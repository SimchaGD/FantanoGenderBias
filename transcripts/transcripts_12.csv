f00yIaXqfOU,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for our weekly track round a big title big title where I list out all these tracks that I heard this past week tracks that I thought were the best tracks the week tracks that I was kind of met indifferent toward and the worst tracks of the week ok we have a lot of songs to get through a lot of tracks to recommend you they are all referenced or listed and linked down there in the description along with our amazon associates link if you want to support this segment click on that link if you live in the US anything you buy on Amazon we get kick back from it does not add to your overall price alright let's get to it with one of the biggest singles of the week and we are going to start off with the songs I was kind of meh meh on these tracks the new Lady Gaga single perfect illusion now I said on Twitter I liked this song and in a lot of ways I do you know that there are some serious pros and there's some serious cons to this song I think it is a loud and a bold and in-your-face comeback single for gaga I think it's relatively catchy I like the kind of epic 80s rock style instrumental that she's got going here the first verse most definitely reminded me of something Springsteen would do and I think she channels that influence really creatively however some of the lyrics are not only redundant but super corny on this record especially toward the end she's singing about this perfect illusion amidst all the confusion and she's just singing this part so hard that I can't help but laugh because she's singing these lyrics as if she stumbled upon some kind of lyrical Epiphany when instead the songs a little under written on the lyrical side but still you know catchy song for Gaga and it may be her next record will kind of have this sort of grungy rock vibe to it that might make things kind of interesting so the tracks okay in fact okay next Jeff Rosenstock with wave goodnight to me Jeff Rosenstock great pop punk songwriter this song however not one of my favorites of his doesn't have some of his most biting lyric although I do think the kind of self deprecating tone of the music video is sort of funny just not as memorable as a lot of his other tracks especially from his last record but still want to give his new record a shot because he is a good artist in my opinion just not one of the better tracks I think he's ever released then we have Sleaford mods with the song TCR another group who I have reviewed very positively although this song to me sort of sounds like they're spinning their wheels in the mud a little bit while the beat might feature some kind of quirky synthesizers that don't usually make their way into a sleeper de mons track to me this track was a little redundant and sort of uneventful for them you know nothing really all that new lyrically up stylistically aesthetically again I'm kind of hoping for a little bit more in terms of excitement and just refreshing ideas from Sleaford mods especially considering they're one of the most unique music duo's out there with their kind of strange fusion of electronic music post-punk and spoken or shouted word moving on from there we have Marissa Nadler with the best you've ever had which is not a bad track it's just okay just want to reference it here because it's sort of like a strip back acoustic cut that's going to be coming out on a fourth coming sort of sister project to her latest record it's just kind of acoustic b-sides from that album or tracks that didn't necessarily make the cut that she didn't end up recording with a full instrumental backing so she's just kind of offering us the acoustic cuts which for your hardcore fan and you love her Spacey or more acoustic material you should most definitely be conscious of so check that track out if you're into that next worm rot Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless grind kind of grind core by the numbers for worm rot but they are still one of the better grind core acts out there right now as far as new acts go this track is loud it's fast it's heavy it's abrasive and I feel like this song it's kind of hard to sell someone on a grind core single in my opinion you know sometimes the power of grind core reveals itself better when you're listening to a track within the context of an entire record of songs that are equally loud equally short equally brutal but still check that out if you're looking for some new grind core again from one of the better and also foreign groups in grindcore today that are making quite a bit of noise also the growlers with all be around production by Julian Casablanca song one on this one I have never heard a more bland song this month than this track this track is just so painfully okay and run-of-the-mill don't really know what else to say about it as is the new American football track give me the gun the band with another track over here is really kind of not really making emo anymore as much as they are just Moody adult contemporary rock I'm really not sure what people are anticipating with this new full-length album there's like nothing exciting about these tracks that they've dropped thus far then I want to reference the new cast McCombs a track opposite house singer songwriter cast McCombs he has a new excuse me album out that I want to check out because the tracks that I've heard so far have been ok I like the very lush instrumental backing on this track it's beautiful I believe this song also features a appearance from angel Olson whose new record is fantastic you should check it out if you haven't already it's a nice easy breezy singer-songwriter track I usually like my singer songwriters to be a bit more bold bit more in-your-face have a bit more eccentricity personality coming through but Cassie he's just kind of you know one of these laid-back chill guys that I really have to be in the mood for but still the songwriting and the instrumental backing on this track seem so detailed and intricate that his new record might actually be worth you know spending some time with for me even though you know previously sometimes I'm sort of indifferent toward his music but this track it's okay I think you guys might dig it a little more than me it's got me kind of curious moving on from there Tim Hecker has a new Adult Swim singles single ambient music kind of another thing that's sort of different and drone sort of another thing that's difficult to sell on a single basis especially with this track being such a monotone drone featuring these heavy layers of strings that seem kind of redundant from beginning to end still I think Tim does pull together a pretty decent vibe and I guess if you were going to tap in the ambient artists on the shoulder to come together with a single it would be him because he does tend to write pretty succinct tracks I just want to make sure if you're one of those P who loved his latest record loved his past couple of Records you don't miss out on this track because you'll most likely dig at least a little bit what he's doing here and finally I want to say röyksopp never ever featuring Suzanne's son for this is just such a painfully generic electro/house track I was doing it's just so by the numbers in every way shape and form but these tracks some of our decent some of our little lackluster they are not the worst tracks of the week okay which we are going to get into now worst tracks of the week okay we have the odd word with faded fat fuckface which is easily one of the most boring songs the outfit has ever released completely sparse and skeletal just uneventful instrumental and it seems like they're kind of toning it down on the vocal front as well just to kind of create this oh wow they're doing a quiet track they've never done that before whether the so innovative there's really nothing interesting going on on this track it's totally boring moving on from there mi a with foreign friends featuring Dex adapts m.i.a drops another boring single I have not liked a single single from this new album of hers so I got to tell you I'm not looking forward to reviewing it we have Zach dealer oka of Rage Against the Machine Fame coming through the new single production by LP and it's totally lackluster zach is trying to do his usual Rage Against the Machine thing which is kind of unfortunate because it's not like there was no versatility to his rapping silent who was singing into his vocal delivery across rages discography but he's still rapping as if the Battle of Los Angeles came out like last year and the production just I don't really think suits him at all it sounds like as if LP had like remixed a battle of Los Angeles b-side or something and now it's just finally being released after all these years just does not feel like a new sound does not feel like a new song does not feel like Zach is trying to reinvent himself as an artist seems like instead he's just resting on his laurels and trying to give fans who are completely uninterested in hearing anything refreshing or different uh you know some warmed up leftovers and that's all moving on from there SIA with the greatest feature in Kendrick Lamar you know in in what age I mean it's it's crazy it's 2016 and Lady Gaga's coming out with tracks that are more raw than SIA SIA unfortunately since her big breakout record a couple years ago it seems content to write the same five songs again and again and again and again and give us the same vocal delivery on every single track and you know this song was so terrible I barely even wanted to stick around for the Kendrick Lamar feature which doesn't even exactly say it which doesn't exactly save the track so yeah it's just kind of a generic pop tune and as sort of again has that foreign rhythmic flavor that every single white people pop tune on the radio right now has to have because people are obsessed with dancehall now for some reason even though they've never heard a dancehall track in their life the only exposure they've ever had to dancehall is Drake's one dance so whatever moving on from there another worst track of the week but when I also want to reference a Green Day's revolution radio which has some of the corniest lyrics I've heard on a Green Day song in a long time but finally the worst track of the week unquestionably worst track of the week is what I understand is the finishing cut from Billy Ray Cyrus's latest album where he is featured with his daughter Miley Cyrus doing a 9 minute ambient vocal drone piece featuring a sound Bowl that apparently Miley had bought him and it is hot garbage you will definitely you know if you didn't know how to tie a noose before this song you will spend the time that you're listening to the song learning had a Taiwan and hopefully um you will be able to finish the track before you actually get a chance to tie that noose on to anything that will be able to carry your weight alright so there you go worst tracks and especially the worst track of the week alright we're going to move into the favorite tracks of the week best tracks of the week over here shout out to Specter black and white wonderful Loki sad heartbreaking ballad that I am looking forward to hearing within the context of her latest full-length record beautiful song drug dealer with easy to forget a kind of quirky DIY recorded throwback rock track that features some guest vocals from Ariel pink really thought that song had a fun personality fun attitude that I thought was really cool I also want a reference DRAM with cash machine DRAM dropping another hit dude had ChaCha dude had broccoli with little yachty and now this cash machine song is a freaking banger the song is amazing I loved the the cash machine samples throughout this track loved his catchy lyrics I loved his singing voice as well he's one of these few rappers out here who can sing and rap and his singing voice and his rapping voice are both fun eccentric creative colorful so yeah definitely dug this cash machine track definitely one of the pop rap singles of the year I think moving on to little yadi with like what's up featuring que supreme and britain big brother chubba some people hate little yadi they think is total garbage but sometimes every once in a while and I understand you know that that latest ap drop not very good little boat is probably gonna be hard for some people to swallow but every once in a while he comes out with one of these bangers that is just just pedal of the floor insanity and this track is no exception I love this track this track is just balls-to-the-wall crazy I love the beat little yachties delivery is just in the red no apologies or anything he's fallen really hard he just goes completely insane but he still kind of has that goofy tone to his voice that makes it songs fun to listen to why is blood with do you need my love which is a very low-key beautiful little ballad I think if you're into people like I want to say Julia halter for example I think you'll like this track quite a bit some of those songstress is that right these very Spacey Airy but very soulful and gorgeous ballads preoccupations formerly the band know they have a new record coming around the corner very soon they have a new song titled memory which is one of the most soulful and interesting tracks they've dropped in a while and it's also 11 minutes long and I like that with this name change they've done a little bit of a sonic evolution and reinvention as well you know even though these guys formerly mostly were the band and that was still very felt on their last record it really seems like they've evolved past that sound with these songs that I've heard so far and they're doing something completely different much darker and much more tortured and I'm looking forward to seeing kind of the full picture that on this new record a beach slang with the song Adam Bomb Beach slang kind of a shoegazing noise rock noise pop outfit I reviewed not too long ago very positively in this song of theirs while it's nothing entirely new sound wise super catchy hook one of the catchiest hooks I've heard in the past couple months Radian which is a group on Thrill Jockey records pretty experimental label they have a new song over here that is kind of like a funky little experimental rock track that sounds like if somebody tried to make some groovy IDM music with live instrumentation and the results aren't bad it's not anything that sounds all that new to me like there's probably other groups and artists who have done the very same thing but these guys they pull together an eerie funky track over here that I think is worth listening to moving on from there couple more we have slaves with take control like in these couple new singles that I've heard from slaves although I'm not expecting too much of the record this new song over here sounds like a fusion of Black Flag and Sex Pistols in the best way possible the chorus is heavy and hard the verses are savage and animalistic and it kind of has just an old-school Punk sound to it but doesn't sound super dated and flat and boring a couple more tide dolla sign with stealing which is a valid that almost made it into the mass section because I am a little torn on it I think the song is catchy but the kind of fusion of auto-tune vocals and acoustic guitar not acoustic guitar but kind of these really pronounced you know jutting guitar chords that are super flavorful and soulful not sure if I like it all that much but I think the tune at the core of the track is cool and it's fun even though some of the lyrics are redundant but again ty dolla sign I like his voice I think he's a good singer which is why I just wonder why he slathered his vocals and so many effects on this track you know really could have done without it because there were some good more stripped-back guitar-based cuts on his last record would love to hear more of that from him in the future but less dolled up I guess and finally Dan Deacon with change your life you can do it one of the best singles I've heard from Dan deacon in a long time fun electronic music track it's like a hipster rave you actually want to be at and it sort of lacks this compositional pretentiousness and just overwrought NISS that has turned me off - some of it is so much of his recent material because he's got to do these grand compositions got to be super minimalistic it's got to be super duper layered instead just write these you know super straightforward catchy songs that actually snap and pop reminds me of the stuff he was coming out around the time of spider-man of the Rings which is my favorite moment in the in the Dan Deacon discography so it seems like he's going back toward writing those more direct fast catchy fun songs a little bit on this cut which was also kind of true of his last record even though wasn't amazing from beginning to end so I guess maybe we're sort of seeing him trend in that direction a little bit more and I thin and that's it guys you know those are all the songs that I wanted to reference to you guys it's a lot of songs but you know they're all worth checking out as far as the favorite tracks the met tracks you know check them out as well if you are into the genres of the artists just wanted to kind of reference them because a lot of people then ask me what I think about these tracks and the worst tracks as usual if you're morbidly curious go for it I'll say and that's it guys the favorite tracks best tracks worst tracks many tracks of the week again hit up that Amazon Associates link down there in the description if

DY_SrcWzRak,duh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Isaiah Rashad record the sons tirade Isaiah Rashad is a Top Dawg entertainment signee and a rapper who I understand hails from Tennessee it was not too long ago that he dropped his somewhat hyped Sylwia demo which I was kind of indifferent toward thought some of his deliveries and some of the instrumentals on this thing were way too smooth a little too middle-of-the-road however there was potential on this thing potential for Isaiah to come into his own gain his own personality get some fire into his songs get some passion into his songs maybe attack some loftier topics I don't know what I do know is that I was looking forward to his latest project over here given that I had enjoyed songs such as free lunch and yeah now that the album is out I want to review it but I'm not reviewing it by myself I'm going to be talking about this record with the one the only mr. Luke James not the singer a fellow YouTube music reviewer who puts out great reviews every week and we are just going to be shooting the over this record so enjoy the conversation that we have again appreciate you watching at ran position hey everyone now we are here through the magic of the internet talking about this new Isaiah Rashad album with of course the one the only Luke James not the singer of course not the singer and you can check out his youtube channel it's linked down there in the description he has lots of reviews that he drops every month as well and we're just gonna be shooting the on this nua Isaiah Rashad record let me know in general what you thought of the album because if I am correct you liked Sylwia demo right yeah I kinda have to start off by saying that still be a demo is one of my favorite projects to come out with in the past five years it just really resonated with me I thought he had a lot of great content he was mixing some rapping with the singing his lyricism I think was better on that one than it was this project and other than Kendricks work on TDE that was always the other album that I really enjoyed from them I just always had Isaiah as my second favorite TDE members so I was excited to hear this album I was waiting about two and a half years but then I started to lose a little bit of excitement because of these tracks he was dropping over the past year so not that they were trash tracks they were just kind of good they're very smooth lots of bass but there wasn't anything to them that blew me away and had me going Oh goddamn Isaiah is back this album is gonna be the I didn't get anything like that from these tracks he was dropping leading up to this project so when I finally got this one I saw it with 17 tracks long and I'm thinking oh god please tell me it's not gonna be 17 tracks of all this smooth mellow because with me I do like those vibes and he even says on this project he makes music for the Vipers so you know that's what yes is that on a rope and rose gold I think yeah and and I get it I understand why people like this one if you just wanted some mellow stuff like this but it was almost too mellow for me I found it very flat I found the songwriting it wasn't very focused because he does bring a little bit of content obviously he's battled substance abuse issues within the past couple years he had another child and he kind of scrapes the surface on these topics but after such a long hiatus I was hoping he would go much deeper and really go into detail about some of these things because that's what he did on Sylvia demo and he was also rapping better on that project like I said this one he's mumbling and croaking through some of these songs to the point that it was just ridiculous to me like that song a lot the Mike will made it one is kind of banger and then he's just going yeah that's kind of like a super hedonistic track I I feel like he just kind of wanted to make this like a really druggie dark banger I believe not too long before that cut he actually makes reference to like listening to a lot of little yachty yeah yeah he does and sorry go ahead can tell that he's sort of going for that vibe on some of the tracks yeah he said that in an interview actually that he's been listening to some little yadi and I read that I was like oh my god last thing I want to hear is that one of my favorite artists is listening and taking notes from lil yachty but you know I understand he said he kind of wanted to bridge the gap and sort of do this newer sound that artists are doing because that's what a lot of the kids like these days those damn kids Anthony but this this project for me it was so disappointing I don't think it's an awful project by any means but this was not what I wanted from Isaiah Rashad and it just felt very dull and unfocused especially that second half man the second half of the album is just damn near unbearable to me there is maybe one or two songs on it I enjoyed but what were your initial thoughts my initial thoughts things I agree and I disagree with in terms of what you just said for one I mean I do think the project is overly long as seventeen tracks you know Sylvia demo had its moments I thought I had potential you know but but not so much that I thought Isaiah Rashad was the kind of artist who could carry and album for seventeen tracks and and that certainly seems to be the case and in the second half it's sort of ironic I mean he does really fall apart at that point on the record but simultaneously you could tell this is also a point on the album where he tried to change it up and do something different on a lot you do have that kind of dark spacey hedonistic banger where he's rapping a lot about drugs and sex and so on and so forth you know then you have a a which is kind of like that R&B inspired track where I think he's rapping about just like drinking and driving and you know that track is sort of really in your face and really energetic don't matter stood out to me as well and Brenda was easily one of the sleepiest and most low-key cuts on the entire project and by George just seemed to me to have like no focus whatsoever and just like totally totally boring finish to the project and then find a topic was one of two moments on the project where it felt like he was trying to be self-aware by critiquing and kind of strong Manning his critics that a few points on the record saying like oh whoa once you find a topic man why don't you rap about a thing you know just like focus on the thing but when you have a project that is so unfocused as this one is to the point where it becomes really a drag to listen to toward the end I mean it's a legitimate criticism you know it's like people aren't telling you this because you know people are making this criticism up you know I mean this is this is kind of a specific criticism you know and I get that maybe it's something that he wasn't ready to deal with because I think TDE fans are a very specific breed of rap fan you know I think that's the kind of thing they expect and they want from their rap songs so for Isaiah Rashad to sign to that label and sort of be injected directly into the the bloodstream of that fan base and they're like you know where your topics man just like you know can't you be like Kendrick and do a concept or something you know I understand that he might not want to give in to that pressure you might want to make fun of it a little bit but as you were saying you know some of these personal issues that he's gone through over the past couple years they only show up here and there and like really faint references and bars and he doesn't really go into it in any significant way now beyond the second half where I agree it falls apart the first half I'm really enamored with I mean I really like free lunch I really like for the squaw you know rope is okay what's wrong with Kendrick Lamar I thought was a fantastic track park is one moment where I think even though it doesn't really have a strong hook or anything his delivery is so amped and energetic and captivating b-day I thought was okay slick the Shaka even though that was a low-key cut I thought the vocal melody and the guitars on that track are really beautiful I thought it was a moving love song you know even though he kind of makes fun of the idea of focusing on a topic on a track there are quite a few tracks here where he does try to focus on the topic and I think some of the lyrics on this track are really moving like when he's rapping about how this person you know he's the end of this person's month this person is the start of his day I thought was really nice titty and dala with Jay Rock I thought was pretty good and stuck in the mud I thought it was a pretty cool concept about all these people kind of being stuck in the same rut that he is and I thought scissors performance on that track was pretty as well I think in some respects this is like a more amped and a more height record than Silvia demo you know but as you were saying he does have those moments where he does seem to lose kind of that baseline of coherence that he had throughout the Silvia demo like on that one sort of second half of I think it might be a lot where he's kind of going into this weird interlude where he's just like rapping about xanax and he's just like blue wool and he's just like bumbling and he sounds barely alive and I think the project kind of has this seductive drug enos to it that I think is pretty cool at points that reminds me of records like a live love ASAP for example you know it seems like the whole point of the record a lot of the time is to be as smooth and as intoxicating as possible I think Sylvia demo was certainly smooth but this new one over here feels like you know I've literally like gone into a drug trip or something had at some points and I think that sort of lends it an aesthetic quality that I think is pretty cool vocally and lyrically I mean sometimes he goes into some cool ideas but I still think he kind of suffers from this problem where he sounds just like an amalgamation of his contemporaries you know he's still very much sounds like a blend of Kendrick Lamar and Jay Cole to me in fact this whole project itself especially the first half to me sounded like something that wouldn't come out on TDE but like Jay Cole's record label instead you know if you would told me this is some new rapper on Jay Cole's label I feel like okay makes sense you know sounds like something I would drop on this label you know you know in ways it kind of reminded me of that bass record that we reviewed together not too long ago you know honestly that exact same thing when we were preparing for this review but the reason I like that one a little bit more than this was because that one was half an hour sure only half an hour of smooth vibes this one while I did like the first half better than the second half I did find myself getting kind of sleepy and drowsy by like track seven because I just was waiting for him to do something a little different just to make it interesting and like you said he does mess around a little bit on that second half that by George song I thought was awful a lot I didn't care for that AAA just sounded like some generic South and rapper mixtape type of  and this whole project almost seemed a little bit like it should have came first and Sylvia demo would have been though one like it's just a more focused project to me in my opinion but Tony still be a seemed like a little limited though it seemed like a little one-dimensional in my opinion this one seems more varied but it feels like this is a commercial project that like many commercial projects when it's your debut commercial project you kind of overextend yourself you try to do everything like anything and everything that you record you just throw it onto the record and it doesn't necessarily work as an entire album you know I feel like I understand what you're saying because Sylvia demo scene is more cohesive you know it's so in a way I think it's maturity level makes it seem like that album is the one that should have come out after and this one should be the one this first this to me seems like okay this is my commercial record I'm gonna try to make a little something for everybody you know what I mean I'm gonna drop this crazy track where I'm rapping over these fast speedy break beats that like you know Andre 3000 would normally be on or something like that you know that track I thought was pretty interesting although that is one of a couple moments on here where I find the refrains kind of corny where he's like pimps hoes fingers masturbating at pimps oh yeah a bit off for me too that actually eyebrow-raising moment yeah and that song reminded me of that Joey badass one remember that one where he had the same thing yeah that one off before the mic toward the end of the record there's like also rapping over a fast break beat yeah as for favorite songs on this one though I also really liked Florida squaw I thought that just was very smooth I like the drum work on that it kind of took me back to the nineties a little bit and just the idea it was simple but it was focused enough he's just trying to take care of his family and do the right thing so I did appreciate that one rope that first half kind of reminded me of a song off J ROCs album telegram just the bass line the way words going and then on the second half I noticed they had the same sample from A Tribe Called Quest on lyrics to go so that was a pretty cool moment I appreciated that one and just just the southern nuances throughout I thought were really cool like with silk to shock at how some of the lyrics come from an old soaked Shaka album charge it to the game it has a hook from fiend on there so he took the lyrics from that and then Teddy and dolla obviously 2 Chainz used to be titty boy and he was in the group Playaz Circle with dolla so just I like those little southern nuances he always brought that just like I'm Sylvia demo with Brad Jordan and Kevin Miller those are things that I found interesting because I've always been a fan of the South and hip-hop scene so that added a little bit of an interesting factor for me but I can't help but feel like this album would have been one of my favorite albums of the year if it were like twelve tracks twelve or thirteen tracks I think this would have been a really dope project but then like we've discussed already multiple times in this review it just sort of extends itself a bit too long I kind of agree you know you say around track seven you started to get kind of underwhelmed by it I mean for me the perfect cutoff would have been like track eleven and then maybe throw find a topic on there as a finisher just to be like aha you know it's like you know I'm referencing the fact that you guys think I can't focus on a topic you know it seemed like it could have been a more interesting self-aware moment but you know maybe not as great as it could have been and I do want to say I did pronounce that that track title wrongly you did pronounce correctly self the Shaka sometimes I mix in my eyes and my else so I apologize for that but uh but yeah you know in that second half I have to fully agree it does really fall apart there and my least favorite tracks really just come one after another on there you know I am really enamored enamored with the first half because to me that kind of feels like Sylvia demo Plus you know a lot of the time sure you know maybe he does kind of lose his composure a little bit because of those druggie passages but I think that's a part of the appeal that's a part of the character of the record that's part of the concept of the album you know for him to be going through these sort of moments where things are really hazy and things are kind of unsure and things are hard to read and harder to find but then once he kind of starts experimenting with all these weird sounds that I don't necessarily think compliment him don't play to his strengths and don't really fit with the vibe in the first half of the record it all kind of goes out the window for me you know you were talking about how you appreciate some of the southern vibes of the record I really appreciate how jazzy the first half of the record is I love just the jazzy flavors of the instrumentals some of those Sylvia demo instrumentals I didn't think we're as dynamic as the instrumentals on this record you know some which I'm just super impressed with I just wish that every song could have you know been as consistently good in the second half as I think the first half is yeah so for you do you think this is a step up or step down from still be in some ways a step up in some ways a step down you know I mean the fact that he overextended himself led to a really inconsistent project but also the moments that are the brightest on this record I think kind of outshine my favorite moments from Sylvia demo you know in that respect I'm kind of torn on the record you know I see him progress I just feel like it going into the future he needs to play to his strengths more and you you know only drop an experiment in there when it really works and it really fits with the tone of the record and you know just cut the fat in general like when something's not working when something's going on too long when you've already made a track about a certain subject twice already on the same record you know consider like making it a little tremor so that the overall statement of your album has a bit more impact and doesn't lose steam as people are going through the 17 tracks and thinking themselves and not every one of these is good mm-hmm yeah that's the thing I felt with this one is there wasn't really much in the way of standout songs that really blew me away like I can listen to a lot of these songs and I think they're good they're smooth there's some nice bass in them but it didn't give me enough moments where I was really taken aback I'm like rewinding did he just say that  oh that flow was crazy or this part in the beat was crazy like it was just very flat and kind of solid but I was hoping to hear more aggressive rapping on some of these songs as well because we remember what he did on tracks like shot you down where he went off Heavenly Father on so via demo is one where he goes really deep like that's probably still my favorite personalized they ever shot a track I just I loved that track and I guess I was just hoping for some more deep moments on this one cuz he was gone for so long so you know some people some people told me oh your expectations were too high just take it for what it is it's just vibes and and I understand that point of view but I think it's fair to have high expectations if you have a favorite artists and you have to wait two two and a half years for their project I don't think there's do you just like you're just like that guy at the start of the record you just like young man with his head lie and now August all have in common I heard you record get dude I heard it yet so yeah you were that you were that guy he was referencing right there at the start of the record man he born in 1991 is weird that basket was so weird like to me that moment seemed like such a straw man like who would say that like wow man it's weird you're you born in 1991 and you're sleeping with girls that were born in 1994 that's crazy like why is this three year difference between two young people crazy I don't understand it seemed that such a strawman moment or something I think what made it so funny to me is just when you think like I'm a bit older too so when I think of someone who was born in 91 that is kind of weird to me like just you can look back and remember what you were doing in 91 and what the scene was like you know just the age difference between whoever was saying that and him maybe that's why I took anyway I mean thinking about it it's not really that big of a I don't know I guess a generational shock since I mean I think in 91 I was like in grade school so I mean I was still a kid technically you know not not too far away from whatever he was doing but I digress generally I liked the project you know and and there were moments that I disliked you know I I'm sort of feeling around the same level of enjoyment as I did for Sylvia demo but for different reasons you know I feel like it's an album that I'm torn a little bit by you know it has its pros it has its cons whereas Sylvia demo just kind of exemplified the same strengths and the same weaknesses from the beginning to the end of the project in my opinion you know this one over here it has its high high highs and it has its serious lows yeah for me still be a demo I just like it so much more it was just more focused and again it was the content I think there were a lot of moments on Sylvia demo with his lyricism where it was really raw and I came out of that project feeling like I really knew who this new artist was at the time and what he was going through and where he was from so you know I guess more content on this would have made a big difference for me but there are still songs on here I really enjoy and that I can vibe with just off the strength of how smooth they are and just kind of relaxed but again 17 tracks of pretty much this whole type of sound I'm just kind of flat yeah but what do you think about the you know what are you feeling like first score on the the record for me man I hate to say it because I wanted to love this one so much but I just didn't I don't think it's trash it is a little bit above average for me so for me this is a 3 out of 5 I'm feeling roughly the same honestly like the like as strung 6 to a light 7 although I thought I thought I was going to end up enjoying it a little more than you because I had heard you were a little disappointed in this record like going into it I was like I'm actually kind of feeling it you know but sort of hearing your thoughts you know that second half it really doesn't come together and I think it affects the the album on a whole in a great way I mean greatly you know only if if if only a good chunk of these tracks are just like bonus material or something I think it could have just made for a more consistent project yeah Brenda was pretty much the only track on the second half just looking at the list very quick that was the one I think I liked the most on that second half just that jazzy production was nice the way that he handled it and flowed I thought that was one of the better tracks but a lot of the songs are forgettable like dressed like rappers I do like how he sort of touches on how little boys are dressing like rappers can that make them a father that was an interesting line so there are bits and pieces of moments where he is saying something but just not enough for me not enough that it's very memorable and a lot of these songs they just don't stick out to me that has been our hopefully concise review on this new Isaiah Rashad record thank all you guys for watching I want to again give a thank you and a shout out to my guest in this review mr. Luke James his YouTube channel his link down there in the description you could check out his review content that he's dropping all the time as well thanks for coming on man thanks for having me man cool Anthony Fantana Luke James Isaiah Rashad forever 
XkUtee1lF3I,oh hi everyone slick the knee we're at an AA theater the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new of Montreal record innocence reaches this is the one trillionth record from Atlanta indie veterans of Montreal now in the third act of their career but they seem no less prolific now than they were in the early days although I will say recently the band has hit choppy waters on a couple of occasions most notably on their previous record aureate gloom which was easily one of of Montreal's most inconsistent and confusing albums yet and with this new record over here it sounds like the band has not really worked their way out of the woods yet innocence reaches is yet another unfocused of Montreal album that has no real sense of direction to it which seems to be happening more and more another the band has a sizable and varied discography behind them at the drop of the Hat they could whip out some kind of crazy psychedelic electronic glam pop mishmash but then it could also do some psych rocks and hard rock but with a bit of a bubblegum flavor to it some acoustic jams as well the band could forge ahead and continue trying new things but instead they just seemed content at least on this record to sort of trip back and Lily hop from one sound to the next that they've already toyed with and then just assemble whatever happens into a series of tracks that they called an album the tracklist on this thing is a mix of glam rock some 60s psychedelic rock and pop music as well as the zany electronic pop madness that you may remember from records like hissing fauna and the synthetic cuts on here are more gaudy and obnoxious than ever maybe not so tiring and taxing as they were on false priests easily one of my least favorite of Montreal records but pretty damn close especially as the album seems to kick off with these driving kick drums and these MGMT style synth leads that are just really glossy glistening and the leer sound this track sound like the band is dipping their toes into the world of tumblr politics although the new comes through with a really cool message of unity on the chorus and I guess this is a bit of a disappointment for me because back in the day when of Montreal and MGMT were both at their creative peak so I would say of Montreal was writing electronic pop music that was a cut above what bands like MGMT and bands that were ripping off MGMT we're doing and now it's almost as if they're going back to revisit a sound that they had already bested years ago there's also the very chill and funky it's different for girls which has some pretty thoughtful lyrics about the politics of sex and gender I liked it when it first came out although the more I listen to it the more cringy I find some of the lyrics to be especially those moments where it seems like Kevin Barnes is uselessly white knighting over things like girls not peeing on the toilet seat really then there are other statements on the track that I feel like could have been legitimate but Kevin Barnes kind of couches them in irony like he does on a lot of his lyrics the song is sport in a pastime another one of the more electronic cuts in the track listing here in my opinion has one of the weaker instrumentals has one of the worst vocal melodies on the entire project above above but the song does seem to feature these rattling high hats it's it's like trap music you can't get away from it anywhere even on Montreal record it seems to have at least a smidge of influence the song ambassador bridge is equally drab and lifeless as Kevin Barnes is singing really moaning again and again I don't really get the appeal of these sort of redundant instrumentals and very unenthused vocal performances that Kevin Barnes is delivering on this record and the track doesn't exactly light up when a disco flavored instrumental pops in to separate these very taxing verses out now I will say there are some great highlights on this record though the song gratuitous abysus is a really kind of fun fuzzy hard rock track that sounds like the studio is performing a sold-out show at Candyland and the song my fair lady Kevin Barnes is singing about a self-destructive girl so self-destructive he has to give his love to some other girl sounds like a bit of a dick move but in the lyrics he makes the case for just how toxic this person is that he needs to separate her from his life and on the song death pacts he seems to be describing you to the same person or a very similar person somebody who also has very self-destructive behaviors which Kevin Barnes just really rips into on this project and I found this sort of surprising because a lot of the behaviors here that Kevin is singing about so negatively he has sung about doing or exhibiting himself on his past records although he does have a moment of self-awareness on this track where he says I've just gotten over a lot of these problems myself awful and the track casts arpeggiating easily my favorite track in the track listing here I think also one of the best songs of Montreal have written and recorded this decade to me this track Kevin Barnes makes the case for glam in 2016 awesomely refined instrumental on this track and I would say exciting ascending instrumentation on the chorus amazing chord progression and when Kevin Barnes sings that chaos arpeggiating it's just like this great emotional release the song is not only incredibly beautiful but very cathartic as well the dramatic drum fills the buzzing wall of instrumentation it's a beautiful moment on the record while this album does have a lot of sort of unpredictable twists and turns it's unpredictable and exactly the way that works against it more than for it it's just Kevin Barnes and company just really refusing to settle on anything and because nothing is really committed to there are a lot of tracks on this record that just sounds super lackluster fans who are well aware of their pre hissing fauna and pre satanic panic in the attic output will certainly find a few bones thrown to them on here sound really great but again a majority of this record and kind of drab uninteresting electronic acts with flat vocal performances or cuts that are super obnoxious and taxing and sort of glitchy and gaudy I don't really know what else to say you know there are plenty of tracks on here that I like there are plenty of tracks in here that I don't I'm just kind of split between all of them and the album as a whole I just generally feel indifferent toward it I'm feeling a strong four to l85 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this record thanks for watching Ferg 
iAfxeKWphdg,ah under the subpoena here the Internet's most negative music nerd I don't like the way you to review dead album of goods so blue and it's time for a review of the new angel Olsen record my woman singer-songwriter angel Olsen is young up-and-comer who stole my heart a little bit back in 2012 with some of the more fiery passionate songs from that album she had dropped that year not a perfect record but I will cut all of my limbs off if the song waiting is not one of the better tunes of the decade angel was coming through on this track and on others with a strong voice some sharp lyrics which had me excited to hear whatever music she was going to be dropping in the future which was not too far down the road right around the corner she got signed to the jag Jaguar label which I only thought would help her but then when she finally came out with burn your fire for no witness it wasn't really the the aha moment I was hoping for it was an angel coming into her own based off of the sounds that she had given us thus far instead this album was weighted down in a series of loafie distorted kind of garage rock tracks that sounded like something some no-name band trying to sound like the next-best coaster Vivien girls would record then she matched these tracks with these long arduous sparse acoustic cuts that were just navel-gazing didn't really have a strong sense of direction and did not justify their six five or sometimes even four minute lengths angels still showed potential on this record even though it wasn't as raw or as riveting or as funky as what was on her debut and I was just kind of hoping to hear some of those sounds return on this latest album here and that they do but in a whole new way to me this album was kind of like listening to angel Olson again for the first time but at a totally different angle but I think the dynamic of this record is similar to her last record you know you have your hard heavy distorted tracks and then you have your soft gentle elongated acoustic cuts the tracks where angel goes electric are a little more ruff a little more in the moment they feel like they have some more nuance in there they're not just kind of that generic lo-fi garage production and her lyrics shine through a little bit more as well I feel like vocally she's a bit more over-the-top and animated especially on the stellar single shut up and kiss me which features these buzzing crunchy guitars this romping drumbeat and vocals that shout and Yelp and Bello angel is absolutely animalistic on this track when she lets loose on this record she lets loose it might sound kind of sour or maybe tone-deaf to some listeners but I actually like the attitude that comes through on her voice I think she swaps pitch for swagger on this album and a lot of spots and it works you know she played it pretty reserved on her last record a lot of the time and I think the results were mild on this new one over here she's just taken some risks lighting some fires the attitude is almost punky at points now angel is also capable of some tender moments as well on this record like what she's reaching into her falsetto against the dreamy beds of synthesizers on the song in turn which kicks the record off a song that is short but I'm pretty enthralled with the lyrics about wanting to be somebody make something of yourself but then getting emotionally crushed in the rat race that we're all running and then there are other tracks in the first half here that I think are also emotional riots the song never be mine which features all these dramatically strummed acoustic guitars the instrumental sounds like something out of the 60s or 70s but it isn't trying so hard to force nostalgia down your throat it has an old soul but feels distinctly young and in the lyrics here and with her vocals as well even if you weren't paying attention to the lyrics the agony that agony coming through in her voice she's just very sorrowful about the fact that this person who she has in mind is just never going to be hers the song give it up has some pretty interesting opening guitar chords it sound like something that could have been on a Nirvana record but ultimately angel comes to a different musical conclusion a few bars later which is good because in in 2016 we do not need another Nirvana ripoff instead the warm base on this track and the confident and raw guitars on here that are very string and trebly remind me of artists like The Velvet Underground and and there's kind of that 60 sheen on it that you would get on a Nancy Sinatra record also you know definitely a modern garage rock vibe again and there's something about the vocal harmonies on this cut that kind of remind me of like 90s era no doubt the song not going to kill you has this kind of crazy built-up instrumental jam at some points like the momentum of this track is so intense that it reminds me of like some psychedelic Jefferson Airplane type but then this intensity is broken off all of a sudden with these more Spacey instrumental passages with dramatic drum fills and Angel Olsen just beckoning out loudly into the space the instrumental has now created now this point you're going to be facing down the kind of funny sequencing of the album because all of the raw aggressive in-your-face tracks with a lot of attitude ER in the first half and then all of the slower more acoustic and ballad type songs are in the second half here we see Angel embracing her funkier side her more tender side and it's not necessarily a bad point on the album doesn't necessarily suck the momentum out of the record because she offers a bit of musical diversity across these tracks - I like the very slow and seductive heart-shaped face with its lazy elongated vocals it does drag on a little bit but I like that the performance feels really live and in the moment depending on my mood when I'm listening to the record I can really get lost in the performance the song sister is longer but somehow easier to swallow songwriting wise it sounds like it could have been a crossover hit dropped by some up-and-coming country starlet in the 60s at least at the start of the song because as angel progresses in the track she ramps up the emotional turmoil and the song kind of gains a personality of its own and the song continues to evolve as it progresses on I love the angelic vocal harmonies toward the back end of the track and the beautiful pianos as well for seven minutes angel and her band just consistently without new musical ideas to keep the song interesting however we do have the song those were the days which has kind of a whisper quiet vocal delivery and a very breezy demeanor I don't really care for and the closing track on here Pop's has these basic piano chords that are played in this pitifully sad demeanor the song doesn't feel like a tune as much as it does an emotional exorcism if angel hasn't wowed you by this point on the record this song I don't think is going to sway you I think whether or not you enjoy is going to be heavily dependent on your preferences for the nine tracks prior I do prefer though the song women that comes right before a lot more emotional and compositional peaks and valleys throughout that song in my opinion all in all not a bad record at all I think it's one of the better singer-songwriter records of the year actually it is the solid album that I have wanted angel Olson to drop all along back when I first heard her music several years ago and now it's it's finally here so no reason to complain all you can do at this point is listen because it's catchy it's fun it's emotional it's passionate and it's it's probably worth crying to at some point yeah I'm going to leave it at that I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this thing trigger trigger transition have you given this record oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this record ii don't know why you would it's good angel olson my woman forever 
f8oMW4yqh_o,ah hi everyone bird said any shadow here how do I do it the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Travis Scott record birds in the trap sing McKnight coming through with his highly anticipated and mercilessly pushed back sophomore commercial album Travis Scott following up his 2015 commercial breakout hit record rodeo an album which featured wavy intoxicating bangers such as I no way that doe and 3500 a record that I wasn't anticipating loving as much as I did especially considering that Travis's previous projects owl Pharoah and days before rodeo I felt were really horrendous the project sounded unfinished mastered badly or experimental but not interesting rodeo though in comparison seemed so much more well groomed focused put together the hooks on this thing snapped and in general Travis Scott was borrowing heavily from this new Atlanta sound artists like future as well as young thug and etc etc etc but taking the sound and refining into an album format with very glitzy glamorous instrumentals meanwhile across a lot of these tracks telling a personal story of his come up in hip hop music for once it felt like there was more to Travis Scott than the usually mediocre lines and rapping that he would deliver and his influences that he would so obviously wear on his sleeve so now it's a year after rodeo pretty much we have birds and all I can say is what happened because this new album is several things one it's not as good as rodeo it doesn't even artistically progress past rodeo and I would say occasionally this album progresses back to Travis's less developed projects like owl Pharoah most notably on the intro track and the track after that where it seems like Travis is just bunching different instrumentals and song ideas together to create one song that isn't even really a effective as a song because these different chunks don't really complement each other they barely transition into one another well well well but anyway the the introduction to this record it has this kind of ethereal pretty glistening instrumental it's nowhere near as epic and ambitious as what I remember rodeo kicking off with and we have Travis on this track singing about going out and having a badass time obviously Katy Perry doing a little ghost writing here and the lyrics deeper into the track don't really get much different rapping about a new stand we press the issue not only that but this verse happens against a rhythm that doesn't sound too unlike something that would have popped up on Rodeo and that's the thing throughout this record I'm picking up a lot of instrumental deja vu but a lot of the time bird seems to take a somewhat darker and murkier tone but it's not the better for it because the more stripped-back approach only leads to the tracks on this thing feeling more underwhelming the most interesting moment on this introductory track is the andre 3000 verse which is pretty fantastic I also love the glitchy vocal edits that occur throughout his bars too and once the song way back pops in it's like we're hearing an extension of the same underwhelming song we had these forgettable refrains about a chain on his neck sleeping with the tech pills on his desk and then all of a sudden were treated to these harmonious vocals it's kind of a pretty passage he's singing about the television and not believing what you're seeing or the media or something and then further into the track more lyrics they don't have anything to do with the lyrics that came before these lyrics although I think the outro on this track was very layered and pretty and interesting with its synth leads and it's guitar soloing also got to give a shout-out to the corny reference to Michael Phelps on this track too but I digress these tracks so far they're OK you know the album is not terrible I'm just a little disappointed at this point that Travis didn't kick things off as big and as catchy and as distinct as he did with his previous project I mean goddamn these two songs don't even begin to go toe to toe with this side so in my mind I'm kind of rationalizing what's going on and thinking you know maybe he's just doing a more subtle thing maybe he's making a quieter record maybe making a somewhat darker record and I have to be open to that sure but as soon as I made my mind up on this the quality of the songwriting just takes an absolute nosedive on the song coordinate which has absolutely the worst hook on the record worst hook on the record and if it's not the worst what's good about it is that the part where Travis is sounding completely lifeless on the mic rapping about his skinny jeans oh it must be the part when he goes that part was lit fam this song is so boring it should be a sin and immediately after this we have an appearance from the crowned king of passing off lazy songwriting as deep and artsy mr. Kid Cudi on the track through the late night of course Cudi brings his ridiculous vocalizations from burn burn burn burn moaning his way through all these lines about partying into the a.m. the hook senselessly incorporates this French formality for please si vous play and it doesn't even make sense within the context of the hook where it's used it's just like thrown in there because it rhymes with the words that were said before I mean the song has to get the award for laziest incorporation of a French phrase into a rap song and then once Travis appears on the track he doesn't improve it he actually makes it worse in a way for one he has a bad habit of letting his guests go first and ruin the track before he even touches it and then once he starts rapping on this cut he drops this beautiful couplet of lines where he's sprinkle a little season on a salad and talking about stroking his cactus your cactus are you sure you don't want to compare your cactus to anything else other than a fucking cactus and also doesn't the chord progression on this track sound all like anted oh the torture on this record continues with the song Bebe's in the trap featuring NAV who is NAV I guess he's an up-and-coming Toronto rapper with a horrible baby voice that sounds incredibly generic his lyrics are even more uninteresting the dude couldn't even flow for eight bars without stealing Drake's flow from the song Madonna off of his if you're reading this too late mixtape the song is kind of on some weekend shit where some girls are being lured to a drug-fueled condo party and yet it's another song where it feels like it takes forever first actually here Travis say or do anything and when he does finally appear we get all these sporadic words that it's just like word salad he's not doing or saying anything this verse is absolutely boring I mean I get that he's maybe trying to give this sense that hey things were so crazy last night that I don't really have any complete thoughts or memories about anything that happened but it's just such a lazy way of going about creating that sensation also the lines about trying to text his accountant from the mountains and uh-oh they change like a mood ring really great simile there I mean I know the lyrics on Rodeo weren't gold or anything but how are the lyrics on birds just so much worse after an interlude which only works as a breather from all the terrible songs that preceded it we don't really get much relief the song sweet sweet is yet another track with no hook in sight no hook at all it's just some boring refrain that nobody's ever going to remember in a couple years over a looped instrumental that sounds exactly the same as it did on the verse since the start of the album I would say that the song outside is birds first offering of a well-groomed song with an intro a verse a chorus and a feature that actually comes toward the end it's 21 savage he's not exactly the most riveting rapper in the world in my opinion but I guess the kind of eerie low-key beat on this thing suits him Travis's verses aren't bad to listen to you know he has kind of that warbly auto-tune vocal with a little bit of reverb on it and the song goosebumps right after seems to meet that same average bar of songwriting as well we have an intro we have a decent verse we have a chorus we have a song topic here kendrick lamar's the feature comes toward the end although I do think his vocals sound a little phone-in especially with how muddy they are and I'm not really sure if the track called for all of these zany vocal antics that he usually brings to the table though I guess I appreciate that he did kind of focus on to the topic of the track about you know just love kind of having a desire for someone when they're away and it's almost like Travis wanted to follow this love song up with another one but terrible this time with the song take Travis's attempt essentially at a slow R&B jam and his vocals of course which are auto-tune he's trying to sing his way through the bulk of the track sound god-awful they lack any kind of sensuality or sexual appeal are really heartfelt emotion that I think one would need for a song in this style and then in my opinion we have what I think is the best track in the track listing here and that's pick up the phone with young thug and quavo this track has been released for months now and actually even made it on to young thug's latest project as a bonus track I think the instrumental on this thing is really fun I love the watery steel drum esque synthesizers and Cuevas appearances great young thug's appearance is great and I like the songs focus on just wanting to get with the scroll wanting to get that call from her get her to pick up that phone when you call her but again this song has been out a while now and I don't really see it uplifting the track listing in any kind of way because it's not anything new and speaking of not anything new we have the song wonderful featuring The Weeknd on this thing as well this track was obviously a rodeo leftover and it wasn't good back in December when it was released and it's not good now and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if a bulk of what is on birds are just rodeo leftovers and b-sides especially since tonally and instrumentally it seems like a lot of these tracks were created in the same headspace but even though these tracks share a lot of similarities to the tracks off of rodeo again they're not up to snuff not only do the features not add to this record in the way that they did on rodeo but when Travis tries to tell a personal story which he does very rarely on this record such as on the song lose it just kind of comes off as very vague and nondescript when he's really trying to go into this idea of being paranoid because he's so successful now and he has more to lose to boil it down Birds is a less interesting a less everything version of the album travis dropped three sixty-five days ago and it's so inferior it actually calls for a retitle I think I would rather call this record birds in the bed sleep goodnight because this thing is Sonic ambien and I'm not even going to get on Travis's mediocre attempt hopping on the dance hall bandwagon with the song guidance that would make this video five minutes longer and I've already talked your ears off at this point so again what happened how did we get here how did we come to such a lackluster record with no strong singles no significant experiments or progressions past his last effort how did Travis lose his Drive and his ability to put together a solidly built song within the span of a year um maybe he's grown complacent I'm just not really sure I'm feeling a strong two to a light three on this thing Treach Fortran and those are my thoughts on this new Travis Scott record sorry if they're rubbing you the wrong way or you disagree that's completely fine this is my opinion at the end of the day that being said what did you think of this record did you love hated why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Travis Scott birds in the trap forever 
F-YpP8QJfH4,hey everyone Antoine Antoine here the Internet's busiest the music Amero the ha ha and it's time for our great album segment where I go over some of my favorite releases from this past month recommend em to you down there in the description box of course are some reviews of the album's I'm about to tell you guys about and some links where you can listen to music from these albums let's go first off on a shout out New York band show me the body these guys had one of the most electrifying debuts this year it took me a while to get to it but I finally did and it's this really cool blend of punk and hip-hop and funk and sludge metal it's a very invigorating and animalistic record the band already has such a unique sound very early in their career and I'm looking forward to hearing them just go further off the rails with another album and continue to blend together this mix of ideas that I don't usually hear bands put together at least not since the rap rock or rap metal era which every day because I lived through it I'm trying to forget also want to give a shout out to no name on the mixtape telephone this is one of the smoothest prettiest most easygoing most personally touching mixtapes of 2016 it's not one of these tapes that's gonna hit you over the head that's gonna grab your attention and just shake it violently it's for the patient listener no names lyrics I think are very moving very earnest and she talks on a couple topics that I haven't heard other rappers or singers touch on in quite the way that she has here so very intriguing project very pretty project hopefully she can take her talents and build them up into something a little more high production on her next effort next I want to shout out the new o'seas record a weird exits these guys are a noise psych garage rock outfit and this record in my opinion though they have been at this for years is one of my favorites in their discography one of the best things they've put out in a while some great production on this thing very vivid instrumentation and tract kind of rides this linear psychedelic noisy jam that the band just does not let up on some very quirky instrumental performances and vocals on this thing too because the OCS are a little tongue-in-cheek there is an element of playfulness to their music and man the vivid sounds the intense walls of fuzzy guitars and and driving drums and some freaky keyboards or a warm warm bass what's not to like about this LP also want to give a shout out to New York rapper kah who has come through with honor killed the samurai now Kyle we got to give him some credit because the New York Post tried to lambast him recently talking about how there's this you know New York Fire Department head honchos also this really bad rapper says naughty words and is dividing the nation when it just couldn't really be further from the truth so you know kudos to for putting up with that hopefully he just kind of works through all that drama but certainly his music is certainly up to par still while this does sound a lot like everything he's done up until this point there is an element of conceptual 'ti to this project over here with a lot of the instrumental sounding like they are sampling what sounds like chunks of a karate film soundtrack and there are also some vocals snippets that play throughout almost every song here that kind of compares the tragedy of the samurai to the tragedy of the stories that Chi is rapping about usually a series of cautionary tales about violence and and drugs and gangs and just urban life this thing is very quiet it's very subtle it's very chilling basically hip hop's answer to the noir film in my opinion next something that is a very light-hearted and fluffy and fun the new Carly Rae Jepsen EP if you enjoyed some of the 80s pop bliss of her last album emotion no reason you won't enjoy this new EP over here just as good just in my opinion with some fewer weak links and it's kind of sweeter straighter to the point with just about 28 minutes and like eight tracks or so so it's a good collection of cuts really catchy really fun all you need to do is just take a deep breath and say I'm not too good for pop music and you'll probably love the hell out of this thing finishing off we have Frank Ocean with blonde a record that was highly anticipated this year an album that I was kind of worried about listening to because I didn't mono like hate it I like channel orange and I saw so much potential on that record and I wanted Frank to come through with an even better project because on that record while there were good moments there he still sounded very young and amateurish and inexperienced here he's much more mature I think he's really come into his own he's experimenting so much more instrumentally lyrically songwriting wise sonically the you know there's not really an element of this album that didn't please in my opinion or at least intrigued to a degree this record was very personal very emotional very moving heartbreaking at points found a lot of the lyrics to be worth reading into as well really liked this thing and I'm glad some of you guys were there to enjoy it as well along with me and yeah I think that's it guys those are the album's I want to recommend to you again reviews for these projects are all down there in the description box

get turned on to some good music ok I hope you're having a good one you know eating your fruits and veggies staying hydrated make sure you subscribe and tell your mom to subscribe to you know maybe she wants to be hip to all this new music you know what I'm saying god damn forever 
bwHEVxtIAzk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly best and worst tracks of the week segment where I round up all the tracks I heard from this past week tell you what I thought of them were they the best where then were they kind of men or were they the the worst tracks I heard this week before we get into the worst tracks of the week let's get into the songs that I was just kind of indifferent toward we have the new radio department single Swedish Guns easily one of the most underwhelming singles I've heard from these guys and this is a pretty easygoing band they're not exactly a hard and heavy band usually they have this really sweet catchy blissful jangle pop sound to their songs but they really kind of trashed it for this new track over here in favor of something that just doesn't really sound anything like the distinct style the band is crafted up until this point it's a little punch here and it seems like they're going for something that's a bit more upbeat a little more rhythmic but the end result I think is just kind of generic we have a new track from mono Eli's or Ellie's heartbeat I'm just not feeling this track at all I'm feeling more like me know instead of mono just another kind of generic piece of post-rock unfortunately we have Bone Iver with 33 God a lot of people have been hyping this track up because they want to hear that new boney vert record saying that the songs so far have been amazing unfortunately I'm pretty indifferent toward this new one seems a little more epic and ambitious than a lot of the stuff from his previous record although I find the lyrics super obnoxious on this track here some of them could come in 50 yeah just not just not feeling that and also this to me just kind of feels like I don't know like a watered down Peter Gabriel song like everything I'm hearing from this boney vert record so far just seems like just pulling so hard from Peter Giffen from Peter Gabriel's discography excuse me yeah just just a unashamedly so I would say and it's almost like he's kind of like distracting from it with the obnoxious lyrics and the totally ridiculous song titles moving on from there we have the new placebo song with Jesus's son placebo lives up to the name of the band on this track and really does nothing for me unfortunately and those are the tracks I was just feeling mad but here the worst tracks of the week unquestionably unquestionably okay and remember all these tracks are linked in referenced down there in the description box as well as our amazon associates link of course if you want to support this segment you can hit that link if you live in the u.s. anything you buy on amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price used to buy some stuff you were going to buy anyway cool cool all right worst tracks of the week listed in order of from least worst to worst we have DJ premier with timmy turner the premix of the new designer track sounds awful not only our designers vocals just mix terribly to the point where they almost hurt the ears but DJ premiers scratching and DJ cuts on this thing just feel so out of place and the alterations he makes to the instrumental itself sound terrible easily one of the worst remixes I've ever heard not that I think DJ premier is a not talented you know he's put out together plenty of great beats and remixes over the years it just kind of seems like sticking a square peg into a round hole on this one they just don't really complement each other I think moving on from their health with the song crusher this is a new Adult Swim single and you would think it would be interesting given the mix of sounds and influences going into this thing it's kind of like droney and ambient but it's also super oppressive and distorted and noisy and there's some trap flavored percussion in there too and obviously some of the noise rock elements that health always carries in their music pop up as well again a really interesting mix of influences and sounds and yet it just falls so miserably flat and feels terribly uneventful like nothing's going on at all of interest moving on from there we have mi a with free done featuring Zayn of all people and m.i.a unfortunately drops another drab boring uninteresting single I mean this girl used to drop some of the most revolutionary crazy off-the-wall uh political but also party animal type music to ever be recorded and now her new music is just so underwhelming like oh it's so drab again I use the word drab I keep saying it because it's really what it is you know there's just nothing of interest going on it just so flat it's so dynamic list it's so lifeless but moving on from there to something that has a lot more life though it's not necessarily the better for it it's the new sleigh bell single it's just us now which easily has the worst transition from a verse to a chorus I've heard this decade this decade I would not be surprised if this had the worst transition from a verse to a chorus for the next several years as well and just kind of held that title for the 2010s it's like the song almost kind of has a breakdown like a like an old horrible lemon of a car and then just kind of kicks up and all of a sudden you're kind of like 30 seconds into the future for whatever reason and the chorus is going it kind of miserably sputters its way through this horrible structure the band is pulled together for this track and the the music video is oh so edgy can't help but cringe a little at it to be honest so yeah not liking that track at all and of course it comes with sleigh bells usual a horrible sound of overly distorted guitars shouty yell P awful lead vocals terrible mixing just everything sounds so sunburned and brittle and awful so you know at least they're consistent I guess and finally the worst song of the week worst song of the week Black Eyed Peas with where's the love now you may know if you are a Black Eyed Peas fan or at least you know a hip-hop fan from the 90s and the early 2000s that they have already released the song what are you talking about Anthony that's a great black-eyed pea song that's that's a real good song Black Eyed Peas they used to be good back in the day well they have re-released this track re-recorded this track with a bunch of other artists singers rappers celebs and the end result is 100% throw-up cringe I want to die especially toward the end of the track where dj khaled has a feature and he's like dude I want us to love each other where's the don't want us to love and you know it's it's dj khaled 'he's a usual unmedicated paranoia getting to him again and talking about they wanting this and they not wanting that and they attacking him and they being focused on everything that they him and we are doing he really needs to get it checked out because it's getting you know kind of kind of worrisome you know I worry about the guy he's thinking that there are these people around every corner that don't want him to be healthy you don't want him to be successful so on and so forth it's it's kind of sad um and honestly you know some of the rap verses in this thing like ASAP Rocky's rap verse since things trash um you know in the reasoning is I don't vote oh it's it's so terrible and Jaden Smith standing right next to him looking so Moody he looks so Moody and yet it's it's actually a pretty depressing and I don't know brain destroying rendition of what was once a pretty great track from the Black Eyed Peas you know if all you know these guys are they're terrible party songs from the mid and late 2000s I encourage you like check out their early stuff because they have some great music in their back catalogue alright so now that we're out of that depressing worst tracks of the week segment let's move into what I feel were the best tracks this week we have a producer by the name of crap face collaborating with elevation on this track called swim meet comes off an EP I believe and this track is kind of like one of those quirky fun PC music style bubblegum bass cuts but this song has a really cool sample worked in from Rihanna's work that's actually super catchy and works against a nutty nutty fun and melodic beat that you guys definitely got to hear this was a great track definitely a highlight for me this week moving on from there Sam foe with blood on me a soul singer and songwriter who you may remember from subtracts big breakout debut record he had kind of a rough start in my opinion going solo but it sounds like he's really kind of coming into his own and delivering a solidly built and catchy and Booth and catchy and passionate song on this new cut over here I've always known he was a very good singer since I've you know had been hearing them on those subtract tracks but then I was like oh well you know he's not really writing all that well when I was listening to his initial solo stuff now it seems like he's really kind of building that material up with some good writing some good production and some passionate vocals as well so I'm interested to hear what he's going to do in the future you know with a new album or something like that moving on from there ty dolla sign with three ways featuring Travis Scott ty dolla sign his campaign project is on the way this track was super catchy not going to go too deep into it because I'm going to review the album very soon but I highly recommend this as I have almost every track he released from this project so far pretty hype for it also don't want to get too deeply into but want to turn you guys on to the new al se track atmosphere black metal over here that's super melodic super quality that has a new album on the way from that project to that I'm also going to be reviewing I want to reference banks with Gemini feed banks a singer who previously I found kind of underwhelming was kind of indifferent toward her last record but this new song over here is easily one of her catchiest and most upbeat and vibrant tracks that I think she's ever released really got stuck in my head on the first listen so I'm looking forward to maybe her putting out a new full-length record that has a little bit more oomph to it because this track is certainly the better for it so yeah you know the track from an artist who I wasn't anticipating you know would come through the single that I was like wow you know that kind of stopped me in my tracks right there moving on from there a couple more we have Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds with Jesus alone a soul-crushing ly dark ballad from Nick Cave over here and a new album on the way to just around the corner so I'm actually really excited or the tone of this new record given just how dismal and and again like soul-crushing this song is there were lots of very Spacey and soft songs from the caves last record but I feel like that ominous looming darkness that I usually enjoy in his music just wasn't there seems to his returned it seems to have returned on this new cut over here so I'm pretty psyched about that everything everything has a new track out the British art pop outfit called I believe it now and it's usually one of their most blissful cuts yet not one of their most experimental but still has a solid chorus to it and some beautiful vocal harmonies I have to reference also gold links new track featuring bad bad not good and Kate Renata on production this track was a given to be good just on production alone but gold link even though I thought his last record was unbearable his vocals are actually pretty great on this cut can't really you know fault the kid on this one you know he's coming into his own a little bit he sounds less goofy then the vocals are more listenable and again the production does connect a lot of the dots but still you know he was ruining the beats on his last record even though some of them were good this time not so much the case it's kind of a passionate passionately sung hip hop infused pop track you know there's a lot of different influences going on in his music and it seems like he's finding a way where those sounds are coming together in a harmonious way as opposed to clashing with one another violently and the end result being nearly unlistenable in my opinion and finally I got a reference the new suicide boys track with Denzel curry titled Ultima suicide suicide boys I just quickly reviewed their recent EP not too long ago remarked on the fact they sounded really dark really southern definitely a bone thugs or a three 6 mafia vibe it was kinda mean kinda you know like again it kind of dark but it wasn't like taking it so far that I was amazed or impressed you know didn't see much darker than like a bones track or anything like that right so I hear this new track it is in the fucking red it is like the nut seus thing that I think either of these guys have ever posted but I think the suicide boys they would have to really amp up the aggression in the way that they did on his cut if they were going to bring Denzel curry on because Denzel curry his last record was animalistic and it seems like they're really trying to do their best to go over the top make the hardest the grimy is the most blood-soaked track that they've ever recorded now that Denzel curry is kind of coming together with them on this cut and it's nuts man it is like the it is it is bodies on bodies on bodies disgustingly angry and mean this is this is a track I would not want to meet in a dark alleyway by myself that's all I'm saying okay it's it's either gonna kill you it's gonna rob you or something worse something even worse or just do or just do both you know because once once it's

MdGbp6dtNhY,boo hi everyone go to the newsstand over here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Vince staples EP prima donnas a primadonna he's got a big head the big old melon head just like the melon over here Vince staples is a California rapper fresh off of his successful full-length commercial debut record summertime o6 and album that was very well received when it dropped although it did underwhelmed me a little bit while I thought staples brought quite a bit of talent on the mic and legendary producer no IDs fingerprints were all over this thing there was something kind of unsatisfying about all of these kind of short weekly structured tracks all stacked on top of one another none of them really reinforcing each other leaving that strong of an impression and I'm not really noticing a great change of pace or tone on this new EP over here but it doesn't suffer from some of the issues that summertime oh-6 did because it's just an EP it's short it's 7 tracks doesn't overstay its welcome these songs don't really get an opportunity to be buried in the midst of all these other tracks that are equally unimpressive still I will say this EP is a little bit of a mixed bag for one there all of these strange vocal interludes at the very start of the EP at the end of every track where Vince staples is just kind of moaning his way through a bunch of repetitive lyrics sounds a feel I give enough sometimes a feel they given up sometimes the feel I given up sometimes the feel like giving up sometimes I feel like giving up sometimes I feel like giving up and with the songs big time and war ready I don't think the EP starts or ends all that strong mostly because the instrumentals on these tracks don't really hit as hard as I would have liked them to the instrumentals on these tracks just sound really miniscule don't really feature some of the heavy bass and the vibrant sounds that are on the other cuts here though I will say much like on summertime oh 6 Vince does seem to have an ear for very creative and kind of quirky production I like the instrumental on very blissful and guitar-heavy smile there's some crunchy chords on this thing a really wild solo that paints the chorus of course there's booming bass on this thing and some sharp kick drums and staples very staccato flow sounds great over the beat as he tells this story about how he's kind of using Fame to leave behind his old life and turn his back on old friends song loco with kilo Kish is definitely one of the craziest songs in the track listing here lives up to its title and actually features a Kish verse that didn't utter liebe or me though she doesn't exactly a very away from her usual monotone delivery I would just say her vocals work really well into the eerie instrumental Vince staples goes in the opposite direction with a relentless very expressive flow that features some of the raunchiest lyrics on the entire project and the title track with ASAP Rocky is one of the most nightmarish bangers of 2016 Vince staples comes through with this stone cold flow and there are some awesome really chilling male vocal harmonies on the chorus singing is it real is real and the choppy yelling samples in the instrumental are pretty crazy too the song is sparse but it's also kind of loud and also unsettling and it's incredibly dark and I love the way the beat just lights up with this just wailing we're like siren synth when some of ASAP Rocky's vocals pop in but ASAP Rocky starts repeating some refrains the beat seems like it's building up there's a beat change here and we're getting some more momentum to the track and then it just finishes where's the verse was it ASAP Rocky going to do a verse I mean you did this beat change up why don't you do something with it clearly there could have been more to this track than this I mean you literally teased to a second half of the track or some kind of significant change in the track but once that change came it's like hey let's just create this bridge to nowhere maybe you guys don't feel the same way but I can't get away from this feeling that occasionally it's just like Vince staples doesn't want to finish a song the song pimp hand is a nasty track that I think requires a steady head Bob and mean mug to fully enjoy it instrumentally and even flow wise the track reminds me of something that clips would have done back in the day of course with The Neptunes on production but that's really all it is you know it's not like this big concept or anything like that and I've known Vince staples to be able to put together a solid EP before it's just that he's had trouble in my opinion building this up into a solid full-length album that is entertaining and memorable from beginning to end and I think that's only going to come as a result of cutting the fat when you have a weaker track and when you have a golden opportunity like on pre-madonna actually build the track out and have your feature actually do something significant on the song as opposed to just saying a couple refrains and disappearing just crossing my fingers and hoping Vince staples can go the distance a little more in the future but for right now I think the CP is define I think it's a good EP I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this thing Trant and have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this EP alright that's it guys see you next review of forever 
GloclhybVlQ,ah shout out if any out Hanano here a college street I remember what up dude the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new young thug album Jeffery young thug or Jeffrey is a prolific Atlanta rapper songwriter and crooner back with another project it was bound to happen young thug was not going to spend the rest of 2016 silent he's already had a pretty big year with multiple projects under his belt like I'm up and slime season 3 projects that were received well by fans and a lot of major hip-hop critics out there but personally for me by young thug standards these tapes didn't really feel like anything special I really thought thugger was selling himself short on these projects because he has a standout voice but there were so many forgettable choruses and verses on these projects it felt like most of the time he was just kind of going through the motions and not really varying up his flow or his songwriting or even his instrumentals a lot of the time he was just merely putting out the music that fans expected him to put out and at first I didn't really think this new project over here was going to be anything different especially considering this tapes multiple gimmicks which are bound to distract away from the actual content of the music on the front cover here we have Jeffrey featured in his most gender bent outfit yet looking like the female version of Raiden from Mortal Kombat and also uh there are the i grabbing track titles on this thing which i guess were named after people that young thug said on instagram he idolizes among the names in the tracklist harambe the gorilla but also more obvious choices like goo op and RiRi as well as Floyd Mayweather and then Kanye West whose track I read was actually originally named Elton but then pop man which is the ultimate slight in my opinion and totally hilarious that Kanye's track used to be for somebody else you know just like everything else in Kanye's life it was once somebody else's hey put down the keyboard you can stop typing real angry now I have just breaking your balls of course the lyrics on these tracks have about zero to do with the people that they're named after a lot of the time with the exception of tracks like RiRi whose chorus seems to reference her hit song work or the song future swag where young thug tries to do a direct impression of future style and futures music and doesn't do too bad of a job in the process not that futures rapping or singing or whatever you want to call it I was really beyond young thug's talent it wasn't so he kind of just easily hit that mark now you might as well just ignore the track titles on the rest of this thing unless you want them to lead you into a series of false assumptions you have funny moments where gucci mane is featured on the the project but not on the track that is named after him Wyclef Jean is actually featured on the project not on the track that is named after him what I will say is that surprisingly young thug's shallow attempts at trying to get people's attention which he's never not doing actually don't take away from the quality of the music on this tape from track 1 it's clear that this isn't just going to be another thugger project because he is featured riding this instrumental that is so heavily reggae inspired with the upstroke guitars and the very slow rock steady calm rhythm the nice warm resonant bass young thug's lead vocal is incredibly melodic actually catchy and it's backed up and elevated by some beautiful background vocals that make the track feel refine of course in the lyrics here we have Geoffrey threatening people who mess with his money nothing new or incredibly revolutionary by young thug lyrical standards but the track still remains captivating and catchy before I go deeper into this review I will say trying to deeply analyze young thug lyrics and and critique them as if you would like a verse from nas it's a fool's errand I'm not going to do it now the vocal performances and the instrumentals and the hook on this thing stay pretty varied and distinct as we go deeper into the tracklist the song Floyd Mayweather features some of the stickiest flows on the entire project some beautiful piano arpeggios weaved into an eerie beat although I wish that Gucci Mane and Travis Scott on the chorus of the track did a little bit more to break the song up especially when Travis Scott comes through the track feels kind of monotonous at that point especially since his feature is so underwhelming where things really seem to heat up on Jeffery is when the song RiRi comes through which is a fiery passionate track which features pained lead vocals from young thug and a wild chorus where he's talking about how she does that work and she earns it but he says her earn like young thug literally sounds like a seal as he is singing this hook and somehow it works oddly enough the song is as freaky as it is sexually charged whether or not it actually turns you on I'm just going to leave that up to you to decide and then we have the equally good goo op which features young scooter and two members of me goes off set and quavo and this track features an epic wintry just frigid be listening to this instrumental I imagine Jeffrey in the middle of a snowstorm doing karate as snowflakes just fall in slow motion all around him and on Harambee you could say young thug legitimately goes apeshit this is the most aggressive track I've ever heard him on he's screaming his brains out he's all over the place he's just got it all the way in the red and I would love to hear more tracks from him in the future where he goes this ballistic it's a really entertaining cut again I guess it's another track title that you could take literally in a way Harambee most aggressive cut in the track listing here despite the actual meaning of the name Harambee but whatever the song webby is just merely okay doesn't really stand out to me but it fits in to the very refined and pretty instrumental palette of the entire tape and I do give it to young thug for delivering yet another energetic vocal performance in the track listing here and then the closer Kanye West is actually another sort of reggae or dance flavored cut which features even more good vocal melodies especially since Wyclef Jean comes through on this track dominates the second half and there are plenty of moments on this country young thug is punctuating this great instrumental with these really weird vocalizations wait wait hey they're really melodic and rhythmic and they sound much better than what I'm doing right here I'm sorry I liked this project didn't love it but I liked it and I was surprised by that I didn't go into this thing anticipating that I would come out enjoying it as much as I did but I I guess I can't really be too surprised because even at my most disappointed with young thug I always thought that there's potential there you know he seems really eccentric he seems out there he seems on the fridge and he's doing some strange things with his voice if only he would push them into some better written songs some better instrumentals some more memorable hooks or at least you know just experiment a little bit and while this album didn't do all of those things to the point where I'm head over heels for it it did all of them just enough to keep me entertained for the majority of it I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this geoffery tape listen will you be calling a Jeffrey Jeffrey from now on and yelling at people like morons every single time someone calls him young thug let me know down in the comments I'm sure you will did you love this thing did you hate this thing oh it was your favorite track off of it did Harambee go hard let me know okay you guys are the best forever 
TtqyDOj5Js4,hi everyone coffin and meet Ana here the internet scratched music nerd absolutely Louie disgusting and it's a time for a review of the new Carly Rae Jepsen EP emotion sigh B Carly Rae Jepsen Canadian pop song stressed returns with a new collection of tracks which I guess are just run off from her very good last commercial full-length album emotion dropped last year and despite the fact that this album was coming out from one of the biggest voices and pop music one of the friendliest voices in pop music I enjoy the hell out of this record it was a triumphant return to 80s pop music but without feeling overly nostalgic Carly didn't come off as one of these artists who sort of uses the staal juh as a crutch in order to attract fans it's just that the songwriting and some of the instrumentation on this record and this new EP - calls back to something that's been lost over the past 30 years in pop music like feel-good attitudes and bliss and innocence but Carly embraces these characteristics without making music that is simply for children because I think adults deserve happy music to do it do it do it do it but even at her saddest on this record Carly's music on this new side b EP still comes off as catchy and infectious and on the song the one she's actually singing about how she doesn't want love she doesn't want to be the one of this particular person that she's singing about she doesn't want that pressure it's a track about essentially dating but not really wanting to commit set to a really sharp beat a wonderful synth lead and maybe Carly feels this way because she's felt the sting of rejection on the song fever where she describes the love the obsession she has for a particular person as a sickness that she can't get rid of the verse is on this thing are very Spacey leave a lot of room for Carly's vocals there are some just reverb bleepy synths that are just kind of calling out into the nocturnal darkness of this instrumental and then it eventually gives way to this hard heavy thick fuzzy punchy chorus that is maybe the most radio-friendly moment on the entire EP one thing that I do like about this EP in general it doesn't seem too make as many concessions to the cheap radio pop stylings that a handful of tracks did on a motion I also want to add there is a moment in the lyrics here where Carly describes herself as being put in the friend zone it happens to girls too on the song hire one of my favorite tracks on here great single from this thing Carly's lyrics are pretty straightforward and uplifting and and good mood inducing as she's singing about someone's love taking her higher the instrumental on this thing is really tight great beat throbbing synthesizers and I guess I would have to give it to the song cry to be the moodiest track on the entire EP where Carly is singing about a lover who withholds his feelings just Stowe's them away out of reach and this is heartbreaking for Carly I will cry for you Carly I will cry for you kill me maybe and Carly uh gains like a sense of humor I think toward the end of the EP where she sings on the song store about having a difficult time saying goodbye to a particular person so she makes her exit by simply saying hey you know what I'm going to the store at least that's how I interpreted it to me it's kind of a hilarious premise for a rejection song and you know Carly dam Carly you're cold you just you just go into the store on the guy oh it's worse than breaking up in text I also love how bouncing and playful the chorus is on this track to the Brant Brian I'm just going to the start to the stuff I'm just going to the stuff Oh Carly ends things off on a slightly dark note with the song roses where she uses roses as a metaphor singing about them going black which again pretty dark by carly Rae Jepsen's standards I guess uh you know this thing it's not really a cohesive project or anything like that it's a compilation it's little EP it's it's a mix of tracks that were leftover emotions from emotion these were the emotions that didn't make the cut I guess but it sounds like there was really no less effort put into this handful of tracks and there were many of the great songs that were on the original emotion even if some of the songs tune wise and writing wise maybe are as great as those tracks it seems like Carly and company went into these songs with no less ambition because the production on these tracks sounds fantastic performances are good and the lyrics while they do kind of center around love many of the songs on emotion did as well and it seems like Carly would try to give us a different angle of love or some kind of emotion that was torturing her on that record here it's really no different even though you know we do have a lot of love songs one after the other it's kind of a different flavor each time hey you know I don't want to be with this guy I need to leave this guy I'm obsessed with this guy and then there are moments where oh hey we're together and we're happier oh wow our relationship is just crumbling in a way I like this EP a little bit more than I did emotion you know there weren't really any cuts on here that I that I super disliked or any choruses or production tricks or moves that that drugged me the wrong way and the CP doesn't really overstay its welcome or anything like that you know it's just kind of short quick and to the point doesn't really have anything to hide it's just some good poppy ear candy that I enjoy you know the last hurrah for summer if you will the last pop hurrah for summer I'm feeling a strong seven to light eight on this thing Church at Richard Tran and those are my thoughts on this new Carly Rae Jepsen EP what did you think of it did you let it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it okay also remember to subscribe because that's good for you keeps the the sickness at bay and um make sure to sing the praises of this EP on high to the heavens if you enjoy it yourself okay okay you're the best see you in the next review forever 
l2PCJl1TnDE,Hemme hi everyone industry kablammo here the internet's busiest music nerd and getting my thoughts right now on some recent developments that have come out of the music streaming industry people talking about Spotify allegedly burying the songs and the albums of artists who do exclusive deals with other music streaming platforms now the sort of stuff I always take with a grain of salt because it seems like the the music journalism industry a lot of the time is just an arm of the music labels out there and they just kind of report on all the negative shit that the labels would like you to think about Spotify like that whole debacle about Oh Taylor Swift once the elder artist to be paid more for being on Spotify and it's just not fair she's such a patron saint of music she hasn't forgotten about the little people it's not like her labels just using her to to squeeze more money out of Spotify for her music and the music of other artists that are also on her label I mean she really cares about those small independent bands that are getting paid anything oh there's a reason people call her a snake Spotify of course is shot back and said that this isn't true we're not doing this and even me personally I have a hard time believing that Spotify is actually engaging in this type of behavior I mean there's such a huge successful company they have a lot of employees I can't imagine that they would do something as stupid as to peddle II bury the results of incredibly popular artists like Drake or chance the rapper just to just to stick it to those artists because the result of that is going to be that they're going to make less money because people go onto that streaming service to stream those artists because those artists are popular why would they decidedly make less money just to just to get back at these people a streaming service blatantly denying its customers artists like Drake is like a grocery store denying its customers bread I can't imagine a faster way for Spotify to become irrelevant and I think they understand that it just doesn't make sense just like exclusively streaming your album on a particular service in general which of course Universal Music has said that they are no longer interested in doing since Frank ocean's latest record kind of a stupid idea for them to do that Frank Ocean such a huge such a popular artist if you put the album on just one streaming platform especially a paid platform then you're only going to limit the amount of people that are going to hear the record it's it's it's it's math I don't know how Universal hadn't figured that out beforehand and Frank I don't necessarily blame him for doing what he's doing I mean in the industry today if you're an artist I would say whenever the opportunity comes up take the money and run man because uh this music industry it's very unforgiving nobody's going to sort of keep your legacy alive nobody's going to do you any favors the moment you're irrelevant you're chewed up and you're spit out so for anybody that could be right around the corner that could be for some indie darling especially for an indie darling and that could also be true of the most popular artists out there today so if Apple offers you a fat sack of cash saying that hey you know premier with us you get all this money sure why not but what sort of really got caught in my craw was this recent set of articles that had come out talking about how Spotify is publicly saying that exclusives are bad they're bad for the industry they're bad for the fans they're bad for the musicians or pretty funny considering that Spotify in the past has dipped their toes into the exclusives game I mean they didn't exactly come through with wonderful exclusives I mean they didn't exclusive with that recent like tyga album that they should have paid him to put it in the garbage honestly but how is Spotify the streaming service company that has mil means more subscribers than Apple music who is known for their huge glamorous music exclusives on Apple music going to shit on the next logical step in this music streaming competition I mean Spotify wasn't exactly stopping in their tracks during the early days of their company when the rest of the industry was saying streaming is bad for music don't stream music streaming hurts the band's Shamy hurts the art and streaming hurts the industry they were like you know what we're still fuck it we're gonna keep going now if there's one thing that I know is bad for artists and bad for music and bad for the fans its Spotify potentially having a monopoly in the music streaming world and far in a way being the most popular music streaming service with no real competition because with no real competition Spotify is free to provide as mediocre a service as they want if Spotify wants to end exclusives for good pay artists more for streaming make it so that it makes monetary sense to make your album available free and to everyone on a platform like Spotify versus taking a fat sack of cash from Apple or title which is a platform that partially exists because the artists who head the platform saw themselves being ripped off in the music streaming realm which is why they started their own service to cut out the Spotify middleman now that Spotify is the head honcho and the music streaming game they don't want to see smaller services taking that next logical step to compete with Spotify directly and provide a service that is legitimately separate from what every other music streaming service out there is providing you need to make your service different from everybody else's service one of the easiest ways you can do that is making sure that what is available on your service is different than what is available on other services and since you're all offering music of course you want to have music that other streaming services don't have that gets more people paying attention to your music streaming service it only makes sense and while there are labels out there like Universal Music who are saying hey man I don't know if I want to do this whole exclusive thing anymore I don't think exclusivity is necessarily going to be a thing of the past I think we're going to continue to see more and more of it especially as we have artists who are in unique positions like Drake or like Frank who are incredibly popular and have a lot of sway with their labels and have a lot of sway in the industry and can be offered these multi-million dollar deals by platforms like Apple to release music exclusively with that labels are screwing over artists and taking a lot off the top artists are screwing over their fans by putting their stuff exclusively on these streaming services and making it difficult for them to access but fans are also screwing over artist by pirating their music and not actually supporting the artists and their careers streaming services are screwing over labels and artists by not paying enough everybody is treating everybody like garbage and I'm so happy to not be a part of any of it and sort of have the ability to stand on the outside of the orgy of shit and just kind of casually comment on it as I see fit and I'm gonna leave it at that for this a little rant over here Spotify talking about exclusives they're bad kind of hypocritical but also really dumb because how are you going to compete with these other shaming platforms when they're offering things that you are you can't really cry wolf when you're one of the biggest competitors out there and Apple is figuring out ways to do what you do but a little better all right let's so let's let's get out of here a transition and those are all my thoughts on Spotify exclusives Frank Ocean music streaming right now money music industry let me know what you think of this twisted web that we weave if you want down in the comments section I remember to like this video even if you don't like it because you would you've watched it fucking liked it and make sure you subscribe because I hear that's good for you Anthony Fantana music streaming Spotify forever 
dnkjfA3anDk,hi everyone beg the bank Hanano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for some thoughts on this latest record from Brownsville rapper kah phone is ringing honor killed the samurai this is the latest record from grimy gloomy and grave rapper kah you might remember his last record which I reviewed very positively the Knights gambit though in the meantime between that record and this one he had come out with that record under the name dr. yen low 100 days with dr. yen low somewhat unimpressed with that one unfortunately kind of strange considering that the music he was making under that name wasn't really that different from the music he makes under his con named which was maybe part of my issue with it being under another name but whatever the one thing that I want to say before I get into this record is cause not really making music for everybody for sure anybody can enjoy his music but it is hip-hop that is so mysterious subtle soft on the ears kind of eerie it's very repetitive its skeletal it is low-key to the extreme the instrumentals typically don't serve up a whole ton of detail don't try to steal the show too much they kind of just you know play as a foundation for cause very very whisper quiet voice his delivery his flow they're not exactly showstoppers or anything like that he is really the patient man's rapper their points on this album and his previous records as well where his rapping just borders on spoken word now where cause sort of butters his bread is that his his lack of overall energy and enthusiasm on his records is kind of trumped by the fact that his songs are endlessly quotable and all these lines usually build up into a series of cautionary tales about drugs and violence and money let's get into a few of my favorite lines of this new record of his all goes awry when that reason is seized and all foes could die I'm back squeezing a piece instantly regret that step weavin the Beast want that dough to grow seeds is the yeast that's that's a bar I bathe replenish from my days of menace was true by my influence the rages in us I dealt vicious for well-wishers and naysayers it's love they got me from scrub to great player no one's mixing words vicious verbs emerge from being this disturbed as a kid observed on curves where they twist the herb was wrapping the present years before the gift was heard my quarters wasn't in calm waters the ships perturbed those ships were not in calm waters they was perturbed I need money not to bling self boast or greed reasons but to bring health to most diseased regions and god we trust' could bring silver lining to ill environment I'm finding if you really grinding that's the real assignment now I could go on and on and on quoting lines from this record there are tons of great lines on this record while the music isn't exactly attention demanding nor is cause delivery the lyrics are deadly though if there is one more thing I came away really impressed with on this record it was kind of the flow of these tracks the topics of these songs and the concept of the record each song featured these various snippets talking about the tragedy of the samurai and kind of parallels that with the tragedy of the tales that cause telling in his songs then the instrumentals each one sounds like it's something sampled out of the soundtrack to a karate movie which definitely adds a certain musical tone to this record that caused previous efforts just didn't have still though a lot like with dr. yen-lo I can't help but feel like cajas in a way painted himself into a creative corner while he is very idiosyncratic and he is a unique talent over the course of his handful of records thus far I don't think he's proven himself to be all that versatile in my opinion kai has certainly sharpened his weapon over the years to the point where he put out that excellent Knight's gambit record and I think just honed his style so incredibly well but there aren't so many new ideas in my opinion on this latest record over here at least not enough to keep me guessing just as to what cause is going to be doing next because I think I can put money on the the idea that the next car record will not sound too unlike his previous several for some people that predictability factor is going to rub them the wrong way I am one of those people to a slight degree because I do think there's something to be said for being adventurous because certainly the rabbit hole goes deeper than what we have here still I don't think the lack of surprises on this record takes away from just how incredible the lyrics are and how interesting the concept is how well the instrumentals flow together on this album - the instrumentals actually have some nice versatility on this LP as well from the dramatic instrumental swells on the song hours and then there are some beautiful fluttering woodwinds on the track illicit fields and then the sad wailing guitar solos on the song I wish death poem that closes the entire record out again despite the lack of surprises I still think this record is great and it's just as chilling as anything that cause put up to this point I'm feeling a strong seven - a light eight on this LP transition have you given this album a listen did you love it - hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this cop album you're the best cop honor killed the samurai forever 
f51wTFevGpw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here you know who it is Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our best and worst tracks of the week segment where I recommend to you guys about tracks I enjoyed from this past week tell you guys what tracks underwhelmed me is sort of just was kind of met on and the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks of the week let's start things negative because who doesn't love a little negativity to start with the worst tracks then we'll get into the met tracks them again - the best tracks the tracks that were best in my opinion of course because this is this is all subjective fam all right worst tracks of the week we have a handful over here quite a few tracks fighting for this number one worst track of the week spot let's hear the runners up we have the new against me song crash which is an OK tune I think it's a little basic and in power poppy by against me standards which is kind of saddening but maybe what rubbed me the wrong way the most about this song was the music video I've never cringed so hard at against me to be honest I'm not quite so sure if it was the jumping around sort of Wiggles style dancing all over the music video or the fact that a I can't quite figure out what they were trying to do with the whole face paint thing like one member looks like kiss Laura looks like Ozzy Osbourne I'm not really sure what the what they were trying to do with this music video it's a it's a migraine and a half but still not the worst track of the week not the worst track of the week moving on getting closer to that though the new no age track separation unfortunately no age kind of sounds like they're not really trying much like they were on their last album unfortunately so not really sure how to take this track it's just another really underwhelming and disappointing no age song and then we have the new Jimmy Eat World track get right which sort of takes the band's original sound or the sound that we remember them for in the 2000s and tosses it in the trash and instead gives us this overly dramatic melodic and a shimmery and shall we mix that sounds like something Coldplay would use much more than a band from sort of the Jimmy Eat World sort of pop rock and emo rock era it's kind of a Coldplay effect I think all these bands are come through and they're like oh let's just try to sound like the most popular rock band today and to sound lean are really showy and huge and dramatic even though that's not really our style we'll just attempt that and the worst song of the week actually does that very same thing it is the sum 41 song war a terrible song not only awful lyrics really just try cloying chorus but also trying even harder than this Jimmy World track to be really just over-the-top and dramatic and shimmering when some forty one that's never really been their style you know I would have respected much more if they just tried to do the whole pop punk thing again and through rap Rock verse in there for good measure but instead they're trying to do this overly showy and emotional thing and it just doesn't sound all that great you know just sounds mediocre unfortunately but moving on to the tracks that I was kind of a different toward you know I could certainly understand people enjoying these tracks much more than me they're not awful but they're still songs that you might enjoy and there's still songs that uh you just might like more than me that's all the new Thundercat track was kind of on the fence with this cut buss in the streets it's a kind of got that 80's 70's R&B and funk and soul meld to it that a lot of his songs tend to have but since his debut record his production just the instrumentals in the mixing just don't really sound that fantastic and also just the the the amazing elements of improvisation that I hear with his band during his live shows are just not showing up in his music at all I mean I guess it's great that it gives you something to be surprised about in the live setting but it's something I would love to hear on his actual records but hey you know this track my sound better in the context of the record I guess was sort of underwhelmed by the new angel Olsen song - angel Olsen singer-songwriter can be kind of hit or miss for me in this track sister it's not one of the more eccentric and bold and in-your-face garage' tunes that I've enjoyed from her as of late it's one of these sort of despondent and bland spacious acoustic tracks that sound like something that would be pressed onto a 7-inch single that you would get a free copy of if you had like 12 marks on your urban outfitters punch card or something and moving on from there we have American football with I've been lost for so long people have been asking me to review this new American football track asking me what I think about this new American football track I think it's kind of middle-of-the-road guys I think it's pretty underwhelming nothing really all that special about this track it sounds super clean to the point where it's it's a I don't know I mean American football they never really had a dirty sound but it sounds so sanitary to the point where it's like an adult contemporary rock track and not the passionate fiery and emotionally captivating emo that they were known for in the 90s and if this track is indicative of what's going to be on the rest of the record I'm going to be pretty uninterested in it to be honest so this track nothing really all that great about it in my opinion also pretty underwhelmed by the new Meshuga song born in dissonance I mean Meshuga comes through with another melodically deficient riff on a weird time signature I don't know are we supposed to be amazed and blown away by this same formula the band has been rehashing again and again and again for multiple albums up until this point I don't know and finally the new Darkthrone track you know this track just barely scraped into this category it's not a bad track it's not a terrible track you know I'm failing to sort of see what's all that special about it but it is a pretty decent performance it does sound rough around the edges they do kind of bring their more traditional black metal sound back there past couple of records have had more of a heavy-metal vibe to them this sort of sounds like a more pure form of black metal or they're just going more in that black metal direction the vocals are rough as hell some of the riffs are pretty decent although they are sort of slow and really brooding and ominous definitely give it a shot if you've enjoyed a lot of the old old-school black metal suffer if you've enjoyed Dark Thrones past efforts don't miss this track all right as far as the songs that I ended up enjoying this week got to give it to young thug with the song Wyclef Jean young thug or Geoffrey a lot of you guys are asking me to review his new record gonna be doing that very soon I promise you and this song he does like a reggae thing on the instrumental and he doesn't sound that bad doing it I was pretty surprised with his versatility here usually young thug just kind of goes through the motions and puts out the same track again and again and again but here he really surprised me so kudos to him on that kudos to him on that also carly rae jepsen with the song higher carly Rae has come out with a b-sides collection from her fantastic album emotion that dropped not too long ago and these songs sound like even more 80s bliss than the record that she just dropped I don't know what it is about this 80s pop stuff that Carly Rae she just is complimented by it so well lots of artists especially these underground indie artists they try to rehash this whole 80s thing they sound terrible doing it for whatever reason Carly it's probably the good songwriting sounds fantastic so I'm probably going to be covering this b-sides collection pretty quickly so make sure to give a listen to this track as soon as you can carly rae hire fantastically catchy song ty dolla sign with Zadi this is a very catchy and modern R&B track very moody I'm liking what ty is doing with his music right now I mean there were so many great highlights from his last record that even though there were songs that really underwhelmed me I was really looking forward to seeing what he would do on his next project because there's certainly incredible amount of potential there goddamn horses in the stable such a goddamn good song all right uh also ulcerate with extinguished light oppressively heavy atmospheric sludge track here super progressive a technically sound and very cool linear song structure on this track it's dizzying it's like a dissension into hell moving on clipping with air amount this new single from the experimental rap trio is much more accessible than their last single still trying to wrap my head around this one this track sort of seems a little bit more along the lines of the catchy er cuts off of their last record so definitely looking forward to to you know hearing more cuts like this on the new album not that clipping can't experiment or anything like that but I at least like to you know have tracks like this to be sort of home bases throughout the record to be like okay you know here's a few avant-garde songs and here's a few tracks that you know you can really kind of knock your trunk to and just really kind of turn up the bass and whatever haven't really dove too deeply into the lyrics on this cut but the music video is super trippy and I'm just liking Devi digs flow on this thing and the instrumental seems texturally rich as well Mick Jenkins with the song drowning bad bad not good is on his new record that's fantastic Mick Jenkins a couple of his tracks lately I've been kind of underwhelming me especially those tracks Rhys singing a little bit more don't particularly feel all that great about his singing voice a lot of the time but he seems to be a little bit more aggressive on this track and just kind of really sticking to his bars and sort of a what he did so well on the waters and finally the band gate creeper with the song desperation a little by the numbers as far as death metal goes but still a really grimy brutal straightforward fast and throttling track with a lot of energy something that when I shared it on Twitter there were people who weren't even into death metal and they were like well this is actually pretty cool and and that's definitely something interesting about this track it is rough around the edges it is aggressive and does have that grimy blood cake death metal sound but there's something kind of accessible about it you know just the way that the guitars move and the pace and the groove of the song just seems really catchy you and just like anybody can listen to and just be like yeah yeah it's like this is deadly you know so I definitely give this track a listen especially if you're kind of a death metal newbie because this could certainly hook you in I think and those are my tracks of the week my favorite tracks the tracks I was kind of meh and the worst tracks in my opinion excuse me that was disgusting what did you think of all these songs that you loved them hate them why and what were some tracks that stuck out to you this week that maybe kind of slipped through the tracks

oNxGFNaJByg,anybody anything hi everyone been thony camp tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for one of my favorite segments on this channel it came from band camp where we go through some of the weirdest band camp pages on the infamous band camp platform where independent artists can go up and pretty much you know upload their music whatever it is whatever their heart's desire I mean obviously with it within reason I guess but there's so much insanity as exemplified by these six projects we are about to show you let's kick things off with forest of Harambee this is a black metal project that is obviously in tribute to harambe the gorilla the gorilla who was shot at the Cincinnati Zoo because a kid went in his enclosure and they thought the kid was under threat of being killed by the gorilla so they decided to put Harambee down and this band who was allegedly from Norway not quite sure if I can trust that they put out three tracks that have amazing title such as I am Harambee and dicks out and then a great end a pre pre Mott let's it let's give a little sample of this track over here titled the dicks out your ears are not deceiving you it literally sounds like ass yeah it's it's kind of your standard generic demo quality black metal but at least the spirit of Harambee is there and you can legitimately say there is some Harambee themed black metal on the internet so I guess just kind of keep that meme alive guys moving on to some more metal but not quite as as Mima fide we have jute kites per dorrance CI used is an experimental metal project from Missouri very prolific a lot of albums under this artist belt at this point this one over here sounded to me like the most gripping of all that I had heard from this project on Bandcamp so far but when I went to listen to this record because I was considering giving it a full review I literally ran into a couple migraines migraine headaches like this album gives me migraines despite the fact that instrumentally and compositionally I do find it kind of intriguing its little gimmicky it's kind of a one-trick pony but still yeah I wanted to say something about it that's why I'm talking about it here in this segment it is a supremely weird record it has been labeled by the artist here and I believe others as a micro tonal metal I guess because some of the notes and the melodies played on this record don't quite fit into the chromatic scale they're sort of like these weird in-between notes that when layered on top of each other create a lot of chaos and dissonance it's it's intriguing but there's an intentional ugliness to it that I like quite a bit if you enjoy your metal to be super experimental and technical dizzyingly weird then I think you're going to find stuff about this project that you like let's sample a bit of it it's so raw it's so animalistic it's so noisy it's just that it wears on me after a while maybe down the road I might have a little bit more tolerance for this I do enjoy at least a couple tracks when I hear them in one sitting it's just kind of difficult to trip through this entire record and just always be like exhilarated about listening to what's going on because it is so taxing it is so soul crushing at points so again choukai / Durance definitely look that up our next little ditty over here comes from one of many albums thus far from producer rapper singer-songwriter mr. coin Locker kid whose music I've been conscious of since 2012 the guy is really odd unpredictable and there are actually a lot of cool characteristics about his music he blends together so many styles in a way that you wouldn't necessarily think makes sense but somehow it does I mean sometimes I don't care for some of the ideas that he works into his tracks but still I give the guy all the credit in the world for coming off his on the fringe and as adventurous as he typically does and this new track over here seems to be no exception not only because there is like a 20-minute song on here the longest song I think he you might have recorded so far I might be wrong on that but he seems to be bringing in some more weird wild horn samples and singing vocals and really kind of just continuing to diversify his ever-growing style which is kind of like becoming this Acura sized blob that's going in every direction and is just overtaking all these different ideas and sounds and concepts and and just kind of mixing them together into into one giant mass let's let's sample this track exactly where you want to be my lion and you touching my penis and pulling your hair outward how the trajectory of planet Venus this project if I didn't mention the name of it already is the salmon of doubt so ya coin Locker kid the same and about give that a shot now for some people out there and this is true of our next artist for them the 90s are not over the 90s are not dead they're still alive and well and our buddy Shane darling over here has a record out titled spectral which sounds like some industrial goth rock from about 20 years ago very Manson or Nine Inch Nails inspired but it's very demo quality and also Shane doesn't seem to display the sharpest sense of songwriting ability so this kind of allows him to really venture out of the norm in terms of the flow of a typical song and his vocals are are quite odd and a motive as well very very angsty very pained very tortured not really sure how to put it into words so we'll we'll give this track PR electronica shot please don't DMCA me I'm giving this an honest shot given it the the good old college try I swear next I want to give a shout-out to an artist who I've actually done a formal review of before a couple formal reviews it's Milo Milo wraps you you know the guy but this track this one 40-minute track which consists of multiple songs lands on his latest project or under the scallops Hotel name which in a recent interview or I guess an interview that came out just before his latest record which was a little while ago he explained a scallops Hotel is where he kind of experiments a little bit more tries out new ideas tankers and that sort of stuff and just kind of puts all this weird stuff together under a project under this kind of alternative pseudonym and here once again while it is demo quality and it's obviously very rough and not tightly or fully put together organized still Milo comes together with a lot of interesting ideas with too much of life is mood and on this thing as I said it's kind of one 40-minute track just I kind of kind of all linked into one cohesive block so you're not like skipping around or anything like that it's just kind of one cohesive string of consciousness sort of moment you know nothing is sort of finished so tightly that it can be its own song with a couple of exceptions like the track featuring uh s be the more but it all kind of links together into this holistic project as kind of just one track is flowing directly into the next you know it's kind of like a random Tabas tree of odds and ends for Milo so if you're a big fan of Milo and you kind of want to hear him explore a little bit and try out some new stuff then give this project a shot you're just going to land right in the middle of this notion open opening up to a minute track and we're going to see where it takes us because we're going to be adventurous haha shout out again to milo keep doing what you're doing always interesting to hear new milo project so that is link down there in the description with everything else we've been talking about in this segment so far give it some your time but we're going to finish things off with this last project over here we really saved the best for last for you ladies and gentlemen this project comes from a band who goes by the name of skank chiral scott hotel and the album is titled in the arrow skank over the checkered pattern before i get into what this project is i regret to inform you that there were about 40 dubbed cassettes of this project and they are now sold out so there's just no reason to live anymore but if you're a total peasant you can listen to this album digitally and in what a digital album experience it is as this is pretty much a song for song cover of Neutral Milk Hotel Zin the aeroplane over the sea redone in the stylings of horrible high school band demo quality ska yes Scott renditions of of this album front to back but the performances are terrible the horn sound awful the mixing is is garbaggio the singing is absolutely awful just how bad the songs sound is I guess a part of the joke a part of the appeal of this project I'd I can't help but laugh at it of course these tracks have genius retitling of the songs skaaland 1996 two three four pick it up pick it up pick up you're gonna pick it up big lip stop stop it you know if you're interested these guys apparently also have an avant-garde noise cover band Lincoln dark thirty which we will generously link down there in the description if you are so curious thank God for the Internet thank God alright guys that's going to do it for this episode of it came from band camp those are six band camp pages that I wanted to turn you on to and obviously again please don't DMCA this video I have children to feed a channel to grow and I'm just I'm just trying to share your music around y'all just trying to share your music with people you know and again you guys who are watching please make it worth it for these artists to be featured in this segment if you liked anything that you

yegJB-LEtrg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm going to do a quick review here of the new going to Sufi album callous coda Sufi is a desert mystic a singer a songwriter producer multi-instrumentalist and he broke out in 2010 with the really good record of Sufi and a killer he was kind of put on by Flying Lotus you know a lot of people were paying attention to him because of his appearance on flying lotuses music and Flying Lotus lent some production to this latest or that big breakout record of his not the latest record is I didn't want to say that but moving on and not too long after he dropped a couple of projects that were just super lackluster it just seemed like Sufi and the killer as good as it was was just kind of a fluke unfortunately I mean the muzzle EP just or album just seemed so much less adventurous the production was super lackluster and now this new record over here has been like I want to say like I guess four years in the making I suppose and while it has a lot of tracks there's a lot of material on this album there there's nothing much else going for it in my opinion to me this record is just like demos the album there's a lot of different stylistic ground covered on this thing you know there's some tracks that seem like they have more of a psyche rock vibe some tracks that seem like they have more of a synthetic almost new wavy vibe or maybe kind of like a goth industrial kind of thing it's all very low Phi it's all very noisy and intentionally so you know it's an abrasive record and texturally I find the album pretty stimulating you know there's a lot of different sounds some of them harsh a lot of them very dirty and tattered there's definitely an ugly Beauty to this record that I think ganja Sufi was going for an ugly beauty that I think was similar to that of a Sufi and a killer but the thing is some of the songs and the production on a soufiane a killer I was really enamored with the production there I felt that the way the beats were sort of put together required a lot more skill than what is actually being simplified on Callas over here while demos aren't necessarily a bad thing you know for example that new Kendrick Lamar record untitled unmastered love the out of that but the thing is the performances and the songwriting were so good that is sort of overtook the fact that the song sounded a little muddy and a little noisy being muddy and noisy and just again texturally simulating is really all this album has going for it going to Sufi doesn't really have the compositional talent or really the vocal talent to kind of make his ideas translate and sound captivating I mean he certainly is an eccentric and an idiosyncratic vocalist but I wouldn't exactly call him a skilled vocalist you know he makes some weird funny sounds but he doesn't really back those weird funny sounds up with great vocal melodies or I don't know good performances it all just seems like a little overly indulgent directionless and I don't know just kind of navel-gazing a lot of the time I'm not really sure what else to say about this album you know it's just kind of like a series of motifs a series of tracks that just kind of are bridges to nowhere again I say demos the album as if that's like some kind of grand statement or something like that when in fact it's just kind of like really unambitious in the long run which is a little disappointing because I thought this might be a little different I liked some of the tasters from this album that I had heard and I thought the album art from this record was actually pretty grim and intense and I was like wow you know this looks like some crazy hardcore you know zine punk  from the user nineties might be pretty cool not that I thought that he was going to go in that direction but maybe we were looking for a bit of a harder edgy or aesthetic on this record given the album cover and the album title when in fact it's you know just a tad underwhelming unfortunately it's an album that totally makes sense though you would hear like 30 seconds of a couple of tracks and be like hey that's pretty cool you know sounds interesting but once you actually kind of get a full panoramic view of the songs it's kind of like wow there's really not much to these tracks you know once you get past those 30 seconds or a minute that's semi interesting it just kind of doesn't know where to bring itself you know some of these songs actually might have been interesting if some of these redundant parts actually transition to other short songs and then you could have made a full song or something like that I don't know but yeah this this thing is sort of not only unambitious but it just sort of skips out on these tracks that have a little potential it's almost like it has a DD in a sense as well yeah I don't really know if I have much more to say about it than that unfortunately but if you're like in the record you'll like the record I mean I certainly understand in a sense with it being as noisy and as eccentric as it is but to me that's not really backed up with anything you know it's just kind of a bit of a little bit of a crazy moment that doesn't add up to much for me personally but those are my thoughts on the album what did you think of this record if you did give it a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana going to Sufi Callas forever and Callas call us I get it a bit of wordplay there no need to leave an angry comment singing Anthony even you don't know how to say that I'm totally you know you don't get that album tell Anthony huh have a good one 
IjyhNVPVV0A,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and today I'm doing a couple quick reviews on the iPhone of a few albums I wanted to cover and I'll just throw them into a bio review because I personally was curious about them and some people have been asking me about them the one that I'm going to be talking about here is the new tobacco records sweatbox dynasty as you may already know tobacco is a producer multi-instrumentalist singer some would consider him the mastermind of the electronic psychedelic music outfit black moth super rainbow but he occasionally comes out with music under his sort of solo suit in him over here seems he's doing that more recently than he was not too long ago when black moths super rainbow was first sorting sort of starting to take off and now that he's kind of establishing a solo career for himself and he's come out with a couple of good records you know his first few big solo endeavors involved him playing with a lot of the same fuzzy psychedelic sounds that he would find on a black moth super rainbow record but the beats were a lot more hip-hop influenced you know so that was a pretty cool change of pace and then he really won me over big time with his ultima to massage record which again saw a lot of those same fuzzy psychedelic textures that I've been familiar with him before familiar with from before but um way more distorted and noisy and experimental and trippy he just really went down the rabbit hole on that record which made it pretty interesting and on this new record over here I was pretty excited to hear it because it seems like tobacco is really kind of defining himself more as a solo artist than he is as a member of black moths super rainbow like his solo material is really kind of gaining a personality and a sound of its own but now it seems like he's kind of dropped the ball on this new record unfortunately and and it comes mostly as the results of so much of the material here sounding under written under produced sort of just short of breath and unfinished I mean the album just barely scrapes that just barely scrapes past the 30 minute mark excuse me it just seems like there's something missing from this album there are a couple cat tracks that sound like they could have just ended up on a black Mouth super rainbow record if not for the fact that they're just kind of like a couple more weird sounds and a little more distortion than usual or something like that yeah I mean there's there's nothing particularly special about this record especially considering its following up such a great album in his discography you know and maybe if you're not at least crazy about ultimate ooh massage you can at least admit that that was a unique moment for tobacco and now it seems like he's not only failing to push ahead and continue evolving his sound but he's not even working up to the bar that he set on his previous record because again a lot of the material here is so under written it's so lackluster more than half of the songs on this record feel like a motif and there's like a six minute song toward the end that's doesn't really justify its length that feels like it was just tagged on in order to get the track to like an official albums length this record just seems so scant and just effortless in comparison with ultimate to massage you know effortless isn't something I want to a label I want to put on an artist whose music I typically enjoy or an artist whose music I look forward to but I mean I feel like it's the only word I can pull to when I compare it directly to the album that came before it that seemed like yeah I mean you know it wasn't a magnum opus or anything like that but it was certainly an entertaining record in a really creative moment for tobacco and it seems like he's hit a bit of a dry spot with this album and I'm not completely sure as to why I think I'm just gonna have to leave it at that you know while there are some interesting ideas on this thing and some of the sounds are cool some of the production is is pretty interesting you know tobacco usually comes up with some fun psychedelic distorted sounds and and that's still the case here as far as song structure and just you know writing and producing these songs out fleshing them out and exploring them fully this album has just some serious shortcomings you know some glaring shortcomings I guess is how I would put it but I'm gonna leave it at that what did you think of this new tobacco record did you let it hit it why what do you think I should review next and that's it tobacco soy box dynasty forever 
eLfbvBCavtM,you begin hi everyone kantha nice start tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new a JJ record the Bible - a JJ formerly Andrew Jackson jihad when when they had a cooler name is a Phoenix band known for its mix of rock and punk and folk music a band whose music I have been enamored with for years people that can eat people amazing record can't maintain fantastic record knife man their most ambitious and conceptual release to date the lyrics on these things hilariously bitter and witty you know honestly I'm not even going to go down this rabbit hole because I have a hard time putting into words brief words what it is that makes these three albums so fantastic yeah of course it is the lyrics it's also Sean bonnets vocal delivery that super yell P emotional sounds like he's on the verge of some kind of mental breakdown the tight musical performances and the raw recordings on the band's records are a nice touch to on can't maintain a knife man I would say the band actually transitioned pretty gracefully into incorporating more electric instrumentation and more arranged instrumentation on top of that the band completely lost me under last record Christmas Island to the point where I was just in awe of this thing in awe that Andrew Jackson jihad could put out a record that I was just so indifferent toward and they seemed to have just done it again on the Bible too many of the issues I had with the band's last album are repeated on this new record we have questionable production choices like on the song my brain is a human body which is a loaf I track it's a very rough into sort of track as far as the recording goes but in the worst way possible this thing is like listening to a demo song off of a broken four track that your idiot friend spilled beer on top of during a fruitless recording session also tracks like goodbye oh goodbye Cody's theme also gold and Eagle are so loud distorted compress and overblown that they're nearly unlistenable if someone sucked the dynamics out of my band's recording much I would fire them although in the producer of this records defense I'm sure it was entirely the band's decision to try to sound like Neutral Milk Hotel as many times as they possibly could on this thing which is unfortunate not only because Andrew Jackson jihad already kind of has a definitive sound that they don't need to veer away from especially not to just rip off some other band sound and it sounds like there was a decent Andrew Jackson jihad at the core of some of these songs it's just the instrumentation recording just flat-out ruins it we have a lack of refreshing songwriting ideas like on the song junkie church whose chord progression and melody are only interesting to me because they borrow elements from my favorite song off the last Andrew Jackson jihad record Linda Ronstadt and then there are other cuts that feature the band toying with different musical styles that don't fit their aesthetic that do not play to their strengths at all they quite frankly sound awkward toying with some of these sounds like the very sunny and slick power pop going on on the song white worms the song no more sh t ish is a kind of mild attempt at a dramatic piano ballad something I think the band did a little bit better a knife man and the song American garbage they legitimately try to put together a new wave cut on here and it's a black luster now the band has gone outside of their musical comfort zone in the past but it's not been without I don't know that musical shift in style coming along with some kind of irony or like there's a point to them changing their style like it adds to the narrative of the song in some kind of way but on the Bible too it's like Andrew Jackson jihad is just casually changing styles from one track to the next just because they're bored though one of this album's best moments comes as a result of this surprising musical change of pace the song tera fire which features these burning lead guitar melodies that are pretty sticky and these jumpy rhythm guitars that kind of remind me of something like a ska band would play in the 2000s or the late 90s and after this track were pretty much at the end of the record which thankfully Andrew Jackson jihad does not drop the ball here we have the song small red boy which is an acoustic cut with some really dramatic and beautiful strings woven into the instrumental there's a great spotlight on Shawn's vocals that really has been lacking for the majority of the album thus far and he gives one of his better vocal performances on the entire record not only that but his lyrics from beginning to the end of the track are gripping describing some kind of nightmarish fantasy where he's coming to terms with some sort of great evil or shame or regret haunting him from his past and I think this small red boy that he's singing about is his younger self who he thought of at one point as evil and now he's come to the decision that he's going to relieve himself of that burden take that suffering that self induced suffering off his shoulders the chorus on this thing is stunning and the yell P harmonized vocals are pretty nice - I am I am I am the truth and then the lyrics on this track loop back into the song no more shame and this creates kind of an aha moment on the record all these previous songs sort of tie into the narrative of this track where Sean gets some kind of closure all of a sudden tracks like goodbye Oh goodbye or the depiction of some violent angry unruly kid on Cody's theme all makes sense in fact now the title of the track makes sense and it would have been fantastic if the rest of the record could have shared in this aha moment but unfortunately it doesn't either because the songs lyrically are detouring in another direction or the instrumental or the recording is just so terrible it makes digesting the narrative of the track difficult there were some bright spots on this record just like with Christmas Island and I guess I can give it to Andrew Jackson jihad for being a little bit more conceptual on this album and tying things up in a pretty interesting way on the finish but in a lot of ways for me this album is just Christmas island part two too many glaring flaws for me to say that Andrew Jackson jihad has sort of come out of the woods on this one you know they sort of still seem to be in the midst of this tailspin that they put themselves in for what reason I don't know and I'm just kind of praying for the day

EmAp9HUWu_0,remember hey everyone dance the need arctan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Crystal Castles record amnesty one this is the latest full-length LP from popular indie electronic duo Crystal Castles the first album that's been released under this project's name since the departure of the duo's famed front woman Alice glass and since then she has been replaced by one Miss Edith Frances now the teaser tracks from this thing honestly didn't give me high hopes for the record and even if Alice glass was still working with Ethan cath on this record and I had heard no songs leading up to the release of this album I would still be kind of skeptical because Crystal Castles last album was easily their worst thus far but dude this barely cobbled together album failed to meet my very low expectations as Crystal Castles is no longer creating the alternative and stylish electronic dance music that made them so popular in the late 2000s there are a couple moments on this record that sound like faint rehashes of Crystal Castles songs that would have been decent if they had come out around 2008 or 2009 with Ethan composing some quirky but also kind of moody since escapes and of course these are topped with Edith Frances performing a completely charmless Alice glass impression an example of that would be on the song char but then we have cuts like frail for example which has this banging awesome house beat really buzzing dissonant just sour synthesizers that are bright and siren-like but on here Edith sounds like you'll Andy Visser of Dion's Road as she's kind of yelping in this very high pitch against the noisy instrumental Ethan and Edith make it pretty clear from the get-go that they have no other plans for her than to just force her to live in Alice's shadow despite the fact that her aggressive yell P smudged and distorted singing only brings a fraction of the excitement that Alice's did from the sound of the vocals on this project ethan clearly feels like alice was just a placeholder and didn't really have anything to do with the success of the duo and could just be easily replaced by anybody but the results speak for themselves that's really not the case but not all of the issues on this record can be attributed to Edith there are also a handful of tracks that end really abruptly don't have much in terms of significant song structure are really redundant boring the song teach her how to hunt is a very droney and forgettable interlude that doesn't add anything to the track listing here and the song ornament is as forgettable as it is breezy now when ethan isn't trying to drill for oil in the same dry reservoirs that Crystal Castles have already just sucked out completely on previous records he's doing things like throwing rattling trap high hats into his beats which I will leave it up to you as to whether or not that's working and then there are several cuts on here which feature these super distorted and overblown just way too loud synth leads that are just trying way too hard to be edgy sort of like something that would have gone over well in an industrial club in the late 90s but just sounds kind of silly and out of place today talking about songs like fleece and sadist for example unfortunately there are just so many things working against the success of this record anemic song structures and lengths this is the shortest Crystal Castles album to date lackluster lead vocals lackluster song ideas and occasionally just trying a little too hard to to be edgy there are only a couple instrumentals on this thing that I like and a handful of tracks that I think Crystal Castles at least pulls together a decent aesthetic at least Ethan can still produce a dance track that's kind of harsh and moody as well as physical which will most likely be enough for fans of the duo who weren't into them for anything more than that anyway while I do think there's gonna be a Crystal Castles diehard here and there who think this record is really great I think I personally can say that this is Crystal Castles worst album to date and by a pretty noticeable margin I'm feeling a strong three to Lake for on this thing transition and those are my complete thoughts on this new Crystal Castles record did you give this out Melissa did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it are the best you that us so should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please subscribe and uh yeah that's all also don't cry if you hate my thoughts on this record but you're welcome to respond tell me what you think about the cell which I asked you earlier now I'm asking you twice now you got to do it alright so now we're going to leave it at that Crystal Castles amnesty forever 
iKvC10hmVnU,it's all been building up to this to this moment hi everyone Nothe nice leap tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd tired of an up all night man up all night with Frank Ocean this has been four years in the making Frank Ocean singer-songwriter his return after his massive commercial breakthrough success album channel orange this here this new album is an album people have been talking about had been waiting for ever since the release of channel orange have you even been asking me if I know when the record is gonna come out is if I have some kind of inside info on mr. ocean but the truth is that just about everybody in the music industry was totally clueless as to when this new record was gonna come out to the point where numerous rumors and endless misinformation were spread all across the internet and these got so bad that once this mysterious cryptic little live stream of like a warehouse popped up on Frank ocean's website the idea that the album might just be around the corner was totally unbelievable now this live stream is eventually what ended up becoming the endless visual album that was released just about 24 hours before this new blonde record the album that I'm guessing was formerly boys don't cry could be wrong on that if I am leave a pissed off comment down there in the comments thanks now since endless and since blonde were released so close to one another I mean I think it could have been spread out just a little bit more but since they were released so close to one another didn't really see a point in doing a whole second video just to review and go in-depth about endless especially since my opinion on the project is pretty cut-and-dry endless is an indulgent and purposefully obtuse art project commissioned by Apple to get buzz built up for this new record get social media accounts updating get people talking get bloggers blogging I'm not even going to sit here and pretend care about a bunch of guys sawing wood and welding while wearing designer sweaters but what was good about endless was the music with the exception of the very odd and new wavy device control at the very end of the project that had kind of this thriving synthetic beat and these awkward lyrics about live-streaming Yola if the rest of the record was really pretty and ethereal it was like this very modern but stripped back take on soul and pop music and while it did seem kind of casual and off-the-cuff and not exactly well organized or punchy I thought the sound of it was pleasant Frank ocean's vocals were gorgeous a lot of the time on endless vocally I think Frank started to show some real maturity maturity that wasn't necessarily there on channel Orange especially during some of those killer falsettos which he hadn't quite explored to the depths that he was on endless so with a more impressive vocal range being shown and the potential for a different sound maybe a more subtle low-key easygoing sound I was looking forward to just seeing what direction Frank took blonde in and it definitely is a different album from channel orange and does carry over quite a few of the moods and the sonic palettes from endless it's not as Airy or as loose as endless and that's a good thing I think anything more mellow than what we actually ended up getting here would have been a little bit too much of a stretch for fans still blond is pretty stripped back in comparison with channel Orange especially considering that they're long ambitious tracks on that album such as pyramids it's stripped back in comparison to Frank ocean's many contemporaries as well instead of huge and complicated instrumentals and explosive choruses blonde finds power in simplicity and raw emotion the instrumentals and the ballads on this thing a lot of the time are pretty modest so modest to the point where somebody who's looking for something a little more extravagant might think that there's really nothing special going on here there may not be any pyrotechnics on this record but I still find a lot of a Frank is doing here pretty adventurous there are moments where I'm reminded less of Frank's R&B contemporaries and more of indie artists like Bon Iver on this thing like on the kind of warble II and demo quality good guy interlude or at the end of the track white Ferrari where we have like this acoustic break down with some faint rock samples going on in the background that I can't quite place and this musical change of pace and these influences these sounds and none of them should really be a surprise considering the strange and eclectic list of credits Frank put on this record that sort of leaked online came with something people were picking up at like this pop-up shop a series of pop-up shops rather in support of the release of the record names were listed such as Jamie xx and James Blake and Kanye and Kendrick Lamar Pharrell understandable names also there is an Andre 3000 listed on this thing he has a very obvious amazing and intense feature on the solo were priests but that we have eyebrow raisers like Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead Brian Eno Gang of Four an artist that aren't even currently around right now we have the Beatles and Elliott Smith as well as David Bowie I'm not really sure in what capacity these artists are incorporated into the record are their subtle samples I'm missing are their interpolations of their songs into these tracks that sort of whizzed by me did they sort of take part in another capacity and the list goes on the feature lists on this thing is is a long list but you wouldn't think all these names and faces went into this project given just how low-key it is not to call these songs uneventful but on each track Frank only includes what he needs and nothing that he doesn't now this record kicks off with song nike's admittedly not my favorite in the track listing maybe my least favorite track could possibly be because of the pitched chipmunk to lead vocals on the beginning of the song that lasts way too long and fit kind of awkwardly against the like 808 drums that are very slow very steady very watery synthesizers on this track to the chipmunk vocals don't really add anything to the narrative in my opinion as Frank sort of seems to be singing from the standpoint here that he is later in the track when he's sort of in his normal range of voice and the track doesn't really have a strong narrative either as it's kind of like a salad of references to Frank's recent experiences current state with maybe a few faint statements on love and materialism and there are a couple other tracks on here that I find to be kind of similar as Frank is sort of flipping through a bunch of random thoughts against a kind of pretty watery instrumental of the song skyline - or The Closer budem Alexa Deena still though I guess this introductory track does a decent job of setting the tone for the very easygoing record and it's not really a big worry for me because the album starts dishing out very focused and very high-quality songs right away with the track IV a track that's mostly propelled by these very quiet driving guitars that sound like something off of an xx record Frank's lyrics about falling in love as a younger self are delivered in this really innocent this really boyish voice and he gains a lot of fire and passion in his vocal delivery on the chorus and I love all the lyrics about wanting to but not being able to go back to that time when he was younger when this love that he's singing about still existed the song pink and white has one of the most glamorous instrumentals on the entire record with beautiful string sections and a kind of little bubbly bassline boop boop some crisp drums all set to this 3/4 time signature and Beyonce delivers some very faint reverb background vocals that that blossom beautifully as the song moves along and the second half of the track again one of the most glamorous instrumentals on the record here the track goes over well Frank is singing about these experiences and these things he's been taught by lovers in the past that he's sort of holding on to sort of a piece of these people he's dated stay with him forever because he has learned things from these people then we have an odd little detour about Frank's mom telling him not to do drugs it's like a bit of a voicemail or something that made it on to the record it's cute though maybe the message isn't completely clear or why this thing was in wasn't completely clear to me at least during my first handful of lessons because they're numerous references on this record to doing drugs like right after on the song solo where he's talking about being on tabs of acid but they're also references to not doing drugs on here I believe there's a line where Frank is singing about not having smoked for a year or something and at a lot of the points on the record where Frank is singing about doing drugs it seems as if he's kind of referencing a moment in his past so maybe these are all recent realizations that he's made and he's finally taking his mother's advice to heart which might be the case when you look at a song like nights for example where toward the back end of the track Frank seems to be singing about how his lifestyle burning the candle at both ends is really wearing on him this might have had something to do with maybe this album being delayed so often as he sort of seems to be singing about getting his life together and it doesn't sound like he's singing about the distant past it sounds like the very recent past then we move on to the song solo definitely top 5 favorite track on the album really top 3 for me love the constantly shifting organ chords on this thing which sound like something out of a little Church or something but the chord progression is very jazzy very fresh one of Frank's best vocal performances on the entire record and contains a mix of not only singing but also you know like some spoken word just a tone of voice that sounds like he's rapping or about to rap and the lyrics on this thing are clever as well and sort of talks about a solo in a bunch of different contexts like either you're hitting a solo like sort of stealing the spotlight or getting attention your solo in terms of trying to get with somebody because you don't want to be alone or you want to fly solo toward the back end of the track when he's talking about this instance where this guy's going to the courts to try to get separated from his baby mama through child support payments also one line on this track that stuck out to me was one about avoiding highways which could be interpreted in a bunch of different ways but the way that I took it is that he is avoiding highways to avoid the fast lane stay out of the public eye just kind of live the personal and the low-key life that he wants to live he doesn't want his fame to sort of take over and sort of suck up every waking moment of his existence the song self-control is another stellar track in the track listing here with its kind of slick dry electric guitar chords that are really sensual have a lot of swagger the rest of the instrumentation that pops in later in the track is super soft it's slick it's beautiful it sneaks in so quietly you barely notice it and then all of a sudden once it's all there it's kind of like a big sad crying party and the lyrics on this track another moment where I love the lyrics where Frank is singing about not really being with this person anymore but hoping he's remembered by this individual and singing about toward the back end of the track kind of being a placeholder sleeping in between these two people being that remembered past lover that someone never really gets over and then we have the very unsettling song pretty sweet which has Frank singing wildly over this chaotic wall of what sounds like strings and since it's pretty crazy definitely one of the most experimental and wild things I've heard on a record this popular in a long time also the really peppy percussion at this point in the track that and the the very fast bass line this track plays into this really unpredictable moment on the record that I like quite a bit Frank is kind of realizing how his life decisions are hurting him on the song nights we have that intense Andre 3000 feature which features some amazing lyrics we have the weird close to you interlude track which features an interpolation of the Carpenters song of the same title and we have the Facebook story skit as well there are so many risks on this album at various points but they're quiet risks so they might not be just hitting you over the head and they're pretty refreshing in my opinion even if a couple of them come off as somewhat random or just kind of unfinished ideas the album gains its composure once again and starts dishing out more fleshed out and more coherent songs though they are some of the most structurally and sonically odd in the entire tracklist like the dreamy white Ferrari or the track Siegfried which some amazing string arrangements and rap passages as well and then we have the emotionally stunning God speed which has a gospel vibe to it that ends the album off or almost ends the album off really well and then we have the closer which I'm still kind of indifferent toward don't care about the vocal delivery that much don't care about the instrumental that much the only thing I find kind of interesting about the track are some of Frank's lyrics as he's singing directly to his mother and also in a way his fans obviously and kind of giving everybody an update on all of these recent thoughts and experiences that he's had the only glaring issue to me about this record is that it ends and starts a little weak the rest of the record though is loaded with incredible highlights fantastic songs or little detours that are so weird and unexpected that I can't help but find them stimulating anyway the entire album has a supremely weird flow to it it sort of seems to get stranger and more experimental and more I guess unhinged as it moves along but it always stays low-key beautiful and subtle occasionally it feels a little unorganized but I think that only plays into the character of the album that has this really potent humanity to it a lot of this album is like reading into the personal diary of of someone who you're really curious about or you really care about or you're really infatuated with which is Frank ocean in a nutshell for the past several years people have been nothing but obsessed with and infatuated with Frank Ocean and have been nothing but waiting for this new record over here so in a lot of respects I think Frank not only pleased me and came out with what I think musically and lyrically and instrumentally is a great record but I think simultaneously pleased his fans and kind of gave them what they wanted it definitely impressed me I guess the only issue that wasn't an issue for me but something that I hope isn't an issue for other people is that I just kind of cross my fingers and hope that a lot of people didn't find the music too sleepy or too uneventful on this album because if you are a more patient listener I think you are going to find a lot of things to like about this project I'm feeling a decent a strong eight on this thing transition and there you have it my thoughts on the new Frank Ocean record great record definitely going to be a highlight of the year for me and yeah that's it guys what do you think about this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should have you next and that's it Anthony Fantana Frank Ocean forever 
rnFKFVmjKqk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly favorite tracks of the week segment where I recommend a bunch of tracks to you guys that caught my attention this past week that I thought were particularly good now per usual if you want to support this segment there is a link down there in the description box it is our Amazon Associates link anything you buy off Amazon if you live in the u.s. we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price use it to buy some you're going to buy anyway alright now also before we get into the fav tracks usually what I do in this segment is list out to you guys some tracks that I didn't like this week the worst tracks of the week segment now before we get into the worst of the worst there are always a couple tracks that I tell you guys that maybe I didn't like or I was kind of underwhelmed by a lot of you guys were asking me about this new Earl Sweatshirt and knowledge track balance it was a new Adult Swim single really one of the more underwhelming tracks I heard this week not the worst but it's just kind of like this one minute moment that is sort of unambitious and depressing as usual like Earl Sweatshirt songs tend to sound I don't know I just don't really have any feelings on it you know I mean it certainly sounds unhappy but there's not really much to it flow wise or instrumentally that I'm like wow this is this is a track man this is a track just really you know kind of indifferent toward it to be honest then some of you guys were asking me about the new Metallica cut hard wired I thought it was okay you know it's not terrible it's not great it's just kind of alright the band is really throwing things back to a more classic thrash sound and it just sounds okay some of the people who I saw reacting to it on Twitter we're saying the lyrics were cringy which I mean that's these are kind of like standard thrash lyrics for like the 80s and 90s and I don't know what the hell you're talking about you know they're edgy they're kind of dark they paint a negative portrait of the world I really don't expect anything else from a thrash song but whatever there you go so yeah I'm pretty indifferent toward that track no real feelings honestly it's not it's not great it's not terrible I certainly like it more than some Metallica's 90s and 2000's output it's passable that's what I could say about it and the new Pixies track talent was kind of passable too definitely not one of the worst tracks the band has put out since they kind of reformed and started releasing music again but I think they have a while to go before they're actually putting out some music that I'm actually entertained by once more now as far as the worst tracks this week got to give it to the new Touche amore track which featured Julian Baker this cut over here titled skyscraper to me a track that not only would I not want to hear from Touche amore but really any band in general is just kind of like this washed out bland overly reverb indie rock track that has no propulsion no guts not the intense sense of passion I usually get from a track from these guys that I usually enjoy from these guys usually like to listen into the lyrics too but those are kind of washed out with the reverb just not getting the appeal of this track especially given that it's coming from this band just kind of sounds like another faceless indie rock track that just uses too much effects but the worst track this week has to go to the new Crystal Castles song sadist which is one of many teaser tracks that have been leading up to the release of this new record which is out now none of which I've liked but this one kind of takes the cake not only because the vocals are so faint they're barely there it's kind of like a stowed away hidden away Alice glass impression a sense that are so rough and distorted and trying to be so goth it's like painfully edgy it's like kind of now that's what I call edgy edgy they're so ugly and distorted that it's like Ethan cath is just trying to force this dark mood into the track that's just really not there and and that's really all I have to say about the cut you know there's there's nothing really appealing to me too much about these new Crystal Castles tracks but I will sort of update you guys on that further as gear up to review the new full-length album which at which I am going to do so don't worry about that now as far as tracks I want to recommend to you guys this week we have a new cut with Kool Keith with MF DOOM the album that it's coming off of is titled feature magnetic the song is superhero and of course with Kool Keith and MF DOOM sort of borrowing a lot of their stick a lot of their gimmicks from comic books and from superhero and supervillain lore that track comes together very nicely moving on we have kha gritty New York rapper whose sound is typically very low-key very dark very moody does not disappoint on this new track over here delivers what he usually delivers with the same level of lyrical detail and storytelling and it's actually tagged with a really sad heartbreaking animated music video sort of showing this cycle of drug dealing committing crime going to jail family destroyed next generation repeats that process and so on and so on and so on it's again really kind of a tearjerker moving on from there we have dumbfoundead who just came out with a new track titled Harambee it's a fun fast hard plucky little freestyle no issues with that track really Danny Brown came out with one of the darkest most despaired and tortured tracks he's ever released in his whole career with the song pneumonia which features I think's like some ad-libs and some input from schoolboy q which is pretty cool Sun Kil moon I loved Portugal Mark kozilek comes back with a another very wordy track this one has a little bit of a political angle of course there's some funny and witty lyrics on this one he seems kind of like he's on a real tear with these new tracks like with that track that he did about Michael Jackson he was just really ripping into Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson fans and all that stuff and it seems like he's really taking no prisoners with this new set of tracks that could possibly be building up to a new record so again entertaining output from mr. kozilek there as usual Isaiah Rashad TDE member comes out with the new track I mean I'm liking these new singles they're not as laid-back they're not as chill they're not as glazed over they're not as forgettable as his past efforts he seems like he's more amped more energetic more in-your-face he's giving you a reason to listen to you to listen to him he's demanding your attention and I'm liking it you know and we're gonna end things off with a track from the Thrill Jockey discography a new record coming on the way from the group rec Meister harmonies some are saved some are drowned that's the name of the track it is a abrasive noise drone sludge hybrid that is going to melt your face off if you turn it up loud enough and there you go those are my tracks those are the songs I wanted to recommend to you this week those least favorite tracks avoid those if you can but trying out if you're morbidly curious and that's it guys alright also that Amazon Associates link again it is down there in the description box if you want to support this segment hit it up anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the US you eat kickback from it that's all I got to say alright this has been the favorite tracks of the week segment I appreciate you watching preciate you a pop pop a bless as Ethan over at h3h3 would say and we are going to leave you there hope you have a good rest of your weekend hope this coming week is good I'm going to review the Frank Ocean I'm going to review the Frank Ocean don't worry about I'm going to review the Frank Ocean I'm going to review the Frank Ocean I'm gonna I'm

uIooSLzxH-8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the didn't copy the name that time the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new oh C's record a weird exists is the latest full-length LP from prolific garage rock outfit VOCs when we last left the band their their previous record came out last year mutilator defeated at last pretty good easily one of their best records in a while in my opinion while the songwriting on this thing wasn't amazing the appeal of the album was centered more around jams than it was tunes and the jams on this thing were sweet they were spicy intense as well the production on this thing was leagues better than the production that had been on the band's last handful of albums which was maybe just a little too low Phi or low Phi in a way that didn't actually sound pleasurable to the ears my ears this record was a legitimately high-fidelity recording with a mix of clean and distorted sounds it wasn't just this non-stop brittle ear searing punishment it didn't feel like I was running a marathon over a bed of hot coals while I was being mercilessly shat on by seagulls so with the band heading in a good direction with their last LP with no hesitancy I tried this new record out and happy-happy Anthony it is a better record all the improvements of the last album are explored further on a weird exists now still the band is not really emphasizing songs here it's still more of a jams album it's about the performances is about the grooves about locking in that groove repeating it throwing tons of cool effects and sounds and musical embellishments on to that groove there are different vocal styles on this thing from quirky falsettos to very gruff animalistic screams raspy shouts fun and wild guitar performances that feature disgust II buzzy heavy chords and riffs too springy and wild psychedelic echoes the bass and drums sound good but not exactly you know vibrant I mean they're pretty plain but they do a good job of propelling all madness that happens on top of them this thing is just 40 minutes of noise site punk garage madness especially on the fastest and the heaviest tracks in the track listing here for one gelatinous cube hilariously gruff vocals on this track quick little funny guitar lick the verses are intense as hell and then it gets even crazier when they're swapped out with these fierce wild loud burning guitar leads it's a wild child of a track then we have the very fat and just thick and distorted ticklish warrior which is another highlight for me easily one of the most monstrous tracks this band has ever recorded I really love the loud soft dynamics of these tracks like on the song plastic plant the band has these very quiet funny falsettos on the verses which are very tensioned building and then all of a sudden we're getting these huge explosions of guitar very crunchy guitar chords cascading over one another with all this springy echo the performances and the recording just seems so live and in the moment and unpredictable the song jammed entrance is a supremely weird instrumental with these tense little keyboard of notes that sound like they're playing Morse code more than they are playing music the keys almost seem glitchy in a way another chill but swanky instrumental goes by on the song unwrap the fiend which I liked a lot and on the song crawl out from the fallout the band experiments with bringing some strings into the fold and they actually do well on this track it's a very chill and at this point very well earned spaced out session and the track listing here that I think kind of calms things down really well from the madness of the middle of the album and even though this track is really gentle it's just as colourful if not more colorful than all the tracks that preceded it with its very low-key lazy vocals and the wonderful string embellishments that while they are colorful and they are soft they're also kind of weird you know there is that subversive element to this instrumental here even though this is one of the softer and easier going cuts and the track listing here the band still manages to make it sound a little sour and a little unsettling a lot of flavorful layers on this thing and other than that there's not much else to this record I mean I have a few complaints I think the intro dead man's gun could have been longer seems like a sort of abrupt finish I think they could have jammed this track out a bit developed it just a touch more and then there is the closer the axis which I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with I dislike very much the stale very stale and very stiff keyboard chords and drum beat on this track though I do like the kind of goofy and tongue-in-cheek vocal delivery as well as the funny lyrics about not loving someone anymore it's just kind of so bitter and blunt in your face that it's funny but then after a while after the instrumental being as redundant as it is starts to eat away at my brain and make me contemplate just smashing my computer in the band introduces this guitar solo that gets progressively more distorted and noisy to the point where it is just like stuttering feedback and white noise that just overtakes the whole song and just envelops the whole instrumental and swallows it like a monster a very well-deserved destruction there you know there was just a point where it was like the band read my mind and said hey you know what let's just destroy this instrumental and yeah they really wrecked it I was like good good wreck that instrumental record really a hilarious way to end the song and the album itself you know I really used to like the OCS early output you know they have a good handful of records in their early discography that I fell in love with and there was a point where I just feel like they fell off a little bit not so much that I started to hate the band or anything like that but it started to seem to me that the group is really emphasizing quantity over quality when it came to their releases but now with this sort of sudden turnaround that they've made I've been really pleased with the output that the band has been delivering especially on this project over here I think this is the best album the OCS released in years not only that but it's a record that honestly lives up to the title so if you're looking for a solid and consistent garage rock album with fun instrumentals interesting sounds intense high-octane performances and a kind of strange personality then may sure you give this a shot don't let it slip through the cracks I'm feeling a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best so try to our next hit the like if you like please subscribe please no cry if you don't like my thoughts on this record vocs a weird exists forever 
dYPX3Y0XriU,hi everyone mr. Arab Spring here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Rae sremmurd record shrim life - Rae sremmurd they're not just the final words that you say when you succumb to the stroke that leaves you paralyzed from the waist down and financially ruins your family they're also a popular Atlanta rap duo who just dropped their second full-length LP now originally I didn't take the duo all that seriously when they broke with huge singles like no type and no flex zone songs that I thought were no good these singles of course led up to a pretty underwhelming album off this LP I was getting some serious crisscross vibes who I may add were also based in Atlanta when they were popular and were similarly marketed at the same hey these guys are really young but they're really popular and mainstream sort of angle I thought these guys would be like done in a year but they're they're back I mean the industry hasn't chewed them up and spit them out already so morbid curiosity got the best of me I decided to give this record a shot and I was honestly surprised surprised to hear that these guys were putting together some legitimately catchy pop rap with loads of production from mr. Mike will made it now I'm not saying this records a classic I'm not saying it's reinventing the wheel I'm not saying this is a smart album although you know it doesn't matter what I say I'm sure there's gonna be a comment down there saying hey hey you've rated this higher than blank-faced ah to boil it down this record is turn-up shit which in theory I don't dislike I think there's plenty of crappy turn up music out there that just absolutely sucks but this is some turn-up shit I can get down with even though they're not deep lyrics on this thing and really conceptual themes running throughout the album what I can commend Stremme life to on is that there are plenty of very energetic and charismatic vocal performances all over this thing the vocals come off a little less annoying this time around even though they are still kind of high-pitched and shouty and yell be still though the energy that goes into those I think is infectious a great deal of the time especially on tracks like shake it fast Oh shake it fast which features a hilariously graphic verse for mr. Juicy J himself I love the Bang & bass on this track the click-clack percussion it is a strip club anthem the duo also does well over a DJ mustard beat on the song set the roof which features a little bit of help from Little John himself I remember back in college I loved the shit out of that kings of crunk album I was blasting that thing everywhere all day I probably looked like a total loser and I guess I still do but whatever fuck it still with this that track was a little bit of a throwback and that was nice as the shouty multitrack gang vocals have a lot of energy the groove of course is funky it has that trademark little booboo little DJ mustard bassline and with the opening track on this thing yeah this album is a non-stop party it is a party that just does not let up it's throwing bottles everywhere it's flipping the furniture over it's climbing up the walls even low key tracks with deep nocturnal trap instrumentals are pretty engaging like on the song real chill with Kodak black which i think could have used a better chorus or by chance which I think has one of the better choruses on the entire record hundred bands in the land do you have one that chain and the tracks that feature sway lead doing these lead vocals which I didn't really care for on the last record sound eerie and kind of lonely here there's a weird sadness to them that I think is kind of appealing his little boy voice sounds so chilly amongst the smooth glossy synthesizers and Spacey trap percussion like on the song look alive or the song black beetles with Gucci Mane which I think has one of the most captivating choruses on the entire record which is a song essentially about blowing money fast because you're not planning on living too long I think there's references to like falling in love with strippers on this thing money raining slowly through the air it's a dreamy seductive track so again completely surprised to hear that nearly everything up until this point I had been really enjoying I've been enjoying myself listen to this record it's a fun album if you hate everything on this record you might not like fun I'm sorry I just find this record entertaining but at the last third this album turns into almost a complete bore the duo starts incorporating tracks that are total throw aways or take the album down a few emotional detours that are nowhere near as fulfilling as everything they've been doing up until this point namely the song do yoga total throwaway track no idea how it made the cut on the just normal version of the record especially since the bonus tracks on the deluxe version are all way better than this song there's a terrible lyric on this track about coming on to girls which was on the song came a long way the duo tries to turn their success story into a sub story and I don't know it's just not really all that captivating especially since the the allusions to their struggle and their come up just seem really vague and generic there's no real captivating specific details to kind of pull the listener in and make them interested in the background of Rae sremmurd the song now that I know is a really lackluster attempt at throwing an R&B jam into the record about relationship troubles I think this could have easily been one of the better pop rap records of the year but again the duo just does not pull through on the last third things go south pretty quickly almost immediately after the halfway point of the record but again up until that point a majority of the cuts on this album are fun to listen to it's an entertaining record don't go into this thing expecting anything huge anything ambitious it just features a lot of tight well-crafted bangers with some funny silly over-the-top lyrics that are all just written and delivered for a thrill and I would love to hear these guys continue bringing that vibe into the future and maybe if they decide to go down a more emotional route with some other tracks and the in the latter half of their next record hopefully they go into a bit more detail or have potentially gained the life experience needed in order to to make that kind of angle appealing or captivating I'm feeling a decent two strong six on strem life to transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best but should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're pissed off about my thoughts on this record because you thought I was too positive about it or I was too harsh on it you know you're always going to piss somebody off but whatever Rae sremmurd Sharma life to forever 
xmGcoPn08jg,it's still so hot it's still so hot I don't want it to be hot anymore hi everyone humid is the new hot Tanner here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new partynextdoor record p3 this is the latest full-length LP from Ontario singer songwriter producer partynextdoor one of Drake's flagship artists on his ever-growing ovo sound record label a record label that in the past I haven't been a big fan of I've been pretty vocal about not being a big fan of the output of the label as it continually releases these generic Airy moody bland alternative R&B records that are pretty wash rinse repeat all of which just copy and paste the same alternative R&B isms that originally came from the weekend or have already been on a Drake record maybe these artists helped Drake kind of forged these sounds but they end up on Drake's albums first which is the downside of being signed to a very popular contemporary artists now my last run-in with party next door's music wasn't exactly a positive one the the title of the album was to also the score I gave the album but party next door's popularity has continued to grow with this latest full-length LP and his influence on Drake's music in my opinion seems to be pretty huge especially in light of Drake's latest album views without a doubt party next door is the one who helped teach Drake his little fake patois accent that he puts on every once in a while despite the fact that he is about as Jamaican as haggis and a handful of the dancehall inspired tracks that are on this new partynextdoor record sound eerily similar to the dancehall tracks that were on views and while I do think party next doors talents shine brighter on this record than they did on the last album I still don't think he is the total package by himself he seems to be a capable producer on this album and he picks out some pretty decent instrumentals - he's pretty good at conjuring a mood on the album as well like on the track heigh-ho which in my opinion is a fantastic start to the project some gas rattle off right at the start of the song not really sure what that's bringing to the album but still it is a very moody nocturnal instrumental kind of unsettling especially when you read into the lyrics as partynextdoor is singing about checking up on this girl who he no longer seems to be with there's a stalker vibe to the track that might be unintentional but either way I think it kind of makes the song work the song nobody has some very pretty pitched vocal samples woven throughout the trap beat a lot of party and ex doors vocal harmonies multi-tracked vocal harmonies are very smooth and pleasant to listen to and partynextdoor gets kind of adventurous on the brown-skinned instrumental which has these really sour weird chord progressions that most artists in this genre would totally veer away from at first impression but he sings on top of this instrumental like a pro and it's not one of the worst tracks in the track listing here despite the fact that it kind of ruins the dark sexy mood that a lot of the tracks have brought up until this point I think the biggest instrumental misstep on the entire record probably comes on the song joy where the very synthetic 808 flavor drum Tambor's and the very lazy guitar arpeggios not only do they just not really complement one another aesthetically but there are points toward the end of the track where they don't even sync up tempo wise and they sound really sloppy and ugly plus the crescendo on the track at one point like audibly clips like everything was just way too saturated maybe not EQ properly I'm not sure it sounds like at some points this album was being mixed on headphones or something so while there are highlights on this thing the problem is that almost every track here starts off like a steamy bath but it all eventually gets colder and colder and colder and you just don't want to sit in it anymore at least if you're an attentive listener if you're the kind of person who listens to a track for the first 30 seconds and then lets it fall into the background as maybe you spend all day on Twitter or something then maybe you'll like this but for someone who pays attention to from the beginning to the end of it you're probably gonna notice a couple things you're gonna notice that partynextdoor is not really that great of a songwriter I mean he comes together with some cool melodic ideas and motifs here and there but he doesn't string them together with winning choruses and good bridges and strong endings a lot of the time the hooks just are our shades different from whatever the verse was doing a lot of the endings are pretty abrupt as well as partynextdoor fails to build out some of these tracks in any significant way like on the song spiteful where partynextdoor is just kind of spending a majority of the track vocalizing improvisationally over this instrumental and it's not like he's got the best voice on the block or anything where you can get away with that and stay engaging and then there are tracks on here that sound anemic and hollow like they don't really have that much beef or oomph to them which was kind of my issue with a lot of the cuts off of Drake's last record this is especially true of the dancehall inspired tracks on this thing the songs only you and not nice you're not know these tracks share so many similarities with cuts like one dance from Drake's last album and they are equally bland the verses are so sparse and have so little going on and the spotlight is mostly on the vocals and it's not like the lyrics are so fantastic that they're deserving of such a bear and open space which brings me to my next point and that's the party next door is not exactly a great lyricist in a way it's kind of like an Achilles heel to the record now I understand I wasn't going to this record expecting bars but I don't see why the lyrics on this record should be so bad at points that they're comedic like this corny little couplet over here which ends with a terrible Ice Cube reference or I ain't looking for no boo ain't no ghost Busta sent a message to my Instagram use a vegan but you goin ham or the premise of the track don't know how which is all about this girl who looks great obviously takes great pride in her appearance maybe dressing a little sexy and partynextdoor is saying to her well if you're gonna look like that you you better know how to and I get that he's saying hey you know you better be good at sex looking like that but the way that he phrases it it's almost as if like there might just be a possibility that she just doesn't know how sex works and you know human beings we've been doing it for for thousands millions of years at this point I think we got it down if we didn't have it down you there wouldn't be 16 and pregnant you know going out on a limb here just gonna guess that this track does not take place at some Christian abstinence camp and maybe at a club where the girl who is singing about is is likely to know how the sex works and the song problems and selfless may be the most hilarious track the track listing here where over and over partynextdoor is is he's singing but it doesn't really sound like he's singing something he wrote it sounds almost like he's just just talking off the dome and there happens to be like some kind of made-up improvised melody to it where he's just singing about these two women fighting over him and he hopes his son has this problem I don't get it is this like some narcissists internal monologue is like two women are fighting over him and then what's even funnier is the second half of the track where after just going on and on and on redundantly about these two women fighting over him he goes on about how this girl who he's singing about in his mind is is selfish and then this point in the track doesn't really connect to the previous point in the track and doesn't really develop all that significantly this song is essentially to have songs that just died out and there are moments on the cell P where partynextdoor is not really that much of a performer like on the song transparency where he barely sounds alive on his own song I don't understand this current day trend in contemporary rap and R&B where it's like popular to sound like you don't even have a pulse when you're on the mic I'm not saying you got to be ODB I'm not saying you got to be like Danny Brown or anything like that but like at least sound awake all that being said I did find this record to be an improvement on what partynextdoor did on his previous album I thought the production was better I thought there were a few captivating musical moments though the album generally was a little light on the writing side and you know some of these instrumentals were a little too hollow for my taste and I thought the record was certainly more instrumentally diverse than the previous party a Next Door album was I didn't exactly come away liking it but I guess I understand the hype a little bit more and can see this album taking off better than the previous partynextdoor record did because if you loved some of those dancehall tracks off of Drake's latest album and those have been some of his biggest hits in a while then you're gonna love the same tracks that pop up on here because they're just like carbon copies or just like the same exact formula rather maybe a party next doors next record has some meteor and more interesting writing and instrumentals it might actually wow me and obviously the lyrics will need a couple tweaks as well still though feeling a strong 4 to la-5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best through the best what should i review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're angry over my thoughts on this partynextdoor album you know definitely understand the likeability of this project a little bit more on this one but it's just it's not it's not for me yeah I gotta say it's a little too long too huh 
Pq3J2noL6tY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little Uzi vert tape the perfect love tape Lulu sievert is a Philly rapper recent double XL freshman I first covered him earlier this year off of his Luisi vert versus the world mixtape which I didn't really see much merit in much originality or much in the way of quality lyrics rapping songwriting some of the production was decent but that's really all I came away from the tape enjoying now of course my morbid curiosity got the best of me had to line myself up for a another musical beating on this new tape but Lulu sieverts buzz seems to continue to grow maybe I missed something on the previous tape and maybe the lack of originality that I heard is going to go away on this new project and he will have kind of come into his own on this one I mean I'm not certainly beyond liking the type of music that little Uzi vert makes I like a lot of the singles from young thug and future I certainly enjoyed little yachties little boat tape quite a bit so maybe little Uzi he's gonna come through with the solid project on this one with some good songs with some catchy tracks I don't know but of course I'm not going to review this new mixtape by myself I have invited the one the only mr. D respect check out is a YouTube channel lots of interesting think pieces on hip-hop and rap culture on there it's linked down there in the description and though we're going to shoot the shit over this new tape talked about its pros its cons and yeah just generally have a robust discussion the transition and heroin magic of the internet with my friend D respect we're going to be talking about this new little Uzi vert tape a part of the reason I invited D on to this review is that he recently released a video where I think he planted the seed of this idea I bought it yet planted the seed that will lose averts music video for the song money longer worse video of all time you know I'll leave these channel down there in the description box of course you can check that video out for your one of his more recent videos but we're not going to talk too much about that I just wanted to say that he's had this negative opinion this negative public opinion of a work of Aziz in the past and the recent past and I'm just gonna say I'm gonna guess go out on a limb and say this mixtape had to have changed your mind this mixtape had to change my mind yes he turned over a new leaf on Guzzi I've gotta test this mixtape because of this mixtape well I'll tell you one thing I wasn't expecting to like a song on the mixtape okay that's good as a story it's alright it's a start yeah I wasn't expecting like a song he's gonna he's winning you over one song at a time next tape two songs yeah next tape three years I'll go to a newsie concert problem yeah maybe he'll spit in my face by then so so you know usually we kind of get into the positives first in these collaborative reviews what is that one song that did appeal to you and why uh ghetto flowers but ghetto flowers whoa whoa that's one of my leisure tracks that was a treat for that reason yeah I figured it would and it's it's either a make it makes it or it breaks it and for me it it made it I don't know it works at the base it work it works with it I don't know why originally when I heard it I kind of felt it was a bit redundant but I think that's there's a valid point there yes how do you know it's it really comes down to the hook for me because the thing is this dude does not have verses he just does not have verses so if the hook isn't there then what's the point of the track and this song essentially as you're just saying is whoa whoa whoa whoa just over and over and over and it's like wow that's it that's your hook that's your your course here that's your big catchy refrain I mean I guess I remember it yeah say that much about it but I don't know what to say beyond that I mean okay so that's that's your positive it's like it's made for dabbing injuring a being just over and over again it just whoa whoa time repeat and it's an infinite dab yeah yeah so is there another positive take away from this tape for you another positive take away and again we go to the hooks erase your social media erase your social media there was something about there was something about the repetition of acid if I got a snapchat on me ain't got no snapchat I think it's sooo personal that's what I got to Terfel at one point he kind of had and I was like alright that's what I got a Twitter foe I felt it and again I could only get alone laughs I can only come another because as you said there are no persons mmm hey you know in a way it's it's not bad advice and it's probably one of the few moments on the tape if not the only moment where he's kind of making a funny observation or statement on sort of the now of how we socialize so I mean you can give him that if someone told you that little Ozzy had a song called eraser social media would you figure he would have at least like a two-bar a part of the song where he makes a solid commentary on how we're all alone and where would you've expected that no because I would not have really expected any focus on this project whatsoever okay though he does focus a little bit on one of one of my other least favorite tracks on the song year loss where he comes off a little heartbroken where he's rapping about how he misses this girl who I guess he used to be with which was kind of hard to listen to he really just kind of put himself out there in a really vulnerable way on this track that I thought was a little difficult to stomach I don't know if I don't know about you that was one of the one of the tracks there were four tracks on this album on this mixtape that I just didn't care for uh one of those was uh lost Alfa Romeo was one of them original four of us the opening track do what I want yeah it's also I but up into there I just do what I want is kind of just like t it he starts it off with and it works for his audience I suppose right it works for mom and dad if you could just start that sentence off however you want it Principal Skinner I do what I want into every bubble I do what I want like that speaks to the sense of it of his of his audience I guess but mm-hmm but I mean I guess I guess I sort of wonder what his audience is I mean I remember I saw not too not too long ago that video of him like at some summer festival and like all he's like all these like white chicks and bros or just like chasing him through the crowd because they just wanted to get like a picture with him or something on it was it just like coming to a festival crowd that obsesses over him I guess I guess it's my question yeah I I guess I it's one of those things where you're standing so next to fame maybe that's what it is oh you know what all right let's let's not assume that I mean what would really be if you were 15 year old Anthony and you listen to this mixtape and it opens up and says I do what I want your mother just sent you to your room and told you that you don't do what you want it's like oh yeah losing this mixtape could not have been edgy enough for me next out of it I probably would have been listening to some tire of the creator at age 15 alright if I was 15 now little Uzi vert would not have been edgy enough for 15 year old amp just just saying I'm just saying okay so I mean little Uzi vert you know personally my positive take away from this tape is that when I listen to his last project I kind of just swept little ez vert under the rug and cast him off as just kind of a mother trap crooner who to me sounded like just a few shades different from your futures and your young thug's and your little yachties and all that and I just kind of saw him in that Lane but not really separating himself in any kind of significant way and I think my positive take away on this tape is that I finally feel like I have a little bit more of a grasp of what a will lose averse song sounds Lakers supposed to sound like I mean for one his vocal inflection I think has got a little bored a little more distinct but only in ways that I find to be really obnoxious I mean for sure I think I could pick bullies avert out of line up now if I were to hear his voice like I have a series of features on the track yeah but the nasal tone and the blood la la la la la like delivery that he that he has when he's rapping which kind of has this weird awkward flatness to it is just just painful after a while I like to listen to and I can't stand it it just sounds so snotty and so annoyed um so you know it's definitely easier for me to sort of parse him out amongst his contemporaries but I feel like all the ways that he separated himself on this tape only further confirms my dislike for what he's doing you know at least future I enjoy his voice an artist like little yadi I could see quite a bit of humor in and young thug even though I do find him to be redundant sometimes I do find his delivery a little more melodic you know to listen to where his little yadi I was little maneuver rather it's just kind of cycling through the same nasal monotone inflections again and again and again on every track no matter what lyrics he's really saying you know occasionally he'll come through with a refrain that yeah I do what I want uh that maybe you can kind of see someone much younger than yourself getting into but outside of that he's just really not offering anything that I'm interested in on this one maybe you unless so in his last project you know I'm I find typically he hops onto beats that are maybe a little more ethereal and sunny than your average rapper but then again there are beats on here from like Metro boomin and Zaytoven this sound like instrumentals that they would do for just about any other rapper that they work with on the regular so sometimes in those instances he's not really doing them himself any favors in terms of defining this sound um that's just kind of my whole take on it honestly I find it a bit conflicting uh we're in a race here social media and this kind of brings a whole album full circuit when he says something like I don't want to be with that girl because that girl's with me because she knows I have cash on me doesn't that go against your hope because that's what you present you know there's there's so many there's so many times on this whole tape where he literally says things like I get money I get money I get money and I know I'm coming at it from a very I'm coming at this in terms of right like how that does it make sense whatsoever so what perception would anybody get from you other than you so he's full of contradictions just like POC man just like POC yeah just what when I think of contradictions I think of little Lucy and I clearly um we happy rappers are imperfect people they could be contradictory you know especially the best ones especially the best ones but again it's it's those rappers that constantly have their narrative straight those are the rappers that people forget over the years those are the rappers who you can't trust you know the PAC's and the little easy verts of the world people are going to look back at their lyrics would be like man he was such a he was just a double personality you know you just never knew which direction he was going to go in you know they live forever he also has this thing that he does and I've seen him do this on quite a few freestyles where I'm listening to it and I'm thinking like he does this thing where you know he closes his eyes a little bit he just sort of just mumbles what he has to say and it's almost like he's keeping it to himself and I think there are a few times what he sort of does that on a few songs and it's almost like he's developing this he's developing this thing that kind of irks me a bit cuz it's like I just fucking say it already just get off your fucking chest kid in a nutshell this to me is just like some crooner trap for somebody who prefers hair dye over like big gold chains or something you know um and and that's just kind of how it boils down for me you know as a little son heir and in sort of the same way that you pointed out in your video about money longer uh in a way I cookie tries to make it sound a little more sigh gelik and trippy um but it just doesn't really go far enough to really differentiate himself from his peers and really do something appealing beyond what a lot of his peers are doing you know to me he's just kind of another one of these trapped critters but with a more annoying voice and I mean that's kind of why this tape I think appeals to me maybe slightly less than his previous one mm-hmm well and well he walked away with at least the one and a half tracks for me also to walk away with a bit of dignity on that well I don't know I'm feeling like maybe a light two decent three on this tape I'm just not really coming away from it with much you know other than I like a few beats on here a few refrains are okay but I just really just like it to me just doesn't really have much in terms of delivery in terms of the inflection of his voice just really gets to me um is hook writing as well I could be super subpar I mean I'm not really going to come over here and like critique the do the lyrics all that deeply because I'm not I will keep doing deeply I mean you know that's that's a bit of a fool's errand and when all the things about this kind of music that are supposed to be appealing I just don't find appealing at all in his case transition and that's going to do it for this collaborative review of this new little hoozy vert tape I want to thank my buddy do you respect for coming on and talking with me about the tape appreciate his appearance I will leave a link to his YouTube channel down there in the description where you can check that out and yeah that's it that let me know if you disagree with my thoughts on this little luzie vert tape I'm sure you will if you're pissed at me but if you are that's that's fine too you don't got to think what I think I'm not making you think what I think okay all right everyone have a good one thanks for watching forever 
soU23fARkjI,hey everyone flim-flam tanno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another vital update where i show you guys the recent acquisitions that i've made that have gone into the vinyl collection over here although we do have a good handful of cassettes in this vinyl update so be on the lookout for that toward the end of the video so let's get into this handful of records that I have over here this first one was actually passed to me by a fan of the show through my P o box it is a group by the name of the Commons they are out on Berger records there seems to be just 500 copies of this thing so maybe they're still in circulation although I'm sure you could acquire this thing digitally and if you take a look at the front cover here not only will you notice that there is a rad little Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle riding on a wave going into the city some tidal wave I imagine or something but also we have a descriptor over here right under the band's name psychedelic cumbia Punk some pretty big labels there for people are familiar with these genres and I gotta say maybe I was a little disappointed when I actually got my ears on this thing it didn't seem so much Punk as it did like a garage a surf rock band because that's kind of what Punk passes for these days a lot of underground bands are kind of doing this surf rock thing it's a very cool little purple purple color let it get a little splatter in there too so it's more of a surf rock thing more of a beach rock thing and as far as the psychedelic element goes as psychedelic as this record gets the guitars are a little overly reverb II so they kind of bleed into everything else other than that I would say some of the tracks do most definitely have a Latin flavor though sometimes that comes sometimes that goes you know so don't expect every tract to have kind of the spicy latin vibe although it would seem at least from the first half of the ten inch here that all the lyrics are sung in that spaniel so you know they're they're definitely not you know trying to make an English record here you know there's definitely a Latin flavor at least to the degree of the language spoken on these tracks throughout the entire EP I like what the band is doing you know that there's definitely some interesting ideas here although sometimes it seems like there's this sort of amateurish vibe to it that I think kind of works against the enjoy ability of the EP like it's a little too messy like the performances aren't as tight as I would have liked them to be but still it's it's a relatively interesting little 10-inch and definitely not the sort of run-of-the-mill thing that you hear or expect from Burger records so there you go there's the first little release right there next one is one that I picked up in New York it was $1.00 it's an 80s rock classic and there are so many songs on it already that I know that I like you can't really go wrong with the boss mr. Bruce Springsteen himself dancing in the dark on this thing cover me is on this thing if you haven't heard this record do yourself a favor I mean it's an 80s rock classic there's not really a horrible song on it in my opinion nothing too flashy or impressive about the packaging because it seems like it's just kind of the original packaging and records like this are so cheap even if they are sort of a printed in the error that they were originally made in because they're just so many in circulation you know it's like you could probably run across a copy of this anywhere used in decent condition at your local record store so you know again if you do actually end up in that situation do yourself a favor pick this up because this is a good rock record you know very catchy songs passionate performances Bruce's vocals are great the lyrics are great and also you know it's it's a very distinctly American record and I don't just mean like it's blindly patriotic like a lot of American records today tend to be you know it's obviously inspired and in love with the country that it comes from but on songs like born in the USA there's an element of critique there too so there you go born in the USA Bruce Springsteen East Street Band whoo all right um this is me on this next one essentially trying to expand my Dylan collection over here although maybe not coming out as pleased as I hoped I would be you know I've heard many people hype up the basement tapes again and again and again and again you got to hear the basement tapes you got out in the basement tapes it's kind of like an essential Dylan record although I'm not as enamored with it to be completely honest the performances I thought were maybe a little too rough Bob Dylan's vocals his vocal performances really not his best but it is in good condition you know the records are in great condition the jackets a little beat up but you know it sounds good you know if you're really trying to hear Bob Dylan in the raw here and you are Dylan completest I see no reason not to pick this up you know there are at least some decent tracks on it but you know don't expect to come out of this thing as wowed as you would be with like a highway 61 revisited or something like that you know so uh so yeah you know and again Dylan's are great so it's sort of to be expected that you're going to run across people that are like oh yeah that Dylan record is great that Dylan records great every Dylan record is great but you know I guess I'm just a little too picky sometimes as you guys already know but not too picky to keep this thing because again there are highlights on here it does give you assuming your Dylan fan an opportunity to hear him in a different light hear him in a different sort of frame of reference and you know again a lot of his records in the 70s and especially the 80s weren't necessarily as raw or stripped-down or as wild or as funky as his earlier output in the 60s so you know it's kind of interesting for him to kind of go back a little bit on this record and do something you know a little a little more on the fringe so uh so yeah Basement Tapes over here this next one is going to be a quick one because I don't think I'm going to open it it's just Kendrick Lamar's untitled unmastered and you can see the reflection like of the camera in the in the in the vinyl because it's still wrapped up and as you may notice it is signed it is a signed copy it's a squiggled copy yeah I don't I don't think I'm going to open this thing I think I'm just going to leave it closed you know I know how it sounds it's a demos album so I'm not really sure that hearing it on vinyl is going to sort of enhance the experience of the record and I just want to preserve this as much as I can because it's signed so I'm not going to open this it's not it's not going to be open I'm just showing you guys that I got a signed copy because I was I was in on sort of that early run of signed copies that Kendrick was selling off of his website so it's got a squiggle got a squiggle and I actually bought another copy sign for a giveaway that I mentioned at the beginning of this video assuming that the bumper 4 is still there and that squiggle is different so he's really squiggling each one so I'm not gonna open this one I'm sorry guys that bully me this is not something I typically do as you guys already know from seeing pretty much all of my vinyl videos thus far if you have I open my  and I listen to my and you know I handle it I show you guys but this is just one this is just one you know instance where I'm not I'm not going to do that I'm just going to leave it it's just going to just going to stay not gonna not going to mess with it just gonna leave it there it can stay there and there it will stay alright moving on we have a couple more Kraftwerk Autobahn classic piece of electronic music over here if you're not familiar with these guys and you're into electronic music or you want to know more about the history of electron music you got to listen to craft work and you know especially this track over here fun-fun-fun on the Autobahn fun-fun-fun on the Autobahn 22 minute epic right there back in the day when electronic music was stripped back long-winded and patience testing but also fun and sort of creative in definitely uh pushing the envelope for the time very cool labeling over here I wanted to point this out sort of the the what looks like UFOs over here very cool I like that a lot you know it's just a very pretty label you know plays a 33 and a third it's a it's an older copy but it's in pristine condition as far as the Koala the the the record goes so I was really happy about that plays great sounds fantastic and you know again just adding to my crap for collection over here I have several records from the group already so it was and this is another one of their sort of classics their essentials so I'm not sure how much further I have to go before I have all the albums of theirs that I want but I think I'm almost there alright uh few more this one you guys know that i pre-ordered this this is pre organ of course pre-ordered this the BAM it's a gatefold although the in insert art I'm not really that enamored with I'm not sure exactly what's going on here kind of confused by the by the whole thing you know obviously this is the back cover which you guys have seen if you've seen the album are online and we do have an exclusive color here because i guess i pre-ordered it over here we have the lyric sheet three bedrooms a new boo boo boo sorry I'm just looking at this in the camera make sure I'm framing it correctly so please excuse me if my eyes divert from the lens a little bit and the record over here is a pretty somewhat clear yellow so it matches the the yellowy I guess sort of a tone and hue of the binder over here so it's it's a nicely put together package good job Death Grips you know you put together a nice little gate fold over here I suppose their previous records I think this might be their first gate fold no okay so the powers that be was a gate fold obviously because that's a double album but this is a single album over here all their others have just kind of been in sleeves and stuff like that so you know we have another Death Grips gate fold over here and enjoying that and sort of seeing this picture clear it's really no less confusing it's still confusing front cover okay we are going to get into some of the cassette releases over here that I have been past first I just want to give a shout out to dream catalog who actually passed me some of the cassettes over here along with a vinyl copy of the new 281 for record a rain Temple you guys may know that I've already reviewed this not too long ago wasn't too crazy about it but they actually put together a really nice vinyl package on this thing I know they usually put together good cassette packages but the vinyl package on this thing is great nice matte finish on the cover not some crappy shiny cheap finish it's a wonderful gatefold over here with liner notes and the classy song titles listed and everything and the double record is self is kind of a really milky off-white color with some you know like little purple notes kind of thrown into there if you noticed it's very very subtle i it may vary from record to record you know some records might have a little bit more extra sort of colors worked into there but uh but yeah just kind of like a milky opaque kind of color with a clear sleeve again they put together a good package on this thing so if you're in love with this record I highly recommend getting this on vinyl because again good packaging good package so you won't be disappointed with the look and I don't know if train catalog has dabbled that often before in vinyl this might be their first vinyl not totally sure but if it is the for kind of first go they did a great job but again not too surprising given how much effort they continue to put into their cassettes and how good and quality they always turn out to be now the cassettes that they passed along a handful of artists over here Shema 33 here's the cover over here and this is most definitely on the more ambient side of the dream catalog spectrum there is a liner note in here where the artist is talking about how great care when the compositions of this tape and it definitely shows you know while the music on this thing is soft and it's subtle it does progress nicely from point A to point B it doesn't stagnate for too long or anything like that and it's very soft it's very pretty it's very relaxing it has kind of that Spacey retro futuristic synth patch sound aesthetic that you expect for most Stream catalog releases and yeah it's a very nice little black cassette over here and yeah there you go alright moving on a couple more from these guys we have this next one I am chess sumac Masuda chassis Matsuda chassis Matsuda chassis Masuda okay this one is less ambient more on the progressive since side of the spectrum some kind of weird experimental auto-tune vocal passages that kind of reminded me of some music from the latest one at Rick's point never album garden of delete if you're looking for something that again has the same kind of Spacey retro futuristic synth sound that most stream catalog records do but it's a little more meaty and experimental I heard some like guitar leads on this thing like distorted buzzing guitar leads a dream catalog really diversifying with some of their new releases and bringing on some cool ambient artists and experimental electronic music artists we're really trying to do something different you know it's not just another you know micro house record it's not just another techno record word these guys are really doing some odd stuff with electronic music you know with home produced music and you know I think they deserve some props for that for sure and finally uh Wolfenstein over here putting together a interesting album over here the the Brazil World Cup 20:34 and oh I want to actually say this is a really cool red cassette the chess Amata cassette very cool red cassette they put together nice cassettes good job guys also Wolfenstein over here with the beautiful little green cassette over here with the up with kind of like the the the Brazil stickers over here you know he really went into this concept and and just came out flying colors I would say this is most definitely one of the weirdest and the medius albums I've heard on dream catalogue records he's like mixing those spacey synthesizers with elements of dance music with elements of Latin music and yet there's also something kind of I don't know apocalyptic about it as well like it's kind of dreary - it's an odd release from dream catalog and Wolfenstein I give him all the credit in the world there W OSX as he is sort of credited here all the credit in the world for sort of coming together with such a creative mix of sounds and influences on this thing I got past this next cassette from either the band or maybe someone who's a fan of the band they also sent me like a few download cards for stuff like Pig destroy or something which was actually pretty nice of them the name of this group abated massive flesh and the name of this tape is brutal death let me give you kind of a look as to what's going on here this guy's like crucified the bands logo almost completely unreadable obviously and this is some very nasty like death grind kind of stuff it's very noisy it's blood caked it's filthy and listening to this thing on cassette while it's not exactly poetry the way that it's composed kind of like Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen uh you know with the occasional like wow my guitar lead thrown in there in between all the chugs they're obviously like a duo it sounds like as you're mostly just hearing vocals single guitar or almost and just like you know really fast brutal drums and listening this thing I could set really makes me appreciate the importance of the medium that you're listening to something on music like this thrived on the cassette medium in the 80s and the 90s as tape trading for this extreme type of metal music which was hard to come by a lot of the time because it wasn't on big labels or it wasn't on a whole lot of labels and the labels that it was on it didn't get printed in a whole lot of copies so again stuff like this thrived on cassette and it sounds great on set because the brittle crappy distorted guitars the cassette kind of takes the edge off of those a little bit it's kind of blends the guitars with the drums makes everything sound a little fatter bigger heftier nastier so you know just kind of the beauty of this stuff of this kind of music even when it's kind of rough and amateurish and in the way that this is I think it's kind of lost in the digital age a little bit and just you know if you get a chance to hear either this cassette or a cassette in the same genre you know it may sort of ring in a different way to your ears because again of the platform of the medium that it's being played off of and a couple more cassettes over here that I'm just going to kind of mention in one group this person sent these to my p.o box premium escape is the name of this artist or premium ESC and this guy is pretty much embracing every vaporwave cliche in the book not just visually but also musically as well you know it sounds like you're getting a lot of the the contemporary R&B samples slowed down sort of the the the contemporary jazz kind of stuff but even though again it's sort of like every vaporwave cliche I've ever heard including like you know there's like this small sort of picture over here you know just like all the pictures of like this 2000s era culture like late 90s culture it's like oh hey look at this computer this weird digital desktop space or whatever the dude seems to have put like quite a bit of effort into like the labeling on the cassettes because there's cool stickers on every cassette and as far as like vaporwave cliches go it's not too bad you know like the sampling is cool it's like wavy and catchy and it's sweet on the ears and it's most definitely has an alluring vibe to it so Premium ESC you know one of them has named habitats the other one is titled domestication the other one sort of seems to be a self-titled I can't quite tell but I'm going to keep these because you know they're cool little artifacts from the the vaporwave era and yeah I'm just going to leave it at that this has been this vinyl update guys I appreciate you watching hanging out with me watching me just kind of finger through some of the new releases that I've gotten my paws on probably have more a little more vinyl in the next one you know I just had all these cassettes kind of piling up and I would just wanted to give them all a shout-out in this episode because some of them were were interesting to me so and I plan on giving them a little more attention as the week's come on and I get a little bit more free time because I do have cassette deck now and I can't listen to these cassettes and you know especially some of these dream catalogue cassettes it seems like the labels really kind of diversifying and trying some new things and you know embracing the artistic desires of some of the artists on their label who are clearly you know trying something different than your average vaporwave artists or a lot of artists who you could call vaporwave who the label is putting out releases from early on alright guys you're the best transition that has been another vinyl update guys I appreciate you watching means a lot there are links on this screen right now you can subscribe to this channel you can check out our official site you can check out the previous vinyl update you can check out the playlist of vinyl updates that we have which have compiled over the years which you can essentially watch the progression of my whole record collection through those videos and yeah that's it guys alright have a good one hope you will stay hydrated eat those fruits and veggies listen to some music that you like forever 
L7J8eLUYWaA,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our favorite tracks the week segment we're down there in the description box I recommend to you guys a bunch of tracks I heard this past week that I thought were great that I thought were worth your time if you want to support this segment hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description anything you buy on amazon if you live in the US after you click that link we get kickback from it doesn't that add to your overall price does not add to your overall price I repeat alright and before we get into the favorite tracks of course like usual we need to get into the worst tracks with a weak segment of this video where I tell you guys what are some of the worst tracks I heard this week maybe to the dismay of some of you but I'm sure to the lack of shock of most of you don't really care for the new Green Day track bang bang honestly I haven't liked a green day record since Nimrod so I mean the fact that this new track over here it's not terrible it just sounds kind of generic you know it's not the worst track of the week that's all I'm saying you know I'm just kind of indifferent toward this new Green Day cut you know it's definitely not as bad as the new Bayside single you know we can say that at least I will here the new Green Day album I am mildly curious but it's been a while since I've enjoyed a Green Day record so I don't really know what I'm expecting you know that's that's really all I got to say you know to me American Idiot was like mainstream punks death rattle so the idea that Green Day is going to come out with a record in 2016 that's gonna blow me away it's just not I just don't think it's probable but I don't know I'm going to give the record a try when it drops and this new single over here it's not exactly you know pointing north I guess you could say really disappointed with the new banks and steals track this new paul banks and RZA collaboration is not looking good there's a lyric on this track where he raps about how he doesn't make art for the salary despite that he got all that money from Martin chick rally for that route an album that there's a single copy of we have a track from Kati Goodman and Greta Morgan they are doing a punk covers album and this new song over here a cover of The Misfits where Eagles dare a misfits cover that I don't think any misfits fan ever really wanted I don't see the points in covering all these punk songs in the sleepy dreamy drab kind of Beach rock renditions there's nothing really appealing about this revision of this classic and great Punk song in my opinion the only good things about the track are things that you can solely attribute to the original songwriting of the song beyond that we have a new track from m.i.a whose recent singles have been getting more and more drab more and more lackluster this new one over here is really nothing different and then finally ending things out with what is truly the worst track of the week I don't think it came out this week but I certainly heard it this week and it left a pretty big impact on me the band wack rat who is fronted by a former Rage Against the Machine bassist and this song is titled generation fucked and I guess the only way I could put it into words is that this song is the musical equivalent to a wake up sheeple we're just going to leave it at that because the lyrics are so cringy they are so edgy and the kind of metallic new metal groove metal thing going on in the instrumental is not refreshing at all productions pretty lackluster on this thing so we're gonna leave it at that worst tracks of the week worst tracks that was the worst track all right let's uh recommend some tracks to you guys that I think are worthwhile let's you know move away from the depressing stuff for a second okay okay all right take a breather ah pretty good mood now but alright kicking things off new track from The Dillinger Escape Plan I don't think I mentioned this track the previous week when I should have but these guys unfortunately have announced they're going to be breaking up however the good news is that they're coming out with one more album and this new track over here that they have put out Limor int death is of course chaotic it's heavy intense math metal that's going to melt your brain I would expect no less from these guys it just kind of sounds like they're doing what they would normally do at the high quality standard that they normally wit moving on from there Kyle Kraft before the wall this is a great little folk tune that I heard that I think came out via Sub Pop Records this week this dude has just some really hard aggressive and I guess energetic guitar strumming on here and a great vocal delivery that kind of reminds me of like early Dylan during his more acoustic and politically charged days but not the same you know he's not like just some Dylan ripoff or something he just got a great solid socially-conscious folk ster aesthetic that I like a lot moving on from there uh sure no limit with young thug uh sure puts out yet another solid single and I'm just kind of waiting for the album here you know it's some good commercial R&B you know it's not it to me as stimulating as some of the artsy or more left-field stuff that's experimental and adventurous but for commercial R&B standards I think what he's putting out with these recent singles is pretty good so again I'm just kind of waiting for the record and young thug's appearance on the track was energetic was peppy brought the track a lot of color so no complaints about that moving on slaves would spit it out these guys are UK punk band that I was kind of underwhelmed with the wrath with their last record but they at least had a couple good singles and maybe this new record over here will be good for at least that this new song over here is raw it's fast it's snotty it's nasty it's disgusting it's got an attitude to it just like some good punk from the UK should moving on from there regina spektor with small bills regina spektor comes through with a good single here one of her most poetically punchy songs in a long time the instrumental I think could use a little bit more variation but I think her words on this track are really what bring the song home and really what bring the track a great appeal her words are really witty and beautiful a lot of the time and you know reminds me a lot of her old stuff so you know if you're more into the older more energetic more poetic and more in-your-face Regina Spektor from her early days and I think you're going to like this one moving on from there we have a couple more we have Sabrosa which is a wound of the warden which is a really good kind of doom metal track with some arranged instrumentation which they're kind of know for a van called warthog with a song culture which is an incredibly raw Punk track that I was surprised to come across this week these guys I want to hear more from them so I'm going to be looking out for whatever album they're going to be dropping also an artist who I heard about this week who I want to hear more from a fellow by the name of rich chigga and he is a rapper I'm not even going to go into what I think chigga means because I'll probably get in trouble but it is a catchy pop rap song and he's got a hella deep voice and some pretty clever lyrics and a very skeletal but grooving instrumental um this guy's got a lot of charisma and I think he sounds great on the mic so I don't really know what else to say other than that I'm just looking forward to hearing more from this dude rounding things out with the witches the punk garage psych rock outfit from Australia who came out with a great record a couple years ago whose new album I am anticipating greatly they have a new song out titled seaside that you have to check out if you're into that stuff and finally Isaiah Rashad of Top Dawg entertainment has a new track out titled free lunch a guy whose delivery and whose tracks I usually find slightly underwhelming actually comes through with a kind of upbeat and energetic performance on this new track so maybe with a little bit more gusto and oomph he could actually wow me though I'm sure hardcore fans of his stuff so far will enjoy this track and what he has coming out in the future you know I find him kind of mild personally but if you have liked him up until this point you're probably just going to find this track to be a little bit more entertaining and bold I mean in my opinion definitely one of his better singles so yeah that's it those are all the tracks I wanted to recommend to you guys this week again hit up that Amazon Associates link down there in the description if you want to support this segment and try to avoid the worst tracks of the week at all costs just check out these good tracks just check out these tracks that are that are great now I actually never mind check out the tracks that I dislike you know form your own opinion that's all I'm saying alright have a good one eat some fruits and veggies stay hydrated forever 
AUwW8P_BwEY,hi everyone Nothe nee reviewed tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most hellish painful deadly segment on this channel the why you know review where I go over a bunch of Records that came out not too long ago and because I didn't get a chance to review them in full I go over them in brief gauntlet style here so let's get started this is the latest LP from this experimental music duo and I was anticipating it because I thought their last record was a little bit of a snoozer thankfully this new one is heavier it's a little harder but I'm not sure if I'm liking the stylistic shift that the duo made here it's almost as if they're dipping their toes into emo a little bit on this thing while they continue to make this very dark heavy noisy brooding music it's almost like industrial emo at points and on paper I have to say I do think that that fusion of influences is pretty interesting but still I'm not crazy about the production on this thing I do think there are tracks that could have been a little bit more abrasive I get that these guys don't want to continue to just try to be that weird experimental black metal duo and I get that you know they don't need to continue to pull from that in order to continue to be an interesting music project but still was hoping for something a little bit heavier a little bit meaner a little bit gruffer and also on top of that some of the musical arrangements on this thing wasn't really feeling them all too much you know some of the synth arpeggios and chord progressions just we're a little flat to me still though if you're looking for something depressing bleak textured and experimental look this thing up disappointment island indeed did it that did it I gave this album several shots and I have to say each time it came away from it I just didn't feel anything this is just one of the blandest records I think is in this band's discography you know it's not terrible but it's not great either the songwriting is just so wishy-washy and just just so Gojira I mean I guess the band is sort of playing to their own cliches at this point and doing it so well and just kind of feeding into their own blueprint so so cleanly that there's nothing really that stands out about this record to me you know I think hardcore fans will probably like it because it's more of what they've come to expect but the band is just not pushing themselves at all from what I can hear on this new LP these guys are a Korean experimental rock and post-rock outfit who I found out about a couple of years ago really impressed with their last full-length LP that I thought was pretty decent some very interesting Asian instrumentation worked into these post-rock arrangements into these experimental rock songs on this new LP though I can't quite put my finger on it just not as enthralled by it but I figure I would mention the band in this segment because they do have a new album out if you are looking to try to break down that wall of you know just western music hitting your ears all the time and you want to hear something from outside the West then give this thing a shot because if you're looking for an interesting rock band that does not come from the UK US or some english-speaking country these guys are definitely worth your time especially if you give that previous record a shot but if you haven't heard that previous record maybe this new one over here will value a little bit more you know to me it just kind of felt like more of the same but it's not quite as bold of any way give these guys a shot look this album up I believe this is released in the US so these guys are getting a little bit more play over here so maybe that means they could potentially grow an audience over here in the future not totally sure but again if you're looking for some experimental rock if you're looking for a post rock album from a band that you might not have heard of yet that is outside the US then give this thing a shot this new metronomy record I was expecting something fun snappy funky something I was going to get me up out of my seat something catchy well written sharp fun vocals incredible lyrics but I just didn't really get any of that you know this this album is just so unspectacular in every way shape and form there's just nothing memorable about this record to me you know I mean even though the band's last record love-letters had some really terrible muddy and messy production on the deep cuts at least songs like love letters were like good singles to me this record didn't even have a single to stand on in my opinion there's just nothing really to this album for me it's just not really that fun or engaging of a record considering the styles of music that that Metronomy pulls from pop music dance music I mean shouldn't this stuff be instantaneous and and fun and stick to your mind the moment you hear it the none of this is really leaving an impression on me these guys are a pretty significant experimental rock band and they have put out a very synth centric record this time around that has its moments but overall I'm just not really seeing the appeal of this change in direction that the band is going in with this one the sense from what I can hear do not refresh the band's sound in any way it's not like the synth sounds or the synth patches are amazing or manipulated or played with in such a way that they sound like mind-blowing it's not like the synth playing is is mind-blowing also the scents are so prominent in the mix on some of these tracks they drown out other musical details in these songs whether it be the guitars or the drums or the singing and the lyrics and again these scents aren't so interesting that I think they're worthy of such a prominent place in the mix again I understand Toby's need to kind of always push Ko dot into some different territory always try something new he's a musical adventure he's a tinkerer and that's why I'm just always going to try to give whatever he does next a shot even if what he's currently doing isn't really like blowing me away ty Segall Charles moot Hart and Chris Shaw formed together into a new band put out a new record and if you're familiar with the work these guys have put out in the past you could probably guess very safely what kind of music they're going to be writing on this album you know it's going to be garage or it's going to be punk or it's going to be psych where it's going to be low Phi or it's going to be some mixture of the four and this thing is pretty much some garage punk all these guys respectively prolific is hell and as a result not everything they put out is a hit not everything they put out is the greatest thing they've ever done obviously they all have their moments every once in a while and it's clearly as a result of their work ethic you know but just all the stuff they put out not all of it is amazing I mean I think the production on this thing is saturated it's distorted it's heavy as hell some of the riffs on this thing are mean as  they are like junkyard dog riffs they're like Kimbo Slice punching you in the face until your head is essentially tuna-salad riffs but the songwriting is just okay the vocals are kind of generic though they are a little gruff and shouty you know they definitely match the aggression and the adrenaline of the guitars it's okay you know it's not really all that unique but it is a pretty fun and exhilarating exercise and yeah oh yeah this one makes him on a booogy booogy booogy booogy booogy booogy my way over to the pause button to pause this thing this album is like some of the most obnoxious electro house I've ever heard in my life it's so abrasive it's so off-kilter the lead vocals the guest vocalists on this thing are all terrible and even when they do manage to pull together an interesting beat there are some odd wailing just out of place synthesizers or just sound effects or just I don't know noises that are just looped into these beats and it's not even really in a way where when I hear it I think whoa these guys are really submerging the whole electro house formula they're tearing this electro house apart they're running in that electro house they're flipping all that electro furniture on its dönitz head and they're smashing those electro dishes on the electro floor rather than sounding really adventurous and games in the genre and Lord knows that electro/house could use a refresher instead Mastercraft is about as appealing as a car alarm going off outside your bedroom window at 3 a.m. can I just feel like this is just a wee bit drab without someone coming up to remind me that it's not another introducing I know it's not another introducing I don't think DJ shadows ever going to come out with another introducing and even if he did it wouldn't be good because introducing is introducing I don't need him to put out the same album twice could it just be possible that the song three Ralph's is really boring or that on the song depth charge DJ shadow isn't exactly playing to his strengths and that the run the jewels and Ernie fresh tracks are like the only two memorable moments from this thing this is kind of one of those weird collaborations where occasionally it sounds like one person is taking lead and occasionally it sounds like the other person's taking the lead you know it's it's it's like we're hearing a bunch of Les Claypool songs but they're accented with some wild wailing sean lennon guitars or we're hearing a little sean lennon song but with some kind of trebly wonky blood les claypool bassline that really could have been a lot warmer and smoother you know there's a reason that this kind of bass tone doesn't exactly sell itself to a psyche rock a psych pop sound put les claypool with an electric bass on almost any song and he's still going to be doing his usual little les claypool jig and that's fine that's what his fans sort of come to hear I just think there's some moments where this collaboration doesn't quite work there's some decent tracks on this thing though I think mostly the songs were less takes the lead and Sean complements what he's doing but that's just my opinion it's not exactly an exciting marriage I think this collaboration is more exciting in name than it is in practice yeah that's really all I have to say about it and that has been this relatively pain-free episode of the why you know review thank you for watching I appreciate you sitting down powwow and with me and listening to be

Anthony Fantana why you no review forever 
G0S8teWZy3U,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and gonna do a quick review today of the new JPEG mafia and freaky collaborative EP the Second Amendment Baltimore experimental rapper and producer jpg mafia aka Peggy aka the black Ben Carson he has only been active under this name for a few years and already has a few pretty lengthy sizeable projects under his belt like communist slow jams and of course black Ben Carson and dark skinned Manson previously I've been pretty indifferent toward his projects because of a few little shortcomings I found them to be kind of long-winded unnecessarily long really and also all of the obvious attempts at being super edgy coming off in the lyrics were a little bit of a turn-off though the production was really noisy and textured I certainly like that in a way this new EP over here is kind of business as usual for JPG mafia I mean it's an EP but it's 12 tracks long and all these songs span an hour in length and also you will catch supremely edgy moments in the lyrics like on the song trust me daddy where Peggy does a little lyrical nod to the Dallas shooter a reference that I think some listeners will probably think is too soon and their cuts on here I would blatantly classify as filler like the song big data which is probably the most useless track in the tracklisting year with it's horrible clunky instrumental that doesn't even sound that good and lyrics that really aren't making much of any kind of point I think the songs lack of appeal as a song is pretty much the reason why JPEG mafia included it in this mixtape it's such an on song and yet it lasts so long what made this EP stand out to me though and made me want to talk about it is that not only is there a pretty interesting hemlock earnst appearance on this thing free Keyes contributions to the tape are pretty decent and also there are some standout tracks on here that I guess I could call singles in a way I love the hit a lick on a Whitehouse track that songs a dirty grimy glitchy banger then we have I might vote for Donald Trump I guess another attempt at being edgy but still a very sharp and humorous track in the tracklisting here I also love the jazzy horn samples and the trap percussion on the song ranked e2k that's kind of a loaf I very dirty instrumental on that cut that song while I do like it this song and many others on here very rarely do you get a straightforward direct very well groomed track and the track listening here many of the songs are five and six minutes and not because they're super progressive or it really just takes jpg mafia to get a song out in that length rather these tracks are padded out with weird instrumental interludes that are only sounding interesting vocal snippets and sort of weird samples and found sound that are okay though some of them do kind of drive the political point home of this tape and whatever song that the the snippet happens to be landing on I do occasionally find Peggy's rap style to be a little bland kind of unenthusiastic he has this demeanor about him that reminds me of these somewhat monotone west coast rappers who feel like they're too cool to actually like the moat anything still though there are people who enjoy that style a lot more than I do and so I can commend a lot of the lyrics on this thing for being pretty raw and well-traveled and loaded with some interesting references overall it's an admirable EP it has some good production has some standout tracks though it is pretty messy and unkempt and unfocused and I would like to hear JPG mafia put out something a little more succinct in the future I guess but those are my thoughts on this project what did you think of this tape if you've heard it there's a lot of hate of why whatever dust and that's it Anthony Fantan oh jpg mafia forever 
amGvfPpr5go,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd doing a couple quick reviews today one of them obviously being this video is on the new dinosaur jr. record give a glimpse of what you're not 90s indie and alternative rock outfit dinosaur jr. they're back doing exactly what they're known for for another full-length record and you can't really fault them for being stuck in their ways I mean dinosaur jr. helped originate a sound in the 90s that countless underground bands right now that are way less talented are shamelessly trying to rip off with one song after another all dinosaur jr. does there needs to do rather in order to stay relevant and keep people's attention is just be themselves I guess now this new record over here it's a pretty sweet little album it is a change of pace from their last full-length LP the kind of clean and mellow I bet on sky it's more distorted its rougher it's more textured I wouldn't blatantly call it lo-fi but it certainly seems to embody the era of music that dinosaur jr. came from a bit more than their past couple of Records which you know their past couple of records are pretty good you know it's it's great that the band was able to clean up their sound and modernize and still stay relevant still put out some interesting music but now on this one over here seems like they're thrown back a little bit to a dirtier sound that older fans might be an assaulted for at this point a lot of the guitar tones on this thing are pretty cool the mix I think is kind of muddy but it's a bit of a trade-off because all the performances sound really live and in the moment I think my main issue with the record though is that the songwriting is kind of breezy it's almost like Dinosaur Jr is kind of on autopilot or they're just kind of working against their usual blueprint with these songs you know there's not really anything tune wise that's really standing out to me the sound of the record is pleasant enough just to kind of have on in the background but there's nothing that memorable about the tunes aside from a couple here and there that stick out like be very fast peppy and catchy good to know as well as the cut be a poet which is painfully sad overall this record is more of the same from dinosaur jr. and that could be a good or a boring thing depending on who you are people who have been waiting for the ban to evolve past their 2000s output might be disappointed by how not refreshing this record is people who have never really enjoyed dinosaur jr. in the past probably not going to be won over with this record but hardcore fans that just can't get enough of what dinosaur jr. do will surely find some enjoyable tracks on this thing and those are my thoughts on this dinosaur jr. record let me know what you thought of it down in the comments below did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana dinosaur jr. forever 
S8BpvVYuqgk,ah hi everyone know that he named Shanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new no-name mixtape Ted a bone did it did a PO no-name who I've also seen credited as no-name gypsy in the past is a Chicago rapper who made some waves in 2013 with an appearance on chance the rapper's hit mixtape acid rap now given that that was chances big breakout tape it didn't give no-name a whole lot of room to steal the show but as the years went on she started to make more appearances on more chance the rapper projects also appeared on a few albums from fellow Chicago artists like Mick Jenkins as well as Jessi Boykins the third and even though I've heard her around and I've been aware of her as a rapper I have to admit I've never really came away from a no-name verse like damn that was verse there were some bars and in a way maybe that's kind of by design not that I think no-name tries to sound boring but her features lack the overblown put on they usually come out to play once a rapper starts spitting instead of trying to sound better than you or larger-than-life or really angry or super sexy no-name sounds and since it's like a likable relatable human being weird I know and the same vibe comes through on this new mixtape over here except in the concept of an entire project this very subtle soft-spoken delivery that no name has going actually has some impact to it it's kind of like she was that girl at that party who didn't really stand out because she kind of kept to herself and wasn't really trying too hard to get anybody's attention but away from the riffraff and the hustle and bustle and in the setting of this very intimate mixtape it is revealed that she is in fact one of the sweetest and smartest people there now this thing is ten tracks it's about 33 minutes long and the project gets sweeter and warmer with every cut telephone is kind of like a big loving hug and not in a corny way like the music's trying to be really happy and in force you to be in a good mood rather no names really positive attitude throughout this project is so natural and comforting that it's infectious and the music on this thing reflects that - of course it is not surprising that she is rapping over a lot of very smooth jazzy soulful instrumentation not a surprise because she has worked with chance to rapper on numerous occasions and you know that's obviously a sound that he loves to work over but also I can't really see many other instrumental styles complementing her rapping I think it just makes sense for her delivery now the soft sensual sleepy sounds of neo-soul are very popular right now as well and in numerous reviews I have been quick to point out when artists are playing with the genre and they don't sing well they don't play their instruments well they can barely write a song but in the case of telephone the production is consistently gorgeous the percussion is simple but it's effective the keyboards are fantastic the chord progressions mwah mwah mwah the guest vocalists sound great and are usually mixed over one another really well when they're doing some background vocals or something like that doing some multitrack vocals and no-name while she does sing on the projects she never really takes lead and I think it's because she realizes that she's more of a rapper than a singer and this project is better for it instead she does her best and I think succeeds shining through on this project with her very personal and personable lyrics like on the song yesterday where she has a funny little line about wearing tennis shoes to clubs with dress codes because  their clubs while the second verse of the song is loaded with nostalgic allusions to life her past her grandmother the song sunny duet has these very pretty sporadic do-do-do vocal harmonies that that pepper the intro of the track which are really ear grabbing and once no-name starts rapping it's really cute and heartwarming because she's kind of just like spitting bars about being in love and - rapping about a crush on the song ditty Bob there are numerous references to her mother in her lyrics specifically moments when she was a kid and was getting in trouble and would be threatened to have her ass being there's just something really sweet and heartwarming and innocent about these tracks even as No Name is rapping about things like the drugs that she's not doing anymore or that her mother is worried about her because she likes alcohol a little bit too much it's her lyrics and it's also her delivery as well which occasionally I think while it is quiet it does get so slow and so lazy that it is a little bit of a turn-off like on the song all I need we're in the second half of the track she just kind of stops rapping for some reason but then the song reality check shows how capable of a rapper she really is as she keeps a pretty steady flow from the beginning to the end of the cut also one handful of bars that stuck out to me 17 moments and cloudy days on my snap mysterious aberration illuminated the trap my telephone Cal occasion synonymous with the sunrise now is against the foreground I thought that was a pretty poetic also the song casket pretty very short track wish it was longer wish it was more explored because it's one of the heavier songs topically but it's a very dark song despite how sweet the instrumentation sounds talking about how her friends are young their casket pretty other sort of at that age where their lives are most threatened by the ongoing violence in Chicago and violent police officers - as she raps in the song about helping her friends make it home hoping her telephone doesn't ring with of course you know bad news the song forever is one of the peppier smooth and and upbeat and catchy tracks in the track listening and then the song bye-bye baby another favorite of mine in the tracklist is very sad I don't know whether or not to be moved to cry or move to just kind of smile because of how thoughtful the song is she's essentially rapping about her baby who she aborted and she is deeply regretting this decision and kind of envisioning in her head being in heaven taking care of the baby or you know atoning for this mistake in some kind of way I've never really heard of this topic quite in this manner and I actually have to say it was pretty unique it was pretty interesting overall I love the project it has its obvious shortcomings I think no name could do a little bit to make her rap style more engaging occasionally with the muddy vocals it does sound like this thing was recorded on a potato plus I would like to hear a couple more focused song topics and verses on the next project all that being said though telephone is unquestionably one of the nicest one of the kindest and one of the warmest mixtapes I've heard this year a project that I think is going to greatly reward sensitive and patient listeners I'm feeling a light eight on this thing transition have you given this no name tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this tape have a good one thanks for watching bye 
kVA3PTb_958,this skillet album it's not good music world is so vast and endless that if you tried to listen to every great album that was ever recorded and would ever be recorded you never finished never but in that never-ending search for greatness chances are you will also run into some of the worst music the music world has to offer and that is essentially how this skillet album came into my life I've heard so many bands that I'm sometimes surprised by what I haven't heard and I say that because this band has been releasing music since the late 90s which surprises me because this band sound would have totally been in my wheelhouse when I was like an angsty nu-metal loving high schooler and back then I just listened to all those awful alt metal acts like from the Ozzfest headliners to the bottom of the barrel bands that everybody tries their hardest to not remember and even though I ran in these circles I don't remember anybody saying ever hey dude dude did you listen to that new skillet record man now this might have had something to do with the fact that skillet has spent the last decade virtually hitless but that's okay man because skillet they don't do it for the fame they don't do it for the money man they're doing it for the big G I feel tricked man I went on Apple music I saw this edgy ass album cover I was going to settle down pop in a lip ring get my raver pants on get a little eyeliner on and just chill out feed the dark side of my teenage soul and before you know it I'm listening to a song with lyrics about being saved from hell because the Angels don't come down here Christian gospel music is one thing I mean I enjoy quite a bit of it actually I think there's an old-timey beauty and charm to it that I like a lot but when you start like dropping corny Christianized metal music that's really when you start to lose me let's just sample a little bit of this record how does this album exist in 2016 where is the market for this is the Atlantic recording company hoping to get a time machine go back to 2002 bring high schoolers to 2016 just to have an audience for this thing the radio market that used to be home to rock music that sound like this pretty much dead and the edgy teenagers of today they're not listening to Christianize trent reznor ripoffs the cleanly sung vocals on this thing that are terrible occasionally the band works in these very glitzy clean choral arrangements which are even worse the guitars are the definition of overproduced they're just kind of like that just cliched new metal tone the bass of course is morphed into the guitars the drums don't really bring much to the equation a couple times I heard some glitzy synthesizers that sounded like something off of a Andrew wks I get wet but this album is not looking to party rather skillet overloads their tracks with the kind of melodrama that you typically get from a band who clearly thinks that the message they're delivering to you in their songs is super-important I mean you know they're saving souls man they're saving souls I will give it to the band that sometimes they put up a couple choruses that are semi catchy like I could see them working in a bunch of different musical contexts the problem though is that the sound of the song is the sound of this record is like 10 to 15 years too late and even if you go back that far like to the band's records that they came out with in the early 2000s they weren't exactly doing the whole alt metal thing any justice then either back then they just kind of sounded like a hodgepodge of all their contemporaries and now they're just continuing to do that but with way less of a potential audience because who wants to hear this kind of metal and rock right now especially again with the religious angle coming from the lyrics skillet album not good Tran good not good not good forever 
Htt3TnkMwPY,Hey hi everyone ghosts and ghouls you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ghoul record dungeon bastards this is a new full-length LP from eclectic conceptual California crossover thrash band Google following up their 2011 record transmission zero a cool punk metal album that was also like a comic book with a cartoony story that featured some somewhat sci-fi undertones told with a myriad of different vocal deliveries across the span of the record some guttural burner some vocals some shouted and screamed vocals as well each voice was kind of like a character in the story or just the standpoint of a particular person in the band because the band themselves puts themselves in the story and of course all this is set to a soundtrack of thrashy guitar solos and mosh friendly riffs it's a monstrously fun record you know it's it's a punk metal hybrid but there's a bit of guar influence in there as well I would say it's it's metals answer to the be horror movie like the Beast slasher flick but it's a little too tongue-in-cheek for that it's more like metals answer to a Troma film and with dungeon bastards it sounds like Google is serving up yet another helping of pretty much what they did on their last record similar production similar songwriting style similar singing also each track helps to tell an ongoing story which is highlighted in a preamble of the lyrics of each track on the album's Bandcamp page of course the story and the themes turn up in the lyrics as well some tracks make it more painfully obvious than others like on the song guitar mageddon which has no real lyrics whatsoever it's more of an instrumental but the song features all of these vocals snippets about war and nuclear war nuclear fallout and the song word is law has these kind of awkward talks some rap verses woven into the track which are told from the standpoint of a dictator that is sung about on the album the dictator of the land of creepy Sylvania which is where the story here is set where the band Ghul lives dictator taken over I mean it's it's a fitting story for an election year and while again it is fun the vocals do come off a little bit too much as novelty in my opinion that's mainly what kind of turns me off occasionally about this record that Google kind of steps over that novelty line in a sense still despite how silly this album can be how silly this album can seem an incredible amount of effort seems to go into the story and the joke creep sylvania is painted in the lyrics on this record as a vivid world of undead armies and heavy weaponry and mutants and gruesome violence like on the song blood and guts which features a tale about a doctor performing experiments on these dogs - I don't know turn them into just super killer dogs but then they end up turning on him and tearing him apart this is highlighted in the finishing lyric of the song which goes the doctor screamed as their manacles snapped dragged off to his doom as his skivvies were crapped what can I say the instrumentals and the performances on this thing they're high-energy they're gutsy and it seems like Google put a little more effort into some of the lead guitar melodies on this record - almost each song has a distinct melodic theme that's placed pretty prominently at key points in the song the drums and the guitar riffs though they're a kind of dime-a-dozen not revolutionary by thrash or Punk standards and if you've heard ghouls past couple of Records then you're already familiar with the kind of music they're gonna be serving up here however it is a shortcoming that ghoul partially overcomes with their character with their personality with their creative storytelling style and attention to detail it's not a perfect exchange but it's an exchange that works for them and makes them a pretty unique band in metal today but maybe the most glaring issue I had with this record is that the band doesn't really go all that far to outdo their last effort while dungeon bastards is pretty good a lot of the time it feels like an all too similar sequel to the last record it just kind of features a slightly different storyline this is especially true as the band delivers cuts that just do not feature Horace's that are as gripping as the ones off the last record like on the closer and the seong-gu lunatics still though one interesting thing about the narrative of the record is that it ends off with a cliffhanger like this Supreme Being after a bomb blast comes through this other dimension and things are just kind of left there I don't know if this is something that Google is going to have to sort of do battle with on the next record all I can do is hope that this story carries over on to their next project and maybe we get an interesting little trilogy or something I guess we'll just have to find out on the next record same goal time same goal channel and those are my thoughts on dungeon bastards I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this LP transition have you given this cool album a listen as you love it - Jade what would you rate here the best you're the best what should I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my review on this goal record Google Dungeon Master's forever 
_OkqJVoI3fo,hard to knee court a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd hi everyone it's time for a review of the new descendants record hyper calf iam spazzin a this is the latest full-length record from famed punk outfit descendents known and appreciated for the album Milo goes to college a hardcore punk classic and underappreciated for the handful of records that would follow soon after some of which I think were kind of a precursor for a lot of the melodic pop punk that would come out in the 90s the album enjoy for example which is among one of the Bands most hated records has a kind of wild unpredictability to it that I like a lot now despite my love of the band's early discography it's kind of hard to get excited for this new comeback record over here especially since this reunion already happened about ten years ago when the descendents put out their real comeback record on Fat Wreck chords and with the album's cleaner production and ham-fisted political statements and steadier performances and just predictability it was already a kind of underwhelming return it was unquestionably the band's most mature album ever but mature in exactly the way that takes away the appeal of a punk record and I think the maturity increases once again on this latest record over here to the point where the band's once very raw and emotional sound turns into sort of saccharine PAP on tracks like without love on which the chorus makes me absolutely sick also the cut shame this hey or the song smile we're literally the choruses what I wouldn't give to see you smile the closing track beyond the music as well I mean what descendants deliver here is nowhere near as lifeless and is over produced and as stomach churning as what was on the latest blink 182 record that album not good in case you haven't heard but that doesn't make hyper calf iums painfully mild sound any easier to swallow there are a handful of decent Tunes on this thing like on the song fighting myself which not only has one of the better vocal melodies on the entire record but the bassline is phat nimble super killer the song on paper lyrically is one of the wittiest moments on the record where we hear lyrics about not being able to get any but on paper this person looks good good credit score good grades bills paid etc and I can definitely nod my head in agreement with the point the band is making on the song limiter about just over zealously prescribing behavioural medication to young children if only the performances and the instrumentals were a little gutsier while I don't mind the lyrics on this track the responsible old man punk aesthetic of the music on this thing isn't doing the songs any favors it takes the much-needed oomph added the equation of a descendents album and I guess it's fitting that we have a chemistry theme on the cover over here because this album feels pretty formulaic I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing pretty and different toward it to be honest but I sort of see the appeal in listening to this if you're a hardcore descendents fan you know it's very much a fan record somebody who's been sticking with the band for a long time but for somebody who's looking for a new vibrant exciting and raw punk album this is just not it unfortunately transition have you given this out and listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best or the best was that I must hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you hate my review of this descendents record because you're free to like it way more than me buddy forever 
2O-TfcGQboQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the favorite tracks of the week segment we're down there in the description box i've linked to you guys so my favorite tracks from this past week we're rounding them up here and before I get into the segment I have to say if you want to support this segment support my buddy Austin who edits this segment hit up our amazon associates link which is linked down there in the description box anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the US we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price use it to buy some shit you were going to buy anyway alright let's get into our worst track of the week segment before we recommend some good tracks to you guys we have a couple pretty terrible tracks that came out this week the new tough low song cool girl is one of the most painfully boring pop songs I've heard in a while and the new chainsmokers track featuring housey is one of the most painfully boring EDM dance pop songs I've heard in a while but it seemed like as far as terrible songs this week when nothing was quite taking the cake like almost all of the songs on the Suicide Squad soundtrack um the panic at the disco cover of Bohemian Rhapsody Bohemian Rhapsody is essentially brendon urie karaoke it's awful our standards for cover songs have apparently dropped so low that it's okay for Brendon to just come up and do karaoke and we're fine with it we'll just throw it on a soundtrack and sell it to people and then there is the track with Dan Auerbach and Action Bronson and Mark Ronson dan and action go together like peanut butter and petroleum jelly on this cut it's terrible but - but to me the worst track on the soundtrack has to be the grime song medieval warfare I have no idea what this song is it's like got these chugging guitars these rattling trap high hats some punchy sub bass kicks it's like a metal trap fusion the song sounds like a failed science experiment like if this thing we're a living breathing being it would be writhing on the floor convulsing screaming kill me me and of course Grimes is baring her vocals in the background and the mix again to sort of hide her voice for what reason I don't know because the the instrumental on this thing is horrendous easily one of the worst tracks she's ever put together hopefully she got a big fat check for this thing from the Suicide Squad movie alright those are the worst tracks of the week we're going to move on to some tracks that are actually a tolerable or preferable going into some metal music now this new project this new album that's coming out on Willow tip Records from a band named Mithras and the title which I'm going to pronounce incorrectly is between cilia and sherburn's and this is some really cool experimental avant like technical metal some elements of death metal in there I think in black metal it's pretty extreme it's noodley it's dense its intricate and its intense you know it's not one of those technical metal songs that kind of loses its oomph in all the musical Wang Curry you know there's a lot of gusto to it despite how kind of dizzying and layered the song is so I'm really liking that moving on beach slang these guys are a really sweet kind of noise rock noise pop project a little shoegaze e at points they have a new cut out new record on the way song as punks in a disco bar their last record I thought was incredibly catchy maybe not that memorable or distinct but certainly catchy and this song kind of the same thing hoping they drum up a more distinct sound a more memorable sound on their forthcoming record though Street sects industrial noise Nick's on Flint sur record Street sects are back with another track I recommended one song to you guys a few weeks ago you guys hit up the comments section of that song we're like holy shit Fantana was right this is lit and so is the song - okay so I'm really excited for this street sex record because these guys are noisy and intense as hell again if you love noise if you love industrial music and you like it visceral with kind of a rock directness you're gonna dig these guys new on brain feeder records this dude who I know has some pretty interesting production on his mixtape I'm not crazy about his rapping maybe it'll grow on me but production is certainly interesting the kid is named JP Morgan and this free mixtape is available via brain feeder records give it a shot passionate from a JPG mafia and freaky I might vote for Donald Trump while the vocals are a little more buried than I would like them to be on this track the beat is insane it's a weird oddball banger it's noisy it's crazy and the lyrics are hilarious as well and the video is actually pretty well shot I like the idea of them kind of infiltrating suburbia and I love the shot of like the old man looking at them out the window and then like the pistol comes up it's fucking crazy so yeah that's fun little single their proto martyr post-punk band noise rock band proto martyr has a new single out via the Adult Swim single series summer singles series that they do every year and I'm actually liking the single quite a bit this is the noisy hectic sort of intense performance style that I was hoping that the band would do a little bit more on their last full-length record and of course the songwriting is still good and I've always liked proto martyrs vocals at least on their last record quite a bit so they're moving in an interesting direction with this track you know sometimes these Adult Swim singles they feel like leftovers and b-sides and just you know stuff that didn't make the album or whatever but this track felt like new and refreshing if I like the band was actually doing something kind of kind of different and hopefully this direction they're moving in turns up on their next full-length record moving on indie how the the song golden threads from the Sun these guys are a post-rock and experimental rock outfit they had a pretty seminal record in the genre Seiler and then they just kind of disappeared off the face of the planet and they're now coming out with this follow-up record like over a decade later and from what I'm hearing of the album so far even though in regards to post rock it is kind of dated but still I mean by the standards of post rock it is a pretty quality record the instrumentation is really cool it's dynamic let me adjust the light a little bit thank you the instrumentation is dynamic it's beautiful it's not like you know the the typical explosions in the sky ripoff type crescendos every five seconds it's actually some pretty creative songwriting and melody writing on these tracks especially on this cut over here so if looking for some quality post-rock that isn't just the kind of you know throw it on the pile type of dime the Dozen stuff give this thing a shot a couple more Norah Jones had a beautiful new ballot out now I have to there we go title carry on loving that track and it's actually kind of got my mouth watering a little bit for her new record it's a very nice sweet piano ballad I'll say experimental metal and sort of atmospheric black metal project I'll say has a new track out new record on the way I imagine and this is actually one of the more abrasive songs I've heard from the project in a while and while I do like some of the prettier moments on their records you know I think it balances well with the more abrasive tracks when they do actually show up the last few records been a little too mellow in my opinion and maybe this new song over here is you know kind of a hint that we're moving back in that direction a little bit so so yeah I'm enjoying that and I will end things off with the e-40 song petty which is a fun little pop rap track efore T of course comes through with a ton of I don't know I guess a charismatic very tongue-in-cheek bars all over this track and the the hook is super catchy too and it's just kind of a fun ballsy silly pop rap song and I think that's it those are all the songs I wanted to recommend to you guys again they're linked all they're down in the description box those were songs of the week avoid those avoid those at all costs you probably heard some of them at least and yeah that's it okay thanks for watching this segment again Amazon Associates link down there in the description as well if you want to support this segment subscribe to the channel because we're going to be hitting you guys up with song recommendations every week in the album reviews of course are great in between all these recommendations and you're the best all right have yourself a good one thanks for chilling with me for a few minutes checking out these songs goodbye forever 
Trb2KK-Ui7c,a hi everyone vapor II wave tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new 2814 record rain temple what the hell is 281 for it is a collaborative music project featuring fellow ambient music artist telepath and hong kong express both of them associated with the vapor wave scene specifically the subset of it revolving around the dream catalog label now their previous full-length record which dropped last year not only put this collaborative duo on the map it was one of the biggest ambient records of the year arguably you could say one of the biggest records in vaporwave still though it did not click with me personally even though i appreciated how ambitious and conceptual the album seemed plus I also liked the hazy mystical retro futuristic aesthetic of the music too however it seems like the duo is drifting away from exactly that on this latest release here working in elements of ambient techno and even downtempo into some of these cuts and the sound scapes on rain temple are actually a little chillier a little more digital and pristine I would say the nostalgic warmth of birth of a new day has melted away a little bit and while I think generally change 4 to 8 1 4 is a good thing because there were elements of the last record I didn't really care for I'm still finding myself having reservations with this latest record over here it's just the flavor is somewhat different this time there are two main components to this record one you have the variety of repetitive hypnotic minimalistic compositions that go into these 8 tracks which occasionally feature maybe like an epic instrumental build or something and then you have the sonic component of this record the sounds of the sense the textures the mixing the sound effects and the sound effects that were used in the process of giving these tracks a wide panoramic field now there are moments on this record where both of these elements are as great as could hope for them to be like on the track before the rain which is a stellar intro I love the chilling and slow-mo synth leads that call out drily over the fractured piano arpeggios that kind of hang in cascade over one another in the background it sounds like something out of a big-budget sci-fi movie from the 80s I would say it's emotionally powerful as well which is great because I think there were a lot of moments on birth of the new day that were a little emotionally sterile for my taste and then the momentum of this intro track continues on to the next song which features a pretty prominent rhythm and synth bassline it's sort of cerebral the way it works on you the groove is slow Behar there are all sorts of droning synth keys popping up in the background and these twinkling leads that are shy but glisten beautifully however these sounds kind of lose their flavor over the course of the tracks eleven minute runtime if - eight one four was going to step this far outside of the ambient comfort zone of their past couple of records they could have at least put together a composition that moves from point A to point B while the sounds on this track are good it's not like they stay fresh at this level of repetition there are a few interesting variations over the course of the track but not so many that they fill up the very long runtime I kind of feel the same way about the ten-minute cut this body as well as the song transference which is only eight minutes but still gets pretty stale pretty quickly with this very dreary 2 chord progression which is set against some pretty strange sound effects that don't really enhance the mood of the song at all there's a lot of texture on this track but none of its really that well organized the song lost in a dream I think is where a lot of people are picking up the downtempo vibe as some very distant and shy vocals pop up in the dense mix that the instrumental provides and while the vocals are okay I feel like they're not all that well complemented by the sour sense that I think are providing a different mood than the vocals are though much of what else ends up in the track I think is OK the rain sound effects and the kind of sparse but primal percussion the song guided by love is one of my favorites and features this haunting thick beautiful wall of synthetic droney sound and kind of sounds like new-age music for a new age the song contact is equally seductive and pretty and glides right into the very rhythmic closer inside the sphere which is the track that sounds like if this album had been a movie this is the moment where the credits are rolling and the song does give the album some sense of closure as the project seems to finish off with the same progressive synthoids that it opened up with overall I would say this is a pretty decent record it has a pretty strong start a semi strong finish but much of what goes on in the middle is a little bland to me it's cool that vaporwave and the dream catalog label have done wonders for the genre of ambient music even if a lot of the ambient music on the label is under the vaporwave name the label and the artists on the label have to get the credit they deserve for actually getting this new generation to care about ambient music but outside of the cultural petri dish that projects like two eight one four were grown in it's hard to see this album as all that revolutionary or interesting especially since on this new record over here they seem to have changed stylistic course into some genres that are already very well established this thing has its moments but I feel like I need to be sipping on some kind of kool-aid in order to be head over heels for it I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition have you given this album to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best but should I order you next put it the like favorite like please subscribe and please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this record to eat one for rain temple forever 
2QSAf3CP7Mo,hi everyone Sano here the internet's Macias music nerd and it's time for a review of show me the bodies album body war these guys are new york rock band who fused together elements of funk rock sludge metal punk rock rap into a pretty abrasive and ballsy sound you know it's rap rock but without all the hang-ups of all the crappy commercial new and rap metal bands that came out in the late 90s in the 2000s just give a listen to the opening track to the title track of this album it's pretty much the band's mission statement heavy primal drums the shouted almost caveman-like vocals buzzing bass and twanging guitars that are her key and jerky and kind of unpredictable they huff they puff they roar like a monster there's something kind of post punky about it as well and all this stuff comes together into a super visceral sound and there are other cuts on this record that are equally as good in terms of performance and intensity and writing as well as just being an interesting mix of sounds like the song aspirin which is a monstrous closer for the project and features these eerie sparse guitar sounds that kind of add a little atmosphere to the heavy percussion in the grunting bassline the ending is super crushing with the vocals and the guitars and the drums is all saturating the mix so aggressively at once the song two blood packs has an odd little groove to it sounds like something one of the weirder alt rock bands from the 90s would have recorded as a b-side or something but all that being said it's not like the track relies so heavily on nostalgia to be appealing I mean that's the case for show me the body in general there are a few things about their sound that feel like they're pulled directly from the past but they're put together in such an odd in a modern way that this album couldn't have come out in any other decade than this decade and on the song chrome exposed we have this kind of diddling bass line which builds this very quiet tension before everything just explodes into this roaring wall of cars and drums with this ascending and descending bassline that sounds almost like it's an upright bass that was miked and distorted or something just the way that it it's total madness you know there are a lot of things about this band that remind me of groups like dope body or Rat King who I know they performed live with thrash crossover acts like suicidal tendencies I don't know exactly what it is about them this sort of makes me think of suicidal tendencies maybe it's the vocals the way the vocals are so shouty and kind of matter-of-fact over the the visceral instrumentation there are some slower cuts in the mix here too that aren't too bad you know even though they're more tender and they're not as pummeling they're equally entertaining like the track metallic taste which to me has a bit of a king cruel vibe to it and the versatility on this record continues on the tracks like tights wah which is a bit of scuzzy straightforward punk rock which the band is equally as well as the tracks that they're fusing sludge and rap into and the song honest our maybe my least favorite track here but I do find it slightly intriguing that the band in the middle of the record would come through with this weird droney spoken the shouted word interlude my only other issue with the record is that tracks like worth won and new language while they are as pummeling and is crushing as many other cuts here they do kind of feature that show be vocal staccato to look which at this point on the album has worn itself out a little bit like we've heard so many tracks so far that had the same vocal delivery was hoping for a little more change ups at this point on the record but overall this is one of the gutsiest and most freaky rock debuts that you're going to hear this year it's a raw high-energy recording with some good performances on it it was a lot of fun to listen to for me and the band brings an interesting mix of styles that already sounds unique from their debut project over here I can only hope into the future that they die further down this rabbit hole and drum up some even more interesting sounds I'm feeling a strong 7 to a late 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best so should I reveal hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry Anthony Fantan Oh show me the body forever 
f1vo4v11Qck,look the way stares at you it's like you stares right into your soul hi everyone Stephanie soul tan oh here the Internet's creepiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bones mixtape paid programming to eerie and prolific California rapper bones is back with a new mixtape his second this year and one of his longest thus far standing at over 70 minutes long which on the face of it isn't necessarily a bad thing for a while now I've been enjoying bone sound his lyrics his production his delivery is rap style but I've been wanting him to drop something a little more substantive than the usually short projects he drops one after another for example his last mixtape useless this thing features some of his heaviest beats and most blood-curdling screams yet on any project generally I liked it there's something that you should know about bones music if you don't already his sound is incredibly dark by hip-hop standards he pulled a lot of influence from artists like bone thugs-n-harmony and three 6 mafia but he travels so much further down that tortured horrifying almost gothic rabbit hole farther than I think any of his contemporaries do at least for example his verse on biodegradable is one of the grimy ax stand grimaced I've ever heard him drop on a project with references to cuts on his hands from aluminum cans and rust in his lungs from the dump he was in I actually think there are quite a few lyrical highlights on this thing a lot of the time bones is spinning the edgiest ever or singing from his tear-stained diary on cuts like my biggest enemies o has been my so the palpable angst and their moments on here where he's throwing jabs at the plethora of copycats out there who have sprung up since his cult following came into fruition and they figured out the bones formula sort of like on the song black mold where the opening line to this track is literally yes it is terrible shout to Fogo which is backed up with some amazing production from fleece with of course those very Spacey dark trap flavored pieces of percussion which are accented with these weird way Ling tones throughout much of the tragg way again there are a lot of great ideas on these tracks some good lyrics good production but sadly the over an hour of material that is featured on this project is spread out among bones usual one to two-minute song formula not too much unlike every other bones project and not too much unlike the original paid programming mixtape which dropped in 2013 which was also pretty long - and while bones rapping in production has certainly improved a great deal since the original paid programming tape he's just really not pushing himself outside of his comfort zone with these song lengths even though there are highlights on this thing a great deal of them drowned one another out because they're all given the same level of impact in the same amount of emphasis as these scant song lengths reduce the memorability of even the best ideas on this thing not to mention that these songs stand shoulder to shoulder with other tracks that are so short and so unambitious I have no idea how they made it onto the project and I guess it's part of the concept of the paid programming series for bones to just throw in everything and the kitchen sink which is probably how kind of random moments like art Vandelay happened which has a kind of funny Seinfeld reference at the beginning of the track and then right afterwards we kind of have bones doing this somewhat lifeless singing over this very chill wavy future funk beat and on the song tears of an angel it's almost like we're getting kind of a weird R&B cut I can't help but imagine bones on this song singing with like a pair of oakley's and like a white button-down shirt which is open of course and like wind is blowing against him and he's in front of a green screen which is putting him on an ocean horizon and he's just saying in his heart it sounds like something off of I don't know a public-access music talent show but honestly the low points on this record the spots that are awful or that I think are so bad they're funny they're few and far between but still the overall lack of ambition on this project and just how disjointed and attention-deficit it seems leaves a lot of quality tracks potentially quality tracks hanging on sudden fade outs and abrupt endings around that 1 to 2 minute mark I haven't reviewed but I've at least listened to around 10 of this guy's project since I found out about him and he does this on every single project and you'd think that with each one the appeal of what he's doing with these short songs would grow on me but it just hasn't because I don't even really think there's any creative merit behind structuring songs in the way that bones does it's not even like the songs are just short it's kind of like bones continually releases half a song over and over and over especially on a project that is an hour long it kind of becomes wash rinse repeat this formula works on some of the most aggressive tracks here which make a strong impression because of their volume in there and their anger or maybe out a moment where bones verse is so dark and so great and so well written that it stands on its own now I do enjoy the handful of cuts that actually go over the 3-minute mark on this thing like on the track words cannot encapsulate which the very depressing mood of this track I think is enhanced by its normal song length but these longer tracks are just kind of few and far between you know paid programming - it's just again the same kind of issues that I've had with bones past projects but just kind of exacerbated by the fact that I'm listening to over an hour of material and 25 songs now despite my slight boredom with this project I stuck around for the final moments the song final level cutscene is a weird mix of cringe coming from the faux video game intro but I was also deeply moved by bones verse where he was talking about how people just react so callously and with fake concern to horrible things that go on in the world on social media but then I was also mortified by some of the black luster lyrics on the verse - and then the whole project ends with this 20 minute long skit titled sesh radio volume 3 which is of course following up the two previous radio is one of which turns up on the original paid programming and it's an odd piece of sound art that is produced to sound like a real Heol radio station a real radio program and it's actually kind of funny absurd witty the breaks in between shows are really funny the weather segments are really funny they're malfunctions during the radio program their songs playing in between pieces of course bones is performing on these songs but he's not performing like he would normally put put together a song himself he's sounding like another artist entirely there's one track in this little skit where he sounds like he's doing kind of a grandmaster flash thing bones might have this tortured dark exterior on a lot of his songs but he actually reveals himself to have a really sharp sense of humor not only that but he shows how far his creativity goes when the sky is the limit say what you will about some of the writing and some of the dialogue in this skit but the world that bones creates on this little skit here is pretty vivid between the hosts and the different shows and the programming and the sound effects and the music beds behind the hosts and the people who call in some of the commercials on this thing is a hilarious ad 4-iron Gaines Jim and another like promo for truck nuts in the end I'm slightly torn on paid programming too part of me feels like some of bones most wildly creative and cool ideas turn up on this project then another part of me feels like the same issues I've had with this past efforts show up here in spades and then I'm also kind of impressed with the weird radio programming concept that he has going on with this mixtape especially with the skit at the end and just the variety of songs and musical styles and emotions that turn up throughout this thing - I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this thing Richard transition have you given this mixtape listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you are pissed off at my thoughts on this goddamned bones mixtape I'm sorry bones pay programming to forever 
EU1PzBC1LMY,a hi everyone majorly Caetano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new dj khaled record major key DJ music mogul and hip-hop's biggest meme dj khaled he's back with another new full-length album and it's been subject to a lot of talk because this album comes after dj khaled 'he's meteoric rise on the snapchat platform where he regularly drops these short motivational videos where he talks to you about his feelings and his aspirations and getting lost on Jesse not to downplay DJ Khaled's legitimate tenure in the music industry though this guy's been at it for years releasing albums and orchestrating one hit after another but he's not some master producer or songwriter or anything like that he's more like a mover and a shaker he is this guy who brings together the right rappers singers producers and songwriters to craft these chart-topping radio hits songs like I'm on one and all I do is win and welcome to my hood recently hold you down which many people have seen the completely preposterous music video for that thing and say what you will about Khaled formula I mean because of how he conducts himself artistically for years people have wondered what exactly it is he does but it seems to really work for him as he releases one popular album and single after another and continues to make waves in the music industry however I can't really say I've enjoyed Khaled music all that much myself every once in a while he'll drop a track that in my opinion is pretty credible like the 2012 single hip hop which had some pretty fantastic verses from NAS and Scarface a great beat from DJ Premier but a majority of the tracks he releases are usually just like radio trite but I think that changes a little bit with this new album over here now that Khaled fan base is not just an urban radio audience a radio audience in general he's now this massive figure on the Internet and now that's kind of given him an opportunity to not adhere to these radio formulas that he's been working on all these years but instead embrace the meme which I mean isn't exactly revolutionary in the Internet age in an age where memes are almost a huge part of music promotion it's just kind of a smart thing for him to do because on this project he is working with the best and brightest that mainstream hip-hop has to offer and backing them up with some pretty good beats however that doesn't prevent this album from feeling like yet another dj khaled compilation album as each song sounds like a standalone single and there are real no thematic ideas that tie all of it together and they're different people featured on each song I will say though there is a the occasional shout from DJ Khaled in the track as well as some lyrical references to his snapchat memes in the variety of verses across this project the important thing is though is that miraculously there are more hits than misses on this thing in my opinion like with some holy key featuring a fantastic vocal performance from Betty Wright whose singing is meaty its passionate its fiery on this cut and then we have verses from Big Sean and Kendrick Lamar Big Sean no idea why he would turn up on a song with Kendrick again of course he gets bodied again but I feel like he puts up a little bit more of a fight this time around some clever bars on this thing got to give him a shout-out for the vegan bars on this track Kendrick comes through with of course that schizophrenic set of flows and in vocal deliveries and pitches that he delivers on almost every track now the song is epic Grande it's entertaining Jermaine's interlude is a surprisingly thoughtful and passionate song for a dj khaled record and a fantastic couple of verses from j cole himself I actually would say this is one of the better songs I've ever heard J Cole on I've ever heard J Cole performed it's just a shame it didn't end up on a J Cole album I guess then we have fuck up the club with future and Rick Ross and yg and Yo Gotti each one of them brings a pretty charismatic verse of look at the grew grew grew grew future on the hook is catchy as hell the beat is very woozy it's a flavored chill club anthem and future is maybe the artist that I think is featured the most often and the most prominently on this thing and it's not actually that bad because dj khaled influences him to do something a little different on every track you know it's not like ds2 or just another future mixtape where he sounds almost the same on every single cut he goes off on the song imma be alright and on the song do you mind he delivers a completely auto-tune las' verse the song worked for it with Big Sean and 2 Chainz and Gucci Mane is equally smooth and low-key and catchy and the track on here toward the back end of the project featuring Travis Scott and little Wayne is surprisingly fruitful as well it actually sounds like a song that could have made it onto a Travis Scott record and it's complemented with a little wayne verse the beat is melodic it's epic it's grand it's huge and there are a few slightly lyrical cuts on here that old heads from the 2000s and the late 90s I think will appreciate a lot you have one cut on here with Busta Rhymes Fat Joe fabulous and Jadakiss the song don't ever play yourself it's pretty grimy and then I got the keys with future and jay-z which is a cut that I was kind of mild on as I heard the single release but in the context of the album I liked it quite a bit even though I think the whole I got the keys thing is just a dumb DJ Khaled meme and doesn't really make for a quality chorus I guess future did twist it into something that worked for him and the whole idea of keys and jay-z well there's a whole nother context to the usage of the word there and jay-z's performance isn't bad either sure lyrically he says a lot of the same stuff that he says just about everywhere like he's not losing he's never lost his babies blew his wife's Beyonce we know but still a pretty entertaining track but I do have to give it to NAS though for maybe the best couple of verses on the entire project his performance on the track NAS album done is absolutely fantastic it's just kind of a shame that there wasn't a good chorus written into this thing again a hook is exchanged for just like a bunch of DJ Khaled memes that's a major coup this track would have just been better as a freestyle than something they were trying to groom into a commercial album track I will say one more thing about the lyrics generally they're not awful it's a lot of one-liners and it's a lot of semi empty braggadocio beyond that I try not to read too deeply into the ethos that DJ Khaled brings into this record a lot of it is predicated on the same weird paranoia and vague allusions to success that you'll pick up in his snapchat videos something his fans buy into for some weird reason despite the fact that most people walking the planet are probably not important enough for anyone to hate them for being successful and in the case of dj khaled i doubt there's anybody out there who really fits the straw man who he's kind of talking about in almost every video he makes even me with my minor meyer slice of internet popularity there's nobody out there just stewing in their anger thinking that anthony Fantan oh I hate that he's successful I hate him if I were hearing all the things that dj khaled is saying outside of the context of a hip-hop record and just dj khaled in general I would assume I was being pitched on some kind of pyramid scheme or something Khaled really is like the rap game ty Lopez again a lot of the lyrics here don't really hold up to heavy scrutiny but what material is delivered here is pretty decent by pop rap standards of course there are some really corny commercial R&B cuts that work their way into the tracklist here like do you mind with Chris Brown and August Alsina and Jeremih which is just way more Chris Brown August Alsina and Jeremiah that I want to hear the Drake track is OK there are a couple catchy one-liners here and there I love the Kendrick Lamar reference on the track the hook is kind of bare though the track generally is kind of bare and while I do find the song pick these hoes apart a little funny for its brashness and I guess it's you know blatant but tongue-in-cheek sexism the Kodak black verse right at the start of the cut is absolutely atrocious and while forgive me Father with Meghan Trainor and Wiz Khalifa and company is not as horrendously corny as I thought it was going to be it's still not one of the better cuts in the tracklist you know with this one J Khaled dropped a competent record which is more than I expect from him and at this point with one album after another that I have not reviewed because I just have zero interest in them because again they don't really flow effectively like albums they just feel like compilations a lot of them are just really trashy commercial trite but now it seems like he's trying a little harder and trying to craft tracks that people are actually gonna want to listen to again and again and again maybe DJ Khaled's internet fame has forced him to up his music game a little bit because he's not just simply playing toward that urban Billboard chart audience and because of that I kind of hope his internet fame continues to last because while his audience continues to be more diverse because of his snapchat following it sounds like his musical endeavors are becoming a little more diverse and that's a good thing I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this album cool cool Anthony Fantana DJ Khaled major key forever 
Q2zc4Fi2mb0,hey get the near act tannin here the Internet's busiest mutant and it's time for our great albums of the month segment where I go over the records from the past month that stood out we recommend them to you link them down there in the description box along with reviews and songs that you can hear from the records and then you guys get some good music recommendations you go on your merry way and everybody's have a handful of Records to recommend to you guys this month a couple of them made the love lists not all of them though actually just one of them made the love list but that's okay and we're gonna start off with this record that is the new il wise records scum with boundaries aisle wise is an experimental and art rock side project from Andy and Zac from Death Grips their last full-length record was kind of an unambitious lo-fi nose rock album that didn't really impress me in any way shape or form I mean there were a couple decent songs here there but this album is totally different way different tone totally off-the-wall fun creative zany really odd and also catchy you know there's some incredible choruses on this thing too if you're into rock music that is on the fringe and lives up to the label oddball lives up to the title scum with boundaries give this thing a shot moving on clams Casino comes through with his first full-length commercial project I mean this album is far from perfect but there are some great singles on here good features from the likes of little B as well as Vince staples not really a whole lot of complaints about this record you know it has clamps casinos trademark dreamy very wavy and developing sound on it and there are a few cuts where he tries his hand at some alternative R&B and some pop and it goes over relatively well it's a pretty good record definitely not the disappointment that some producer curated albums are another very good album I heard this month is the new apathy record handshakes with snakes apathy a connecticut-based East Coast hip hop artist who produced and wrote this entire album has some great features on here from the likes of be real and bun B and Twista also Ono is on this thing a lot of great features and a lot of great topical tracks too one awesome track for the beginning of the LP about how rappers want to sort of make it big in hip hop so fast that they don't actually put in the work put an effort show the passion that it takes to run the long game that a guy like apathy has for well over a decade at this point because he's been dropping some pretty consistent projects over the years this is a tasteful record that has a bit of a nostalgic East Coast throwback but isn't so obsessed with the past that it just feels old hat and dated and totally boring got to give a shout out to the new self-titled K slang Tver record this is a collaborative singer-songwriter record that went over better than I thought it would though it doesn't really come together all that well as an album because what the song sounds like really kind of depends on which singer sort of takes the lead on the project however that being said even though this does feel like a comp of sorts it is a high-quality comp you know the songs are very good some of them a little too short for my tastes like I wish a few tracks got cut from the record and then a few others elongated to kind of give the songs a bit more girth make them more satisfying but it's still a good quality record if you enjoy indie folk if you enjoy these monster singer songwriters and you might have been kind of waiting on the sidelines thinking though this collaboration can't be good no way that I'm you know gonna enjoy this entire record if I'm a KD Lang fan or Laura there's fan or a Nikko case fan but in fact they do a good job of supporting one another on each of their songs throughout this record it's a good album and finally I'm going to end it with the new woods record Sun City Eater that uh easily one of the best records in the woods discography drifting farther and farther away from the dreary and the funky sounds that a lot of their earlier albums had and giving us a bit of full crock as well as music that is I don't know slightly funky you know there's some pretty bold orange sections on this record I can't say that I'm completely in love with the vocals all the time but some of the sunniest most catchy song writing on a woods record has turned up on this thing and also some of the best production on any woods albums so far has turned up on this thing and yeah you know so if you're looking for some indie rock some indie folk with some cool warbly falsetto vocals some eerie choruses that are pretty infectious give this thing a shot alright all of that again is linked down there in the news web yeah you're the best Anthony Fantan oh great albums transition have you given any of these records a listen did you love a made my what do you think I should review next and that's it okay guys

uYGP3wmTDAU,hi everyone scruff the knee buff tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly favorite tracks the week segments before we get into these favorite tracks which I will be recommending to you guys they're all linked down there in the description box please support this segment by hitting up in the description box our Amazon Associates link if you live in the US and you use this link you buy something on Amazon we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price cool cool just uses to buy some shit you were gonna buy anyway but first also before we get into the favorite tracks worst track of the week this week was pretty fruitful in terms of tracks both worst tracks and good tracks we had handful of tracks that were eligible for the worst track title we had the new Specter vs. Smash Mouth song love as a soldier which was painfully generic maybe not the worst thing I've ever heard but really the most faceless and anonymous thing I've ever heard come out of the Smash Mouth camp then after that we had the new Snooki song young mommy although this track it kind of seems like it's intentionally bad like it's kind of put out there to troll us and be kind of silly and goofy yg whose song fuck Donald Trump from his latest record still brazii recently dropped a part two of the song with some pretty cringy verses from G easy and Macklemore but even though all these tracks were bad none of them are the worst track of the week the worst track of the week has to go to the Democratic National Convention 'el song our fight song which is a song and a music video that played during the DNC featured some B+ list celebrities all kind of going crazy singing this terrible acapella track we should really be ashamed as a nation that this song represents us in our political process in some way because this was so bad that not even some of those sing-songy acapella people on YouTube would have put this together like this is like far below even that quality standard in terms of the songwriting in terms of the the video being corny as hell in terms of the lyrics which are just massive amounts of cringe again we should be ashamed as a nation this is the worst thing to ever happen in our country since I don't know some kind of national tragedy that I'm not gonna mention because I don't want to piss anybody off all right let's get into the favorite tracks of the week now that the worst track of the week which is like down there below have has been mentioned it's out of the way so like I said this week has been fruitful there have been a lot of great tracks this week a lot of tracks that I want to share with you guys and again they're all down there they're all down there this track came out a while ago although recently popped up on Apple music so it gave me reason to listen to it again and I don't know if I mentioned it in a previous video so I wanted to mention it here the Travis Scott and young thug song pick up the phone featuring quavo from me goes pretty fantastic track a song that I hope ends up on Travis's next record its melodic it's tracked labored it's heavy epic instrumental young thug's performances great Travis's performances great Cuevas performances great no complaints about this song just a fun pop rap tune with a lot of auto-tune cool cool all right a lot of people been hitting me up about this new Mac Miller track dang featuring Anderson PAC was sort of mild on the cut as at first but as I listened to it more and more I started to see the appeal of it started to see what was so good about the track Mac Miller is certainly a little more expressive on this cut you know he's not just doing his totally you know lazy glazed over white guy thing that he usually does though that is certainly here in this track their moments where he really picks up the emotional intensity and Anderson PACs performance is fantastic one of the things that initially turned me off about the cut is that it kind of has this slow easygoing laid-back jazzy kind of neo soul thing going on and everybody's doing that sound right now why do we need another song and this aesthetic in this style but Mac Miller and Anders pack actually do this song do this sound a lot of justice and there's some surprise and great horn sections on this cut too so good for these guys they put together a good song in a style that seems to be really saturated right now but somehow the song stands out as a good track we have an insane song from a band named brain tentacles the song is called the sadist I might be a little bit of a sadist because I enjoy this track it is powerfully weird it's like some extreme black metal but there's these groaning pieces of instrumentation that play throughout the cut that sound like horns or string instruments I can't quite tell it's so hellish and so strange I can't really make heads or tails of this thing all I know is that it's so perplexing and it's so weird that I find it entertaining it's slightly hilarious but also it is very grim it is very dark despite how strange the instrumental palette seems so I'm pretty interested to see how this band might sort of measure up when they come out with a full-length record I've seen some comparisons to the band sigh with this group and I certainly agree with that check this out if you're looking for some insane fucking metal music this week moving on alunageorge lake Kelley 47 and Reesie live with a new song called mean what I mean great fucking track awesome track awesome pop track great beat great singing all over this cut great guest verses this is pretty much like a summer smash that I hope ends up smashing I mean what I mean like the music video is so good - no complaints about this thing you know it's a good dance pop tune it's got a kind of a throwback flavor to it you know sounds like something that could have existed in the late 90s or the 2000s or something but I don't know it's it's if you like disclosure you know if you like your house pop if you like your dance pop kind of tasteful you know not just super trashy or anything like that you're gonna like this thing of course the alunageorge fans are gonna like it too moving on clipping baby don't sleep clipping experimental hip hop trio they dropped a new track and promotion of their forthcoming record this song is weird as hell probably the hardest to digest single clipping has ever dropped it is on my favorite tracks the week list obviously but I'm still kind of on the fence with this song because it is so odd it's gonna be interesting to see how clipping fans take this track I'm still scratching my head on this thing but I'm hoping I end up liking it once I soul search on it a little bit more the beat is super abstract so is the strong song structure lots of distortion lots of noise lots of texture clipping yeah done confused me moving on to a track that I know I loved from the moment I freaking heard it The Dude's an injury reserve are back they have a new record coming out titled floss a new mixtape you might remember these guys from the live at the dentist's office mixtape which came out a while ago one of the best hip hop mixtapes of that year if you have not heard it this song is banger extreme banger extraordinaire the hook of course these guys write great hooks the hook is amazing I love the ocean and the sounds like ship repose 6 also richie with the t's one of his bother that bars on here about about not having a dad and being raised by the internet was pretty funny of course the verses on this thing are great but you know there's not really anything about this song that I don't like instrumentalist killer hook is killer verses are killer and there's kind of a little auto-tune interlude at the end of the cut that I didn't quite expect but went over pretty well on a tape it could end up gliding the song well into another cut because it was pretty low-key it was like a pretty little interlude moment and the the music video is pretty dark too with people like jumping around and washing and going crazy and for whatever reason Richie with a tee is like dressed like some rapper out of the 2000s or something but uh but yeah it's it's it's a banger it's one of the best bangers of the year and it's tasteful too you know it's not just like this crappy mindless song you know it goes hard it goes crazy but the lyrics are actually worth diving into all right so big endorsement on that track if you listen to any of the tracks in this freaking list listen to that freakin track alright moving on the garden with called this number now these guys are a sort of experimental punk and a post-punk outfit that I reviewed a while ago but I was pretty neutral on their record because it was just so inconsistent however this new song over here batshit insane and seems like it really kind of steps outside of the the very predictable formula that while it was weird it was very redundant on their last record this song seems a little longer a little more fleshed out a little more crazy and zany and a little more schizophrenic - like this thing is spaz tastic it jumps all over the place emotionally and sonically so um you know if you're looking for something really odd really jumpy and kind of freakish look up this song all right moving on something that's a little smooth a little poppier sounds like it's a bit of a pop rock throwback from the 90s communions with don't hold anything back this song was joyful it was melodic like this track a lot defiant three the song crossfire there's some the grimy ax snip hop I've heard this week sounds like something from the Def Jux label from back in the day so if you're into that sound definitely give this thing a listen space candy with elastic spring this is a bit of a bubble gum bass sort of thing if you like PC music if you like igloo ghost if you like artists like that give this thing a shot really strange beats really glitchy and sort of jittery production that I thought was really beautiful colorful textured and a couple more dj khaled with holy key featuring big Sean also Betty right and of course Kendrick Lamar I'm gonna review this dj khaled record this week I think and I like the song quite a bit of course it's a pop rap track it's it's heavily produced it's clean it's banger I mean it's it's Basie it's glitzy um but I don't think it was bad you know it wasn't a trashy pop rap track or anything like that I thought Betty Wright's singing on the chorus was fantastic even Big Sean's verse wasn't that bad got to give him a shout out for the vegan bars on this track so you know God it got to give vegan respect where it's vegan does served a few more Koreatown oddity with fuck dinosaurs this is a weird new single from the Stones Throw Records camp and I don't know it's it's a really noisy distorted odd instrumental with like some feedback worked into it it's kind of like a fusion between kind of that lazy laid-back Stones Throw a record sound and like some noise rock or something like that it's it's a pretty weird fucking song and not only that but music video - with like people dancing there's like an ice cream truck and it's it's some odd shit and we're gonna finish things out with our friend hot dad he just came out with a new song about Pokemon go which is catchy as hell funny as hell pokey don't stop and of course he always comes together with a good chorus and of course in the in the verses on this cut he brings some satirical funny observations about the whole Pokemon go graze and you know his whole songwriting process and how he writes so many songs about popular sort of you know whatever is the cultural zeitgeist of the time shit so shout out to hot dad because he always comes out with good material and that's it guys those are all the songs that I wanted to recommend to you this week and also the worst tracks that I wanted to tell you guys to maybe either check out or stay very far far away from alright you have watched this video and I appreciate that greatly again our Amazon Associates link is down there in the description if you want to hit that up and support this series and I hope y'all are doing well and get some good recommendations out of this list I hit you guys with a lot of freaking tracks and again a lot of good tracks and a lot of creative tracks will come out this week so that's why this video and this list is so long alright y'all I will see you in the next video bye forever and before I get completely out of your hair I wanted to mention the new Sun Kil moon song god bless Ohio which is a track that is just as wordy thoughtful acoustic and melodic as you would expect a track to be from mr. Kasich at this point in his career and that is like down below - alright you guys have a good one but 
vv9_gySpshg,Wow hi everyone do they go to tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kemba record Negus New York rapper and lyricist extraordinaire Kemba formerly known as YC the cynic and artist who I've been waiting to hear new music from since his very good gnk record which dropped several years ago he also released a handful of b-sides I guess in a way to sort of purge himself of all of this old YC the cynic music before he switched over to a new name something that at the time I didn't understand the point of I mean is all this material is it not that good or is it so different from the direction that you're going to be moving in that you'll have no use for it under this new name and now that I've had the opportunity to listen to this new record over here it kind of confirms that because Negus is far different from anything that YC or Kemba has put out in the past maybe not totally from a lyrical or conceptual angle Kemba on this album still reflects quite a bit on topics of race and politics social status and black culture he's rapping about these things now more than ever since recent police shootings and racial divides in America have become hot-button topics on news media and social media but this record is not really the angry revolutionary response to these things that you might assume because on this record kimba's reaction to this stuff is actually pretty low-key pretty measured it's not an angry show of retaliation as much as it is a really sobering and somber portrayal of the current state of things from his point of view and this tone could have much to do with some of the opening lyrics to the record on the song Caesars rise where canvas specifically says do not call this lyrical these are Negro spirituals which I think says a lot about the mood of the record there's a lot of pain and there's a lot of sorrow on this album and some of it is conveyed through what I think are some of Khem bazoer ycs best lyrics yet like right here or right here the song greed actually has one of my favorite opening verses on the entire record and some of my favorite lines on the entire album - how much is a life worth drop a penny off the Eifel he's talking about this one individual on a track who found the Fountain of Youth but he just turned around and bought sprite though one line that sort of blew me away is when he's talking about racism or racist remarks toward him where someone might call him an ape and then he goes at apex lyrically I don't really have that many reservations about the record I mean maybe Kemba could have put some of his points a little more bluntly or maybe organized his thoughts a little bit better but boiling these very heavy and intricate issues down into songs is a really difficult task and for the most part I think he succeeded there's one point toward the beginning of the album where he makes reference to like microaggressions that I thought was a little silly but I still enjoy how thoughtful and topical a lot of these tracks are like on the song heartbeat which is a direct reference to police shootings or on the song sirens open parentheses curious where the listener is kind of tempted with materialistic things I think there's kind of a druggie angle to the the track as well or maybe just a note of jealousy toward someone that has more than you Plus on the second verse here he sorta does this flow though that not that that's you know like a little nasal is a little high-pitched and it's a kind of speedy reminds me of something from Kendrick Lamar's last full-length record and this isn't the only time on this album where Kemba really wears his influences on his sleeve because there is a hefty Kanye vibe throughout a lot of this record not only in the fact that some of the instrumentals were really try to be Spacey and dramatic and build up tension and I'll talk a little bit about that later but also with all of the distorted fuzzy auto-tune interludes that glide us from one portion of the track to another there's also a pretty prominent black skinhead sample on the song Caesars rise if there's anything keeping me from loving this record it's that the production can be kind of lifeless in my opinion there are some instrumental highlights on this thing like on the song the new black theory which has a pretty big boom bap chorus that I like a lot even though I think kembers vocals could have been a little more lively their greed has a great beat I also lovely very mysterious and tuneful brown skin Jesus that is the outro track of the album it has a wonderful chorus that is a mix of like gospel and soul not something I was aware Kemba could pull off so well he also sings pretty well on the song heartbreak toward the last third of the track because the song really is kind of split up into thirds you have this long-winded intro that sort of goes in about this police shooting a great verse in the middle and then the back end the song actually becomes heartbreaking as he's singing this refrain about how he doesn't want to see his brothers die he doesn't want to read his sister's will but having said all that there are plenty of instrumental moments here where I think the very slow pace of the production I can see that Kemba and his producer on this thing are trying to build up tension but that tension doesn't actually get released in any significant way on some of these very slow burning tracks and then there are cuts that never really have that much oomph to them at any point in the instrumental at least not enough to be exciting or really just kind of bring the emotional or the musical point home that Kemba is trying to make and it leaves the song feeling kind of hollow and groggy notably on songs like Hallelujah kings and queens the interlude cuts on here and I would say the song always as well I mean I think that song generally works pretty okay but when sort of thrown into this track listing with all these other very subdued tracks it's just another moment that feels just as middle-of-the-road as many other cuts on here you know there's a lot of smart stuff on this record I'm just afraid that it's going to fall on deaf ears because of just how musically instrumentally underwhelming this record is and I'm not looking for Kemba to hop on some kind of banger generic trap instrumental or anything like that it's just that the frustration this album is very clearly rooted in doesn't really manifest itself or translate all that well through the vocal delivery or the instrumentals on this thing nor does the album end up delivering the intimidation that the opening cutscene rise kind of promises with the lyrics sonically I would say this album unfortunately is not as bold as I would have liked it to be and for some odd reason I think after switching to this new name Kemba has somehow become a little less distinct than he was on his previous record because the Kendrick and the Kanye influences are so very apparent on this thing overall though I thought the concept on this record was cool I liked the lyrics a lot some of the singing went over pretty well generally the album is pleasant to listen to it's smart it's thoughtful and the ongoing story of this teacher trying to get a young black child to betray his racial identity and his self-respect in order to teach him a lesson about loving himself was pretty interesting too I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to hate my opinion on this album Anthony fan tanto Kemba forever 
3QuLKmZB5lg,anybody hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's biggest music nerd and it's time for my one my favorite segments on this channel the most underground of segments on this channel the caveman camp where I show you guys some of the weirdest that turns up on the band camp platform yay yes six records for you today starting off with the sonic art crew sonic art for this apparently is a project that is masterminded by multi-instrumentalist and composer Nathan Anthony obviously it's the fourth installment of all of these records on his band camp and on this album there are many genres coming together I mean everything from rock to like a little bit of musical theater which is the case on this track that is an ode to twitch it's like this theatrical dramatic and very satirical look at the video streaming platform also there is an amazing track on here titled mighty force which is basically the Power Rangers theme with the lyrics switched up a little bit please don't DMCA this video I I have a family to feed thank you so this is a really fun kooky ridiculous record it's really over-the-top it's got a lot of personality it's very colorful and and considering how jokey and comedic this album is a lot of the writing and compositions are super super impressive like a lot of effort went into this record despite just how ridiculous it is so if you're looking for something that is having a lot of fun something that in a lot of ways is a joke but a very intricate and well-groomed joke then look this record up moving on this next project is a bit of a I don't know kind of grind spazzy experimental rock project called Kokoschka this is a really a odd record if you couldn't already tell from the cover art their elements have grind on this thing like I said but also experimental Punk and it's it's obviously a little comedic you know these guys are purposely being as weird as possible and succeeding succeeding so if you want to hear some very herky-jerky completely wild and out of control rock music that's recorded a little rough and is very freaky especially on the vocal end of things give this thing a listen it's an oddball you're going to come away at least entertained or very weirded out let's give a listen to this next project over here just a clip of it just a clip of it don't the nca me please for the love of Jesus Christ that piece is 35 minutes long this is a one long track or rather an album from these guys they're Dutch their name is dead Neanderthals they're pretty prolific they refer to themselves as like a new wave of Dutch heavy jazz there are elements of free improvisation in their music drone in their music and they do emphasize that word heavy they live up to that word they don't just throw it in there it means something now this project is not strictly a dead Neanderthals project it's placed under the name of Krishna which apparently is an ongoing collaboration between dead Neanderthals and an artist named drug culture with av instead of a you actually all v's instead of used in that whole name drug culture and from what I'm hearing so far in this piece it's very dense it's very heavy it's very powerful it's like jazz music that is so progressive so ahead of the curve that it sounds like it's coming I don't know 50 years from the future or something like that it's like UFO jazz if you dig this believe me there's a lot more where this came from on the dead Neanderthals band camp down there in the description so enjoy now this next one from the album cover over here you can see which we have lovingly blurred out a bit of it you could tell this band they like to have fun the band of course is a rodent blowjob Holocaust and the record is anal lacerations from brutal but sex and of course we see a Superman totally reaming Batman just the way it should be and the bands logo is just a squiggle on top of another squiggle and these guys are some disgustingly just disturbing porno grind and gore grind check out the names of these guys their trio here's their their names because obviously you can't you can't be in a band like this in your in your stage name is Fred unless your stage name is like Fred Phelps that would be a pretty funny porno grind stage name but here are their names we have a Bundy blumpkin we have ass eater don't forget the dash in between the both of them and my personal favorite like my personal favorite my favorite out of the three my favorite out of the three of them I will finally say it right here is ha ha ha ha for the final time my favorite out of these three guys is mr. it as shocking here's a clip from the summer smash but you will hear on the radio in the coming months elderly inbreeding basically blood cake guitars and vocals that sound like the tail end of a really long Titus record listen also expect hits such as vaginal butcher knife blasting a JFK assassination photo bomb and bukkake on a burn victim moving on we have a band camp artist who miraculously got what looks like an MTV Unplugged album over here how'd you swing that buddy what the artist is concave onion and this is like a bunch of weird acoustic cuts that all say live in the title I don't know who he's playing these songs live too they might have been recorded like live in one take that definitely sounds like it is the case but I don't know if you can have a live track if you don't like have an audience there to experience the performance I can't quite tell if all of these songs are covers or if just some of them are covers or just kind of like weird renditions of tracks some of them are quite bad but it seems like there's an element of being tongue-in-cheek here like it's purposefully goofy and and weird there is an amazing kind of a semi acoustic take of Ziggy Stardust on this thing but the title has been flipped into Ziggy sawdust for the love of God don't DMCA me please please don't just don't him just chair a little music here sorry okay some of what's on here it's definitely original it's just that it's kind of hard to tell because it seems like he's picking up some ideas and then twisting them so weirdly that they kind of become original anyway even if they are like a cover all I know is this this thing is weird as hell and that's a good thing and finally we're going to be talking about the project Kel Val how from the one the only mr. hunter hunt Hendrix of liturgie Fame now instead of making really abrasive and strangely symphonic black metal he has turned his sights on some electronic music on this project over here and he is given this thing a lovely title new introductory lectures on the system of transcendental Kabbalah now as far as electronic music goes this is pretty strange it's really layered it's very dense it's got some weird compositional ideas but some of these ideas to me sound like something that could have made it onto a liturgy record it's just that the synth Tambor's are very different from the brittle shining very bright guitars II who typically hear in a mix on a liturgy record some of what's here is super super glitchy and strange I've heard people crapping on this record left and right but there are actually some interesting compositional ideas on this thing also I will make the statement and this is a totally true statement listen here okay if you hate this record listening if Dan Deacon dropped this record after he put out the song crystal cat all those years ago people be going apeshit over this  thing most definitely some abstract moments on this thing maybe it's a little more abrasive and harsh and kind of tinny than I would like it to be which was definitely the case with liturgies last record as well but still this thing was intriguing and I guess an interesting piece of what I'm sure is canon for the long conceptual overarching I don't know what that hunter is trying to create with all these records between this one and liturgy and so on and so forth because this one is well features a really odd piece of cover art which you know talks about here in this little diagram that you can see behind me we have ports rays shells beams gates circles and valves and this kind of stuff also turns up in similarly obtuse diagrams like in liturgies cover art like on their record my favorite record of theirs a static huh so you know maybe one day hunter and I I'll take the guy on a date and I'll get the opportunity to you know sort of pick his brain about all these diagrams and all this transcendence and and all that stuff but you know in the meantime the music is is chin scratching and enjoyable and that's going to be it for this episode of it came from band camp all that stuff all of it linked down there in the description if you want to check out any of these records please do they're really strange they're adventurous they're creative again nobody who made any of this music please don't take this video down please don't take down my youtube channel I'm just trying to talk about your music turn some of my fans onto your didn't mean nothing by it and if you guys remember if you enjoy any of this music buy this from these artists because they're sort of doing an independent there up on Bandcamp they could use support for the art that they're creating don't be a scumbag and just like you know pay $0.00 for the music on their Bandcamp you know give them a little something a little something something oh and we're going to leave it at that so thanks for watching you're the best transition have you given these things listen if you haven't you should also over here next to me we have some links to the previous it came from Van Camp video can done you can also check out the it came from Van Camp playlist or you can see all that it came from Van Camp videos and just keep a lookout in the future in your subscription box for this segment because I love doing it and I love being able to turn you guys on to some of these

55l2Junftxo,what up everybody Antron fan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd we're going to do a quick review of the new Roy woods album waking at dawn Roy woods Canadian singer-songwriter a new artist on Drake's ovo record label this is his debut album on the label last year I believe he had an EP on there I have to admit I did go into this thing a little skeptical because of the label that it's on ovo records and my opinion does not have that great of a track record the label just kind of drops one mediocre alternative R&B record after another from a faceless artist who just kind of sounds like a replay of either Drake or The Weeknd who it seems every year Drake is just unhappy with the fact that he let him to slip through his fingers so he just kind of grooms and finds a bunch of lesser-known artists who kind of have a similarly ethereal and moody R&B sound the one thing that seems to separate Roy from a lot of the other ovo artists is that he does a little bit of a dancehall thing on a few tracks here not something I believed he was doing on his previous EP now he kind of dabbles in it with a handful of cuts from this new record over here and it's not like some authentic take on dancehall or anything like that it's the very Airy smooth skeletal type of dancehall that you might have already heard on Drake's last full-length album views and just like his mentor Drake Roy seems to throw a little bit of fake patois onto his delivery on some of these tracks too some people have said in the wake of Drake coming out with songs like one dance that he was just so immensely influenced by the huge Caribbean and the huge dance all the huge Jamaican influence going on in Toronto but I don't know not really the case when you look at a recent 2011 census of the Canadian city here Toronto is only slightly more Jamaican than it is Jewish Ukraine nor even Russian and Drake is not about to drop a chest to sheikah I can guarantee that regardless though this in my opinion is just another filler release from ovo which you can just throw on to the pile of partynextdoor or division or Maggie Jordan these are not vibrant creative groundbreaking R&B records here people these are very trendy they're wash rinse and repeat the songwriting is bland the vocals are an almost nondescript every once in a while a hit or a song shines through but that's just the very rare occasion this Roy woods record in my opinion is just another instance of ovo trying to continually capitalize on this alternative R&B trend and they're just doing it with the most agreeable most lowest-common-denominator records possible but that's just my take on this LP what did you think of it did you love it - JD - why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana really woods waking and dawn forever 
KN8p1OCNy94,antwuan fan Tron here Internet's busiest music nerd just going to do a few quick reviews here today on the old iPhone the first of which I'm going to be talking about is the new suicide boys EP radical suicide these guys are a prolific New Orleans rap duo they've been at it for a couple of years now and I've decided to touch down on their new EP not only because there were moments on it that I liked but the duo has dropped some songs here and there that I thought were really good it seems whenever I share one of their songs I get all these people begging you to review their stuff so it seems like they have a really healthy and a passionate fan base now if you like your rap grimy violent trap flavored sort of dark think of artists like three 6 mafia maybe a little bit of Space Ghost perp don't kill me for that comparison if you guys happen to hate Space Ghost perp and a lot of people don't like Space Ghost / I feel like little bones or maybe some Bone Thugs and harmony then I think you're going to get down with what suicide boys are doing suicide boys most definitely channel this sound well especially on the production side of this thing I literally press percussion excuse me I'm a little tired I didn't get too much sleep last night I love the crisp percussion on this thing and the really woozy and eerie synth leads that are worked into a lot of these tracks too the lyrics for the most part are decent they're not amazing or mind-blowing but they sort of deliver on the edgy promise that the instrumentals on the CT make the thing about the EP though is that it is kind of short of breath not only is it just a handful of tracks but each one of these tracks are very very short some of the cuts don't even breach the two-minute mark still in that short amount of time that suicide boys are performing a song they bring a lot of guts they bring a lot of energy their sound is powerfully dark but in a way I think they're kind of cheating themselves by delivering these tracks that have a lot of pros to them have a lot of great characteristics to them but really lack a topical focus lack a distinct vocal delivery lack sometimes a verbal hook and and lack a decent song length to it just seems a little unambitious sadly I mean take for example the opening con this EP stop calling us horrorcore which could have definitely been a funny and a mean rebuttal to any music fans out there trying to pigeonhole these guys but when you actually look at the lyrics of the track it's really not that at all the song really could have been titled anything to be honest and that's really all I have to say about the EP I like their style I like their sound but once I get beyond that the hooks the song structures the lyrics the rapping delivery though the flows are good the delivery nothing too much here is blowing me away but it seems like these guys have the tools to make something much better than what they're making now so again if you're looking for some really dark grim hip-hop look this EP up it is decent if you like those artists that I compare these guys to earlier I think you're going to find something in this EP that you enjoy a lot and that's it alright cool thanks for watching what did you guys think of this EP if you gave it a listen to your love I hated why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthe Fantana suicide bobo is forever 
5IPI4P2IRmA,hi everyone trapped in Niigata Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Gucci Mane record everybody look at Gucci Mane or scoochie or goo up is an infamous southern rapper Atlanta via Birmingham and his career recently has been revitalized by his return from prison in the 2000s gucci was one of the biggest to ever do it in terms of southern hip hop and trap but despite his massive influence on the new generation of up-and-coming rappers his influence among hip-hop fans was kind of waning in this new decade protegees like waka flocka flame we're getting more mainstream attention than even he was he was releasing a lot of mediocre mixtapes and albums some collaborative records that weren't very well received some of which were pretty highly trashed among fans like his collaborative V nasty tape or his one with Chief Keef and just before his most recent prison stint he had a little bit of Twitter drama where he viciously went at numerous fellow artists many very big very relevant artists however he chalked it all up after to his Twitter account being hacked not really sure if anybody believed that so Gucci unfortunately left us looking kind of bitter however he was still very prolific while he was in prison releasing tons of projects reportedly in 2014 despite being in jail he made over a million dollars anyway but the music industry has had this funny way recently of completely erasing and forgetting all of that drama all of those kind of subpar releases in order to make not just a Gucci celebration but kind of a Gucci reincarnation because between his new singles and videos from this latest record over here this new Gucci Mane is trimmer he's more stylish he's a little more Hollywood he's also more Intel and he's sounding more focused than ever especially with the feature list on this thing we have young thug we have Drake we have Kanye hey he could have had a lot more features on this thing but he opted out of that he carries the rest of the record himself but of course not without a load of production from Mike will made it and Zaytoven both of whom he says on one track he goes way back with them and he'd rather rap on as a track than a dre track ha the instrumentals on this thing they are kind of glitzy melodic trap instrumentals the style production that you would expect from Mike and Zaytoven at this point nothing really incredible or out of the norm or revolutionary about these beats they just kind of get the job done but gucci doesn't really need an instrumental crutch on this record like he has on past material because like I was saying earlier he's way more coherent more coherent than he's been in years and he's a lot more self-aware on this project - there are bars on here where he's talking about himself and he's pretty funny and clever there are bars on here where he is diving into his past a little bit and exploring his rash decisions he's made in the past or just dark and horrible experiences that he's gone through one track in particular first day out the feds I believe it is he talks about his mom turning her back on him because he's done so much dirt so not only is Gucci more coherent but returning to society has given him something to rap about whether it be rumors of his label dropping him on the song pop music which is a very strong dark banger definitely a highlight for me in the track listing on numerous bars across this project he talks about how he is a recovering drug addict and that may be in fact why he sounds so clear and coherent on this project there's even one line on here where he says that now that he's off the drugs he is himself he's him again he also raps about how he's home now like I'm song guap home with young thug which is actually a really celebratory track and another one of the best songs in the mix here young thug in my opinion is probably the best feature on the entire project there's serious chemistry between him and Gucci on this track and stylistically they support one another really well the other two features while Drake and Kanye are big names neither of them really bring much pizzazz to the record Drake's feature is just a really short tiny hook on a song that should have been longer and should have had a Drake verse it would have given it a good length Kanye's verse while he doesn't make a fool of himself like he usually does recently on whatever feature he happens to land on whoever's tracked because he's trying to just be so over-the-top and so ridiculous he plays it reserved but it's a little underwhelming as a result still I do like his lyrics on the song out do you where he's rapping about still making money and still being influential in the music industry from prison and the song Gucci please is essentially about women the world over just loving him and wanting to be with him the chorus is absolutely annoying but what he says in his verses is kind of funny now even though gucci is focused on a series of themes on this project these themes it's it's not like there's that many of them they do get exhausted like on the song back on road which seems like it could have been a really great return song but gucci instead just kind of goes back in his past and tells a grimy tale or two again a drake feature a drake verse could have helped the monotony of this track a little bit and sadly the song robbed even though gucci says explicitly in the song that he's reminiscing about the time he got robbed is not really the strong narrative that i hoped it would be especially considering the track comes from a place of personal experience for gucci the song also features one of the weaker flows on the entire project too overall this project does have some good highlights and the presentation is pretty good it doesn't really overstay its welcome either the tracklisting flows pretty well there's not a whole lot of fat or useless tracks but in lawsuit in comparison to other Gucci albums is only slightly more focused and ambitious some of Gucci's flows and lyrics do get kind of underwhelming or they're painfully basic and not to mention that these song structures on here if you give the album a few listens through you'll kind of realize that everything's a little wash rinse for there's not a whole lot of diversity of sounds and moods and emotions to the record however though I did come away from this album hopeful even though I thought it was just kind of merely decent because again this is the cleanest and the clearest and the most focused Gucci has sounded in a long time if he stays on this path I don't see why he couldn't be making bigger music in the future because while he's not one of the most lyrical rappers on the block he does have a lot of personality to make up for that and with maybe some slightly more interesting production and some better hooks I think he has the potential to make it even greater record then he made here I'm feeling a decent strong six on this one Tran go J hey thanks for watching this review appreciate it have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you have any Fantana gucci mane everybody looking forever 
Cqf5i2t2Hkw,uh hi everyone know they salute a no-no here the Internet's busiest music nerd light and it's time for a review of the new little yachty project summer songs to Atlanta rapper singer hip hop's one of hip-hop's biggest balls right now little yachty he's having a pretty good 2016 not only because he has been named a double XL freshman this year but he also dropped one of the most eccentric and controversial mixtapes of the year little bow a very summery silly innocent ridiculous mixtape with a bright shiny take on the auto-tune trap sounds that have been so popular over the last few years but my review for this project has gone down essentially as one of my most controversial and hated reviews you wouldn't necessarily know it from the likes bar which is pretty positive but you can certainly tell it from the fact that every single time I rate a rap record lower than I rated little boat I get a comment like I can't believe this got a lower score in little boat I'll kill you yeah I did enjoy little boat partially because it's so joyous and hilarious and catchy and partially because it has moments that I think are so bad that they're good but if you actually paid attention to review you might remember me saying something like while I do like this I may reservations because this project might be a little bit of a fluke no way little yadi is going to catch me off guard with a second project because I'll be familiar with his style at that point I really have to kind of go above and beyond and that whole fluke theory that I had summer songs - it's kind of confirming that not only does this tape not have that super weird and interesting double persona dichotomy that the last tape had I mean sure there are moments on here where yachty is singing and there are moments here where he's rapping but summer songs - doesn't have that same vibe where we're being introduced were being invited into this world where yadi is revealing himself and his multiple personalities to us on summer songs - it all just kind of blends together a little bit most likely in favor of May exactly what the title of this project advertises and that is summer songs hits singles standalone tracks and as promised this mixtape is loaded with straightforward and playful bangers a few melodic and slow-mo emotional cuts as well so in a way little yadi hasn't really changed all that much from his last project to this new one over here we still have the very melodic trap nish chef Curtin with glimmering very candy-coated melodies and of course you have that massive sub bass and the crisp snares and rattling high hats his flow and his singing voice his use of auto-tune nothing's really changed all that much the shortcomings that I found on this project are really in the songs the performances some of the biggest highlights on this thing are just criminally short like the song king of teens by the king of teens love the melody on this track it's sunny its shimmering it's hilarious the vocal melody is infectious but the song overall just kind of ends out of the blue just feels like there could have been more to this thing especially with a solid feature and shoot out the roof grimy track never heard yadi on a song quite this aggressive and yet it goes over well especially with the the the gang vocals on the chorus here so again these tracks way too short in my opinion meanwhile the opening cut the intro song on here absolutely terrible and long as hell for whatever reason yadi didn't go into this cut with much of a song idea and he seems to have lost all concept of tempo or timing on this track as his rapping is barely riding the pocket or the groove of the instrumental the song idk I think earns its title because yadi did not know what to rap or about or live just seems like very little forethought went in to this track and the six-minute Posse cut all in at the very end of the project though it does have a long laundry list of features the track has very little to show for it as a lot of these people yadi invites onto the cut are nowhere near as entertained and then we have the Y interlude which is just as long as many of the other album cuts on here it's barely an interlude but whatever however this song is just indefensible because it has one of the worst vocal performances on the entire album why do they hate me yadi sort of answers his own question with this track the vocals on this thing are so bad I can't enjoy them ironically on ironically post ironically and the song yeah yeah is a sort of painfully corny relationship jam my diamonds called like out soda called Turkey and one of the cringy Asterius George references I've ever heard on a song so this project just does not have the consistency of little boat there are some seriously awful songs in the tracklist on this thing however there are highlights the sort of aggressive diss track in a way for hot 97 is pretty fantastic solid banger lots of energy coming from that cut actually keeps the beginning of the album from being completely drab song life goes on is a beautiful and sort of inspirational cut where yadi is rapping about keeping your head up dealing with those hardships in life and moving on it sort of has this goofiness but also this earnestness to it that reminds me a little bit of like a little B track song dip set featuring offset of migos features this hilariously flipped sample from the Cowboy Bebop original soundtrack the gentle piano arpeggios and kind of heavenly choral vocals sound pretty fantastic against Yahoo's rapping he is silly he's charismatic and offsets verses pretty good too however guest verse of the project best guest verse has to go to a little herb on the song up next three another track on here where I'm happy to hear a little yadi experimenting more with making aggressive cuts because the couple of times that he's tried it out on this project they go over well now as far as the lyrical content on this thing of course it is ridiculous and dumb as hell I mean I still have my standards there are some lyrics that are just so painfully obvious and just so dumbed down that I can't stand to even hear them but if you go into a yachty project expecting to hear great lyrics I don't know what to tell you you know I feel like little yadi haters the biggest mistake that they make is that they take him more seriously than he takes himself I mean there's a line on here allowing the song idk where he's rapping about how the is bald like Caillou again there's obviously an element of humor on this project he's obviously being a little tongue in cheek he's not trying to be a spiritual lyrical miracle okay I think his dumb simplicity and his cartoony voice and his cartoony singing are part of what makes him appealing however though some of his worst material thus far has landed on this project melodies and choruses and lyrics so bad they don't even surpass the very low bar that yadi has set so far and then you have those good highlights that are just tragically short overall I'm kind of indifferent toward this project but if you like little boat there's going to be a handful of tracks on here that you like as well just don't expect this to be as consistent I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition and given this album a listen it's a love it to G hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to hate this review little yachty summer songs to forever 
iQ8Gko3MrY0,hey what up everybody Antoine Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our favorite tracks of where I tell you guys what my favorite tracks have been this past week all of them are linked down there in the description along with our amazon associates link if you want to support this segment hit up that link if you live in the u.s. anything you buy on Amazon we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price don't worry it works there's not some kind of crazy confirmation telling you that it worked if you clicked on the link and you live in the US it works just use it to buy some stuff you were going to buy anyway helps out the show helps out the segment cool cool alright let's get into the tracks first however we have to mention the worst tracks a week where a get out of here get out of here I'm not kicking a living thing it's a mat down there I'm sorry worst tracks of the week what were the worst tracks the worst track of the week there were a couple contenders you know some people were asking me if I wanted to put another Ghostbusters track on the worst track of the week because there are some pretty terrible songs on that soundtrack and quite controversial has been the new designer single Timmy Turner but I don't think the single is that bad it's certainly better than a lot of what was on his new tape new English it's actually a full fledged song not too some clip of a half-assed song or anything like that still designers yet to really kind of craft his own sound or hop in his own lane as the track sort of sounds like a combination between future with like a Travis Scott beat or something and I don't mind the track I mean future and Travis Scott collaborating is pretty cool to my ears and I think the beat the song of the instrumental is pretty epic so I don't hate the track I don't think it's a terrible track but it's certainly not one of my favorite tracks this week you know then certainly not the worst track of the week however the worst track of the week it's got to go to want to get the title here correctly it has you go to can't go to anyone else Major Lazer coldwater featuring Justin Bieber and Mo this is essentially oh excuse me another incredibly mediocre piece of dance hall on the market right now thanks to Drake there's tons of awful just run-of-the-mill dancehall kicking around the internet right now that sounds so ethereal bad I just can't get away from it but if you if you want to actually listen to some dancehall that does not suck I recommend Barrington Levy yellow man of course you got to listen to some yellow man one more suggestion not just a any Kamoze check check him out and a lone ranger and iike mouse okay that's some classic dancehall there for you not the crappy whitewashed super clean super pristine dancehall that you're hearing on the charts right now that stuff is boring that's better dancehall that I just suggested to you guys alright moving on let's get into the favorite tracks the week but BAM they're all listed down there in the description again so hit these links go listen to these tracks I like them hope you like them too we have Chris Ferren with say you want me this is a solid piece of power pop right here this guy's an up-and-comer just got signed new album on the way and if you like your hard or sort of alternative rock with some sweet melodies some slightly heavy guitars you're going to like this one also new track from screaming three rails song is titled skeleton and this is a pretty scuzzy piece of punk rock on this one I bet I get it's a guess it's a b-side from the band so kind of cool to hear that from them the strikes are only went harder than a lot of the cuts on their last record I actually wish it made the cut on the album we have a new track from Denzel curry titled today it's sort of this Auto croon trap track it's not one of his harder cuts but some nice melodies on this cut and I like how Denzel curry can do a song like this but it doesn't take away his edge so definitely enjoying this cut moving on we have a new track from AG Cooke PC music master so if you know you've been following the whole PC music thing you might have a guess as to what this new single already sounds like and it's not a bad cut another good you know sort of a chirpy pop tune from the PC music camp we have devala with randhir this is a bit of grime here some very colourful eccentric grime music coming out of the UK a good single from him Skrillex and Rick Ross purple Lamborghini not a bad cut from these guys typically not excited to hear a Skrillex track not excited to hear a rick ross track but when they come together you get a supreme banger so they didn't disappoint on this one and for whatever reason when I went into this thing I somehow knew I was gonna like it like no way coming together that they would just put out a boring collaboration you know you'd figure with the crossover potential that Rick Ross would bring his best Skrillex would bring his best and both of them certainly did so you know it's not heady or cerebral or you know something's going to get you scratching your chin or anything like that it's just a crazy ass fucking banger that's fun as hell but something much darker here Street sex okay this is a new artist that has a record coming out via flen sur records and this is a dirty filthy disgusting sort of gothic piece of industrial noise rock okay this thing is nasty as hell I love how abrasive it is this is deadly if the rest of the album is just as head crushing and his ear searing might be one of my favorite records of the year and we're going to finish off with wind Butler who did a cover of a suicide track in tribute to Alan Vega of the synth punk group since Punk duo suicide who recently passed away so r.i.p to Alan Vega and when Butler does a fantastic cover of dream baby dream from suicide and that's it guys those are the favorite tracks of the week check them all out they're all linked down there in the description as I said along with the amazon associates like hit that and buy something we could kick back from again and yeah so let me know what some of your favorite tracks this week have been what you think of that new designer cut timmy turner did you love it did you hate it and what do you think of the rest of these cuts over here cool cool you're the best talk to you later bye 
3OzfNaYcoVo,dyma the Neo Widow here the Internet's busiest music nerd hi everyone how you doing it's time for a review of the new batch for lashes record the bride this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Natasha Khan aka Bat For Lashes and this is her fourth full-length album I believe and if I recall correctly I enjoyed her last full-length album quite a bit I also liked her vocal input on that recent sex switch EP slash album if you're in the mood for some very occult and heavy psychedelic rock I recommend checking that out but Bat For Lashes is an entirely different vibe however a equally good one under this moniker Natasha delivers this dramatic and sometimes dreamy art and synth pop pulling pretty heavily from artists like kay bush and Bjork and now on this new record over here she's working the whole theatrical dramatic angle even harder as this record features a concept about a bride who loses her beloved on their wedding day so right from the get-go we know we have a protagonist on this album who was going through an incredible amount of suffering and this story this concept even though it looks big and ambitious on paper somehow this album ended up being Natasha's most underwhelming record yet and sadly it has much to do with the music which is just really not up to par in comparison with previous Bat For Lashes records this thing is just for my taste too sparse it's too low-key Natasha is already not one of the loudest art and synth pop artists out there I wouldn't exactly call a lot of her singing emotionally potent anyway you know she's a capable singer but she's not known for these heart-wrenching vocal performances or anything so we're taking her already subtle style and toning it down even further and the result is a series of very patients testing tracks the intro cut I do is understandably quiet and beautiful though I love the omnichord chords if that is an omni chord on the cut it sounds beautiful against her wonderful voice and the song Joe's dream right after even though it is very spacing and is very slow-paced it still ramps the momentum of the record up a little bit and it does a good job of setting the narrative tone of the album but then as the tracklisting rolls on I'm getting this feeling that the record is really missing something and I think that is just a little more musical um a little more emotional fire from these vocal performances like on the song in God's house where the singing is just far too mild the synthetic instrumental here especially with the baseline and the percussion is really really redundant the song honeymooning alone as well which is just screaming for a passion and vocal performance especially given how Spacey the instrumental is it certainly had a room for it but it just doesn't have it the song could have been just a tear-jerking moonlit confessional but it's really just not Sunday love maybe my favorite track on the entire record does a good job of not just picking up the pace but also has some driving synth bass and percussion the vocals are just a little bit more lively but then the record only gets more sparse and underwhelming from there the very folky never forgive the angels moves at a glacial pace the song Close Encounters has one of the better vocal melodies on the entire record but the lone ethereal string sections this instance that backup Natasha's voice are not enough to make the track musically satisfying and be even Spacey a widow's peak which features some even quieter instrumentation and some spoken word that like whispered passages from Natasha I get that she's really heavy on the narrative on this one but there's just so little thus far on the record that is musically entertaining that it would even justify slowing things down even further into a track of this flavor the protagonists on this record is going through an incredible amount of emotional anguish and yet the singing on this record and the music on this record is so measured it's so flat it's so stoic it's not exactly enthralling a few tracks here and there do get louder as they progress but the intensity is so faint that there's very little in the way of payoff I'm just really not sure what to say about this record I'm pretty indifferent toward it you know I do like the concept there are some cool vocal melodies on this thing I think there were some interesting songs penned on this record but the vocal performances and the very bare instrumentals are just doing nothing for me like on the song I will love again one of the better vocal melodies on the record good chord progression and given the lyrics of the track could have been a pop anthem could have been a triumphant moment for the record but instead it's just instrumentally drab just as underwhelming as any other moment on the record you'd think that given this record is a story that the instrumentation would try to tell that story with emotional highs and emotional lows this is I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this record transition have you given this record a listen did you love it that you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

wuXJWdS9vNc,hi everyone seems a nice wet tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new il wise record scum with boundaries the il wise or maybe I love yous I'm not really sure they're a passion project featuring Zach Hill and flatlander aka Andy Morin who are notorious for the roles that they play in the noise industrial hip hop trio Death Grips but instead of making that music under this moniker they make I don't know the band's last record seemed a little bit too much like dicking around to me from Zack Hill's previous project I know he usually likes his his music his albums to be kind of boundary free and just let his artistic intuition take him wherever it may but the kind of fuzzy flat noise rock that this record served up said to me that Zack and Andy didn't really have much in the way of big plans or ambitions for this project however that is not the case on this new record over here in fact the Isle wise are sounding like a completely different band this time around not only is the production miles better but it's actually very detailed and instrumentally dense and this thing stylistically is a little more diverse - you know it's not just this kind of punky poppy noise rock project anymore they're elements of progressive rock and art rock and experimental rock woven into this thing there are moments that sound like Zack and Andy are delivering a little something for the Death Grips fans like on the track spiral to me where the vocals kind of have this deep husky yell to them that that seems very MC ride inspired not only that but the production is very synthetic it's very chaotic it's hard-hitting and while that's cool and all a bulk of this project the appeal of it for me reaches back to a lot of Zack Hills output in the 2000s because this this new album over here when compared to a lot of Zack Hill's solo releases and even some of this hella stuff this is similarly wild eclectic humorous absurd and slightly insane except now I think some of the productions some of the instrumental compositions on this thing rival even that old Zach Hill material dissonant and dreary pianos and kind of scattering electronic high hats on the opening track here even though that song is a little too disjointed for my taste I wish for an intro track it was a little more direct we have a kind of goofy waltz track with some beautiful almost like chamber esque instrumentation that seems like something pulled straight out of the sap of play book especially with just how ridiculous the lyrics are on this cut we have some peppy horns on stop Yellin in the museum that back up the driving rock instrumentation and the funky horns and bass groove on the track starts with a C and ends with E you are kind of surprised too this is a really versatile and dynamic record I didn't think Zach Hill and Andy would come through with an album that was so all over the place and in the best of ways because even though this album does jump all over the place it's kind of this wild sense of play and the lyrical absurdity as well as the the vocals that kind of tie it all together especially the lyrics which a lot of the time are utterly preposterous or border on some sort of sharp satire like on the song doing things that artists do and even though Zach and Andy indulge and a lot of different music styles on the saying there are plenty of relatively straightforward rock tracks on here with wild sense and weird sound effects and sound manipulations many of which feature some pretty tight choruses so it's not like this album is so experimental that it's going to be difficult to digest I'm thinking tracks like hey mind reader or peace and quiet which kind of has this really scuzzy distorted 90s grunge rock vibe to it a little underwhelming in my opinion but it's one of the songs and pretty much the only song I think that would have fits snugly into the tracklist of the last record that is how different this new album over here is from the previous Isle wise album I like the very punky she's a genius and the song roll your eyes which has some pretty cool vocal manipulations which I wish happened a little bit more on this record because I think the vocals are a bit of an Achilles heel on this thing um I don't know they're a little nasally a little run-of-the-mill there's nothing that special about the vocals in my opinion and the way they're doubled up on a lot of the mixes on this record gets old after a while and I have to maybe mention my favorite track on the entire record before I head out and that is uh I'm gonna have sex I'm gonna have sex this song gets me every time I love how off-the-wall some of these courses are and to me it just adds to the the wonderful character of this record it is a rock album that is riding the fringes and it couldn't give a shit about sounding or being cool it's not stylish it's not chic rather instead it is creative it's weird and it's borderline insane given the last record from these guys I wasn't really expecting this to be all that good I thought I'd just kind of get another boring lo-fi pop or rock record but instead I got a very instrumental impressive concisely written very punchy and hard-hitting and even catchy album and if you like Death Grips I think you'll find a lot of characteristics about this record that you'll like if anything about Death Grips is really missing from this band it's not just the rapping or MC ride but this isn't really taking itself all too seriously you know there's not that brooding sense of darkness about the Isle wise this is very much fun and a little tongue-in-cheek and incredibly playful I'm feeling a strong 72 like eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen is your love it did you hate it what would you rate you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this odious album the Isle is forever 
YPx2dv4nR98,this new 21 savage Metro boomin mixtape it's not good this thing is collaborative project featuring up-and-coming street rapper and recent 2016 double XL freshmen 21 savage and famed producer Metro boomin who's been at it for years but recently he's been dropping one hit mixtape and single after another with artists like me goes young thug Kanye West future Drake Travis Scott Gucci Mane's so because of the name recognition on this thing I originally went into this project hoping for something good because 21 savage is a new fresh face who could bring some interesting ideas into the fold that currently popular artists aren't already and Metro boomin I mean that's a really huge endorsement for 21 savage to be working with such a heavy hitter of a producer and I know that Savage has been on Metro boomin x' production before I'm just saying it's kind of a big deal to be doing a full-length double billed project with him but this project is pretty much a dud now I know you're going to say Anthony fuck you you suck you don't know what hip-hop is I'm gonna kill you you know I get it you'll say anything to keep me from saying this but this is boring I have no interest in hearing this guy monotone mumble his way through nine of Metro boomin 'he's sleepiest beats some of which are pretty good they feature very eerie beautiful spacey melodies I mean the the beats here definitely have a sad kind of dark mood to them like on the song no heart and the song X featuring future which is maybe my favorite cut on the entire project I never looked forward to a future feature so much because Savage unfortunately adds so little to these instrumentals as he is one of the most underwhelming rappers I have heard this year I don't know what it is with double XL co-signing these rappers that sound like they barely have a pulse and honestly I'm not even holding this guy to a really high lyrical standard there are some pretty cringe-worthy bars in the mix on this project the main issue I have with this thing is just savages delivery which I think sucks the life out of these beats and I get that lyrics are just totally in the trash right now in 2016 nobody's anticipating or looking for for good lyrics I get that I know that but can't the rapper at least be expected to be entertaining to listen to can I at least have that expectation there is an occasional moment on this thing where savage sounds a little more angry or he freaks out just a little bit like on the song bad guy but for a majority of the time we're getting cuts like feel it where I could feel it in there I could feel it in the air I could feel it in the air I could feel it in the air I could feel it in there there's not much to this thing the best thing is Metro boomin production I can give this thing credit for being a bit of a little mood project but if I wanted to listen to a cross between moody music and trap I would listen to a previous project that featured Metro boomin and like future at least future has a sound 21 savage while his lyrics aren't really any more any less interesting than a lot of futures lyrics he's so nondescript and that's really my biggest issue with him you know I'm not here to question whether or not he's real or anything like that I have no doubt that he walks the talk that he talks but lyrically sonically he just doesn't bring anything to the table for me this thing it's not good transition have you given this mixtape this project a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this project and don't kill me either please appreciate that thank you 21 savage Metro boomin forever 
wk0nPWE6wfY,hi everyone Tony Hawk pro skater for Sega Dreamcast here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new apathy album handshakes with snakes apathy is a Connecticut rapper who has been carrying the torch for the Golden Age of 90s jazz rap hardcore hip hop boom bap just the whole East Coast hip hop thing he's an East Coast rapper who actually sounds like an East Coast rapper and he's been going pretty strong lately with some good solo releases like 2011's honky Kong the album he dropped a few years after that Connecticut casual which had a lot of conceptual tracks about his home state a place that I am also from which is maybe why it struck a chord with moi apathy as much as I like the guy I know and maybe you know as well that his appeal is nice especially today when his style is pretty much old-school hip-hop I mean he's more of a purist than a lot of the revivalists the young revivalists who are making this same sort of boom bat music today because he does not go into a song without a strong sample some kind of concept or topic and after listening to numerous apathy albums at this point I think it's safe to say he's a little stuck in his ways but it's his devotion to this purity and this recipe that I think keeps the quality of his music high now I might disagree with some of his opinions on modern rap I like quite a few of the rappers who he might kind of disregard as being bohemian or emo but you know at least he's authentic enough to give his opinion because truth be told musicians are some of the pickiest people on the planet when it comes to music even if they won't admit it because nobody wants to be the guy that everybody hates because you've got some opinion that people disagree with it's just a headache but but not for me I love this and apathy as well he doesn't really care if you like him if he did he'd be following folding to every trend in hip-hop imaginable he cares more instead about his craft which is how he wins listeners over because it seems he puts a great deal of effort into his songs his production is usually good his lyrics are usually entertaining blunt maybe a little violent sexual but clever and conceptual as well his albums are usually pretty well sequenced and there's not a whole lot in terms of filler or redundancy and apathy has a sound I know an apathy song when I hear one his production is usually pretty Bumi and vivid loaded with a strong sample that somehow helps along the lyrical concept of the track reinforces the story he's telling or the point he's trying to make like on the song pay your dues which features a pretty prominent vocal sample from the song can't hurry love and while the sample is really obvious I like that he flipped it in such a way where it's almost like this vocal was sung specifically to be on this track and I like the lyrical concept of the track too it's essentially about rappers who are desperate to become famous want to become overnight sensations and don't want to put in the work don't want to show the amount of passion that you need in order to sort of run the long-term game that a guy like apathy has been working for decades now or on the song Charlie Brown where you'll find these silly Charlie Brown samples and apathy essentially uses that to back up the I guess world that he's painting that in a way is kind of against him whether it be because he emotionally feels crushed and just things aren't going his way and maybe the fear that he displays subtly about the changing landscape of hip-hop and and maybe he's got some anxiety about where does he sort of fit in this brave new world for the genre that he loves so much and then there's the song Pieces of Eight which I will admit I do find a tad corny but I do admire the fact that apathy really went all out and tried to make some literal pirate rap on this one maybe that ocean air that he's getting 24/7 is going a little bit to his head but still regardless with the sampled vocals on the chorus talking about Buccaneers and preachers overt again we have some literal pirate rap going on here with some heavy nautical themes coming through on the lyrics anchors up bitches on beaches treasure maps even when I don't particularly enjoy where apathy is taking a song or an idea I got to give them credit for going all out with it however there are some other focused lyrical topics on this record that I do like such as on the song rap is not pop where apathy sort of draws this artistic line in between vets like himself and other people who are sort of new to hip hop only enjoy it casually don't really understand the genres history and don't really care about it in general it's just kind of a piece of cheap entertainment for them if hip hop were to disappear they would just gravitate towards something else whereas if that were to happen in the case of apathy it would be devastating and then beyond that we have some great feature tracks on here with some incredibly raw guest rappers such as self-titled on the song Ammon raw which is one of my favorite tracks on here stand out line for me on this cut is when he is rapping about someone choking him but it just felt like a turtleneck the song blow you head off with marvelous and blackest and the beat was a little too mild for me wish it went a little bit harder but verses were quality no such thing one of my favorite cuts on here huge boom bap banger gigantic gang chorus vocals that are hilarious and just totally reminds me of like some 90s hardcore hip-hop where everybody's like screaming all at once it's exciting I like the Wildhorn leads on the cut two that are sampled and woven in with much care and got to give it up to Spit gems for the raspy stand most hilarious and one of the most entertaining verses on this entire project but apathy in a lot of ways sort of saves the best for last though I do have to give it to Ono his verse on Charlie Brown was legitimately depressing a little sad though that was obviously his intention but still best for last Twista bun be and be real cypress hill on the back end of this thing on the last couple tracks now with apathy of course there are some moments here and there where he drops a few lines that just make me groan slightly there was this one line about a year you're like so shallow you're like a pool water it just hurt my head so hard I could barely recollect it and the line about him being from a chi double hockey sticks I get it some of the things he says are tongue-in-cheek they're cute they're a little funny they're a little playful but occasionally I think his similes can be a little too basic a little too simple like somebody else could have penned this I want to hear a rhyme that only you could have freaking penned and I think sometimes he just leans a little bit too hard on the idea that this bar this verse needs to be blunt and direct just could have been some more interesting wordplay here and there on a few bars now as far as the production on this thing goes enjoyed a lot I love the awesome and hard-hitting funk rock break on the song run for your life which is accented with these wonderful soul music whose killer organs and guitar leads on the song Moses with that hard-hitting beat are great too one of the most exciting beats on the entire record I think and the dreary slow beachside guitars on the closing title track are absolutely depressing and set the tone really well for the reflective lyrics that turn up in each verse and the really eclectic sampling on the song attention deficit disorder from the from the band hair the song let the Sun Shine in which is a kind of jaunty piece of 60s pop with socially aware socially conscious lyrics definitely not something I would think rap sample when I listen to it but apathy flips it I don't know in a way creatively but also he doesn't doctor it up too much it's interesting he was able to successfully rap over this track and and pull an effective beat out of it I wish it did a little bit more though especially on the chorus though apathy speedy rapping certainly does make up for that because it is a good change of pace at point on the album outside of that I don't really have anything to profound to say about this record it's another very good record from apathy in some respects I think it's a little better than Connecticut casual I think it's punchier I think it flows a little better there aren't any sampling choices that I think were so egregious or ridiculous that I completely just got soured on the song the features list is certainly a lot more impressive but in other respects I wish there was a stronger concept pulling all these tracks together like with Connecticut casual all that being said though if you like your east coast rappers to sound like they're from the east coast and you miss those days of the 90s hardcore hip hop buh-buh-buh-buh but you still wanted to sound kind of modern because apathy is production style is very crisp it is certainly of the digital age then I see no reason why not to check out this record I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing tritter transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with this review apathy handshakes with smirks forever 
T8awRqOAZMc,Fantan no coming at you hit you up with a another view of the new clams casino record 32 levels cloud rap legend producer clams casino famous for his slow heavy syrupy production style which helped build the careers of people like ASAP rocky and Lil B and I think in a way you could also a credit to him of the building in popularity of a lot of this really atmospheric spacey hip-hop production that you hear today in the mainstream some of which was produced by him as clean of casino has collaborated with some pretty famous artists over the years and he's also pretty well known for a couple instrumental mixtapes that are very popular instrumentals from songs that he had done with other artists but clams casino has been around for a long time he's relevant for years but it's only until now he's dropping his commercial full-length debut a record that features a very tight 12 tracks and an additional 12 instrumentals of all the tracks from the album if you get the deluxe version and this for better or for worse is not an instrumental album in fact nearly all the songs here feature a slew of vocal guests people like Vince staples his appearance on one track makes for one of my favorite cuts on the record a truly unapologetic banger you have Colella mikky ekko as well as sam herring of future islands fame and more and of course ASAP rocky on this thing and little B has 3 separate appearances if you don't include the intro track where I'm pretty sure I heard his voice but by now you guys are familiar with my usual gripes about producer curated albums they're usually not that great not that concise the vocal artists that come on to the record don't typically bring their best performances but for claims casino I will go into this album making an exception going into this record with a positive outlook because if there is any producer out there who I would love to hear make a commercial record it is him because I do think it sound is so unique it has been so influential and maybe he has it in him to put together a good commercial project especially since he has a trademark sound that he can easily stick to from the beginning to the end of the record and ask to be expected the entire project here is holistically wavy the vast atmospheres on this thing remind me of like Chapel sized high ceilings and marble columns it's the sound of pure Majesty and there's a range of moods and sounds on here even though many of the tracks feature that slow-mo Clams Casino sound some tracks are heavy even though they move at a glacial pace they are kind of aggressive while others are very gentle melodic and emotional you can tell the clams and his collaborators are clearly trying to pull it some heart strings on these cuts both of these sides are on display on two of the little B tracks on here the song witness which is the aggressive one of the two and then the title track which I think features one of little bees most emotional performances in a while and there are also moments on this thing where clamps Casino comes out of his comfort zone or at least shows us a different side of himself that he's not typically putting out there on record he tries his hand at some alternative R&B on one cut with Sam du which features some quickly swelling synthesizer chords and twinkle II lead melodies the song itself is okay I'm not in love with Sam's voice or anything he holds his own again the tune doesn't Wow me but still I do love clams casinos heavy production on this thing if anything this song shows to me that he can kind of apply his sound to an entirely different genre and it still works and on the song back to you we get a legitimate pop tune on here with a bouncy bass line and some percussion a great lead vocal melody from Kelly's at row I'm sorry if I'm not pronouncing that correctly but even though her voice isn't super powerful or showy or anything like that it's a little cute reminds me a bit of a postal service song but on the song into the fire clamps casino pushes so far outside his comfort zone that he's just kind of making I don't know something generic it sounds almost as if another artists were ripping him off or something the product just a little nondescript to me as much as I do like the atmosphere claims casino surrounds his tracks with I do see it as a bit of a crutch for him occasionally because when he's not relying on it as much to make his song sound so great and give his songs dynamics there's not much else to listen to and the other issues that there are maybe a few other duds in the track listing here the intro track doesn't really do that good of a job of setting the tone of this LP all that well and then the cut featuring both little bien ASAP rocky while it is okay it's not really the exciting explosive volcanic crossover that I think I and many other fans of these two artists had been waiting for the clothes are on this thing is pretty beautiful the interlude tracks skull it is great but I just wish it was longer you know would have been great as an instrumental cut and that's another thing I think this project could have used some more instrumental cuts I mean Plains Casino he's a producer he makes great instrumentals why not through an instrumental cut on here too you know that aren't just kind of being given to us with the instrumentals in the deluxe version all that being said though I think this is a pretty good record it's not as beautiful or as large and conceptual or ambitious as I was hoping for but if you've enjoyed clamps casinos production it is an enjoyable collection of tracks that shows clams versatility and also that he can continue doing what he's known for just as well as he's known for doing it oh and and finally I have to say the Sam herring track not as fiery and passionate as I'd hoped but unfortunately you know they just played a real low-key on that cut was hoping it would explode a little bit more toward the end and Sam wood would give to us the the fiery vocal performance I was crossing my fingers for when the subtract started but unfortunately it didn't end up happening and the song just ended up being I don't know a little too low-key for my expectations for my taste really because the song does strike me as a little mundane but that's it for my complaints about this thing I'm feeling a light to a decent seven on this record if you're into clamps casino if you enjoyed any of his production in the past even if you haven't listened to his instrumental records don't miss this thing because there are some great on here transition have you given this clams casino record of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's sweaty outside I want to hide in a cool or place punch my face don't do that that's not nice forever 
MmaNvsGfcoY,it's your boy Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our favorite tracks of the week segment where I tell you guys the tracks that I enjoyed quite a bit from this past week recommend em to you and put links to them down in the description box so you can listen to them yourself it's get a little dark in here let's uh let's adjust put some light on the situation all right moving on we do these segments raw by the way if you want to support this segment hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description box basically anything you buy on amazon if you live in the US we get kickback from it it does not add to your overall price and a little more light on the situation but BAM alright before we get into the favorite tracks over here let's get into the worst track of the week on this video over here I really went in on that one there was quite a bit of competition for the worst track of the week it could have been the new Britney Spears and gez song although that tracks only crime is that it has a gez feature and a lot of songs have those these days unfortunately and also that it is I don't know slightly generic not painfully generic but slightly generic it's kind of weird hearing all of these uh stale mm Zehra pop divas try to land on like new bouncy EDM trap flavoured instrumentation it's kind of awkward but whatever so that track it's bad but not quite worst track of the week bad then we had the new Katy Perry anthem rise which is another overly dramatic Katy Perry ballad the light keeps adjusting the BAM sorry which I'm sure her fans will undoubtedly use to overcome their myriad of first world problems but even that was not as bad as what I think is the worst track of the week and that is the new Good Charlotte single life can't get much better which is a jaunty pop punk anthem that will have you thinking if life can't get much better than what we're currently being shown on this song I might as well kill myself so anyway we're gonna move on to the best tracks of the week favourite tracks of the week again all these linked down there in the description all right moving on to quays with your side featuring Nancy Anderson this is an abstract little piece of electronic music with some beautiful lead vocals from of course Nene and Nancy Anderson it's got a lot of different shades of electronic music within it so it's hard to lay one single genre on it but if you like some of those artpop electronic music sort of dubstep inspired producers like James Blake but early James Blake like from his first record from his second record I think you're gonna find a lot to like on this song moving on justice safe and sound justice French electro house duo they are back and with a bit of a vengeance with this fantastic new single unfortunately the duo really couldn't get their shit together too much on their sophomore record had a bit of a sophomore slump but with this new single over here faith for me is kind of restored because the groove is great instrumentation is great that slap bass line is fucking amazing my mouth is officially watering for this new justice record so I don't know hopefully they can bring it back on this new album especially given how good this track is I remember from the the last LP I was a little on the fence about the singles that I was hearing but there is no doubt in my mind that if the rest of the tracks on this record are produced this well and have grooves this irresistible we could be in for another great Justus album moving on Jaguar ma-ma with the song Obi one a band that I believe I didn't care too much for their last record unfortunately so much so that not much of the album has stuck with me however this new track over here sounds like a beautiful little alternative dance gem left over from the 90s that's just kind of being unearthed today I like the track a lot I think the vocals could use a little bit more character but the grooves are great melodies are great production is punchy I'm just really liking the the way this song makes me wanna dance a little bit so I'm just gonna leave it at that all right a couple more Jeff Rossen stock with festival song mr. Rosen stock we love over here at the needle drop his last full-length album we cool very great pop punk record with sarcastic hilarious very self-aware lyrics and this new song over here is no slouch when it comes to all of those things to me sounds a lot like all the things I expect and all the things I enjoy from Jeff Rosen stock just with a different lyrical topic so you know I I don't really have any uh anything else to say other than that I think this is a good pop punk track with some funny lyrics clever lyrics and some of you know throttling guitars very energetic instrumentation very smart pop punk I'll leave it at that preoccupations formerly Vietcong have come out with a new track titled degraded and it seems like now with this new name change their music has become so much more depressing and dark and almost menacing in a way still very much post-punk music but definitely elements of noise and drone and maybe even goth rock getting worked into there so it's been kind of cool to see the band evolve on these new couple of tracks under this new name so hopefully that evolution continues and maybe an maybe maybe a darker record overall will be a cool change of pace for the band so kind of anticipating that and finally we will give a shout out to the new MeeGo single now featuring gucci mane gucci mane now that he's out of prison is really doing the rounds not only is he dropping one music video afterward after another one collaboration after another he just had a new one with young thug which I thought was just okay but this new feature he has on this MeeGo song is fantastic it's not anything entirely new for me gose but you do get those catchy ad-libs you do get that punchy trap production with the rich melodic keys and Gucci Mane holds his own on the track he's entertaining to say the least and those are the favourite tracks of the week again they are all linked down there in the description box along with our amazon associates link just hit it up if you live in the u.s. used to buy shit you were planning on buying anyway on Amazon you also got the worst tracks of the week as well that good charlotte song terrible the album is probably terrible too not sure if i'm gonna touch it might just want to stay away from it because the the single is trash and we're gonna we're gonna leave it at that thanks for watching everybody I hope you have a good rest of your day rest of your weekend and enjoy some of these songs bye bye forever and one more thing wanted to mention that their new tracks out from Swain formerly this routine of Sal and also tobacco you may know his work from black Mouth super rainbow as well and that is it those songs are also linked down there in the description bye 
T0TQ5e75qx8,in ethnic uh who's there blank face blank face who blank face review or I'm gonna subscribe from your jailing come on openly oh okay hi everyone breasts any feet Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new schoolboy q record blank face this is the latest project from black hippies from Top Dawg entertainment greatest MC mister school boy q following up his commercial breakout album oxymoron which dropped a few years ago I myself enjoyed this record quite a bit actually I enjoyed it a little more at the end of the year than I did around the release date it was originally dropped there was some pretty good hits off of this thing like collard greens studio smooth kind of slow jam for Q though I did think it was kind of underwhelming but what was impressive about this record is that it had some of Q's most ambitious tracks yet which were intensely personal songs like Hoover Street as well as the the title track and then beyond that you had all these mean eccentric bangers with colorful progressive production really expressive and raspy lead vocals from cue songs like Lowe's awesome and gangster and another thing that's good about this record is that it's a pretty tight album it's not loaded with filler tracks it's not loaded with skits or just songs that didn't really need to be there or we're just redundant so going into this new record over here I had no reason not to expect the same thing especially given how concise and and catchy some of the lead singles & tracks from this thing have been like Tukey knows part two as well as groovy Tony even the song that part which I found a little underwhelming while it is a little more low-key than I would like for a single and I'm not really sure why anybody gives Kanye West to pass on this verse I mean yeah he has lots of energy on here but the okay okay okay okay okay okay I mean it sounds like a line Cowell would write so going into this album I was expecting honestly some kind of narrative or theme or concept or something that the whole album together especially given that progressive and ambitious hip-hop albums is what Top Dawg entertainment is known for and unfortunately none of that happens here we're actually not even close to a concept being a thing on this project if there is one it's just so vague and miniscule and faint that it doesn't really impact the overall experience of the record the closest thing we have to a theme on this project are the mentions of gang life and drug-dealing that you may already remember from Q's past records but they're a little less detailed here like they're not rooted in the personal experiences that he was really going into great detail about on his previous record I mean I get that he is clearly rapping from the standpoint of a handful of characters that he's come up with in his own head but the thing is that the world that these characters live in seem to be so much less vibrant and interesting than when Schoolboy Q is just rapping about something from personal experience and there are also at least a handful of tracks on this thing that don't really seem like they work into what little chunks of narrative are sort of thrown to the listener on this project not only that but blank-faced is not really the the pointed and direct and focused album oxymoron was either there are 17 tracks on this thing it's over an hour and a lot of these songs are total duds in my opinion like the unnecessarily long and kind of uneventful intro track torch that kicks this whole thing off just way too much time given to this thing considering how low-key it is if it wasn't for the the passionate and the fiery crescendo chorus I guess you can call it a chorus the song was kind of loosely structured from Anderson PAC the track would be totally boring but this track is indicative of a lot of cuts on this record you know there are some cool vocal manipulations on this song and the instrumental and the vocals generally come together into kind of a psychedelic experience there's certainly a character to this record that stands out to me but a lot of the lyrics and the songwriting just are totally forgettable like on the very chilly and low-key song by any means necessary which features some vocals from Kendrick Lamar and the trademark sort of deeply pitched buh-buh-buh vocals that popped up all over his last record - this track just kind of sounds like it to pimp a butterfly left over as a result then there's the total snoozer no you're wrong which features I don't know these very loose piano loops and Schoolboy Q in this really aimless way sort of wrapping sort of singing the track is disappointingly lethargic and really sloppy - he sounds like a I don't know ODB on Dramamine but the worst track on the record has to be big body ride a big my hands write a book we're horrible chorus on this thing can't imagine they spent much time on these lyrics and then the instrumental features this ridiculous splurt e horns and pieces of percussion and some handclaps that just go on and on and on they cycle incessantly this instrumental and many others sometimes even on tracks that I like don't really progress as much as I would like them to especially as they're switching from a verse to a chorus now the album isn't all bad there are actually lots of highlights among the 17 tracks here I love the song dope dealer which is incredibly funny eccentric and features these hashtag ad-libs on his verse trash courier song John Muir has one of the catchiest flows on the entire record funky soul samples awesome horn sort of flare up on the hook some beautifully smooth chorus vocals as well the instrumental is beautiful and it pairs nicely with schoolboy Q's junkyard dog rasping contrast I should also mention that the now extended version of groovy Tony now has a verse from Jadakiss a really good addition to that track and I like the little vocal break that happens at one point in the song to some of the tracks on this record actually surprised me with the fantastic amount of detail well there are a lot of elements to some of these beats though not always do they add to the quality of the song like on the obnoxious singing vocals on the song straight ballin like a beat Jimmy Ronan meanwhile other cuts like black thoughts which to me are very poetic and more thoughtful lyrically feel really loose kind of like a potpourri of sounds that don't really make sense together from the very loose piano samples to the kind of flat lifeless drumbeat hanging in the background and cues flow bordering on spoken word and right after this track we have the very melodic and passionate title track which is mostly dominated by Anderson PAC a good performance from him but again with the lack of organization generally on this record the song kind of feels like an interlude or kind of a transitional moment that isn't really complementing anything I feel like this album could have been sequenced in any number of ways and you would have ended up with roughly the same experience I think the song had great potential to be a closer or something but instead the album continues on for another couple of tracks because the album delivers to us next are really vocally unimpressive performance from Miguel and a terrible hook on this track as well I mean while I didn't really care for the song studio at least that track was kind of pretty and smooth and had enough sense to give you the verse and give you the chorus in a measured manner this song just does not know when to stop and that's kind of this album in general Q did not kill his babies I feel like there are a lot of songs on here a lot of ideas on here that should have made it onto the cutting room floor because throughout this album I think there are a lot of unsuccessful experiments tracks that were not fully groomed to the point where they felt developed instrumentally lyrically sometimes this thing isn't as focused or doesn't go into as much detail or the level of detail I have expected and enjoyed from Q in the past and overall the experience of the record in my opinion is kind of tiring q and his collaborators his producers on here just did not know when to pull the reins in and as a result here we have a pretty sloppy project I think among the 17 tracks here there's probably a decent album but the fat and the redundant moments and the unnecessary moments were just not cut along with all these a knee cuts to that I don't think we're doing the album any favors it's almost as if schoolboy q wanted to have all these vocal moments that were off the wall and is playful as a lot of the very theatrical and almost schizophrenic voices on Kendrick Lamar's to pimp a butterfly but here they're just so much more unfulfilled because there's not a whole lot of substance to this record I'm feeling a decent strong five on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here the best year the best what should I have you next hit the like if you like but you probably don't because you hate the fact that I don't like this album more than you I'm sorry you don't cry it's going to be okay we're all going to get through it Anthony Fanta no schoolboy q blank bass forever 
uw9gtldMQfs,hmm hi everyone your theny dad Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bad bad not good record for this is the 4th full-length LP from contemporary Toronto jazz outfit bad bad not good and as you may already know I've been a pretty big fan of their past efforts specifically BB n g and b BN g - where for the most part the band was delivering these fiery exciting renditions of popular hip hop instrumentals of course with a jazz flavor but as the band progressed and this totally makes sense they started to incorporate more original material into their records bringing us to the album BBN g3 and even though i think some of the sounds on this record were pretty inventive and it was cool to hear the band put their creative juices to the test there was something I kind of missed on this record and it was the fiery improvisational performances that we're so exciting about the first two bad bad not good records so with this new record over here I'm kind of hoping that makes a return and also I was pretty excited to listen to how the band would incorporate the impressive list of musical guests on this thing Kate Renata appears on this thing of a bit of a tit-for-tat situation I'm sure because bad bad not good appeared on his record also Sam herring of future islands saxophonist extraordinaire Colin Stetson Charlotte de Wilson and also rapper Mick Jenkins and we also have to mention that bad bad not good is not just a trio any more at least on this record they are now a quartet with Leland Witte on saxophone he collaborated with them in the past and now it seems that he is a full time member on this project now overall with this project there are a lot of things to like but the reservations that I have are roughly the same reservations that I had with the band's last album the band is exploring some interesting sounds and moods and textures on these three or four-minute cuts like with the very eerie and spacious track and that too the very fat lead synth bass lines on the Kate Renata track lavender those really stick out the very dream slow and sensual choppy's paradise was a pretty interesting moment and the closing cut on here sounds like a densely layered and very ritzy piece of Lounge jazz straight out of the 70s once again bad bad not good comes off as versatile but some of these performances on here are kind of mild and not exactly attention-grabbing in my opinion however the saving grace of this project though is how impressively the band incorporates their guests like on the song confessions part two with Colin Stetson there's some serious chemistry on this track I loved Collins just very avant-garde and strange saxophone playing style and how it works into the funky instrumentation hanging in the background his cyclical arpeggios all over this track work really well and the piano playing and the drum playing just comes off so muscular on this track you could tell that they were really you know playing hard on this cut and I like that this is one of the longer songs on the project to the band and Colin Stetson really gave this track time to kind of simmer the title track is one of the more dynamic cuts and the track listing here it has all these very chill instrumental passages which are accented with these speedy solos and syncopated drums and pianos some fluttering saxophone - and then the other star of the show are some of the vocal features on here like with Sam herring and Charlotte de Wilson both of whom appear on tracks which sound like vintage soul throwbacks and actually go over really well not only because bad bad not good with their musicality with their performances and the production on this thing really capture that old-school Sheen that old-school soul sound but Sam herring and Charlotte do a really great job of capturing that vibe as well with their voices especially Charlotte she seems very much cut from this kind of cloth Sam adjusts though to this kind of instrumentation really well with his raspy passionate delivery I will say though maybe my least favorite track on the whole project was the song with Mick Jenkins not because I think either artist did a horrible job on the song it's just I don't really feel like as much chemistry on this cut it felt like just any old bad bad not good instrumental and then Mick just kind of appearing on top rapping and there's a bit of a long winded ham-fisted chorus on this thing that is just not memorable at all still though despite those complaints this is just kind of another good bad bad not good record and with this project they are clearly maturing as a band and trying out new things and seeing a lot of success unfortunately the project isn't as cohesive nor is it the pedal to the floor experience that I was looking for but the vocal guests and the added instrumentation that they've been throwing into the mix in their music seems to be going over really well and unlike the last bad bad not good record rarely do the instrumentals here sound overly complex or kind of stiff with all the added instrumentation surrounding the bass and the drums and the pianos you know they're really some fluid grooves all over this thing a bad bad not good they seem like they're still kind of in a transitional phase here and who knows how long that'll be as long as they continue to experiment and try new things and as long as they're doing that they're going to keep things interesting I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this album bad bad not good for whatever 
LKQqAr4D9Qg,uh hey everyone so thin he spent tan oh here the Internet's dry and it's time for a review of the new woods album city sun-eater in the river of light this is the latest full-length album from semi psychedelic folk rock band woods they were born out of the loaf eye craze of the late 2000s but since have pursued a much clearer and more balanced sound the band has numerous records under their belts at this point many of which I have covered some of them I love some of them I didn't really like all that much but usually the band drops at least several tracks that I think are pretty good and it's been interesting from record record to see the band evolve into the group that they are today now woods continues to be recognizable as the same band they still use those trademark falsetto vocals that they're known for which I like but might not be for everybody they still use that jammy full crock instrumentation their production though it has gotten clear is still a little rough around the edges but since the band broke in the 2000s they had delivered fuller recordings with more instrumentation I think they have incorporated sunnier elements into their once very dreary music especially on the 2012 album bend beyond which in my opinion is woods warmest release yet but this new album over here is actually pretty sunny - and in a way I think this new record over here is a little bit of a high point for this chapter of woods career because finally all of the very incremental alterations the band has been making to their sound from one album to another have culminated into this very sharp punchy direct folk rock record it's just kind of one concise song after another with all these very blissful sweet summery melodies lots of detailed instrumental embellishments in this record and and very weird turns of phrase coming out of the lyrics I think there are some different influences going into this new project over here - the band has really developed on the groove end of things sometimes the bass and the surprise horn sections on this record and the drums come together into a funk that seems almost Buddhist band inspired though there are many other instrumental funk bands that woods could be pulling from but but still there's a similar vibe there and the band is really sounding tighter than ever now not so tight and regimental II written that they can't throw in like a jammy instrumental passage or or a drum solo like on the song creature comfort but this is the clear sense of direction that I've ever heard on a woods record I like the country vibe on the song morning light the sheen on the instrumentation of this track is beautiful there's a pedal steel on this track as well I think that's very pretty and I can't quite tell the lyrics do they tell of someone's death there's some kind of out-of-body experience on the song politics are free I'm pretty interested in the lyrics on this track as well because it seems like the song is about I don't know a sunny day in a world that's going to hell as the lyrics and the refrain on this track say in a world of let's tune out tonight and I love how woods even though they are writing sunnier poppier music there's still a subtle element of darkness there like on the song can't see at all the refrain it sounds like can see it all but it also sounds like can't see at all it adds this weird subversive I don't know idea of blindness into the track the very mystical Airy woodwinds on the song too or beautiful addition the one downside of this record is as woods explores different instrumental flavours on here occasionally the songwriting is a little lackluster not that memorable sort of seems like it's just falling onto the back burner as woods have just incorporated these different instrumental pallets and grooves into their tracks now so as a result some of the refrains just really aren't that catchy like on the songs Sun City creeps and also Jeremy Earl even though I do continue to enjoy his falsetto vocals it does become a little much when he insists on doing his background vocals in the same falsetto and as woods have continued to change their sound in so many different ways it might be worth considering in the future to explore different vocal options as well since I mean at one time we're talking that a very dreary lo-fi folk act and now we're putting in soulful horn sections and funky bass and drum grooves I mean really it seems like the sky is the limit with woods creativity at this point as long as they don't choose to limit themselves all that being said though I think this is a pretty good woods record a very solid effort from the band some of the catchiest songs they've ever delivered yet some of the best production they've ever offered on a record yet some tracks do pale in comparison to others and occasionally I do feel like Woods's Sound has worn on me since they've dropped so many records so many records over the past decade or so hopefully some more exciting alterations are coming in the future I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this album you're the best have a good one eat some vegetables stay hydrated forever 
6k5bkCY0ims,I'm viola hey everyone Brittany Spears tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new dear huff record the magic indie vets Deerhoof are back with their three billionth record the magic proving themselves once again to be one of the most prolific and consistent bands in the underground today and this new record of theirs actually reminds me quite a bit of an older album of theirs which came out about 10 years ago at this point the record offend Maggie which for Deerhoof was an incredibly distorted brittle and straightforward record especially considering how kooky and colorful their last few projects had been runners for and friend opportunity and then right after putting out this very sunburned kind of loaf I almost garage indie rock record with offend Maggie deer hoof dipped right back into coming through with these very colorful versatile albums experimenting occasionally with electronics and samples on breakup song and la Isla Bonita but now I feel like they're almost bringing it back to basics again with this new project because they kind of have this rough distorted sunburnt sound once again and this garage rock aesthetic at least on some of the tracks here this album is a little all over the place like any Deerhoof album is although the lyrics are still as playful and as innocent as usual and there's also something kind of trippy and psychedelic about the magic maybe you call what is trippy and psychedelic about it the magic especially on the track criminals of the dream were at the intro of this song we have these very glossy very slow glacial synths also the lazy glazed-over vocal harmonies on the song learning to apologize effectively I thought that was pretty sleepy also another synthetic moment was the interlude slash cover of I don't want to set the world on fire which I didn't kill her at all I feel like Deerhoof did everything they could on this track to just not capture the original soul of the of the song and instead dispose of it and replace it with just loads of odd quirk another surprise change of pace is the song acceptance speech which has these very steady rhythm guitars that sound like something out of some kind of grand 80s hard rock anthem which was pretty fun to hear Deerhoof work at that angle although I don't think the brittle production really complimented the sound they were going for on this track while I usually do find Deerhoof sound the way they record their records and mix their records to be very stimulating because usually very high very distorted blaring very stimulating and attention-grabbing it doesn't necessarily complement every track here however this sound does very much compliment the garage rock tracks which surprisingly do not feature any lead vocals from Satomi who has dominated vocally many of dear hosts records since she joined the band and now we're just kind of getting these straightforward garage rock tracks it's cool that Deerhoof can perform this sound like on that ain't no life to me or dispossessed or plastic thrills which to me is a cut that sort of sounds like something off of a Stooges record it proves deer have to be versatile like we've known the band is but I don't think the band really brings anything to this sound they sound like many other groups who are putting out music very much like this today except maybe with a better instrumental performance because there is something to be said for the fantastic guitar work that usually goes into a dear Huff record as well as the amazing drumming from Greg now these hard-hitting and short blitzkrieg of garage rock pair very interestingly with these funky groovy kind of spazzy rock cuts that are colorful and and somewhat hard to predict at times specifically with the song nurse me which might be my favorite cut on the entire record and we have a couple of cuts here that sort of feel like they're part of an exercise and musical ad D where we have very short tracks with abrupt endings and very basic song structures songs like debut and little Hollywood and model behavior tracks that I like the grooves of these songs I think they make for interesting ideas Deerhoof is showing off their creativity on these tracks but I think their focus is a little lacking but despite my complaints there are plenty of highlights on this record it's another fun Deerhoof album I love tracks like Cafe mania hope I'm pronouncing that correctly learning to apologize effectively which I mentioned earlier the funky but sort of depressing life is suffering which has a wonderful ascending refrain of it's another good record for Deerhoof you know there's not really too much more I can say about it than that it's stimulating it's childish but in a good way it's puzzling but occasionally distracted and inconsistent I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with my thoughts on this album you're the best

QYrsp1dyM-I,hey what up everybody Antoine Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is by now just checking the audio over here looks good ah okay alright it is time for our favorite tracks of the week segment where I recommend to you guys a bunch of songs from this past week that entertained me so much that I want to tell you guys to listen to them they are all linked on our website the needle drop comm check all the links down there in the description box okay and we will send you guys straight to those songs via these links okay let's go through these tracks get these recommendations done but first let's get into our worst track of the week segment this in my opinion is the worst song I've heard all week it is the new cut from Crystal Castles featuring a brand new singer not Alice glass so Ethan cath has essentially found an Alice glass clone and worked her into the Crystal Castles sound or whatever the track is titled the concrete and the track is a total mess it sounds awful the beat is bad the vocals are bad it sounds like someone doing a Crystal Castles parody not like something you would expect from Crystal Castles given the Alice glass had left the duo you would think that Ethan would use this as an opportunity to do something a little new refreshing maybe just go down a different path but no he's simply trying to recreate the same chemistry with somebody else who's far less interesting so that in a nutshell is the new Crystal Castles track concrete moving on to songs that are better we have defiled with the cut fear from above this is a grimy brutal piece of death metal liking the the fact that these guys have a bit of a very blood caked and buzzsaw tone guitar sort of old-school death metal sound but they play kind of a modern young animalistic brutality you know it's not just the same kind of old blueprint really phoning it in by the numbers death metal you know sure it does fit the genre in every way that I can imagine you know it's not like anything too exciting or reinventing the genre or anything like that but I did think that the performance on this thing was muscular it was crazy it was off-the-wall so I got to give it to them for that then moving on Gucci Mane first stay out the feds some people were talking about online how Gucci Mane might have had a clone or something so he just dropped this new single with a music video featuring a bunch of clones of himself the track is pretty catchy he's way more audible and intelligible since he's gotten out of prison which is pretty interesting and I think is actually making for some of his best songs that he's put out in a long time I think his album is coming out later this month and I'm pretty psyched to hear it to be honest moving on carnage mace in 97 featuring little yachty this is the most banger a banger I've heard in a while this is a freaking awesome track not only is little yachty hype as hell on this cut but the beat is amazing a lot of people sort of count little yachty out as this mediocre auto-tune crooner but he can actually rap as well you know his flow is pretty fantastic on this cut not only in its speed but also in his delivery because he's just so high-energy on this track I can't really complain and also I think the fact that he named the or they named the track Maison 97 is hilarious moving on igloo ghost with an interesting project over here it's not a track it's kind of one long piece that is essentially an ambient music piece the track is titled snoring music to sleep to so I guess if you're looking for something soft smooth and relaxing but with that kind of colorful angle that you expect igloo ghost productions to take then look this thing up you know it's not just simply a quiet throat in the background there's nothing interesting about it type of piece you know there are certainly some interest little uh I don't know pieces of sound play throughout as well which again I would expect from a glue ghost moving on another kind of long piece ARCA of all people has dropped another project that is essentially this one long like 20 minute plus cut of all these different pieces strung together into this one avant-garde monstrous project so the track is I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it but it is an intriguing piece and if you're an arc a fan you should give it a shot it's interesting that to me some of these pieces like this are more interesting than his his records how they come together you know sometimes I find his albums to be a little too obtuse and a little too cumbersome kind of hearing all of these cuts strung together into a kind of long conceptual one single long conceptual piece that has a tight flow to it I find a little more interesting a couple more we have schoolboy q with the that part black hippy remix not going to say too much about it because I am going to review his new record very soon and ending things off with the song factory floor yeah factory floor they have a new record coming out via DFA records and this is a kind of stone-faced very hard-nosed dance techno cut that is just cold it is chilly it is frigid as hell but the grooves are hard and very physical I like that sort of emotionally disconnected dance music sometimes and I think factory floor does it pretty well those are our recommendations for this week all the tracks that I want to tell you guys to check out here they are whoo again they're all linked down there in the description and yeah that's it if you want to support this segment you should hit up also another link down there in the description box our amazon associates link anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the US we get kickback from it does not add to your overall price and cool cool right recommendations tracks I hope you're doing well 
BLDUp1DAsf4,this new blink-182 record it's not good 182 they're still at it going 25 years week especially on this new record over here which features Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio instead of Tom DeLonge I mean why would you want to do Angels and Airwaves when you could do this now personally never been a gigantic fan of blink-182 like most people I enjoy enema of the state and a lot of their earlier records but but but but a lot of these pop punk and skate punk bands of the 90s I think we're a necessity to sort of pull punk music out of the angry corner it painted itself into in the 80s and they did it with a strong sense of humor as well as introspection but at this point nearly all of Blink 182's original appeal is pretty much gone the closest this record comes to being funny is the song built this pool which is a 17 second long song and it's lonely Rick is I want to see some naked dudes that's why I built this pool a track that I think if you look it up in the Guinness Book of World Records is in there for the the fastest cringe the song broheme Ian Rhapsody at the end of the record is a second fastest the rest of this album's material is painfully sappy pep punk like on the song she's out of her mind which is this sickening trebled girl anthem oh she's so crazy she's so psychotic she's just so nutty but I love her anyway or the song Kings of the weekend which is probably the most generic party anthem I've heard in a long time then we have softer cuts on here which are overwrought with soft smooth range instrumentation like on home is such a lonely place I would rather listen to Green Day's time of your life and I never want to hear Green Day's time of your life and then there's the production on this thing the guitars are so squeaky clean lifeless they're so touched up they might as well be a MIDI plug-in and the vocals are just as squeaky-clean they had this robotically perfect pitch to them on one song after another it's distracting it's like I'm listening to the musical equivalent of of airbrushing drums are the only thing in the mix that has any life or rawness to them thank God Travis Barker can still actually perform really well everything else on this album the definition of overproduced and I think Los Angeles might have been the only chorus that I liked except you know that there are some filler whoa not only on that song almost every other song on here if I hear one more whoa whoa it's going to be too soon and finally maybe the most glaring issue with this record is that I think in my head as I'm listening to this aren't they too old for this but then I sort of check myself because that's ages that's not really how I feel because they're bands from the same eras blink-182 who are still doing it and they sound great namely a band like Weezer who still today deep into their 40s probably pushing 50 they sound like they're angsty young passionate teenagers who wrote the songs that were off of their first full-length record so really the issue is is not that blink-182 is too old for this the thing is that they they sound like they're too old for this because seriously blink-182 no longer has that spunk that sense of play that rascally attitude that made them such an admirable band to begin with even if they didn't have the angriest choruses and the most righteous songs and the most memorable punk anthems what little they had going for them is either gone completely or it just didn't show up on this record at all blink-182 California it's not good transition have you given this album a listen is you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you hate my point of view on this blink-182 record hope you're doing well forever 
jV4EmFzc47A,oh lordy it's a hot one hi everyone Bethany Temper channel here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new avalanches album wildflower legendary plunder phonics powerhouse the avalanches are back 16 years since the release of their seminal debut full-length album since I left you in 2000 now four years there's been talk of this new record surfacing it's been put off again and again and again material through now re-recorded finally the tension started to break when the avalanches dropped a teaser track from this project Frankie Sinatra featuring verses from MF DOOM and Danny Brown personally a little underwhelmed by the the track but only when I heard the incredibly subpar YouTube mix I thought the song sample wise was really fun and kooky the the same blend of hip-hop and a variety of different music styles that I would expect from the avalanches but with a couple surprised verses and after that I was relatively interested in hearing some of the other vocal guests who happen to land on this record people like Josh Tillman aka father John misty Torelli moi also camp lo Ariel pink and even Biz Markie also Danny Brown had another feature on this thing on the short but punchy and very memorable cut the waz er dove is in some ways this album is the avalanches as they have always been they're very eclectic and smooth sampling style is still very much alive on this album and I think it makes sense to keep it alive especially given that in this day and age sample-based music is so relevant especially with things like hip-hop and EDM leading the musical zeitgeist at the moment but I'm also surprised at how little these songs have in common with the instrumental hip hop style that the avalanches are known for a lot of cuts on wildflower are actually pretty easygoing and psychedelic not so much beat heavy funky instead these heavy rhythms are being replaced with lavish pieces of arranged instrumentation on tracks light colors and live a lifetime love in a way this album really lives up to the name of the record because I feel like I am in the middle of a dream state and I'm floating through a field of wildflowers I feel like I'm locked into some kind of plunder phonics musical where people at any moment can break into sample-based song and their cartoon birds like landing on my shoulder if the avalanches first record in the 2000s was influenced by artists like the Beastie Boys at De La Soul this new record over here feels like it's pulling from the neo psyche movement coming out of Australia right now at movement and overall it's a pretty interesting transition but occasionally the album is so easygoing and so soft and so pleasant that the music is kind of toothless like on the very soft and slightly forgettable I wish I was a folks'd are featuring Toro y Moi or the overly repetitive track sunshine or the very smooth and light disco groove and spoken-word passages on the track Saturday night inside out of really unsatisfying closer to the project actually with the exception of the track kaleidoscopic lovers I would say the whole last quarter of this album is a bit of a letdown but before this kind of drab point in the album there are plenty of creative highlights the song because I'm me is this uplifting funky intro sounds like something out of a Jackson 5 record with its soaring strength sections and really direct nimble bassline some great verses from camp blow and the steady disco groove and the glistening other instrumentation most notably chimes on the song Subway's are pretty nice even if I don't really care for the lazy lead kid vocals on the track which fit much better into the post-punk II Shondra EP that they originally came from though was kind of interesting to hear that post-punk gem revitalized and recontextualized on this record and the song colors is another highlight for me because it's this beautiful starburst of kaleidoscopic bliss and then there's also the cuff feature biz markie the noisy eater which was not only one of the more creative tracks on the entire record loaded with textures and and vocal snippets I mean it's really a hilarious collage of sounds with biz markie on top rapping about food rapping about eating he sounds like a hungry cartoon bear stomping through the forest looking for some grub and another thing I could say that is good about this record is that I like the way it flows a lot of the tracks segue into one another so it feels like a really holistic experience but some of these transitional moments are not that great like they don't really add that much momentum to the record or they're not that interesting such as on the song going home which sounds like I'm flipping through the radio dial for a better song or on the song live in under water which makes me feel like I'm sitting in a waiting room hoping I get called next for my appointment with something more interesting and too often this is the case that there are tracks that their transitional tracks on this record that just sort of feel like they're hanging in the background they're not all that engaging they're not all that punchy sometimes there's just too little meat and too much of a blissful psychedelic aura around this record still though despite those complaints I do think most of this album is good there's plenty of highlights there's good material here and I think generally this album is a really creative attempt to sort of create sample-based psychedelia I mean not entirely revolutionary here I mean groups like Animal Collective have done just this in the past maybe not in a way that was as accessible as commercial as this but still the only other thing I can say is that I thought this record was good and that I hope that it doesn't take us 16 more years and to hear another avalanches record because I think the group is definitely onto something here as hyped as I was for this record I can't really expect a group to come back and just be just pedal to the floor blazing and amazing with a 16-year gap in-between two albums they're going to be a lot of kinks to work out in that scenario especially since the avalanches have returned as a trio on this record now a lot of those kinks don't seem to have turned up on this record despite the fact they totally reinvented their sound on this thing and that's really admirable I'm just hoping that in the future they either do something that's altogether new and exciting just as exciting as their debut record or they continue down this path but find a balance between these gorgeously arranged instrumental passages and the punchy rhythmic sample-based sound that they're known for I'm feeling a light 7 on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to love this avalanches record way more than I do well yeah the avalanches wildflower forever 
YPDQ-Pu3Jlg,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's H kill me if you sprinkle your food with this bathroom cleaner over here the sweet release of death will come very soon whoo and it's time for the most arduous segment on this channel the why you know review where I go through in brief a series of Records that I did not give a formal review to over the past month but I wanted to cover them quickly before we go too deep into the next month in this video right here so let's get started this record is pretty much a series of very pretty slow glazed-over slightly noisy and shoegaze e 90s throwbacks some decent songwriting and vocals there just wasn't anything in terms of sound that really stood out to me on this record just kind of felt like a bit of semi-flat revivalism you know it doesn't really add anything to the sound that she was going for on this project but if you're looking for another installment of that sort of hazy noisy 90's pop rock alternative rock sound then you'll probably be into this on this project these guys essentially made the transition from being a punk band to a kind of bland power pop band I mean I like some of the anthemic guitar leads and the heavy rhythm guitars reminds me a little bit of Weezer but the songs especially the lead vocals are just a little lackluster if you're the kind of hip-hop fan who raves about bars and hasn't bought a rap record since like 2003 then you're gonna love this thing you're gonna love the out of this thing it's not bad it just seems like it's running on old software that's all I know they're going to be some super self-serious post-metal fans they're pissed off at me for not giving this record a formal review but I just don't really have that much to say about this album I mean I like some of the noisy guitar embellishments and the dissonant guitar chords it's one of the few elements of flavor in the mix on this record because the bass the Bhoomi over compressed drums and the Grove vocals really aren't that dynamic or versatile don't really add too much to the later tracks that they didn't already put in on the first track I like some of the journey interludes on this album too and I do appreciate that the mix is very heavy it is crushing but musically there's not too much to this album and I understand why the band is trying as hard as they can to make it sound like a caveman wrote this thing it's their style it's just not really a style that I care for or at least if if I were listening to a band go down this road I would want it to be much noisier and much more abrasive than they're actually being here members of dear hoof and Neutral Milk Hotel come together into this duo collaboration for a very fun quirky somewhat spazzy little instrumental rock album consisting mostly of drums and guitar and it's pretty cool and it's pretty fun and despite the fact that you're hearing just two instruments most of the time the album is pretty dynamic they take their lack of layers to the extreme and that they can really kind of push these compositions anywhere and make very fast unpredictable changes to their performances however I can't help but feel like some of these tracks feel more like inconsequential motifs and they do flesh out satisfying songs still though if you want to hear two of the most talented performers in the indie world come together for a surprise collaboration oh it's a pretty creative results and give this thing a shot first these guys when they break they want to sound like Led Zeppelin and now on this new record over here they sound like a watered down the doors I just I'm not getting it I'm not it's not appealing to me the 10 years since their first full-length record and this band still does nothing for me this thing is kind of inconsistent but it's still a good but also bad so bad that it's good animalistic and abrasive noise rock record I wish it was a little more in-your-face I wish it was a little more energetic sometimes despite the awesome textures and sounds that go into this thing it sounds like the band is trying a little too hard to sound cool like they're too cool to try to impress you or be emotional but still some of the guitar sounds the drums the noises on this record are pretty refreshing and interesting if you're into noise rock if you're into goth rock if you like contemporary bands like Grave babies this album kind of reminds me of like old waves records too but more warped more odd kind of psychedelic there are some cool things about this record some cool ideas on this album and I'll be looking to see if the band sort of teases I don't know a more solid album out of these ideas in the future earlier this year I was so excited because Snoop Dogg had dropped a good track with the song late nights which I thought was a tasteful throwback to his doggystyle days but now that this new album has come out and I'm hearing it from beginning to end this thing is a total mess not only is Snoop Dogg again trying to bring back his glory days but he's doing it so awkwardly with these completely unmemorable drab flows production that doesn't really celebrate how great the G Funk era was it sounds like a kooky rehash of the G Funk era sounds like too cartoony for Snoop Dogg to be on talking about like crip and making all these sort of you know braggadocious violent bars and the song my cars is easily one of the worst things I've heard this year and I think that's gonna do it for that what are you doing was you have talked about me reveal me I've been thinking about it I'm gonna do it eventually there's gonna give me time you know it's just you're a long album okay transition and that has been the wire no review ladies and gentlemen on this page you can find a link over there where you can watch the previous Y you know review check out the why you know review playlist because I've made lots of these videos over the years and people tend to like watching them seems to be a pretty solid crew people who enjoy watching me suffer in this series so I appreciate it guys really appreciate it you're the best love you love you lots

IIH01362IH8,hi everyone Bobby Tarantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new logic mixtape bobby tarantino prolific maryland rapper logic he's back with a new mixtape for the past six years he's been dropping project after project now has two commercial releases under his belt his last one was his most ambitious project yet with a bit of a story concept sentence pace now logic he is a very popular and a beloved rapper right now and i understand why i see the hype but there continues to be this misconception that i hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him like anybody who I don't give a 10 I must hate them and I must wish that they were dead but anybody who like I give him a 10 out of 10 that means I'm just dick riding them you just can't win you can't win regardless though logic is a talented and versatile rapper one of the most notable things his early tapes was just how many styles and shades of hip-hop music he would cover across the length of an entire project however some of these projects would leave me hanging a little bit because afterwards I wouldn't really come away from them not really knowing who logic was as an artist despite the fact that he consistently references his personal life in his career art in his music the problem is that he just doesn't really have a strong distinct sound that when I hear it I know I'm listening to a logic song and lately especially with his commercial releases he seems to be pulling so blatantly from his most popular contemporaries J Cole Kendrick Lamar Drake from his spitting to his flow to his production and sometimes his hook in his songwriting logics music is technically sound it just doesn't really stand out to me though and I feel kind of the same way with this new mixtape over here but I do appreciate the angle that he's taking with this project this thing is a very short it's a very lean it's a very punchy it's a very to-the-point mixtape it's not bogged down in filler tracks or bogged down in useless features a lot of these tracks you're very sticky choruses and banger beats it's pop rap but it's not so trashy that you would get sick of it in five minutes and I don't think what's going on here could be easily replaced by your average trapper there isn't a massive concept bringing all these tracks together though I do presume that there might be something in the idea of reversing the tracklist on this project given that the introduction of this project is mostly just like reversed dialog and then we have tracks like slave 2 coming right of for slave 1 but maybe I'm making that up considering that listening to the mix tape backwards didn't really add anything different than listening to a forwards still though there are at least a couple of cuts on here that sound like logic still cannot keep his nose out of the Kendrick Lamar playbook like the interlude studio ambience at night Malibu or the closing cut deeper than money then there are some spacey melodic introspective cuts in the track listing here songs like slave and slave 2 and 44 bars tracks where logic really seems like he's trying to say something poignant say something personal which I think his hardcore fans will appreciate there is a somewhat obnoxious skit on the tape that I didn't care for too much though I do think it made a pretty decent point about fickle rapped fans turning against him for going too slow or getting too big or selling out or whatever but my favorite cuts in the track listing here which i think are two of logics best so far are just the catchy succinct concise bangers with good solid hooks songs like the jam which has this huge showy auto-tune chorus tons of braggadocious bars and the song wrists - which is a super eerie almost creepy banger very grimy actually some of the grimy ass bars that heard logic ever drop and this song actually features a great push a tee verse - I thought this tape was ok you know it has its moments but not really much for me personally because I'm not a huge Logic fan you know this to me reads more like a fan project although hearing some of the details in the tape about logic coming through with another concept album does excite me because you know maybe he'll come through with something even more impressive than his last record but even if he comes through with a super detailed super ambitious concept again if he doesn't finally on this record formulate a sound that is distinctly his I see myself feeling somewhat indifferent to that project - I'm feeling a strong 5 to light 6 on this mixtape over here transition have you given this mixtape a listen there's a lot of did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best well should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my take on this mixtape you know it's just not billy got too much for me the fans will enjoy it though I'm sure logic Bobby Tarantino big state forever 
VbGMzh9rEzE,Hey hi everyone Antoine fan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd and you know it is it's time for a voyage where I let you guys know about some records that have recently made their way into this big ol fat record collection over here added some some nice some nice records to the collection this month as you guys know by now we do these things raw down there in the description you can find a link to check out more of my vinyl videos and see more records in this collection we do this series so you can just check out some cool records and hopefully get some recommendations and maybe you know find something you want for your collection alright now this first one it's not even a record it's not even a record it's not even a record tape it is a cassette tape of the mr. yo T album slash mixtape that I put out that I reviewed I put out a review of not too long ago we have like the little blue pirate man on the front in the red sea with a yellow sky and it's just a it's actually a really plain cassette we have this side a that side be like some skull and crossbones on the cassette but the album art itself is actually pretty cool it says ahoy over here with a little ship and sorry you can't it's kind of small because it is a little cassette because that J card but uh just kicking things off with a tape you know changing things up got to throw you guys a left hook every once in a while alright let's just put this down softly don't want to break that all right these are records we could just throw these around and bust them up and just totally them up we have a little Record Store Day release over here from the band blue caddy ha I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly maybe not but this is a fun little metalcore single a fun anti-donald trump metal core single with lyrics and espanol and the viva Presidente trump is the title of the track on the front says you puto with a machete sticking out of Donald Trump's big fat-ass head uh I I wouldn't say I liked the track all that much but it was a fun novelty you know I mean it's in some respects it sounded like a little bit of a generic metalcore but it still was a fun track we have the lyrics sort of posted inside of the card over here and this is actually a piece of green vinyl which is actually pretty fun and the nuclear blast logo here at the bottom is um sort of done in the colors of the Mexican flag which it would have actually been pretty interesting if this was sort of red green and white as well but still you know nice green anti-donald trump 7-inch with a bit of a metal hardcore punk flavor to it you know not not complaining not complaining all right moving on should we get right into this know that I have a couple other records stored a records in here that I got ahold of late that I'm going to be covering in this video this is one of my favorite albums of the year we got a couple of my favorite albums of the year actually in this pile but this one comes from polyvinyl records I believe and just double checking on that I'm pretty sure it came from polyvinyl records this is the new shoe shoe covers the music of Twin Peaks record over here we've got like a red side we've got a blue side very minimal sort of liner notes over here as you could tell it's like mostly just a white blank slate we have Shu Shu plays the music of Twin Peaks the songs listed special thanks to Jose de Silva and Lawrence English the production credits the instrumental credits and the vinyl itself is actually pretty cool because it matches the colors of the front cover we have the red record over here and it is a very solid sort of red color with some splatters in it over here you can't quite see them they're very very faint but we have like some little shots of light that pop up in the record here and there those aren't uh you know sort of imperfections or anything like that just a very strange strangely subtle splatter pattern and then we have a blue record over here so we've got a red one you've got a blue one and this one sort of seems to be just a solid blue with no splatters into the holes oh wait whatever man whatever so whatever your preference is buddy so there we go that is the the the Shu Shu plays the music of Twin Peaks double LP gatefold package one of my favorite records of the year she should did a fantastic job on this album if you have not seen my review of this record if you have not heard this record please look that review up and give it a shot alright moving along let's see what I want to talk about next in here okay one more record sort a release we have deaths live in eindhoven if you are a death metal fan or if you are a death fan bit of a death completest you may want to check this thing out apparently this is a pretty awesome herb pretty well regarded live performance from death during a festival metal festival performance in the late 90s I believe it was their first big sort of European tour so that's kind of what makes this such a seminal moment for the band got a double LP set over here and it's a very nice heavy I believe it's 180 gram very thick black vinyl pressing I've been given this thing a listen and the recording is a little rough you know it is a live recording and it is not the best of live recordings so you know it does sound a little muddy it does sound a little messy at points but the performance is certainly good you know the band sounds tight the band sounds brutal so there's really no complaints there I would say this is just again more for a completist sort of fan which is you know nothing surprising for a record store day release you know that's typically when they drop projects like this that only the most hardcore of the hard core in terms of fans of a certain group are going to want this release so you know hopefully I've been seeing some of the eBay prices on this thing they're not too bad so you know if you really really want this thing you're a huge death fan there are still copies out there in circulation but yeah it's pretty decent not really any complaints other than just the recording being a little subpar but again live live recording performance is still good all right I got to give a shout out to my dude igloo ghosts because I got this peanut choker a 12-inch single from the label that he worked with to put this out and they also sent me a little bit of I've been listening to this sort of online though I have not opened it yet error broadcast this is a little bit of some hard-nosed techno over here kind of minimalist thought it was pretty decent the artists name is CL NK and the album is black ecstasy you check out the cover over there again but yeah this is a some pretty good minimal abstract electronic music but yeah they contacted me they said hey do you really like that a big blue ghost single and I was like oh yeah I think it's great and they're like oh we're we're gonna do vinyl four I was like hell yeah beautiful red vinyl igloo ghost this guy's one my favorite producers right now this is this is nuts he's completely over the top totally psychedelic very overwhelming very sonically dense and intense but also playful and fun I likes for the mustard-yellow of the art on the other side with the tracks listed over here peanut choker chinchou gold tea and then we have some remixes of the tracks off the project so yeah very beautiful bright red record over here with a simple classy black sleeve mmm-hmm alright moving along let's get into this record over here because this record was sent from a very nice fan of the show if you would like to send anything that may send that may end up on the vinyl segment over here that we have going here's my p.o box I got a P o box so there you go I got sappy o box now so and and this person sent this record not to the P o box I had an office address that I was using but this P o box that I've got now is so people can send me stuff for the segment people can send me memes for the meme review on the other channel so if you want to send me a meme as well oh god I'm going to regret saying that but he sent me this record with a nice letter and it says greetings Anthony Fantana how are you doing today I hope you are enjoying your day to day anyways I wanted to give you a pretty cool record that I know you enjoyed in 2011 wildlife by La Dispute spin this album drinks the melon aid and relax anyways take good care this is a great record that I am passing along to you enjoy the rest of your day Gabriel Gabriel thanks man appreciate that and as he says is the lot of speed record wildlife and it is a beautiful double LP package oh my god love gate folds love double LPS and it is I don't know if the camera is going to show this I guess it shows up it is a beautifully dark dark deep dark purple this vinyl I don't know if the other ones a little bit lighter so it seems this one looks a little bit lighter to my eye and it is I can see the light through it so it is not you know completely opaque so it is sort of a deep clear purple mile and I've been playing it - sounds fantastic no complaints about the sound of this record and the gatefold itself the art inside is relatively straightforward not all too different than what you would see on the CD copy of this record so yeah I very much appreciate this considering again it was like in my top 10 of albums from 2011 and this record still holds a special place in my heart considering how emotional and mode is like emotionally crushed the album is alright we have a couple more over here let's let's get into a couple new ones before we get into some old ones this is not new new but its recent we have the debut run the jewels record which I remember one of my reservations about this record is that the production was not bassy or heavy enough for me but on record the base is freakin bumpin on this project if you get a chance to hear this album on vinyl you will definitely hear the difference in the bass the bass is heavier on the record and not only am i happy with the bass on this record but I'm also happy with the big insert poster that came with this record looks cool guys got all the liner notes in there with a big middle finger that looks nice and the the cherry on top is that the vinyl is orange this is orange as hell orange you glad I showed you this record I know I am sorry sorry about that guys and what side are we listening to we're listening to side one what side we listening to we're listening to side two very fun creative packaging for this really you know good rap album which having heard the bigger bass grown on me a little bit guys you know might have to reassess whether or not I like this one or the the second one more now that the instrumentals on the second one her a little more epic got it got to give it to them or is my favorite run the jewels project meow the jewels you know that's that's the real question come on come on let's go back let's go back let's be a good puppet let's be a good puppet thank you thank you just say please and be polite and everything will go your way all right we're gonna we're going to go with one more new one before we get into some older records over here we had a couple more got to give a shout out to swans the glowing man picked this one up guys because I think it's great and the packaging is not really all that different than the packaging that they threw together for their last record to be kind the records are thick the records on but a lack we have a download card in here although I have a copy of it so you know whatever the records are thick they're black made a little bit of a poster over here of the different sort of it's like different body parts impaled essentially is what we're looking at here the different impaled body parts that are featured on the record itself which I don't know not as epic as crying babies or babies making funny faces but still you know pretty good pretty good you know we have sort of the the plain cardboard sleeve with the logos on each panel of the gatefold over here and it is a triple gate fold oh baby a triple with the liner notes in red in the middle here and yeah it's just a big epic triple gate fold package just like the last one so and I'm actually very happy with the quality of the record sound of it like I was with the last album if you actually look at the dynamic range specs on swans last record there's actually less compression on the vinyl version than there is on the digital version and there is more breathing room in the mix that I like so much more than just listening to the digital version I've been meaning to sort of uh digitize my vinyl record of that album so that I could just kind of listen to to that because the dynamic range is a little bit better alright move it along a couple more records over here we have classic hip hop over here EP md's strictly business that was actually one beyond here and this came out like in 1988 I believe jacket made in Canada 1988 confirming that just confirming that release date there was actually a beat on here that a sampled I think some George Clinton it seemed like a precursor to the whole G Funk thing and you know which which would be way more popular in the 90s and this is actually really great record you know I mean I've heard it before and I know that Rage Against the Machine has covered the song on housing although I wouldn't say it's a very good cover just a piece of useless knowledge that I have in my head but still regardless just it's been a while since I've listened to this record and I remember in the high school and in college I was obsessed with like a lot of 80s hip-hop and this is a record that I haven't heard tracks from like a long time so it was cool to see it in the record store just for like 10 bucks or so and just like whole  let me get this thing since I know it's already good and I mean I wasn't freaking disappointed I liked the the very smooth subdued flows on this album you gots the chills a great track strictly business is a great track and because I'm housing is a great track too so if you're looking to listen to some songs off of this thing you know it's it's 80s rap but it's not as clunky as I know a lot of 80s rap can be which i think is going to be a turn-off to some to some hip-hop listeners who aren't familiar with rap from this era so you know don't expect something super smooth and pristine and and and all that but this is not as again clunky I remember one rap fan who is having a conversation with once described some of those older records is sounding like they're made with pots and pans or something and maybe that's like an app description you know but it's it's these beautiful rudimentary old-school albums that were the foundation of what we're listening to today and you know there's still a lot of great stuff on these records and especially considering how much nostalgia is selling in the music industry right now I think there's opportunities for people to go and listen to like this and bring some of these older ideas back you know and sort of not just rip them off blatantly but recontextualize them for a new sound in a new era so EPMD strictly business a couple more here we have the debut record from german krautrock and experimental rock outfit Faust this is a reissue obviously but still it's it's rare that you come across a copy of this album and it is a kind of masturbatory strange experience I mean I am you know somewhat of a fan of how strange Faust records are I like how much of an oddity they are or were in modern music so you know I just wanted to pick this thing up because I'm a little bit of a completist with though when it comes to sort of weird oddity records and oddity bands you should definitely read into how exactly this man went about being signed and how much of like a disappointment this record was - there label but you know it is an incredibly strange record and it is weird that they kind of got away with putting this record out we sort of have this um you know clear print on the plastic sleeve and the record itself is a slightly opaque trying to sort of work it out of the sleep right now we have like you know some lyrics sort of printed on a plastic sleeve over here which you can't really see because they're from my face but still some of is in English some of is in German it's sort of like a very morbid story of what seems like a pregnant woman being shot so uh yeah for anybody who's looking to be put in a good mood you know just uh just read through that read through that tale and the album here itself is sort of like this milky clear plastic alright let's move on to the final record over here in this update the debut record from Talking Heads if you're looking for a little dance Punk post-punk New Wave music with some fun lyrics and herky-jerky grooves and kooky lead vocals no reason not to listen to this thing it's the first album from Talking Heads y'all so my favorite Talking Heads songs are on here not only psycho killer but also book I read and pulled up put me up up up up up up up if you get a chance to listen to the live album the name of this band is talking heads you can hear some pretty wild performances of these tracks fairly simple straightforward packaging over here with the lyrics on one side picture the band on the other black record sire records and it was in really good condition despite the fact that this seems not like a it's it's not a recent reissue or anything like that the record is very clearly an older album I don't see any indication that this was a reissue in the past few decades though it might not have necessarily been printed in nineteen seven or maybe it was I'm not entirely sure because you know because I'm not obsessive like that you know I don't necessarily collect records to collect them you know I collect them to listen to them said is that a bad thing is that a sin I'm sorry guys I'm sorry guys I buy music because I plan on listening to it apologies to anybody who buys music to not listen to it you know I appreciate your your struggle you know I just don't identify with it personally that's all so there you go those are all of the records for this record vinyl update thank you for watching guys I hope y'all are doing well and found some interesting stuff to go check out after this video again other vinyl videos are linked down there in the description and have yourself a nice day transition bla bla bla bla bla click

SCJ57ntrIQQ,hi everyone new thin utano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the latest record from blood-orange freetown sound this is the latest full-length LP from producer multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter Devante Heinz who has been at it for a long time now I remember listening to one of his earliest groups test icicles back in my college days which was a pretty interesting dance Punk synth punk group then he would move on to do some indie rock and pop under the lightspeed champion name and now in his latest incarnation blood orange not only has he been making music that is very different from indie rock and pop but he's also been expanding his talents as a songwriter and a producer lending his talents to make other people sound better working with artists like fka twigs and Florence on the Machine and my favorite recently uh Carly Rae Jepsen on her latest full-length LP but when he's putting out music for himself he's dropping these dreamy reincarnation of pop R&B and synth funk from the 80s and thus far he's been doing it pretty successfully with two very popular albums under his belt and now a new one now his last record Cupid deluxe personally did not care for this album at all I thought this thing was instrumentally Hollow it was emotionally bland everything was just a little too washed out and reverb effects he seemed to have a strong grasp of the nostalgia that was fueling his desire to make this music but there wasn't a lot in terms of compelling songwriting but it's been a while since that album dropped and as far as I can tell Devante has been progressing quite a bit as a songwriter working with other artists so maybe this new record over here will be more detailed and mature and interesting and we do get a pretty different blood-orange this time around this new project over here is a longer project standing at 59 minutes with 17 tracks and overall this project is more instrumentally adventurous than anything blood orange has dropped in the past I love the hand percussion and the very groovy bass guitar on the song juicy 1 2 4 also the gorgeous vocal harmonies and jazz horn embellishments that kick the record off I think are fantastic even if the second half of the song is dominated by a feminist slam poetry I also love the weird melty horrifying string sections on song EVP they pair weirdly but also nicely with the very awesome bass and drum grooves and there's a great drum solo on the track too I also like the funky horn sections against the very chill synthetic instrumentation on song love eeeh and also there are loads of notable vocal guest appearances on this thing people like Debbie Harry and Zuri Marley Nelly Furtado and Carly Rae Jepsen and a lot of these guest appearances develop into these very steamy dreamy nocturnal sensual duets that are pretty nice and there's also a variety of sound clips littered throughout this record - that transition one song to another song or sort of interrupts in the middle of a track that I think insert some kind of political message into some of these tracks it doesn't always work but I admire the fact that again Devante is being way more sonically adventurous with this new project it's the 80s pastiche that this project has been known for up until this point but with much more bulk to it now the vocals are still a little more washed out than I would like them to be especially on tracks like Augustine and I do think the overuse of reverb does tend to suck some of the characteristics out of the vocals especially when it comes to the vocal guests on this record I think with the heavy use of reverb on these vocals a lot of them tend to melt together and if I didn't read into who was who I would have a hard time telling which guests were what but the unorthodox use of effects and some of the odd mixing practices on this record as well as do vantes vocals do give this album kind of an amateurish charm you know if you like people who who make lo-fi weird throwback pop music like Arial pink or guys like named funk I think you're going to hear some interesting stuff on this project now despite me thinking that blood orange is great we improved from the last record I still think this album has its lackluster moments or just spots where the songwriting is a little subpar namely on cuts like Desiree which is mostly padded out with these vocals snippets that don't necessarily add that much to the tune or like the painfully corny lyrics on the song love you a song that to me in terms of momentum never really gets going it seems kind of like an endless intro of sorts or the song squash squash which is kind of like a single refrain extended out to three minutes and 30 seconds with a few groovy instrumental breaks and the song hands up a track that I like in terms of melody and it's grew and its structure but as I died deeper into the song it seems like this really awkward marriage of an attempt at making a political statement about police brutality and racism and like a love song and then we have the song but you which features these incredibly nasally lead vocals where Devante is just trying to do his best a Michael Jackson impersonation which in a way reminds me of back in the day when Eddie Murphy would drop tracks that would clearly be pulling from the King of Pop or Corey Feldman it just seems like a track that if it had come out in the 80s and people we're talking about it today it would be sort of funny because we would look back on it as like oh look another guy trying to be MJ but instead it's coming out in 2016 it's new not to mention of the incredibly corny hook on this track you have special in your own way you know there's some cuts on here they have some solid songwriting and muscular grooves and these are my favorite moments EVP the song juicy with it's sharp slap bass line and the song Hadron Collider is a pretty good valid to the beautiful pianos on the song I know are pretty nice I enjoy carly Rae Jepsen's appearance on the album too there are a lot of good ideas on this record but they're not always backed up with good songs some of the production leaves a little to be desired especially when despite the fact that it's like there's so much more instrumental detail in this project the sound is still a little hollow due to that reverb also the vocal snippets and clips that don't really add that much to the music or the kind of sexy funky vibe that this music conveys I can't ignore that blood-orange has has displayed improvements on this record and I overall like the mood of the album and I like that the mood is pretty consistent from track to track and there are a handful of songs on this record that I like unlike the previous efforts from blood-orange but I still think there's a little bit to go before this project really Wow's me still it's decent and I certainly see the hype behind this record and if you are looking for something with a synth funk with an 80s pop with an old-school R&B vibe to it I could see you getting down to this especially since Devante channels those influences really well into a finely crafted aesthetic just don't be surprised if you don't find his songwriting to be as sharp and as groundbreaking and as memorable as the Great's such as Prince who clearly influenced him I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with this review which most likely you do but orange freetown sound forever 
EGwEmD7EfXg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly favorite tracks of the week segment where I give you guys a bunch of recommendations of songs that have come out this past week that I thought were really good maybe they slipped through the cracks for you hopefully now thanks to this segment they do not we do the segment in the raw so we're not gonna do a whole lot of tight edits here and all of the songs that I'm recommending to you guys are linked down there in the description box along with our Amazon Associates like which you can click on and use to support this segment if you live in the u.s. anything you buy off of Amazon if you click on that link once you've used it we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price of whatever you're checking out for with what you're buying on Amazon cool cool all right moving along let's get through this list love all these songs except for this one when I shot this video I forgot to record the worst record of the week portion of the video you thought you're gonna get away but I have to give the worst track of the Week award to Fergie's milf money easily the trashiest that I have heard any music be in a long time and and will surely go down as one of the cheapest songs of 2016 let's get into the first one over here schoolboy Q's to quino's to : part open parentheses to close parentheses titles a little confusing but what's not confusing is how good this track is liking it a lot more than the last big single to come out from this forthcoming schoolboy q record that part featuring Kanye West which does seem to be doing very well for school boy has millions of views on YouTube right now it just doesn't really have one of his best verses on the track and I'm just not really that impressed with Kanye's contribution of the track either not really that crazy about the hook it just seems like a very middle-of-the-road song for him you know usually I'm used to hearing much grittier content from him or something that's at least a little experimental you know like collard greens or something that part just doesn't really seem to be that adventurous to me but you know maybe it's more accessible and that's why it's doing so well this track is a little more dreary has a couple solid features on it a very kind of lazy clunky laid-back beat that I like a lot and some very sad piano loops throughout much of the track to its ultra grimy and the music video is pretty gritty as well so you may enjoy that even though it the video itself is much longer than the song so get ready for something a little uh narrative based and cinematic moving along bad bad not good within your eyes featuring Charlotte de Wilson bad bad not good not so much doing a jazz thing on this track sort of doing a throwback vintage soul thing on this track they compliment Charlotte's vocals really well the song is beautiful you know everything down to the sort of background vocals a harp you know soulful vintage background vocal harmonies on this cut just so speak to that 70 soul sound and they just do a really good job of recreating it they bring a good song to the table so it's a decent track I'm looking forward to seeing sort of the mix of sounds and influences they branch out into on this new record which I believe is sort of released now on iTunes so if you want to hear the new BB ng record it's out along with the new avalanches record I'm going to cover that soon so don't don't worry about it I want to give a shout out to the new Maxo cream the persona mixtape grimy little mixtape over here haven't gotten that too deep into it yet but thus far I have been very impressed with the production on the state and surprise there's a paul wall feature on this thing he dug paul wall i had out of the out of the ether to appear on this track new Adult Swim single with felonious Martin featuring Joey purp loves Joey's verse on this cut really interesting to sort of see how much he's growing how many different tracks he's landing on recently you know his eye drops mixtape had its low points I think he's still developing but there's so much potential in what he's doing right now love his voice love his versus love his delivery I think he's got to be couldn't have putting out a good commercial project down the road I got to give a shout out to the new clipping video for the song wriggle off of their new EP check out my review for that EP if you haven't it's a good EP if you like some experimental hip-hop but I got to give a shout out to the video because none other than coucher chesta appears in the video for a second he is spinning a cycling gif of cow church esta angel Olson shut up kiss me fantastic song from angels and this is the bold lyrical upfront completely unabashed did the angel Olsen that I've been wanting to hear for a long time and now she's really coming through in a bold way on this new cut I love the video for this cut to just really no complaints about this song you know a lot of these very kind of slow dreary mony singer songwriters that have been kind of blending just a contemporary folk with some distorted guitars and some garage rock it's very dreary it's very slow-paced some of it hasn't really been translating to me because there's not really that strong of a voice coming out of it but angel Olson is really coming through with I think a bold personality on this cut and I want to finally give a shout out to the band ghoul for the song bringer of war ghoul has a new record coming out if you don't know ghoul they're a fantastic metal act punk act and on this new track over here they're bringing their usual blend of hardcore punk thrash metal some grindcore with a whole myriad of different vocal deliveries to sort of give the listener the idea that they're listening to different personalities or narrators throughout the track and I have no doubt that this new album of theirs is is gonna be very inspired by be horror movies comic books and have some kind of concept to it a story like concept to it running from beginning to end so I'm pretty excited to hear that and those are the songs that I'm recommending to you guys for this weekend that you know max will cream mixtape so check these tracks out if you haven't ready fantastic songs good music that came out this week hopefully this coming week is even more fruitful with some good tracks and yeah that's it thanks for hanging around get some recommendations and hope you guys are doing well 
5lBwkRsID1Q,uh the new designer mixtape is not good at this point you may have already heard of New York rapper desiigner he's been having a huge 2016 he was recently named as a 2016 double XL freshman his hit song Panda has gone up to number one on the charts he is now a good music signee Kanye West's imprint off of the Def Jam label and his song Panda was also included on Kanye West's latest record the life of Pablo where it was kind of renamed and remixed a little bit into the song father stretch my hands part two so now with the whole industry watching waiting for this dude to come out with his commercial full-length debut he drops this thing and it is not good and the sad thing is is that it didn't need to be like this he's under Kanye West's swing he doesn't need to rush things he could have taken his time written some songs developed a sound gotten some decent features and groomed out a full-length project even if it was just a mixtape but instead we got this half-assed rush job of a project of the 14 tracks on this thing there are two decent songs and one of them is Panda and the other one is the six-minute track today which is sort of like a bit of progressive dirty dark grimy trap has a cool beat change up as well in the second half reminds me a little bit of something that would be on a Travis Scott record but designer does his thing he doesn't simply come off like a Travis Scott copycat the rest of the songs are all blatant future ripoffs I I just don't see the point it's like he's literally a carbon copy of future from the minimal dreary moody kind of Spacey trap beats to the deep voice and the auto-tune on his vocals sure before I thought his voice was a little similar to futures but now it seems like he's really going out of his way to sound exactly like it he clearly doesn't have an issue with riding on futures coattails he clearly doesn't have an issue with the question who is the rapper that sounds like future popping up when you google designer name so we either have these future ripoffs or we have tracks that are so redundant and so short that they're not even worth addressing I'm talking 30 second songs one minute songs clearly unfinished tracks it's like he gave us a mixtape of snippets this thing is just so lackluster not even the Pusha T feature that's on here could save it in fact push a T on a mixtape that's that's really so effortless and so mindless sounds incredibly out of place like whoa wait I have to pay attention to lyrics now get the out of here I hope his commercial release is not as cobbled together and doubly I hope that this is not like a trend that becomes the mixtape of the future all of these like snippet tracks chunks of tracks let's just release that does designer and company think so little of his audience that they can just release anything and they think everybody's just gonna eat it up I can give it to designer that he's a little more grim he's a little more dark his beats are a little more Moody maybe because they have that Travis Scott sort of monstrous grand presentation to them and there are some spots here where his voice does get pretty growly and aggressive but without some decent hooks and songs and structure to back any of that up this tape is almost pointless almost nothing good on this tape a few interesting things here and there but the potential that I thought designer might have it's not presenting itself here and that's it not a good tape transition what did you think of this not good mixtape did you think it wasn't good let me know Anthony Fantana designer new English forever

2016 it's the halfway point of the year six months from now i'm becoming out with my best albums a 2016 list telling you my favorite records of the year but still we're six months away we got a little bit of time before that happens but for now I can tell you guys what my favorite albums of the year so far are with these 15 records I have listed right here and they're listed in no particular order okay this is not a top 15 list no particular order and all those other records that I gave positive reviews earlier this year I still like them I still think they're good they'll probably turn up on my list at the back end of the year when I do my top 50 records but these are just my 15 favorites so far let's go with the first record in the list here we have Weezer with the White Album Weezer really came back with a sweet power pop vengeance on this record incredibly catchy songs still that same teenage angst there but by Weezer standards the record is very tasteful they really kind of went back to their roots on the Blue Album it's not too commercial it's not super trashy it's got loads of just infectious hooks and anthemic guitar leads and that heavy thick alt-rock nerd rock guitar sound that is their trademark is back sounds fantastic and when I heard it I just had nothing but praise for this album you know sure it's nothing altogether new for Weezer but they're doing what they're known for doing very well which unfortunately for the past decade or so has just not been the case just so many Weezer albums just missed the mark and now it seems like in the internet age now with rock being as irrelevant as it is they are now free to just kind of you know do whatever the hell they want to do without pandering to a wider audience a radio audience they can really play to the people who gave a shit about their music from the start and I love it moving on from there a strange electronic music album which includes some very creative sampling as usual from the duo known as Matt mos this is a bit of an abstract glitchy very cerebral I ish record where for the entirety of the album the duo samples a washing machine and it is quite musical is quite textured very colourful very entertaining to me sounds like I'm listening to a machine but a very musical machine you know there are only a few points where it sounds like you're listening to just a washing machine you know for as weird as the concept is I think a lot of the points on this record are sort of accessible if you're into electronic music you know if you're just looking for something poppy and straight forward maybe this isn't for you but if you're looking for something a little more adventurous on the electronic music spectrum but still has a good sense of fun to it you know because it's not like this is a super self-serious record you know the duo is very conscious of how weird the idea of sampling a washing machine is so there is a feel of playfulness to this record I also got to give a shout out to ty Segall for the album emotional bugger love this record one of my favourite rock records of the year very fuzzy scuzzy sunburnt distorted loaf I as hell his influences from the psyche and garage spectrum come together beautifully against some of the roughest and I guess most ear grating production he's ever laid on to record and it's so interesting because the last couple of records just seems so clean by comparison and now he's just kind of boomerang back into the depths of lo-fi hell on this album and I'm loving it next one of the best kind of pop rock records a little bit of punk in New Wave mixed in there I've heard this year the new lemon demon album spirit phone which has some of the most amazingly catchy songs I've heard this year creative song subjects I guess I couldn't have really expected this to be anything but good I mean this is coming from the same guy who came through with some of my favorite mashup albums of all time not too long ago and this venture over here is no less creative I like all of the themes of death and space and spirituality and what Evers is really kind of flying through Neil's head on this album and the guitar lines the synth lines the vocals on the hooks here all sharp and very memorable the production is a little rough I mean it's it's obviously a DIY effort but still the record comes through as punchy fun and has a lot of personality to this next record is from one of my favorite bands out of Australia right now the album feeling kind of free from the drones the band really expanded their sound on this record at points it's almost like they're making art rock and experimental rock a little bit of post-rock not just simply the psyche and blues and blues punk that they're known for some of the tracks on here are quite dreary and there's some amazing just wide panoramic displays of instrumentation on this record too from what I understand some of the guys in civil civic had a hand in producing this one and it definitely shows because there are some synthetic elements that work their way into the mix here this thing is heavy it's heartbreaking and it's also more ambitious I think than anything the band has done in the past this next record is another one of the best records of the year in my opinion however this album came very close to a tragedy for modern music and that is the death of David Bowie of course I'm talking about David Bowie's final record black star while it is sad that the great David Bowie is no longer with us you have to admire the fact that there's just few in any industry who get the opportunity to go out the way that David Bowie did and that is essentially come together with an album a bit of a concept album that reflects on his death before he died he was singing about his fame his iconic image how people would receive his death being in heaven and a myriad of different things it's an incredibly sad and just I don't know gut-wrenching record when I listen to this thing and I sort of come to the realization that man he just was on the threshold of death as he was writing this album and it's almost as if he knew his time was up and he needed to get this out as some kind of final message within the context of all this the album is pretty chilling but even if you subtract the record out of all of the Deaf background and everything it is cool to hear david bowie experimenting a little bit again and going back to his art rock glory and embracing some kind of occult themes to this next record is not exactly original but nonetheless amazing it is shoo-shoo plays the music of Twin Peaks experimental rock band art rock band art punk band shoo-shoo post-punk band they're back and apparently the band at one point had been commissioned to redo a series of pieces from the infamous Twin Peaks soundtrack if you're not familiar with the Twin Peaks television series please take the time to binge watch it on your nearest streaming platform and if there's one thing that's amazing about the television series it is the music and shoo shoo do an amazing job of translating the music on this record for the modern age you know the the the the interpretations the liberties that they take with these songs make them so much heavier noisier freakier scarier more chilling I can only hope that with the Twin Peaks series getting rebooted at some point this decade that they use some of the music on this thing because it is quite disturbing and I also like that they were able to take the music from the series and actually compound it down into a listenable album format you know it doesn't just simply feel like I'm listening to a random compilation of soundtrack songs you know they really sequence this record and progressed and groom the song so that it flowed very well as an album experience though the ending is quite strange comes out of nowhere a little bit and next a record that has no ending really it's another Australian rock record this year it is the new king gizzard record nan McGann infinity a punky fast adrenaline pumping psych rock and garage rock record that has no real beginning and has no real end all the songs like sequence into one another very tightly and very fluidly so you can literally listen to this album forever and each track even though there are different movements on the record they all come together into one cohesive piece so again it's it's like I'm being locked into this psyche rock octagon and it's just spinning into infinity so not only is the concept on this record cool but the performances are great the writing is great I like that there's more nuance to the instrumentation on this record it seemed like the band was pulling from what they had learned and what they had picked up on their last record which was an all acoustic project and yeah I don't really have anything else to say about this thing other than that it's a hell of a lot of fun and now a record that is not fun not fun at all very sad very depressing the most depressing record in this band's discography in my opinion the new Radiohead record a moon shaped pool this thing is a sad subtle very quiet dreary experience the acoustic guitars the piano songs the space the loneliness the depression it's all hard-hitting this is a soul-crushing introspective quiet time I'm by myself kind of record which I guess is not surprising from Radiohead the band for sure has always kind of had the potential to do an album like this and now it seems like they're finally sort of giving themselves permission to do so really kind of toy simply with your emotions they're not really touching their listeners on a physical level or on a visceral level on this record in any way shape or form which I think they were kind of distancing themselves from anyway with their last record the King of Limbs which was very electronic and rigid and stiff this album though much more emotional though not as punchy again not as physical but it's just really it gets in there and it just tears it all apart another record that is torn apart emotionally but is is much more crazy tantrum like about it is the new car seat headrest record teens of denial and on this album I essentially listened to the band's frontman will Toledo go through in early like 20s late teens crisis a lot of good tracks on here that poignant Lee pain a picture of how unsure young adulthood can be and translates this angst and translates this anxiety through some well-written songs with progressive song structures and some cool instrumental breaks I think his vocals sound a little bit better to a little more passionate I just like listening to this kids emotional breakdown and something a little more chill and my favorites list over here the new Marissa Nadler record strangers Marissa Adler's in my opinion her best set of songs on record yet and some really awesome instrumentation as well no longer are her songs super stripped back super skeletal we have some beautiful arranged and just guest instrumentation surrounding her very wintery mystical songwriting style and her vocals really shining through better as well I think the lyrical component to this record is stronger than it has been on her past material if you're looking for some of the soft melodic and a little icy and give this thing a shot getting to the end of the list here a couple more want to give a shout out to Kendrick Lamar's untitled unmastered Kendrick Lamar an album of b-sides and it's better than most artists full-length albums it was just kind of cool to hear these extra tracks where Kendrick Lamar is still kind of toying with the soul and the jazz and the funk that was so prominent on his last album to pimp a butterfly a lot of tracks on here that wouldn't have necessarily fit into the concept of that record but nonetheless they were good songs so it was good to record them even if the recording was rough and demo quality and get them out there to the public again even though this thing sounds a little muddy there are a lot of highlights on here and there are a lot of pros to this project I mean Kendrick Lamar's verses his performances are great the instrumentation is great if you didn't like to pimp a butterfly chances are you're not going to like this but I enjoyed that record so this is still going to end up on my favorites list of the year because I thought it was good another rap record from the west coast that I thought was great YG's still brazii the students surprised me on this project as an emcee as a lyricist he was so unimpressive on his last record and not that he's getting super poetic on this new album over here it's just that his songs are way more topical and he's come through with way more personality catchy er flows not only that but I like the production of this record and how it comes together into this really cohesive tribute to 90's g-funk from california you can really hear the dr. Dre and the snoop and the NWA influence on a lot of these tracks and he translates all of it tastefully with some good songs and some good features land on this thing as well got to give a shout out to deaf grips for their latest album bottomless pit experimental hip hop trio you know them you love them you hate them you mean them Death Grips coming through with what I think is one of the catchiest records in their discography next to the Money Store to some people they've said that they think this record is catchy er than the Money Store in my opinion no no it's yet to be seen but I love that they were able to kind of go back to that money store sound while bringing back and incorporating all of the cool production tricks and experiments that they've been toying with over their last several projects you know this thing is really kind of a culmination of all the madness that Death Grips has delivered unto us over the past six years or so not quite as adventurous or boundary breaking as I would like from Death Grips but it's cool they were able to take the sound that essentially they helped establish as a staple in underground hip-hop right now and really continue to expand it and make it sound Oh mind crushingly I'm addicted to this shit and finally got to give it to Swans for the glowing man great freakin record and a cool finish to the trilogy of their last three albums super huge spacey panoramic instrumentally dense project it's two hours long but don't let that stop you this thing is very psychedelic it's very meditative not quite as hard-hitting and punchy as their last couple of albums in this very repetitive hypnotic groovy rock style that they've been toying with over the past couple of years but still enjoy the record quite a bit it's just more of a cerebral experience from swans so loving this and looking forward to where the band takes their sound next in whatever their next incarnation is going to be now those are my 15 favorite albums of 2016 so far what of your favorite albums of the year been thus far and yeah that's all I got to say to you guys I hope you have a nice day and whatever of these albums you have not heard I hope you take the time to check them out if my description of them is interesting to you of course songs from these records and reviews of these records are linked down there in the description ba Tran position have you given these albums a listen are they Sameer favorites of the year if so how much did you like them what albums that I have reviewed are you pissed off didn't make it into the list um nails or Beyonce are you mad sorry you're the best thanks for watching love you forever "
_PXWBSJGAag,hi everyone atomic number here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new case Lang Tver album this is a surprise collaborative record from three monster songwriters we have the versatile pop song stris KD Lang indie darling an eco case and folk ster singer-songwriter Laura there's not really sure what to expect from this project I mean at first just looking at it on the surface I presumed that this was something put together by the powers that be in order to just you know make the NPR crowd just go full orgasm and keep shoveling in that donation money but actually enjoyed the teaser tracks from this thing quite a bit however actually being able to listen to the entire record there is a bit of a separation issue on a lot of these tracks unfortunately it seems like how a song sounds depends very much on who is leading the track there are very few cuts in the track listing here atomic number is an example of one where it actually sounds like all three singers play an equal role on the track which is a bit of a shame because atomic number is not only an incredibly beautiful track but I like the way that these three singers sort of trade off lines on this cut a lot but again as I said many of the cuts on here they feel mostly like I'm listening to a song that could have been on any one album from any of these respective singers on this record just with the other two collaborators kind of playing a very supportive role hanging in the background adding to the three-part vocal harmonies that are found throughout this project tracks like best kept secret are a huge example a song where Laura ver songwriting actually punches through in a very chipper way this is a very bright sunny song it sounds like something a twee pop band like camera obscura would put out for example the track was a little sugary for my taste but I do appreciate the level of instrumental detail that these three put into the song especially with the string sections that pop in later in the cut lyrically the track is also a very kind of touching tribute to guitarist Tim young a friend of Laura's who actually appears on the cut playing guitar also we have tracks like a thousand miles away which as soon as I heard the very gentle groove of the track and the woodwinds on the song I heard Katie Lang's vocals coming from a thousand miles away the chemistry of this trio kind of reminds me of the chemistry of another band of sort of supergroup trio songwriters all of them Canadian a Swan Lake where each song kind of sounds like it's specifically coming from one of the members of the band and then the other two just kind of you know take part in a subtle way in the track and while I guess that makes for a somewhat inconsistent record a great deal of the songs on here are really tasteful even the songs that I wasn't really gripped by were at least pleasant to listen to let me get one more complaint out of the way before I start complimenting this record for how good it actually is and that is a lot of these songs they don't really go the distance we have some abrupt endings on here tracks that are wonderful beautiful that I think really could have gone longer with either a bridge or another verse tracks like behind the armory which has one of the sweetest and most gripping vocal harmonies on the entire record again atomic number or the song why do we fight the ending of the song down i-5 it is literally a cliffhanger the song finishes so quickly I just assumed that the next track was a continuation the entire thing flows kind of like a compilation especially once I get toward the back end of the record and I come to realize that they're not really finishing this up in any kind of way that's going to tie things up neatly still though even though this thing feels like a compilation it is a compilation with highlights namely songs like song for Judy which is a lovely tribute to singer-songwriter Judy sill the instrumental is not only beautiful and funky and gentle the harmonized vocals on the chorus are beautiful and the lyrics come in a great detail into Judy's very tragic story Katy Lang's vocals on the very seductive honey and smoke are wonderful I love the subtle country vibe on the song delirium the eles that are worked into the mix to sound awesome some greens of June has this chilly dramatic feel to it that reminds me of a lot of the folk pop of the 60s in the chamber instrumentation on the song a thousand miles away is gorgeous and I get a real sense of longing from Katie Lange's lyrics but again even though a lot of the songs on here good and and the three songwriters on this record complement to each other really well not only in that they play good supportive roles for one another but chances are if you enjoy the music of one of these three women you'll probably enjoy the music of the other two so without question I think this record is going to entertain the fans of each one of these artists if they're willing to give this album a shot but I think this trio has the potential to reach beyond the the larger group of people who already know them if on this next record that they come out with because I've heard they're gonna drop another one they refine their sound and they expand on their songs I'm feeling a light tease and seven on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it would you ready to hear the best shoe the best so should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe these no crimes if you happen to disagree with my thoughts on this record Anthony and tanto que flying bears forever 
7A3P3bGcC8c,me tom marshburn oh here the internet's spiciest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new riffraff record that peach panther riff raff is a former reality television star one of the most wild rappers in hip-hop right now his goofy delivery and hilarious bars have led to some fantastic singles over the past several years but yet I'm really yet to love a full-length project from riff raff and whether we're talking about an early mixtape of his or his recent commercial break out neon icon the number one issue always ends up being consistency you can always count on riff raff to drop at least a couple catchy very colorful bangers even in the case of this record we had tracks like 4 million previously I loved wetter than tsunami tip dough we Union my dowel pins or how to be the man but then usually deeper into the checklist of a riff raff project we might have a hideous auto-tune ballad or two or maybe even a rap rock mutation like the song cocaine so with peach Panther I was hoping for just a little more consistency with riff raff and in a way I got it because there isn't anything on this project that's so outlandish that it's obnoxious I think the closest riff raff comes to doing that is on the song syrup sippin assassin which is an auto-tuned ballad very Spacey very woozy but what bothers me about the track is that it's so underwhelming riff raff himself says on the song that he's a sip and so much codeine he's about to fall asleep don't know why you could just listen to this track and fall asleep so it's almost like the problem I've had with a full-length riff raff project in the past has just been flipped instead of all these garish tracks that I can't stand to listen to because they're annoying I'm getting these songs that are just dreadfully boring there's some serious snoozers in this tracklist like Chris Paul and all I ever wanted just no oomph on these cuts and even some of the harder hitting tracks while they're not a exactly auditory ambien I wouldn't call them exciting either namely the song only in America which I think has one of the worst most awkward hooks on the entire project Oh America eat duck sauce riff-raff tries to make a weird point about his observations on the American Way I guess I do give props to him on the line about substitute teachers wanting to be battle rappers it is true it is a fair point it's about everybody seems to have some kind of hopeless dream that they're unwilling to give up on so that track isn't entirely bad and neither are some of the eerie bangers on this thing that have some decent features like the song Mercedes featuring gez or I drive-by with Danny Brown and gucci mane the unfortunate thing about these cuts is that they are almost completely devoid of the trademark and gut-busting sense of humor that has made riffraff such a fantastic artist to begin with I wouldn't say riffraff is getting super serious on this record or personal or earnest I mean there's a few bars here and there where I kind of get that sense but he's toned his tone down a little bit and I think the result has been his versus sounding like that of just your average up-and-coming braggadocious southern rapper there just doesn't seem to be as much character funny similes and comparisons and whatever coming out of riff-raffs bars or maybe his shtick is wearing off on me I can't quite tell regardless though there's not really much denying the fact that some of the songs here it really sounds like riffraff and company were out to lunch when it came to writing the choruses like on the song shout out to the bay where they do a bit of a West Coast hyphy kind of thing and I don't like to think which could fooled me it just feels like there was very minimal effort coming from riff raff on this one the beats are decent but without a good song or chorus to attach them to it's not like they're a selling point to the record riffraff just failed to bring anything new to the table on this project and I think he failed to even live up to the standards that he had set so far in his career he has some pretty big features on here but other than that there's nothing really exciting about this record the best tracks on it were the teaser tracks and I think I'm going to leave it at that I'm feeling a strong three to like four on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I argue next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with my review on this record though you can voice a comment down in the comment section if you want to tell me that you hate me and you suppose do it riff-raff peach Panther forever

Orion Joe here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Red Hot Chili Peppers record the getaway this is the latest LP from internationally famous alternative rock and funk rock outfit the Red Hot Chili Peppers the chillies output so far this decade has been kind of lackluster the only other album they put out this decade was 2011 I'm with you which was easily the band's most middling inconsequential smooth and easygoing album yet and that's not really what in my opinion made the band great I mean sure they have some very awesome ballots in their discography songs like under the bridge or scar tissue but it's they're fierce funky and fun rock style that made them such an iconic 90s group now thankfully the getaway brings that funky fierceness back but somehow a lot of the time it still kind of misses the mark unfortunately there are still these really slick and sonically sterile cuts in the mix namely songs like the title track which also kicked the album off for some reason the song the longest wave also makes sure the album is off to a very slow start with one of the most redundant drum beats and lead vocal melodies of the entire album every single time it comes around on the verse I get sick of it so quickly Dadda Dadda Dadda and anthony kiedis of course still comes through with that really put down staccato vocal delivery you know that's just his his singing style you know it's tried and true at this point but I wonder if he's explored every nook and cranny of it especially since on this album I have several moments of deja vu as he kind of delivers his vocals in the same rhythmic pattern it's either this pattern or a variant of this pattern and that would be Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada which is also kind of the same rhythmic pattern his vocals we're riding on the song can't stop which the lead guitar line on this track sounds almost like the bass line from the lead single from this album dark necessities which is a song that I like by the way definitely a highlight in the track listing here I just can't help but feel like everything I like about this record is something that the peppers have done before so there is a lack of new ideas and there are also moments that just feel a little too mellow and maybe that has something to do with the Danger Mouse production on this thing there are a few other artists who he's worked with in the past namely the Black Keys and the result was a somewhat gutless record still though I get a sense that the band is going down a more mellow road like they were on their last record but they're finding more of a balance with their funk rock roots on songs like dark necessities where you have usually smooth beautiful melodic passages balanced out with the slap bass and the hard-hitting drums the song we turn red is similarly melodic funky and dynamic and on the song goodbye angels I love the way that the band plays up to this really tense melodic explosion of instrumentation with these really relentless that the bass lines rhythm guitar and drums it's a little cluttered but the band gets their point across things go slightly south on the song go robot where the band tries to make a pointless point about modern day love and sex against this disco beat that's just a little too easygoing there's a kind of awkward sudden fade-out ending at the very finish of the track which is kind of masked over by these a little blooby blooby synthesizers that I think are supposed to symbolize the digital sex age that the song is supposed to be about oh and then my least favorite track on this thing this Ticonderoga rolls into town where I just cannot stand the brittle distorted sunburned on guitar riffs on this track which sound absolutely hideous and glide awkwardly into and out of the slower more melodic passages of the track it's like the band just wants to bust into this riff but have no idea how to build up to it and they just think kind of this very sudden transition is a good way to assemble the track when in fact it just sounds just cobbled together still I do like the song Detroit even though Anthony Kiedis is vocal inflections here do get to me a little bit I like how the song is essentially a really heartfelt tribute to the Motor City with references to not only Henry Ford but also the Stooges and J Dilla and the song the hunter unquestionably wins the award for the dreariest most depressing and most personal song on the entire record with references to Anthony Kiedis as father as well as Fame and even though I'm kind of indifferent toward the song the choral group vocals on the closing track on this record somehow go over really well and those are essentially my feelings on the album I think they're decent moments to this record there are certainly some high points but they're plenty of low points to that balance it out either they are incredibly forgettable tracks their songs that are awkwardly assembled their songs that are utterly toothless and there are some pretty notable moments of deja vu and the track listing here where it really feels like the Chili Peppers I don't usually say this kind of thing but it literally feels like they're ripping themselves off I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record I was hoping to like it a little bit more especially since there are songs on this album that are legitimately good it's just that despite the I guess the improvements the Chili Peppers make to their music on this record the album is kind of inconsistent whereas their previous record it was consistent but it was consistently forgettable I'm going to leave it at that thank you for watching transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your a to hear the best year the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you happen to disagree with me Red Hot Chili Peppers the good way forever "
9ZE9K_wV1ZI,anybody anything of the nice cure tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for one of my favorite segments on this channel the it came from ban camp where I file through and recommend a series of projects self uploaded on to the band camp platform that I think are worth your attention I also like these projects to be particularly weird so expect some oddities over here in this episode of the of the show like usual and down there in the description box you can check out a playlist lastly list of previous episodes if you would like to be recommended more band camp oddities we're going to kick this one off with an album I could only call interesting Gabriel Gunn deckers I want to meet Richard Dreyfuss now this album is not metaphor Richard Dreyfuss is not a symbol for humanity's longing for the answers to life's toughest questions this album is literally about wanting to meet actor writer Richard Dreyfuss with lots of references to his personal life to his movies there's actually a moment where he meets Richard Dreyfuss that what seems like some kind of you know forum and he gets to ask him a question and he sort of uh confronts him in a way and he says I'm the guy who's been you know trying to meet you and writing all those songs and Richard seems you know pretty cool calm and collected for sure he might have been weirded out a little bit but it was interesting to hear this meeting caught on the album itself I mean it really adds a lot to the concept of it and I'm not really sure what else to say about this thing other than that I mean I find the album funny I think the concept is pretty unique I like that there's a real world element to what this album is trying to accomplish I think the lyrics are witty and I think a lot of the hooks pop pretty well too so there are moments when I'm listening to this I'm on ironically enjoying it you know it's not just simply a comedy record or some album where he's clearly putting it together to with people like he's trolling people he's trolling richard dreyfuss he's genuinely trying to write some good tunes on this record so if you want to hear something with kind of a strange quirk mentally to it a weird tic but it's well-written roughly recorded give this thing a shot moving on we have zeal and our doors the devil is fine this I believe is like listed as black spiritual metal and there's some weird electronic bits woven into the tracklisting here however that's not really what what grabbed my attention about this music as you may have already guessed from that previous label or description of this music there is black metal in this music of course but what kind of makes this black metal so weird is that it has like American spiritual music in a - we're talking American slave spirituals you could I guess call it black and black gospel I have never heard such a thing and again while I do think the production is really messy to the point where I think it ruins the song is a little bit I do admire the very ambitious meld of sounds that this project is trying to bring together might be a little more entertaining with a better recording down the road but again this idea was so novel and it was so interesting that it made me want to recommend this here just for you guys to give it a shot because it is pretty odd this next project has some communist undertones to it a lot of you guys who are familiar with vaporwave and keep tabs on that community might be conscious of a new up-and-coming trend within the vaporwave world called hard vapor which even after hearing a handful of different hard vapor releases I'm not really sure what it is I mean it seems to have a lot of the same characteristics of vapor wave but maybe it's a little more aggressive this project over here is labeled as hard vapor I mean the the H V RF band camp that this project comes from the acronym stands for hard paper resistance front and this album over here is one long twenty two minute piece which to me reads like I don't know music that would be in like a Metal Gear Solid game and you're sneaking into a compound and you're going to take out some guys of course quietly and of course since this project is vapor wave related it has to have a really huge convoluted concept behind it and there's an amazing paragraph in the description of this album which I'm going to read to you as a clip of this music plays in the background thousands of soldiers and tons of aides of Russian thanks a role from previously annex Crimea region into the Ukrainian capital after years of Waddy conflicts and criticism of Russian the return to Soviet ISM from Western media come to boiling point Putin consistently likened to second coming of Joseph Stalin President Trump remains neutral for now to dismay of outgoing of outgoing Ukrainian leaders who are imprisoned by Russian authorities for war crimes against Russia Trump ignores heavy calls from politicians and media in his own country to declare Putin's actions as an act of war and not self-defence Putin declares Ukraine as part of new Russian alliance but still independent state a statement laughed at by Western press with heavy skepticism and criticism who declares the event as the new Soviet uprising gah so uh have fun with your communist guard vapor this next album is from an experimental rock duo known as famous breathers the album is mosquito buzzers and this was a pretty odd freakish project liked a lot about this thing this project actually even has a Glenn Branca ensemble credit and some of the music here reminded me of not only some very harsh noise rock I mean if you're in a half Japanese I think you'll be into someone what's here but also maybe a touch of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds a little bit of the residents as well and some of these songs are pretty dynamic as well I mean these two things happen in the same track like this this okay so it is a pretty strange little album going to recommend this to anybody who likes their rock weird and completely wigged out this next one is an oldie it's been around a little while but it's a goodie it's from a dude snack pack and this project is called dog heaven and it's like this little bedroom synth pop electronic and slash rap album about dogs about how he loves dogs or how great dogs are and I just need more dog albums in my life because dogs are better than cats sorry however the album is not consistently about dogs there's the song live life which is kind of this spoken word motivational piece and there's also a track in here about Bob Ross where I think he wants Bob Ross to be is his uncle you know maybe only stick around for those if you really like the rest of the project or if you just really want to hear a song about Bob Ross but primarily you should be there for the dog songs if you want to hear some cute fun little dog songs then check this thing out and finally we're going to end off with the new gloss EP gloss if you don't know they're a hardcore punk outfit from the west coast the band's name is an acronym for girls living outside Society and the EP here is titled trans day of revenge which came not too long after that Orlando shooting a few weeks ago so it's very aptly timed in a sense the band is just unapologetically focused on LGBT issues and some of the lyrics on this EP like with their previous demo are blatantly violent I mean in a way this EP is a battle cry for the community of people that they are trying to speak for in this music and I think we are going to leave it at that those are the band camp releases that I would love to recommend to you guys in this episode of it came from band camp of course all of them are linked down there in the description box you can not only stream all of their music on band camp but I'm sure if you purchased the music directly from these artists on band you're supporting them as well so you know support local music support

oGgXrNC4J_g,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly segment where I dive into some of my favorite tracks from this past week if you would like to support the segment you could do we already do it now watch it like comment subscribe also hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description box anything you buy on amazon if you live in the u.s. we could kick back from it does not add to your overall price now all these tracks that I'm going to recommend to you also link down there in the description box you can hear and check out all these songs and videos they're cool cool alright I'm gonna do this little raw because that's how we do these let's get into the worst track of the week without question we're song I heard this week potential to be where song of the year is the new Fall Out Boy song featuring Missy Elliott a track from the new Ghostbusters movie where they essentially cover the Ghostbusters theme song it's such a heavy overblown version of the original track I can't stand it it's like listening to pop punk and dubstep come together and Missy Elliott somehow involved I thought she knew better but I guess you know we're all capable of making bad decisions let's let's continue we have a new track from Icelandic post rock and experimental rock band sigur rós this new track of theirs is one of the oddest I've heard them put out in a while quite abrasive as well considering that their past couple of records were kind of easy on the ears their last record not as menacing as I thought it was going to be but their past couple albums have been quite blissful and heavenly this new track by comparison way more textured and heavy especially when these like electronic shots of percussion come in that are very rigid and very hard-hitting so sounds like sigur rós is finally coming through with an interesting change of pace which i think they've been in need of for a while moving on I want to shout out a track body war from the band show me the body a group that I had been introduced to just very recently actually caught them live with rat King at one point but they had a different sound a very different sound than what they actually have on this track this song very punky very heavy but has kind of that I don't know somewhat reverb II Sheen that you would expect from like an indie group or something there's something weirdly hollow about the track that that gives it an interesting character but yeah it's simultaneously also very punishing and hard-hitting again can't fully explain what it is about this track that makes it so unique but I like the song quite a bit moving on my dude cleaner with the song let me be this guy I can't tell if he's making comedy rap or if he's making serious rap I mean it's sort of funny and it seems tongue-in-cheek but ionically enjoy it and I don't know I just find his lyrics on this track to be hilarious especially as he's saying be my hoe girl be my whole world a really really good rhyme they're really great rhyme from my boy cloner so this guy keeps dropping these eccentric rap singles and videos I'm just looking forward to seeing where he moves next he seems like a total nut case musically anyway which you know is just continued to make his music more and more entertaining to listen to as he falls down this descent into insanity moving on we have a track from night funk which is a new collaborative project featuring night jewel and Dame funk and never thought in a million years these two would be on you know like a full-length collaborative project although it is just an EP and it's actually pretty great night rolls vocals complement Dame's very funky synth production or really nicely I know these two their paths have crossed before so I guess it's not you know surprising that they'd make more music together but for them to be really going the distance on a new EP year is pretty interesting and this track is pretty catchy pretty fun fun we have a new track from the tallest man on earth seems like a strip back acoustic ballad not as instrumentally overwrought as some of the material that was on his last record so I'm liking that seems like we're going back to you know kind of that skeletal basic but very effective of singer-songwriter acoustic guitar great passionate vocal formula from the tallest man on earth a couple more we have gucci mane who just dropped a new track which was absolutely hilarious on All My Children where he's essentially rapping about all these southern rappers are his children he's influenced all of them and none of them would have careers if not for him so very funny track from gucci mane and finally we're gonna end it off with a Touche Amore's palm dreams new cut from their forthcoming record sort of on the fence with this track the chorus rubs me the wrong way sort of feels like something out of a 2000s era radio rock radio single but uh the chorus seems not the chorus the verses seem really throttling and energetic and everything that I would expect from this band you know that they're still going for that emo and screamo thing but they're working in a bit more pop rock maybe to take the edge off of that and maybe appeal to a wider audience and just go for a different sound I'm not against this move in theory could result in some good tracks but uh I can't say I'm vibing completely with this song outside of some of the verses and and the great performance you know I think the the drums and the guitars are really tight on this track very melodic and um you know super loud super blaring just really emotionally and auditorily overwhelming like I would typically expect from these guys and yeah those are gonna do it for my favorite tracks of this week again they're all linked down there in the description box and again our amazon associates link is down there as well and also uh in the description box for your morbid curiosity is that terrible Ghostbuster song from the new Ghostbusters soundtrack Thank You Fall Out Boy for that all right we're gonna leave it at that favorite tracks this week forever 
yD2k3gOj9U4,whoo hey everyone get any sleep Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kodak black mixtape little big pock this is the latest mixtape from Florida rapper and recent double XL freshmen 2016 double XL freshmen Kodak black he has been making waves on the trap scene for a few years now earning nods from people like Earl Sweatshirt as well as Drake he's featured with artists such as French Montana as well and race and this year I haven't been as disappointed in the double XL list as I had in the past few years I mean there were a handful of artists whose future material I definitely look forward to g herbo denzel curry Anderson Pak little yachty I'm even semi curious as to what designer is gonna drop this year I mean his material could be good the Panda single has grown on me and middly but fun to fund Abunda I oppose an event so I've been checking out the other double XL freshmen of this year who I'm less familiar with Kodak black is one of those artists who I haven't heard a full project from all the way through I've heard a lot of his singles on YouTube seen a lot of news items about him over the past couple of years so I figured I would get into this one since a lot of people seem to be enjoying it but I can't really say I'm I'm liking it and I can already see the tweets and the comments telling me I'm wrong and I'm stupid and he's authentic and but and I don't really doubt Kodak blacks authenticity but not only do I not enjoy this tape at all but I'm not really seeing the potential for Kodak black to appeal to me in the future either for one let's address the cancerous cover art on this mixtape which was undoubtedly Photoshop using the latest in space-age cringe technology and here's a little science for you the speed at which Biggie and pock are spinning in their graves right now if we were to harness that energy we could power the entire east and west coast but as far as the music goes on this thing it's it's not much better I have to commend Kodak black for not going the auto-tuned and the crooning route that everybody's trying to go for these days you know he's seriously trying to spit some bars and deliver some flows on this tape the problem is is that Kodak's delivery is flatter than an SUV's tires driving up a hill of stainless steel nails not only is his flow off tempo it's super slow and drawly and not really engaging reminds me of a fusion of Lil Wayne when he's at his most squirrelly and lean soaked and Gucci Mane when he's at his most incoherent and when I do understand what Kodak Black is saying it's not even remotely clever or catchy there was one line on here about him sort of like dropping Molly into a birthday cake or making the but just like putting Molly into the recipe or putting a little bit of codeine in the Minute Maid Oh one moment where a doctor was telling him to eat his veggies so he's now smoking broccoli a lot of food to drug references a one line that kind of confused me about he's sorry about forgetting about someone's birthday but then he doesn't give a fuck about a birthday or someone doesn't give a fuck about a birthday I honestly have a hard time focusing on the lyrics because on tracks like today codec black barely sounds alive like there should be EMTs on standby at the studio because he sounds like he's just about to pass out sometimes just how low-key his vocals are and just how slow and off-kilter they are becomes a hilarious contrast from the beat which can be very punchy and commercial maybe even might have a very bright memorable sharp hook like on the song too many years which has a fantastic vocal feature from PNB rock that dude really left it all out there on the track I'm interested in hearing him appear on other people's songs because I think he killed this hook but then once we switch into Kodak's versus he's on this track Kodak sounds almost like a parody of Gangstalicious from the boondocks but with like a blood alcohol level of zero point two four it was one line on the song Bank where he's like I be I like I'd be painting pictures but I picture paint why I'm just so confused you know the lyrics aren't really that interesting which again I don't expect every rapper I come across to be top notch poet okay all right I'm not I'm not sort of holding every rapper to that standard but I'm not really seeing the appeal outside of the lyrics you know is his voice charismatic and attention-grabbing and exciting to listen to not really he sounds half-asleep the production a lot of the time is is the best thing about these tracks and even that isn't very consistent like on the song perp for example this track features these tinny high-pitched synth leads that kind of hurt my ears and they aren't mixed into the beat all that well I think there's just a lot of missed opportunities on this tape you know occasionally I can hear allusions to the life that Kodak leads and mentions of his mother and what he's sort of seen and experienced over his life there are occasionally moments where in his delivery I hear a bit of emotion too the sad thing is is just that none of it comes together into a coherent set of bars or songs there was one line that kind of stuck out to me where he said you don't have to like my music but you'll respect me or you have to respect me and I kind of feel like I'm at that impasse right now you know uh he seems like a kid who's making the music that he needs to make in order to make waves within the music scene where he wants attention as far as what he says in his music I mean I really have no reason to have anything against him as as a person but this tape is really not for unfortunately even without the lyrical component I mean I would love to hear kodak black just sound a little more sober sharp and alive and energetic on his own songs i'm feeling a strong three to a light four on this project transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you disagree with me strongly on this review preciate you forever 
tZv3A6_wxrI,ladies and gentlemen a review for a band that you probably you just think they're okay but in you can't say a bad thing about him the swings hi everyone best the need teeth tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new swans record the glowing man this is the latest full-length album from legendary experimental rock band swans billed as the final album the band is going to release in this current incarnation of the van not so sure what that means but michael gira and company have clearly put a bit of a marker here saying the band is going to consciously move forward and evolve in some kind of significant way with future releases but in a way this is nothing all that new because swans has always been in a state of evolution from the start to this point of their career you may remember back in 2010 when they made their comeback from being dead and came back with an entirely different sound one that was similar to Michael jiriz Angels of Light side-project but it would be on their next record the seer that they would kick off the sound that they had been exploring for their past three records the last time swans dropped a final studio album it was about 20 years ago with the record soundtracks for the blind it would be a couple years later that they would drop the live album swans are dead and in my opinion the new material the band has been dropping since they reconvened has really given a lot of this older stuff in their discography new context because the the band's progression from really primordial and abrasive noise rock in the early 80s to the really developed and hypnotic and sort of progressive experimental rock music that they're making now it's intriguing plus all of the sounds the band has dabbled in and push the envelope with and all the sounds the band has developed over the years on curds like the great Annihilator and soundtracks for the blind their goth rock records their dark folk and neo folk output some of the solo material and and side-project material that michael gira put out while swans was a dead for the first time and now with this latest trio of albums which is ending with the glowing man we're getting these gargantuan opuses where swans entire canon of musical styles kind of culminates and all these things are packed into monstrous song lengths monstrous album lengths complemented with dense layers of instrumentation very vibrant production the songs are performed with these really tense and patient progressions all of these ethereal intros and interludes that develop into these hypnotic grooves and explosive walls of instrumentation of guitars and drums and background vocals and horns and keys and bells and really that's just the band's past couple of records and and the glowing man over here checks a lot of the same boxes that to be kind did so there are no huge surprises on this record in my opinion but some very notable and important changes I would actually say this album is more meditative than the seer and to be kind the band is really trying to hit listeners with these repetitions that we've heard over the last couple of albums in a different way in a way that's simultaneously relaxing but also unsettling case in point of the song Cloud of Unknowing where Michael JIRA's vocals as well as the background vocals come together into what seems almost like a call to prayer or some kind of religious chant the instrumentation on this record comes together in a way where it feels like I'm listening to a very panoramic mix like I'm surrounded by the musicians on this record and really enveloped in the music not a sensation I felt quite as much on to be kind that album to me was just very straightforward it was throttling it was crushing the glowing man is a little bit more about subtlety especially the little sonic and musical nuances that are hidden in these interludes and these drones that the band seems to harp on for much longer than they were on their last album the glowing man doesn't really lend itself to casual listening even less so than swans past couple of Records even though those were both two hours each as well by comparison to be kind is a little bit more of a barn burner especially with blood pumping cuts like oxygen as well as a little God in my hands the glowing man feels like a cohesive to our experience more than it does just a grouping of songs a multi-phase spirit journey if you will even the loudest heaviest build on this record which is like in the first half of the title track doesn't so much feel like I'm being beaten down or whipped up into an aggressive frenzy it's more like I'm being lifted up into the god realm believe me it's not clouds and angels plucking harps instead it's chaos its total meltdown it's pushing the boundaries of human something beyond its limits and I say something because there is certainly an experience about this album in my opinion that's difficult to put into words but when I do sit down and I listen to this record I do feel like I'm being pushed past my breaking point and this feeling only intensified in the second half of the title track here as swans whipped out this heavy guitar riff that had kind of a kraut rakesh groove to it and the more and more they rode this groove the tenser and tenser the instrumental got now after this track we have the closing song which is logically titled peace at last it's a bit of a calm after the storm and this track is one of many shorter songs in the track listing that serve as really good tune full breathers in between these lengthy monsters in that respect this album reminds me quite a bit of the seer there were a lot of those shorter tracks to guide us from one long cut to another and these shorter cuts also bring some nice diversity to the record as well like on these song people like us which had a very dramatic kind of Country and Western vibe to it especially the slowly strung guitars Michael jurors very theatrical delivery of the incredibly apocalyptic lyrics in this track that were unsettling kind of morbid as well and the arranged instrumentation on the track was gorgeous these tracks really help out the flow of the record to be kind by comparison felt a little bit more like a trial with each track because every song was just almost a challenge to be faced which scratched its own sort of cerebral itch the glowing man a slightly different one another thing I like about this album is that the longest cuts on here I think they flow really logically so much so that the momentum that is that is ramped up at the beginning of the track is carried fluidly from one passage to the next like with the epic and heavy riffs and the tubular bells and the grand chorus vocals on the Cloud of Unknowing in the second half which flowed really nicely into the Spacey interlude right after which almost felt I don't know freely improved in a sense to me it's like during these jeroni passages the band is in a certain key and everybody's kind of just gently contributing to this atmosphere of instrumentation and there's so many layers to these interludes even though there's not the strongest sense of direction during these passages as a listener I can just kind of float within these spots and find a lot of beauty and find a lot of interesting things to hear another thing I like about the progressions on this record is that they're not as telegraphed as they were on to be kind and I think that's again because the band isn't trying to throttle you and hit you with all these straightforward aggressive obvious movements instead you may have several pieces of instrumentation changing or embellishing at one time so which one is kind of guiding things you're not really so sure but no matter what direction it's going in at any given time it's all very cohesive it's not like a total mess and nobody's really paying attention to anybody else or that there's no sense of composition on these tracks there certainly is now here I'd like to highlight that even though there are things that I think this album does better than to be kind it's only because this album is trying to go for a different experience than to be kind to be kind to me was a punchy ER record it was a heavier record it was a more immediate record there were a lot of insane and exciting vocal performances from michael gira all over this album as well the glowing man I think Michael plays it a little more low-key the performances and the instrumentation on the glowing man aren't as consistently aggressive or hard-hitting but the trade-off is that you're hearing music that is more intoxicating more entrancing and keeping you locked into these repetitions and into these space passages means delivering instrumentals that are a little more elaborate case in point the building wall of instrumentation on the song Frankie em in the first half which had me at near eargasm or on the song the world looks red the world looks black which at one point features these wonderful jangly guitars jazzy flutes some light percussion and these bear in my mind mantras being repeated again and again and again it's moments like this that just kind of lock my brain into a deep trance and this trance is intensified as this head crushing just just not even like a full riff just one single note and some drums kind of pop in and set the pace for these really hot horns and kind of zany background vocals hello man hello to make a man the intro track the cloud or forgetting is a decent cut I like the instrumental I like the mix on this track it sounds very pretty not one of the most engaging moments in the track listing here but I think it sets the Spacey and psychedelic tone of the album itself so makes sense and I pretty much mentioned all of the songs in the track listing at this point with the exception of when will I return which is another sort of breather cut but still a very chilling ballad featuring vocals from Michael JIRA's wife Jennifer jeera the lyrics are pretty a widening and dark from what I understand the detail and experience she had being sexually assaulted and then as the instrumental develops into these twiddling guitars and some twisted sinister psychedelic keyboard the track only gets better in terms of songs there's not really much else to mention the two-hour runtime of this project is broken down into just eight tracks but again this album isn't really about songs or about what any single song does you know it feels like a pretty cohesive to our experience to be honest even though as I dive into the lyrics there doesn't seem to be one single thread or concept that pulls the entire album together I think sonically and musically there most definitely a lot of common threads but it seems like there's a different experience and a different emotion kind of fueling each single track of course given that it's swans their tracks on here that deal with God and religion and spirituality as well as death and existence and mortality and I guess these songs even though they're fueled by very specific experiences and ideas still point in those directions like on the somewhat abstract and very poetic people like us and on the song Frankie em as well where JIRA seems to be singing about somebody who is trying to reach some sort of higher plane or something through drug use and there's a moment where you singing about you know butterfly butterfly but then all of a sudden the glass breaks he's stabbed in the eye all of a sudden this moment that he was having in the Sun is crashing down and he's dying and even though there are things in the music that to me read to me as being very spiritual and very otherworldly a still swans as a group who I've never thought to take religion or spirituality all that seriously you know that they've taken kind of a cynical tone when it's come to spirituality and and in religion in my opinion either that or when they sort of embrace these themes they come at a very dark sided angle of the closing track on here case in point a few lyrics that stuck out to me about all creation being Hollow and the mind of being as useless as a knife in a lake or an arrow in space I think this is a pretty great swan song to this era in the Ann's career I don't know if we're going to see a big break before we see another swans record how long it's going to take the band to restructure into something different but I just got to say that not only is the glowing man to be kind and the seer I think one of the best trilogies in rock music but this is a fantastic ending to it and just to think about these three albums coming together the feet that swans have essentially achieved here coming together with three records back-to-back all great each of them two hours each and in an age where most rock bands can't help but a look back into the past and pull so blatantly from it swans have continued moving forward and have dropped one incredibly ambitious project after another that pushes the limitations of rock music and I'm looking forward to seeing them continue to do that with whatever swans or swans related material drops in the hopefully near future so if you're looking for something that's a very mind-altering heavy cerebral vast and very dynamic this is your record you know it's a little time consuming but the experience I had with this record for me very fulfilling no big complaints about this album other than you know maybe it was a little too similar to its two predecessors and in some respects I occasionally did get a little hint of deja vu but some of that is surely intentional because the more I listen to this album the more it feels like it's so deeply connected to the two previous swans records and once I familiarize myself with this record I'm looking forward to going back and sort of revisiting to be kind and the seer in depth as well to sort of get a full gauge of what exactly these three albums are trying to do I'm feeling a decent a strong nine on this LP Teran ition have you given the sound modal listen did you love it did you hate it would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the light if you like please subscribe please don't cry happen to a strongly disagree with my point of view on this swans album hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm anthony Fantana forever 
ziYDeoP0ai8,hey everyone totally messed a gnome here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new clipping EP ruggle oh this is a new six-track EP from experimental hip hop trio industrial hip hop trio from the west coast clipping a group that I have been impressed with since the drop of their debut mixtape I was subsequently blown away by the commercial release they would come out with around the corner on Sub Pop Records since then they've dropped single tracks that I've really been impressed with like knees on the ground that track is great but also there have been some extracurriculars outside of the clipping sphere that have certainly been of note especially mr. Davi Diggs lyricist of clipping getting a Tony Award for the role that he played in the Hamilton musical yeah and while I am happy for for him I do still enjoy clipping quite a bit and I just want to hear more music from clipping want to hear what the band is is going to do next and this new EP is a pretty depraved quite a few songs about lust and desire and not even sex just straight again like on the song hot fuck no love which features a hilariously graphic verse from cakes the killa also the song our time at the very end of the project and the title track on here regal which features a very prominent vocal sample from White House's whale hey if you want to hear the original track you got to look up this this group there are UK power electronics and noise outfit the song comes off their 2003 record bird seed but of course there are moments where clipping comes back to those themes of street crime and drug culture and violence like on the song shooter which features this beat that's kind of funky seems almost DJ mustard inspired or just inspired by a pop rap music from the bay the hook is incredibly catchy it's surprisingly one of clippings less noise intensive songs but the track is as bouncy as it is eerie and also this EP off like many clipping projects have so far with some very speedy verses from dahveed at the very end a shot of harsh noise and feedback as da beat says it's clipped bitch and the way this track was recorded it sounds like it was recorded outside like you really feel like dahveed is on that street corner that he's rapping about on this song and the themes of drug dealing that come up in the lyrics on this intro are very gritty as expected there are plenty of moments on here where I'm impressed with David's lyrics whether it be in kind of the way that he's going in depth with a particular subject on a track or some of the one-liners that he drops like on the song shooter to take it back to that track one line where he's like the shooters are going nuts cashew been to blow his ass away Jetstream and while that cut is cool I am hoping for and I was looking for songs on here that had a little more texture in the instrumentals features some of those interesting sampling tricks that I've enjoyed and clippings music in the past and that comes up on the deeper cuts like on the song backup which features this really catchy refrain back up back up back up back up back up sounds like something a new metal song or something and the instrumental has this just booming explosive piece of percussion that pops up pretty regularly I'm pretty sure we hear the sample at its actual pitch toward the end of the track but as I'm listening to it throughout the song it's like I'm listening to somebody pop a paper bag at the other end of a sewer pipe I guess it's interesting they work the sound into the beat but I don't think it's a particularly gratifying sound to listen to in the instrumental as it feels kind of bumi and thin and there isn't really that much oomph to it lyrically I think the track is a little more interesting than it is instrumentally I like Antoine's verse on here where he's rapping that death in the afterlife and about how his girl is like haunting him while he's sitting on the toilet via text message signore Benedict comes through with the wild delivery that come to expect so far and he has this crazy verse where this girl is kind of caught in to the sexual underbelly of the internet and she's showing her feet to strangers on line one lures her out somewhere where like he's going to take advantage of her but then she whips out a katana and awesome the song Riggle however has one of my favorite instrumentals on the entire EP not only do I think the white house samples are executed really well but I love how sporadic and fast and off-kilter some of the kick drums are on this cut reminds me a little bit of footwork music or Juke music but again I think instrumentally this is a moment that could have been a little heavier I'm thinking back to two spots and clippings discography like the song body and blood I just love have overpowering and pummeling that track is none of these instrumentals here really seem to have that same oomph especially the noisier instrumentals the song shooter I think kind of gets away with the fact that it's got a nice bounce it's got a poppier appeal to it so doesn't necessarily need to be overbearing just really head crushing but some of these other tracks the more abrasive cuts I wish just had a bit more punch but the lyrics on this title track I like a lot the themes of sex and violence and BDSM and the cash ends off with the song our time a track that I think had some potential that it didn't fully cash in on I think the guest vocals on here are a little shaky Nayla Middleton I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly her delivery has a bit of a jazzy tone to it which I think was intentional I think the trio thought if they toss that in there would really be a weird juxtaposition however it just didn't fit the eerie and a very strange tone of the instrumental in my opinion and in addition to that I guess I thought the vocal performance on this cut was just a tad flat still a pretty ambitious experiment on this track hectic this project was certainly raw very noisy and showcased the group trying out some new things just didn't have that punchy vibrant visceral production that I've come to expect however maybe that's something that they're waiting to do for their next full-length album and this EP is just a little a little raw and quick just kind of hit the fans with something I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to disagree with me on this review clipping wriggle EP forever 
ddkcwXO8Wk4,please and gentlemen y'all be asking for this review you're sending a few death threats like if we if we didn't review this you're gonna kill us so now we gotta do the review cuz we don't want to die damn Billy man hi everyone Jess and hands tan I'm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new John bel Ian's record the human condition songwriter singer producer rapper mr. John Bell Ian for a while now he has been writing and co-writing songs for some pretty huge stars while on the side penning his solo stuff dropping some projects and mixtapes so the human condition over here not his first rodeo however this album seems to be his big breakout project that a lot of people are finally taking notice of John's work this thing is just under an hour long it's got 14 tracks and cover art that makes me feel like I'm about to listen to a Disney movie and the music actually isn't too far off from that comparison at least when you're talking about music from recent Disney films specifically like from the Pixar universe however it's I guess it's not the the worst thing in the world I can at least commend John on his production on a lot of these tracks many of these songs feature a pretty tasteful blend of radio and soundtrack pop with a little bit of rap the album kicks off with a pretty vibrant instrumental and John telling a story about how despite the fame despite the money he hasn't changed still the same guy which is cool shows a lot of heart on his part but unfortunately his vocals are kind of marred in this really ugly chorus effect that makes telling what John is saying nearly impossible that is until he starts to sing which is when his rap voice just transitions into this boyish angelic let me put it this way John has a voice that makes Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie sound menacing and this is a slight turn-off for me you know some of these some vocals do sound pretty sanitary like not a whole lot of flavor or excitement to them there are a lot of things that I like about this track but I end up being indifferent toward it because there are plenty of cons to John's music so far as well and I feel roughly the same about the song 80s films even though I can see John is making some interesting artistic choices especially with the production on this track where it has this kind of bouncy sheen on all the instrumentation that calls back to many of the amazing hit songs that made it on to countless 80's soundtracks the song itself is kind of this grossly sentimental ballad about going back to a time when things were simpler I guess and it was like ninth grade and John was just kind of chilling with this person who he liked watching 80s movies and again I think this singing is OK the production pretty decent I think what John is offering is certainly better and more entertaining and thoughtful than a lot of the comparable pretty boy pop artists so you might find on the market today like Bieber and Zayn I wouldn't say John's music is intolerable by any stretch of the imagination he certainly knows his way around a hook as well like the song good in me where he has a pretty interesting metaphor about how this person is hunting through the woods and they hunt for that goodness in John it brings out the goodness in him and John shows himself to be pretty versatile on this record too like on the song new york soul part 2 where all of a sudden John just transitions into this big boy voice and he's like rapping some serious bars on here like he comes through the really convincing flow and about as much grit as he can muster and there are a couple questionable lines here and there but then once the chorus pops in he cannot help himself he has to throw in those watery pretty dreamy guitars and those cherub vocals I get that his style means that he's incorporating so many different musical sounds into one song but to me it doesn't really come off as an aesthetic but more of a lack of appreciation for the aesthetics of of every single kind of musical style he tries to pack into one track it simply just reads to me as like a move to make this album more appealing to a larger amount of people because you got a little bit of pop in there a little bit of a rock in there you got a little bit of a hip hop in there and it's all coming together so I think the mishmash of influences here kind of softens the blow of of any good parts of this record because often what's decent on the album is quickly swapped out for something that I don't really care for that much but ignoring that I think the production and the instrumentals are pretty good on the album again but I can't really get into many of the songs on here I think the songwriting and especially the lyrics are kind of insipid like they reflect the emotional maturity and complexity of the children's movies that John's music is is clearly inspired by not only that but I just feel like a lot of the lyrics feed on this totally unearned nostalgia especially on tracks like 80s films I mean you're having nostalgia for a time that you didn't even kind of move through it's just kind of like several years ago that you're nostalgic for and you're sort of nostalgic for the 80s by watching these films it's kind of a nostalgia abortion then there's also the song maybe idk or I don't know where John is talking about the unsure times of today and musically I feel like the song is just kind of like you know a warm hug and it's an assuring smile and it's just kind of like yeah everything's going to be okay but the thing is the song feels like a big fat lie because not everything is going to be okay things are pretty screwed right now could just be my pessimism here but it just feels like a really shallow surface-level attempt to just blank it over all the crap that's going on right now I mean putting out a song like this while we're on the verge of moving through an election cycle where our choices are Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton didn't boo not to mention that the song also features kind of the electronic acoustic blend of instrumentation that makes me think of songs like V cheese wake me up and I hate that song on the song woke the up another track where I really like the production I mean I think it's super inventive the way John produces this beat surely as you know you have these samples of like someone you know waking up with this really huge breath as if they haven't been able to breathe for a little bit the instrumental is very harmonious and glitzy and pretty but I feel like some of the lyrics on here like when John is singing about how we live in an age where everything is staged is kind of like an unconscious admission of the emotional staging of this record John I think would like his listeners to believe that with this album he's really letting us in and we're getting such a personal view of his thoughts and his life and his artistic process but as I step into this record I don't feel like I'm stepping into the mind or the home of a person but rather a dollhouse and every song is a picture-perfect and meticulously arranged room with unrealistic color palettes a place where even the saddest and most troubling moments are given this doily soft exterior again even in interviews and on John's Wikipedia page it is cited that his influences include artists like Kanye West and J Dilla as well as the music and movies of Pixar and I guess I could give it to John for actually making music that before I even read this I thought that that actually kind of reminds me of this stuff so he definitely channels his influences in a way where his music embodies them but this isn't really a combination of sounds I'm even mildly interested in nor am i interested in a band that brings together the artistry of Nirvana and hanna-barbera or Bob Dylan and Japanese anime or James Brown and Charlie Brown I just don't think this record is for me you know it's not terrible but I'm just pretty indifferent to the whole thing it's just a sparkling combination of pop music and rap music not so sparkling that it's disgustingly commercial you know there's certainly some creative and intriguing ideas coming through and the production but I'm not really interested in that many of the tunes not into the lyrics many of which are just so desperate to tug at your heartstrings as if they're like a movie soundtrack that that needs to sound sad or needs to sound a certain way because you've got to feel a certain way during this particular scene because every moments got to sound either sad or grand or like a momentous occasion or just life-affirming and I just don't need it you know and also there are many spots on here that feels if John is trying to be confessional but this is a confessional record that doesn't really have anything to say or at least it doesn't want you to feel anything that it has to say as pretty much again the saddest moments on this project are sugar coated in this really easygoing emotionally sterile pop music again you could do a lot worse than what John has to offer on this project but it's really got nothing for me I'm feeling a light decent five on this thing transition having given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you have a do disagree with my opinion in this review with the John bel ian the human condition forever 
ETXH-YdlXUE,ladies and gents in the world you're gonna get your hard get your real hard done male hi everyone ah honey ah tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new nails record you will never be one of us one of the most savage bands in the world oh they're back for a third full-length record their debut album which dropped like six years ago at this point unsilent death one of the most adrenaline pumping head smashing albums ever recorded Kurt blew of converge on production on this one sounds amazing now their sophomore record that dropped three years ago at this point just four minutes longer at 18 minutes and it seemed like nails was kind of conscious of their music and the way it was being received at this point and what people were enjoying about their music and since their music was such an aggressive challenge to the listener it seems like they wanted to up the ante a little bit raise the bar on this record and say okay you know you can withstand unsilent death let's let's give you this because on here they went even more relentless and merciless louder faster more insane the vocals were just throat shredding to the point really where it made me real back a little bit like this was just a little too dense and too chaotic still liked it though but just didn't stick with me as much as unsilent death did because it was just so difficult to commit a lot of this record to memory because so much of it went by an aggressive blur so with this next album over here I guess I was anticipating and hoping for a few things you know of course I always want to see nails up the intensity and up the noise and up the volume factor of their music but also you know I love it when their music stays visceral and is actually memorable to a degree and I think on you will never be one of us they find that balance still though this record is not a walk in the park it is unwelcoming as usual as we would expect from nails even on the cover itself we have a bunch of these weird monk looking figures with tentacles flying out of their mouths all simultaneously I don't know yelling at or hissing at or grabbing at this black devilish figure just hanging in the middle like from just the cover art we can see continuation of the themes that have worked themselves out in nails music up until this point societal rejection lone wolf status everything I've loved about the band so far and now it's being delivered to us in this 22 minute long album with an eight-minute monster finisher at the very end the rest of the tracklist though is business as usual you have these 40 to 90 second hardcore metal blitzkrieg the production is still crushing the buzzsaw guitars super heavy everything the guitars the bass the drums all compressed into this dense brick of music the bass is pretty distorted the drums are like gunshots going off the blast beats are intense the vocals are these throaty savage roars the songs don't really feel like these isolated moments as much as they just weave together into this tapestry of death and suffering the title track kicks things off with these thunderous riffs and intense speed which eventually breaks down into these very mosh friendly riffs even though these tracks again they're like 40 seconds long a minute and change nails make sure to pack some interesting transitions into these tracks it's not like Aaron the same thing for 40 seconds the rage on this LP is at maximum potency and even though the band is keeping up this level of extremity they're able to make their songs in my opinion catchy once again I love the tension breaks that guide us into some really primal breakdowns on songs like life is a death sentence as well as into Quietus the song parasite features this slow down into a galloping riff with some lead guitars over it it sounds like something that is sped up and pulled straight from the Pantera playbook and I really enjoyed hearing Pam Tara's influence on their first record it's cool that it's come back here the song savage intolerance features some pretty cool dissonant sour lead guitars that sound like this descent into madness over the crazy distorted riffs that are just throttling away in the background and the three-minute violence is forever in the middle of the record the second longest track on the entire album has these kind of noisy psychedelic guitar solos and sounds and the in the middle of the track that I liked a lot and then we come to the 8-minute closer they come crawling back which to my knowledge is nails longest song so far and just the longest track on the record at the very end and nails shows that once again they can go the distance on a song if they want to it doesn't necessarily need to be this forty second cut the introduction of the track has these very dark brooding minor chords that sound like something out of a black metal song the track moves through these multiple phases of blasts beats and slowed down riffs it's all pretty intense definitely some sludge metal vibes at a couple points on this track the song is surprisingly dynamic however I was a little underwhelmed by the ending here which just ended with a simple fade-out as the band starts delivering some of the heaviest and most visceral riffs on the entire cut and not only was I disappointed that the song didn't have a solid ending to it but fading out just seems like the most unmailed way to end a record not really the kind of music or band that should be faded out still though I have to give it two nails I have to give to this record for just being another solid album in their discography I mean maybe at this point people have heard everything that the band has to offer in their opinion but for me the band seems like they're still progressing a little bit they're still keeping up exactly what they're known for doing as well as they've been doing it and it's kind of hard for them to overstay their welcome three albums in sticking to roughly the same sound when not even a single one of these records so far has been minutes I mean with each record so far having a three-year gap the ban certainly isn't over saturating us with this music but I think their next record could certainly do with a little more adventure in terms of the flow and the sound of the album - I mean what few experiments and risks the band took here were pretty cool you know like that black metal intro the final track I thought that was a executed really nicely and I only hope to see the band work in more shades of extreme music in the future and I think I'm going to leave it at that I'm feeling a strong e2 la9 on this album try an O when those are my feelings on this new Nails album you will never be one of us I hope you enjoyed the video I hope you enjoy this record because it's fucking awesome and I hope you're having a good one guys again have a nice day appreciate you watching you know do the lichen and the commenting and subscribing and all that shit so just something you feel like I should review next and yeah mhmmmm eat those fruits and veggies get that get that water stay hydrated forever 
4L953g8FYXI,hey everyone Antoine Phan Tuan here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is best is dinner go and on this channel we are moving a segment from the second channel over here now the podcast is kind of dead don't know if you caught that up on Twitter but yeah podcast is on its deathbed so I don't see it going anywhere forever you know it's it's still gonna be around I'm just probably going to be doing the podcast when a bigger sort of more than full interview comes along just going to stick to reviews and the stuff I'm doing on the second channel for now but anyway what this segment is gonna be is a weekly segment where I recommend a bunch of tracks to you guys that have come out over the past week that I'm really enjoying because there are a lot of songs that come out every week and you guys are asking me to review them and talk about them and sometimes they don't always get to it because there are a lot of albums that I want to review you know unfortunately can't really review everything and but you know the track reviews aren't going anywhere necessarily but there are some tracks that I just essentially want to give a shout out to and turn you guys on to them have you guys go check out some links in the description box and yeah that's it that's essentially what this segment is gonna be so favorite track segments ah I'm gonna try to do this as weakly as possible now before I get into this segment I want to tell you guys that you should hit up our amazon associates link down there in the description box it supports this segment and my buddy Austin who edits this segment as well anything you buy on Amazon if you live in the u.s. we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price just use it to buy you were gonna buy anyway and now some recommendations of some new tracks first off Viet Cong is back under their new band name preoccupations they have a new single new album on the way song is titled anxiety it's really brooding it's dark it's droney not quite as punky as the band's previous material but it's still pretty intriguing looking forward to what the band does next after this past name change and everything gonna see if it kind of coincides with an aesthetic a sound change as well it could quite possibly I also want to give a shout out to bad bad not goods new cut featuring Kate Renata the song lavender kind of a tit-for-tat situation here because bad bad not good did appear on Kate Renata's last full-length LP and now we're hearing some very prominent fat dark deep bassy since all over this cut over here it's kind of ominous it's psychedelic but still hip-hop infused and jazzy as you would expect a good bad bad not good track to be so again liking this track and anticipating that band's forthcoming full-length LP this track and all these others linked down there in the description box moving on Eric Copeland of Black Dice Fame has a new track out titled Grippit new album on the way this track red to me is kind of like a I don't know a psych pop song Eric's music is sounding a little more accessible than it has in the past and I'm liking that however the watery washy very strange electronic effects and manipulations of course are present in the mix it's a very strange track not saying it's gonna be easy to get into but it's sounding a little sweeter on the ears than Eric's music usually is I mean maybe that's a sort of the intention here given that from what I understand this album is going to be titled black bubblegum you know maybe sort of bubblegum as in sweetness or bubblegum music pop music but the blackness being you know the darkness of it or sort of what makes it weird so yeah big in that track clipping as a new EP out titled wriggle which I will link down there as well that I'm going to be doing a review of this EP very soon hold your horses it's coming out Danny Brown new record you just signed to warp records and new single titled when it rained this is the weirdest most abstract and dark thing Danny Brown has done in a while you know is his recent material has been very much focused on and developed for sort of that festival crowd and that Club crowd that was really taking to his music but this just he just went left on this track not only is there like a pummeling just heavy beat on this thing that's just not there that's not present instead to be on this thing is a very eerie with some high-pitched sort of disjointed synth leads and then we also have kind of this very kind of grainy drone cycling away in the instrumental as well and Danny Browns flow over this track is kin  sane he's just high-octane running on all cylinders from the beginning to the end of the track the yell P flow is here in all its glory and some of the bars he delivers are pretty dark and grimy too again one of the strangest things Danny Brown has done in a while and it's going to be interesting to see if many of the other tracks on his forthcoming album follow suit so and again him landing on work records is a really interesting development as well looking to see if that's going to impact the sound of this album in some kind of way then we have the avalanches the song colors featuring Jonathan Donahue feels kind of like a psych pop throwback but with the same kind of editing and then sampling style that you expect from an avalanche this song I did enjoy the iTunes mix of Frankie Sinatra a lot more than I did the YouTube mix which i think was kind of marred with the sound effects from the music video the vocal sounded a little bit better on the high tunes mix so I am a little less anxious about whether or not this new avalanches record is gonna sound good especially since now there have been other tracks coming out to sound somewhat decent what's gonna matter most is how they all come together into a full-length record but so far with this new string of tracks not really any complaints you know there aren't really blown me away or anything but they certainly sound Pleasant and feature the editing and the quality production that I have come to know from the avalanches I guess it's just kind of good to hear that they can come back after all these years and put out some quality stuff and finally I want to give a shout out to the new hot dad song r.i.p meme featuring none other than me master mr. Frank Jeff see hot dad you might have known as someone who I've referenced on the it came from band camp series on this channel maybe we'll link you that somewhere over here and also Frank Jeff see who we have shouted out on the channel numerous times before the hot dad was also not only been honor it came from band camp series but he's written the theme song for the series too so hot dad a very funny and creative producer and songwriter on the internet if you're into the music and the works of like Tim and Eric I think you'll find a lot of comedy and a lot of artistry in what he does and he just came out with this amazing new collaborative track with Frank Jeff see where they essentially sing about the relevance and the death of popular memes and I don't know if you're just looking for like kind of a comedy synth-pop a bit of an 80s pop and 80's rock track then I think you're gonna enjoy this one and yeah that's it that is the favorite track segment for this week guys those are the songs I've been enjoying those are the songs that I want to turn you guys onto so again they're all linked down there in the description along with our amazon associates link anything you're planning on buying on Hamazon today use our link if you live in the u.s. we kick back from it like I said and yeah that's it thanks for watching I hope you're having a good day and 
-R0ZrESv178,what's your favorite idea - being creative yeah ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new yg album still still breezy yg according to my notes is a California rapper he's now following up his breakout 2014 album my crazy life I liked it I thought it was a decent record but everything I liked about the album didn't seem to directly have anything to do with yg there were great features on this thing I was really impressed with a few of the hooks really like DJ mustards funky Basie synthetic production when I didn't enjoy the album it was really because of all the sketches that padded the record out though I like that the album was trying to be conceptual it was kind of a short LP to be incorporating so many little sketches and yg himself didn't really bring much to the table in terms of flow or memorable lines it's really only the potential of my crazy life that actually had me semi interested in listening to this new album that and I thought the teaser singles were okay tracks like Rio is hey and the song fdt which stands for fuck Donald Trump epidural tracks that are super simple super blunt a little goofy in their directness maybe a little overly simplified but I actually thought these tracks were pretty catchy fun and I could tell that yg was making a serious effort to try to address a bit of an elephant in the room when it comes to music that has social issues weaved into it I mean even you know king kendrick lamar's like dropping anti-donald trump songs a lot of rappers aren't in fact another thing I liked about these two tracks is that they kind of had this throwback flavor to the instrumentals in regards to the production on this thing a no DJ mustard to be seen unfortunately but the production on this thing is incredibly good anyway and pulls from that old-school G funk down which I think is sort of necessary in this era of music where revivalism in hip-hop is so popular I mean this decade so far has brought a myriad of different artists from the East Coast who are bringing back that boom-bap vibe but we haven't seen that same sort of rush of artists from the west coast kind of reliving that g-funk sound I think putting out a record with a sound like this is a smart move on YG's part especially in the wake of movies like straight out of Compton clearly people have nostalgia for this era in rap history and nobody is really feeding it even dr. Dre himself with his new Compton soundtrack he kept it really contemporary here and even though I applaud yg on this sometimes I wonder if he sort of lacks the self-awareness to do a record like this I mean he does have one bar on here where he says he's like the only rapper to make it out of the West without Dre for one not true but also even though dr. Dre isn't coming out directly and co-signing you you are kind of riding on a sound that he helped popularize regardless though yg does bring to the sound lots of memorable hooks topical song subjects some catchy flows some good features longer song lengths because this project certainly feels more meaty and structured than my crazy life he doesn't really go overboard on the skits either a lot of them are pretty short they don't affect the flow of the album the entire project kicks off with the very grimy smooth and eerie don't come to LA I'm way more impressed with YG's delivery on this one I think he's got way more conviction better breath control and he says every word as if he means it prior he would occasionally kind of mumble words together into a series of bars that really weren't all that coherent and whether you could tell what he was saying or not it didn't really demand your attention and I'm just loving that this song not only does a good job of setting the tone for the record but it's also very smooth and mean tribute to the area that he's from a DS feature on this track too is really over-the-top and insane we have the song who shot me which I thought was really cool not only because of the way that yg really brings the narrative out on this track and delves into these themes of betrayal and paranoia I love the line on here where he talks about his grandma's praying for him and it helped him because things could have been worse he's talking pictures on a shirt and the beat kind of reminds me of something that would have been produced by dr. dre on like one of Eminem's first couple of Records and yg even seems to pull from that influence a little bit too as he acts in character of the people who he seems to be rapping about on this album occasionally like on the song Jimmy got shot where he's rapping about all of his friends who now that he's kind of made it in hip-hop are sort of looking for a handout love the song twist my fingers obviously very strong gangsta rap vibes coming through on this track he talked about other rappers putting Compton on the map but he says he's putting bomp tin on the map he's representing Compton not only as someone who lives there but as somebody who is a blood from Compton he talks about other rappers pretending to be Bloods and in a couple bars here says that you know he's going to confront them in the club a bit but what I like about this song the most is not only the very sticky hook but also just the vibe of the instrumental and the song itself it kind of feels like some old-school Snoop Dogg liked the song who am i everything from the very bowels laced into the beat call back again to that 90s Cali G Funk era we have the song boom bomb and black t'v which is kind of a sequel to make it back bambo from his last record obviously being a blood he is not saying some of these c-words because you know that crip rivalry key is kind of taking the same song concept but actually fleshing it out into something that's a little meteor and more memorable it's nice that yg is revisiting these ideas and actually giving them the attention giving the song length and giving the song structure that they deserved all along and again on this track we see yg rapping about how he is bold on and elective he's not really breaking a sweat in the face of pressure not allowing himself to get sucked into unnecessary conflict probably the album's best of unintentional advice but when yg starts giving advice on the record maybe it's in a way that some people are really going to take to it like on the song she wished she was which some people will probably hear and just call the song blatantly sexist but I don't see the song so much as like women need to act this way and men need to act this way to me the track is more of a cautionary tale in a way where yg is warning that women not get into what he paints as a gangsta lifestyle but we have people like Jay 305 on the track unapologetically coming out and drawing gender lines on here talking about why women that sleep with a lot of guys or hoes if themes of sexism trigger you then you might just want to sit this one out we have the song fuck Donald Trump again at first I kind of thought the song was pandering when I heard it as a single but then as I gave it more lessons not only did the track just read to me as fun and catchy and not only in a sense agreeable I mean it's not an incredibly thought-provoking track but I think it puts a statement bluntly that didn't really need to be anything else other than blunt and it felt like the track was fueled by genuine feelings especially as Nipsey Hussle came in and delivered a pretty awesome verse about how it's not the USA without the Mexicans that Donald Trump himself is demonizing in his campaign speeches and it's in these last few moments on the record that yg actually gets consistently political we have the song blacks and browns which deals directly in relations between blacks and California and Latinos in California talking about racism and jealousy black on black crime and instead preaching a message of unity and we have the song police get away with murder which not only has one of the most killer instrumentals on the entire record really should have been earlier in the tracklisting because it is one of the better songs and the tracklist though still I guess it makes for a good finish not only does the song deal with police violence but in detail it goes into the way that yg and others may be protecting themselves against not only aggressors in their own neighborhood but aggressive police officers too saying that you know I sort of need to carry a gun on me for this reason he sort of gives these reasons as he's pleading with a judge it's just a solid set of politically charged tracks at the very end of this album the only thing I could fault this record with is that sometimes it's not very poetic you know but from this style of music I expect bluntness I expect the rapper to be to the point you know I can at least commend it though for being super catchy for being immediate for being topical and I can give it to yg for actually coming through with a set of flows and a delivery and bars that are actually worth paying attention to rather than just kind of simply tuning the rapper out and just listening to the beat which is something that all too often we're expected to do with a lot of new commercial rap releases today there are a handful of tracks on here that I think are decent I wouldn't take them out of the track listing or anything but they do pale in comparison to others whether it be because the beat is a little underwhelming or because there's not as strong a subject matter like the song I got a question a little Wayne's verse on that track was okay the song word is bond is alright and still Bray's II didn't really read to me as one of the best tracks and the track listing even though it is the title track here all that being said I was pleasantly surprised with this record not only because it's far better and I think superior to my crazy life but also because I love this freakin thing I think it's a great record definitely one of the more impressive and and memorable hip hop releases I've heard this year I'm gonna have to give this thing a decent two strong eight transition yeah those are my thoughts on this new yg record over here I hope all y'all are enjoying it and if you're not that's fine too let me know what you thought of this record did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yg still crazy forever

interview artists and content creators from across the internet and in this episode a very special conversation with Adam infamous youtuber and YouTube movie reviewer of the YouTube channel and the website your movie sucks dot org well that's me whoo yes maybe you hate it dudes real now you made it on to the needle drop YouTube channel yeah this is just one small step you're you're on your way to stepping stone in this episode we're going to be talking about not only the history of his channel and his review style but I think we'll be able to get into a larger conversation about reviews and reviewing in the modern age you know since we're both kind of like reviewer gasps we both kind of do that it's sort of the semi-regularly it's just it's just a hot day in industry yeah yeah YouTube reviewers yeah all right dude how you doing thanks for coming on I'm doing great um yeah I'm excited excited to talk and shoot the shit okay well let's start off with just how your channel began uh you know your history as a youtuber what exactly got you started making videos and and and you know was it movie reviews from from the start um so my first YouTube channel was created June 20th of 2006 so I'm coming up to about 10 years on YouTube I was like 15 years old and I just I was basically I discovered YouTube and I was using it as a place to upload my really crappy like junior high high school home video things that I made with my friends and then beyond that point I started having a I had a vlog channel and YouTube was just this small community of vloggers all interacting with each other and lie are we still talking like are we still talking like mid in late 2000s here we're talking about yeah we're talking about like 2007 or through nine yes I used to go on YouTube around that time a lot too and and you could probably confirm this you know though there's not like a lot of written history about this time in YouTube but um as you probably remember at this point the top 100 youtubers that community very small and there were a lot of people who are sort of at the top of that community because they would sort of just make all these Sauk accounts and just subscribe to themselves oh you know our YouTube this is oh yeah super easy because it was just such a small community mm-hmm yeah it was it's crazy too because I've gone back and looked up these channels that I knew were in the top 100 way way way back when and now I look at them and I'm like wait a minute they've only got like thirty-five thousand subscribers or something and it's just like this absolute mind fuck I don't know it's it it always seems so much bigger back then but I guess nobody was using the website I remember when YouTube used to like feature people - that was yes oh my god yes it's it's interesting that you talk about sort of you know coming from and being very familiar with that era of YouTube because I still kind of get a strong vibe of that from your videos now that you sort of appreciate that YouTube is this internet mean medium you know and there's kind of like a DIY characteristic to it that makes it so appealing where's you know that there are some people who I think of missed the point maybe we've missed the point because we don't have like five because we don't have like 10 million subscribers maybe we're missing the point we don't have the diamond play button but you know there's something not yet there are some people who've gotten on YouTube just to kind of make TV you know yeah where's like to me that's not the point of YouTube yeah I know exactly what you're talking about there was a Adam Adam Kovac mentioned this and his a fun house podcast that he appreciated my channel for being something that you couldn't just get from TV and I think I think it is important that that YouTube is not just a platform for new art but it's encouraging different kinds of art in a way you know like now it's now it's a lot of being a remix culture which I really like you know this sort of meta building upon other people's works and reviewing even other YouTube channels which is kind of funny well what's what's kind of funny about that is that I feel like the the the video formats that we're seeing right now on YouTube where people are essentially critiquing other videos and you know incorporating other people's videos into their own and sort of commenting on whatever is happening or being said that all in a way almost could have been avoided if YouTube had maintained cleaned up and made more efficient the whole response system because you probably remember yeah you know back in the day people used to be able to respond to other people's videos and you can see 10 or 15 other responses that mean no idea where things because I don't really nobody used it but I used it all the time okay I thought people used it yet exactly but we're I don't know really why they got rid of it you know I think it's it's not that people didn't use it I think it's that people kind of abused it because people would just respond to any video that was popular with a video that you had any relevance to their video you know reply girls psychic pebbles made a video on that yeah so this so there was like you know it was definitely abused you know but but the thing is I think that kind of created a good community of conversation outside of sort of the whatever the most mainstream or popular YouTube videos were you know but uh but yeah it's sort of funny that people kind of found a way reroute that by just kind of embracing this whole reaction format yeah yeah in a way it's I don't know I feel like it was it was kind of cool to have responses to videos underneath the other video see oh here's all these responses to this because now now it's like you can still do the same thing I guess by YouTube's search function but you're only gonna really find the most popular people that responded I felt like I felt like it was easier to kind of connect and find the smaller back in the day and now it's just like all these recommended for you channels that aren't really recommended for you but they're like super big and popular already I don't know yeah yeah it's all about algorithms now and kind of pushing videos to you that it's still federal right yeah exactly you know and pushing videos to you that they know are popular and then they know you know some high quality premium advertising is running on you know they're not trying to push obscure channels to you that are partnered which I don't even know if people aren't partnered anymore you know I've heard that you know there are people who very early on when signing out of YouTube you're kind of already signing on to be partnered yet I'm just in case some idea yeah you know just okay some video that you have like goes viral or something yeah because whenever that happens in a channel isn't partnered YouTube's their sweat and thinking that the revenue yeah we're losing the revenue yeah I don't even know if they're prop profitable yet who YouTube yeah they've got to be mmm last time I heard and I would like I would like to actually find a source for this before I'd start spouting bullshit accidentally but last time I heard Google was running YouTube at a loss and that would explain why there's no legitimate competitors at all because try to imagine exactly how much infrastructure and and memory and processing power etc etc you would need to run a web site like this like how many how many how many days worth of video is being uploaded every second on YouTube at this point right sure it's got to be massive well it's kind of interesting to see that I mean you have YouTube which you know you're telling me is running at a loss but you have people who are on the website who are successfully making videos that are very popular who are effectively millionaires oh yeah you know so I mean how it's it would it would be it would be the first instance I don't know if any company in history has ever run that way well I mean we're you know it's it's employ its employees kind of effectively it's freelance employees are making millions while the company itself is just like you know hemorrhaging money well that's them being run by Google and like I said I mean like I would still like to fact-check this just to make sure we're not that I'm not spouting any bullshit accidentally but you know let's also take account towards you to bread which is gonna be a lot more profitable for them yeah well you know it's just a better service anyway I was just also going to say before we get into the YouTube bread thing you know let's let's also not forget the fact that YouTube and Google collectively spend a whole lot of money on not only the promotion of the website but all sorts of weird tie-ins with celebrities and you know they just recently opened these YouTube spaces which are very large very expensive very huge venues where any youtuber where the channel of a certain size can go in and make use of all these different you know shooting rooms and sets and you know some like really high quality equipment you know it seems like they invest a whole lot of money into the site trying to push creators that they think are doing something but I I don't know if YouTube's really effectively kind of made someone popular on YouTube yet or if it's just kind of continually happened organically again and again and again so in the viral fashion well I mean they like we're talking about they did use to feature videos way back in the day before Google bought them by sure even back then you could artificially make something a trend that you know you're literally just putting it on the front page and then people will see it and be like ok I'm going to check out this person Channel and then even if they don't have decent content they'll still get a decent amount of views and subscribers however I mean it I feel like it has to happen organically because as much as you can push something into the public's eye they have to decide to keep coming back so like one of the very few original like top youtubers back in the day that is still in the top youtube channels today is Smosh and that's because they have their own you know they appeal to a certain demographic that just keeps getting renewed and renewed and they were they were able to capitalize on that like yes they did have a gigantic head start with a would they be famous today if they didn't if they weren't in the top 100 back in the day I don't know I don't know but they were able to able to take advantage of that for sure I haven't kept up on their content like what kind of content are they making now because what's kind of interesting is the heck content really yeah are they still kind of making the same content they made back in the day because they came up during a time when the most popular thing you could be doing on YouTube was fucking sketch-comedy everybody was doing sketchcam yeah if you weren't putting sketch-comedy up on your channel you are going to go anywhere but nowadays it's like if you're not doing reactions to things then you might as well just not be on youtube or if you're not like starting a gaming channel or something well right it what's what's unfortunate about it is well so Smosh is pretty much doing the same thing but they also have a gaming channel and I'm pretty sure they also have a reaction channel etc etc unfortunately just because of YouTube's algorithm itself in the way that advertising revenue works at all is it's really encouraged whether it wanted to or not it's encouraged people to make really fast short videos that you can pump out really really quickly you know it's it's it doesn't really favor the type of content that you would actually have to you know spend weeks filming or something like that you're not going to make much ad money off of one of those videos and so just by that alone by their system inadvertedly or unintentionally encouraging it that's why we're seeing a lot more of that content it's really it you can you can pump out reaction videos really really quickly you can pump out gaming channel videos really really quickly depending on you know whether or not there's any significant editing going into it or not you know so that's why that's why we're seeing all this content is because the the algorithm itself encourages it it's it's like an inevitability yeah and even if your videos even if you're making these types of videos and you know they're not like so viral that you're making mill millions of views you know let's just say several hundred thousand views you know your profit margin off those videos are going to be much larger because what you're investing into them isn't as much because you're not you know doing all this crazy production value or anything like that you know we're talking like webcams images on the screen and you know using content from somewhere else you sort of comment on and react to it you know which again is sort of another way that YouTube kind of I guess keeps at least some people doing things DIY because if the amount of money that people are getting returned to them for doing these videos was so great I don't know probably everybody would be building like a some kind of Hollywood I don't know well quality production out of there you know home or renting out some building or some ridiculous shit well it's actually cool about that though is the the people that do wind up doing these larger productions and actually you know making short films and doing it well those people might not make much ad revenue but they do get movie deals now a lot of a lot of new directors that are being signed on to big Hollywood projects are now just literally being plucked out of off of youtube yeah there's definitely way more crossover between traditional media and Internet media now and there used to be like five years ago you know has me well yeah they're otherwise traditional media will die yeah exactly not only is out of necessity but I think you know there's also a newfound respect there that used to not be there at all all right it was more like you know despise you know the despising people internet media um you know in a way I think that animosity is still kind of there I mean I don't know um though there yeah it's still there you know but uh like in the instance of I don't know how you feel about this film but um uh that Netflix film beasts of no nation how you know it didn't get an Oscar nod at all for like anything and it's easily better than you know a lot of the films like yeah a nod that it was probably because they did Netflix release yeah well yeah exactly I actually saw that at Toronto Film Fest I would I actually got to see it in in a theater it yeah I enjoyed it it probably should have gotten an Oscar or not it was it was very much an Oscar type movie and it's it's not like all the nominations that year were great but yeah III think that it was mostly just because of that whole Netflix thing hmm okay so you know you're doing these vlogs and these chin you know you're running your YouTube channel in the mid and late 2000s you know did this go anywhere for you at the time when exactly did you sort of make this transition over into movie reviews um well I mean so I I was doing vlogs and then I started up a music channel so actually I actually make music I haven't been promoting it that much on my channel recently because all of my recordings are like from 2010 and it doesn't really reflect my current style and abilities um but I I was making making music back then anyway I still have now I'm actually recording an album this summer I know I know you play guitar are you a multi-instrumentalist so you sort of recording and producing everything yourself um I play piano drums guitar and bass mostly there are some other instruments that I can kind of pick up and I'm mostly going to be outsourcing that for this album just because I would rather have the sound of somebody who's been playing violin their whole lives than somebody who learned it like in the past couple years um but anyway so I was doing music and I guess I guess all of my YouTube channels have just kind of more or less been a way that I could you know find out a way to express myself um and I've always had an interest in movies I was literally just like obsessed with movies there was a video store that was close to my home when I was growing up and they had a special deal 7 VHS movies for seven days for $7 and every single week I was eight seven bucks and grabbed seven different VHS movie and I would literally just watch like how do we plan it take them up on that deal me I don't know it just seems like there'd be so many VHS is out at any given time I don't know they it was only like older release right okay sure most people that show up at a video rental store only looking for new releases anyway and I guess I've heard real issues that are looking for like Gen IDs and stuff probably exactly probably why they had that that deal is like no one's renting these old 1980s or 90s movies so we might as well be making a bit of money right sure okay so I watched a crap ton of movies that after a while I just got like decent I guess at recommending them for different friends so like somebody would want something that's like super action-packed and and uncompromising and disturbing and I'd be like oh there's this movie bubble butt and then after a while I just kept hearing like oh you're really good at recommending movies just based on people's tastes not like oh this is a movie everybody should see or whatever but sure a stir on people's taste and then after a while I was like okay well I have a vlog channel so why don't I talk about movies on it and so on my vlog channel you can actually see this like really shitty uh just like face to the camera me like uh pacing around my basement um video that I did reviewing the movie sunshine and I was like I think it was like 19 18 or 19 years old when I did that and and I don't know I didn't illustrate my points very well it's kind of awkward talking and didn't really it wasn't really good it was just more me trying it out yeah I kind of just forgot about it after a while and then a red letter media Star Trek reviews blanket reviews started making their way on the internet and I watched those and I was like holy crap this is awesome and something clicked where I was just like oh so there's this format that I could be doing instead of you know talking to a camera where I can use film clips edit them together put music over top illustrate my points showing evidence you know go frame-by-frame if there's something wrong with it I have proof to say it and at the same time kind of make an entertaining youtube comedy video out of it before that point I didn't realize that like such an option existed I was just I'd never even occurred to me but after after I saw red letter media as planket reviews I was like holy crap why don't why don't I try something like this and the very first review of my channel is like literally just borderline ripoff of a planket style and I even one of the first things I say in the video is like it's definitely inspired by red letter media this is the format I'm using right now not gonna lie and then slowly but surely like every single video that I made after that point just got further and further away from their style and more more into my own and I was kind of just able to find my own thing with it and yeah that's where I am today that was in June 2010 when I created my film review channel so yeah I mean it's a I had a similar experience myself with just you know the process of deciding I wanted to review with this thing but then not knowing how to do it and then pretty much the whole channel you know your first year of doing anything isn't really just you reviewing it as much as you teaching yourself how to do exactly you gotta you gotta like find out what's you about it and it's difficult to just jump in and already be your own unique thing and already be an expert at what you do you got to have this like self teaching process you know um you know do you still feel like you're learning at this point oh I'm always you know I my one of my most recent reviews was like the unfriended review and yeah the amount of like weird edits that I put into it I'm like it's it really depends on the project there's always gonna be something different that I can do with each movie but I guess yeah I'm always learning and improving myself I've always kind of felt like the moment you stop learning or the moment you stop finding ways to improve then you've just kind of peaked you know I'm always going to try and find ways to do things better but to to questions based off of something that you had just said the first thing I want to talk about is is your unfriended review a particular thing about it you know not just your reviewing style where you just sort of really go into just excruciating detail about every single thing about the movie that that doesn't make sense which is funny because I remember um not too long ago a friend of mine you know I I had seen the straight out of Compton movie and which I thought was you know really terrible movie and I even bother with it it's it was terrible and I remember I had recorded this video of myself talking about it for like 20 minutes just going over every single fucking thing that I thought was terrible about it and then a friend of mine like you know I think I passed it to a buddy of mine to edit it or just look at it or something and he said dude you're talking about this for 20 minutes like what the fuck are you doing you know and I don't know it just kind of felt natural there were just so many horrible things about the movie that I felt like needed to be brought up and then when I was watching your own friend interview it was like holy shit like this is like the exact same thing that I would want to do if I was reviewing the shitty ass movie like I'd want to talk about every single little dumb thing that makes no sense about the movie because I don't know that's that's just kind of funny to me I know I like to leave no stone unturned there was there was a comment actually on that review that a lot of people were giving it's that the the date that they said the movie happened like the day of the week wasn't accurate for like oh this date on the 13th wasn't a Thursday yeah that's where I was like you know what I mean like I probably could have found that on the IMDB goofs page but I wouldn't really want to that that I think I think that what draws the line of what I would be willing to talk about is like how how much do you actually have to go out of your way to find out that there's a mistake well I think it's funny just that it's it's not really that you've missed that one mistake but it's like you know with your videos you've kind of fostered this culture amongst the community of people that watch your videos and they're people that look out for those sort of things you know and in a way I think your your reviews kind of speak to that in a way that other reviews don't where that probably you know in it in a sensible way you know a lot of other reviewers try to keep it general because you just kind of automatically assume people don't want to watch a review that's almost as long as the movie but you're unfriended review you know and I've watched all three parts you know very eagerly you know each part is like 20 minutes each yeah and it's just kind of funny you know to think about that you know also in light of that you know I have reviews that are like almost 20 minutes long with albums um you you know you're talking about this incredibly long-form content in an age of Internet media where it seems like the the narrative that people kind of harp on over and over and over is oh it's got to be short it's got to be viral it's got to be like you know super to the point where else people are too stupid to watch it all the way through but it seems like you know you're not having that problem well I mean that's that's also what goes hand-in-hand with me wanting to make a kind of like comedic edited version of it is I I feel like I feel like as much as part of the the product of what I'm selling is the points that I'm making about them part of it is also the presentation and so the the editing that I put into it you know there's there's a point to making everything like really it's almost like I'm jump cutting with the audio if that makes sense like I'm churning out all the all the fat and all the pauses I like to have music end on cues before punchlines and almost kind of like a setting up expectations kind of kind of a subconscious sort of thing wait I don't know I feel like I feel like there's um there's an art in of itself of how to present something and I feel like that helps make it more entertaining for people whereas like if I were if I literally just list it off each point that I had to make about an unfriended and I just said it without bringing bringing that kind of like editing and jokes to it then I'm not sure I would I'm not sure I would have subscribers I feel like I feel like part of what I'm offering is like a comedic funny video in a way I don't know it's a I do get a lot a decent amount of comments of people who say that even though they disagree with me on something they found the video entertaining and that's why they keep wanting to watch so yeah I mean at least at least there's that well yeah I mean there's most definitely an element of comedy to your videos especially in that unfriended video you know where essentially you have very effectively worked in all these memes about the film where you know that they're going to be reacting to this things going on on skype when all of a sudden it's a It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia clip or whatever yeah or you know some video clip from somewhere else you know or in the case of like your cool cat review where you don't really need to throw in a meme or remix all that often because the film just kind of makes fun of itself yeah yeah are there it's it yeah it really just depends on the movie of what I'm able to add to it my friend it was just so exploitable because of the format I'm like well I can sneak in something here and here and here and here that that won't that review wound up taking me so much longer to edit anything else because they were just way too many points where I couldn't tell myself that I didn't want to add it in if I think of something and I'm just like oh this would be funny I'm never gonna say like oh no I shouldn't spend a few more days editing on it I'm gonna go yeah this is gonna be funny yeah I mean there's just kind of a I don't know a bit of a snarky comedic you know let's make fun of this movie because so stupid kind of tone to it that I think his was missing for a little while after like Mystery Science Theater 3000 disappeared off the TV and then you can only get it on DVD and now it seems like they're a bunch of YouTube channels including yourself and like I hate everything or like cinemasins for example that you know have kind of brought that back in a way where you guys with a very fine-tooth comb go through a movie and just like pick out the worst elements of it and not only in a comedic way because calm is certainly an element of it but I feel like with your review specifically another thing that kind of makes them entertaining and gives them a bit of a unique flavor and bite to them is just kind of the harshness that you come through with in your reviews yeah a lot of a lot of people are convinced that I literally don't like anything yeah and is that something that you know you feel like you genuinely feel as you're reacting to the world or or do you feel like you know you kind of put yourself into like the heel role when you not review this movie like oh I'm gonna be the bad guy or something I don't fabricate my opinions yeah there there are there are things there's a reason why when I created my film review channel it's called your movie sucks yes because I was going to like I already knew before I started that I was going to be focusing on a lot of negative and I mean since creating my channel I've actually moved on to a lot of reviews of films that I have very positive things to say about it so like Synecdoche New York is one of my longest series and it's literally just me trying to dissect the film but not saying really anything bad about it just like praising and trying to interpret it yeah or my top 10 of the Year videos but anyway and you do your best of lists yeah as well so you do tell people things that you do enjoy exactly so my I always knew just based on you know being being aware of films and people's public perceptions to them the first movie that I ever reviewed was for precious which was that Oscar Oscar bait that Oscar bait movie that was just kind of like it was so sloppy and poorly put together and like not a lot of it made sense but everybody was praising it and it was almost like this big like oh we have to we have to say we like this movie just so we can get ourselves brownie point it was that not based off that book push yeah belief yeah okay all right yeah and which I remember reading in college in like a lit course and I remember being really you know moved by the book but you know she watched the movie I did not see the movie but I was about to ask you sir what made the movie you know fall short for you well so uh it's my understanding that in the book there are several different stories involving different characters right sure yeah um in the film they decided to have literally every single one of those things from those characters happen to the exact same character it was very it was a crush the precious character yeah this like unreasonable unrealistic sequence of events that it would was just like you couldn't believe that all of this happened to one person there were a lot of simple really simple editing mistakes that could have been avoided and again it's not the worst movie ever it was just it was just like did not deserve the praise that it got it was it was very very sloppy in its presentation but anyway um knowing knowing that much that what I knew I was going to say about movies in general was probably going to go against the grain that's why I created my channel name the way that I did and uh when I was first starting out the way that I got a bit of attention was I didn't even I I actually titled my videos differently so I wouldn't I wouldn't say YMS precious I said precious sucks in big capital letters I was just like again not fabricating my opinions if I was that I probably wouldn't have a you know decent amount of people following me it would probably just think I'm a troll which I guess some people do but it was it was just a way of like being self-aware enough about the contrast in my own opinions to everybody else is that I'm like well I'm just gonna capitalize off of it I'm going to say okay I know that not many people would agree with me on this but I'm going to get attention from people who would probably be angry at my opinion and then hopefully after the video is over I've made a few decent points and they've gotten less angry and now or subscribed to my channel hopefully you know it I mean it worked out for the most part I mean I I feel like personally harshness is kind of a necessary evil because if you just like everything I feel like nobody takes you seriously you know if if everything's great if everything's amazing there's not really any investment there I think for the UH for the viewer you know I think once you've kind of gone against what the viewer thinks or you've gone against the the opinion that the viewer has before they probably clicked on the video um you've kind of challenged them and you've made them either you know pub potentially agree with you by the end of the video or maybe it made them think harder about why it is they liked the movie it's all it's also a little bit about like standards and what you're willing to put up with too and I'm not saying that like people that like more things than I do are wrong but there's always a there's always a certain threshold and it's not really consistent with everybody but there there's plenty of people that can watch my videos and if I'm giving all these different ratings out of ten they can watch my video and leave a comment and be like well Adam rated it a six out of ten which means that I'll probably love it and think that it's an 8 out of 10 and some people legitimately just watch through my content and just do their own math to like what they think their own rating would be from my rating I get so many comments I get so many tweets people are like dude he gave it a 6 out of 10 that means it's got to be amazing that means I that means I'll love it that's funny oh yeah and then and then if if you're not like just constantly praising everything - if you if you say like okay there are very very few movies or albums or whatever in a year that I'm able to classify as perfect 10 out of 10 then when you do it then they're like holy shit write it I meet something and so when you give that rating to something that actually truly legitimately deserves it then you're doing a great service to the movie itself and everybody who would want to see it if they're like holy shit well this now I have to check it out because now they know that you're actually being serious and you're not just bullshitting totally you can't just like hand out tens like candy exactly examining so uh you know sort of what what makes a 10 out of 10 for you you know I know that when I label something a 10 out of 10 it's just purely based off of personal preference and and I guess what I think in my head is that this album this piece of art has kind of reached what I feel to be this peak threshold of enjoy ability you know like I can't see myself enjoying this anymore I can't see myself enjoying music any more than I'm enjoying what I'm listening to right now well so to me there has to be it's a it's definitely a combination of my own personal enjoyment and as much of an objective classification that I can give it while still being trapped inside a human brain so I it a movie would default at like a 5 if we're if we're if we watch the 10 hour-long paint drying on a wall film technically flawless it's just a single shot of paint drying on a wall for 10 hours no mistakes but it didn't really achieve anything because you just let the camera roll that would be a fun I have I'd have to give that a zero because I would hate it too much oh yeah but that's what I'm trying to bring in objectivity because if if the director even if I personally hate it you can loathe the experience but what if the director said you were supposed to hate it what if the what if the directors entire intent was for you to hate the movie what it like there's a movie called Jeanne Dielman I pronounced that horribly wrong the entire title is Jean Gelman 23 Kaidu Khmers 1080 Bruce L it's a French movie directed by Chantal Akerman I think her name is and she was a very obscure kind of like artistic director that a lot of her short films are taught and like film class and stuff but anyway it's literally a three and a half hour long film of a woman cleaning her house and every once in a while somebody comes over and it's implied that she's also hooking on the side and it goes on for forever and I don't like I don't really want to spoil the ending but um to me that movie it's a very clearly defined uh intent of trying to make the viewer feel trapped in the same world that she is because the character herself she's like she's widowed her husband died that information is revealed it at the beginning and and like it's it's trying to bring a different context under something that could just be like okay if you were watching a woman peeling potatoes and making this dish in any other movie you wouldn't think anything of it but because we're watching this over this extended period of time and you truly feel like you want to die watching it then you're able to get into our mindset now I don't enjoy that movie but I'm not gonna say it's a bad movie because like the directors intent should should play some sort of a factor in it if the entire intent of the movie was to make you feel like shit then I don't feel like I could say that they did a bad job so to me to me the directors intent does play a lot of it I would never include that kind of movie on my like like top ten of the year I might include it as like a guilty pleasure like I don't wanna I don't really want to be putting these really almost borderline pretentious art films on too high of a pedestal like some people do because there are literally just people that only watch those kind of movies and look down on other people I think I think that that's kind of stupid yeah but to me my favorite directors and my favorite films are are not just something that could be considered flawless and perfect but there's kind of like a scale of what did they achieve so if you're going to look if you're going to judge a movie and say that flawlessness is an absence of mistakes so a mistake being something that the director did not intend watching paint dry on the wall you could easily achieve a flawless a film by just leaving your camera rolling and paints drawing on a wall nothing no no effort was made no achievement was made no mistakes were made but no achievements now if you're going to look at you know like that sequence in children of men that like 20 minute long single-shot shootout that's a gigantic achievement like to have all the actors coordinated in such a way all the special effects and everything coordinated without any cuts tank taking place for however many minutes this extremely coordinated timed spectacle where if somebody screws up you have to literally do the whole shot over again that's an achievement on on a technical level another thing that I would call it achievement is if you're able to not just invoke an emotion because that's very subjective somebody can cry about something I thought was stupid somebody can find something funny that I thought was not funny right but if somebody's able to have a deeper meaning to a film to be able to create something where I watch it once and I got something out of it it was a good movie from whatever possible reasons I could give but then the second time you watch it you realize there's more to it it doesn't have to be like hidden secret plots but there could be things where it's like oh now that I have the full context of everything in the movie I can see how this makes sense I can see how this makes sense it doesn't have to not make sense beforehand but you could learn more about it you could be like oh so this fits in thematically every everything every extra effort that gets put into a movie sort of brings it higher up to scale for me so my favorite my all-time favorite movies are are generally along the lines of having some sort of combination of perfection and flawlessness with like nothing that the director didn't intend and then beyond that like perfect acting perfect cinematography and not just that but like purposeful cinematography like trying to think of an example of like really purposeful cinematography there's like the film mommy directed by exuviae Dolan and the entire movie is like shot in a one by one aspect ratio and it's very it's very clearly just trying to make you feel like trapped in this like almost coalesced robic emotional environment that the characters are in and things about it changed during the movie depending on what type of parts of their life they're in and the cinematography is used in a very clever way there's a shot of like a microwave and because it's a one by one aspect ratio and because parts of the screen are cut off the microwave doesn't say hello it says he'll very very clever cool things like that that all just fit in somatically I just I I just rambled for so long but you know there's a there has to be some level of achievement for it to get anything higher than a 5 and if something is it cheap so much and been relatively flawless there are some movies that I'd give 10 out of 10 that have minor flaws in them but the question is do the achievements outweigh the flaws enough for it to be that high of a rating sure I agree that something doesn't necessarily need to be flawless in order for me to feel it's a 10 or feel it's an amazing record you know something doesn't necessarily need to and and I agree totally with what you're saying about achievement as well however I don't know if intent sort of ranks as high to me you know especially when it comes to negative reviews you know that and maybe this isn't something as much that I don't know maybe intent would be more important if I were doing movie reviews I'm not totally sure but you know Arsenal is the medium to because I don't see the same way you know because there's certainly a lot of moments where you know the argument is sort of thrown at that oh well this thing that you're critiquing here sounds a certain way because they wanted it to sound that way and you know in my own head my just responsible well I mean that's it just still sounds awful to me you know like even if that was their intention you know at that point that sort of to me comes down to a matter of taste because you know okay they intentionally made this sound you know but maybe they intentionally made that sound because they're not aware of what a better sound would be or you know that was the vocal performance they intentionally delivered because maybe they're not really that great of a vocalist so they're not they're not capable of delivering a better vocal performance you know so uh you know in intent can only really matter to a point you know I guess it matters to me if we're talking about one of these art projects much like these movies that you're talking about let's talk about an artist like Murs Val for example you know annoys artists whose music you don't enjoy by any stretch of the imagination in the way that you would enjoy a beach day so yeah you know well even even worse than that you know we're talking about like harsh ear piercing like white noise and feedback and you know pretty much every unpleasant sound that you could imagine all happening at once in a seamless drone for a massive amount of time and you know it's not something that you're supposed to enjoy in the same way that you would a Beatles track and you know I could I could appreciate that type of stuff for the fact that he's intentionally trying to create something that is disturbing or stomach-churning or just kind of stimulate your mind in a way different than a normal you know verse chorus verse song would I mean Death Grips does that in a sense oh yeah absolutely you know and we can get into that later as we get more into the the music conversation we could talk about a little bit of death Clips you know but they but they certainly do that too you know so when they for example you know make music that's super visceral and that was their intent to make that music you know I guess I can appreciate that and I and I like that you know but also there's some artists that I don't know make music that to me it might be a little funny and I don't think they intended it to be funny I'll still enjoy it anyway and I'll still like maybe potentially give it a positive review but but it's purely from my standpoint you know and and usually when I do that I will pretty explicitly you know say like listen you you may not like this or you may think this is really goofy or dumb or stupid and I totally appreciate that and understand that but I keep listening to this because I think it's hilarious and I'm just getting you know my own little weird slice of enjoyment out of it that the artist might not have intended for me to have but I'm having it anyway you know I think I think that movies and music are kind of going for four different things in it since I'm not sure I would write them in the same way so I kind of agree with you I mean like I don't I don't really give numerical ratings to albums every once in a while I'll be like oh I'm enjoying this album listen to it but I don't really like I I don't have enough time in my day to be seeking out every single elbow it's fine I don't get any miracle ratings to movies you know I'm just like oh that was good oh that's so good I feel like we're part of the intent conversation comes in with movies specifically is that there's a lot of the vast majority of films are trying to tell a story right the vast majority of songs are trying to tell a feeling right and so I feel like I feel like there's a bit more creative liberty or artistic license and what you can do in a song without having anyone really question whether or not it's intentional when it went when it comes to music I don't think it's as relevant at all whether or not some things until intentional but with films when you can look at something as simple as like why didn't the character do this or this didn't exist in this time period or that was clearly not supposed to show up in the frame it's it's a lot it would be a lot more difficult to pick out specific goofy goof type things in in songs than it would be to do for a film so I feel like I feel like the directors intent matters a lot to me even though it doesn't override you know my overall experience of it it matters to me in a sense because if I'm critiquing the artwork itself if I'm critiquing the artist and the form really to me filmmaking is the craft of being able to have control over what's in your frame and control over what's in the final product and even script writing control over what happens at what time in the story and how it's delivered and what makes sense and what doesn't make sense like that's the entire the entire craft to me is like being able to perfect that and most people who really suck at movies or suck at directing or suck at writing those things tend to be a lot more noticeable and seep through than the people who are truly truly talented and perfectionist at it next question I know that you have this massive passion for films you know a passion that isn't going to be wiped away by just watching a bunch of shitty movies that you hate however I imagine that you probably would get sick of movies if watching movies that you hate were the only movies you were watching um you know how exactly do you work uh movies that you actually enjoy into you know your your day your week your month you know and I'm and I'm sure you're trying to constantly expose yourself to to new movies as well that you enjoy you know where do you consistently find yourself finding new films that you really like well so when it comes to me and I guess my overall schedule and what I do with my time even even when it comes down to like gaming for my gaming channel because I'm now doing all of these I'm involving all the things that I love in what is now my job now it's like I'm prioritizing what I do with my time that I would be watching movies or playing games based on what is going to wind up showing up in a YouTube video right sure so and so um my my yearly best of the Year lists they have really helped me to kind of double down and and commit to spending more of my time watching and discovering new things that I haven't seen before or movies that I know we're supposed to be a decent that have good reviews from can and and all that so that's that's helped a lot but I've kind of fallen into this trap where I'm spending so much time working on everything that's current not just with my yearly list but with other other movies coming out that I've really I really really need to check out some older films that that most people would consider to be like absolutely it's set essential but I just like I have not given myself the time to do that yet because I spend so much time on everything else I guess I guess when it comes to watching enjoyable movies there's always the opportunities of you know wanting to get some friends together and you know show them a movie usually if I if there's any kind of a like I guess gathering or date or something if let's say it's like close to Halloween I'll probably have like a horror movie night at my place and invite some friends over usually pretty much everything I do just for Falls around anything that's related to like my YouTube presence but yeah I don't really know where I was going with this I kind of just ran it I well that's that's fine I'm trying to you know tease like more information out of you about this um you know you just mentioned can um is the Film Festival scene and circuit important to you issues is that relevant to you as the indie film circuit important to you if air if you didn't follow these things closely do you feel like you know your average blockbusters kids movies you know huge hyped big movie studio films that are constantly being pumped out if that's all you really had to review and talk about do you just feel like you would hate movies well there's also a oh man that I might just like them more if I didn't know there was something better but yeah absolutely you know I mean is it you know about balance there um yeah in a way so I mean coming up to like I guess the September and October months is when the there are two major Canadian film festivals going on that I frequent one of them being in the city that I live in Vancouver so of course I'm gonna go to that one the other one being Toronto Film Festival which I went last year I had a fucking blast I had the time of my life there and now I feel like I should probably go again this year but yeah that's it's it's very very important to me because so many of these so many of the films that I love wind up premiering at those kind of places well actually most of them wind up not most of them but a decent amount of them wind up premiering it can and then what gets popular from can winds up getting a bit of buzz for those film festivals but I still get to see the movies like in some cases a year before they're actually released which sounds ridiculous but otherwise I'd just be waiting and it's it's good too especially for my channel it's good to be able to check these movies out ahead of time as long as you kind of know which movies you're really looking for we're looking looking to to discover I guess it's good to check them out ahead of time so I can get a video out because a lot of my subscribers are I guess like European or overseas or have some kind of I guess preference for movies that a lot of other channels don't talk about there aren't too many I can't think of another like film review YouTube channel that's popular that really likes going to film festivals honestly I'm trying to yeah whenever I see a lot of these YouTube movie review channels a lot of them just focus on whatever the big popular movies in the theaters yeah happen to be I feel like that's part of why I have any watches at all is because like nobody else is talking about these movies it's really unfortunate cuz it's like I just feel like if they were to see them they would love them but you just have to know how to find them yeah I mean it's it's just a niche thing you know I know some of the some of the bands that I review every week are super obscure and just you know maybe several thousand fans rule and Coker yes exactly you know and and I think those are interesting artists and you know their music is is worth discussing and some of them have some pretty healthy fan bases you know I mean I you know I'm not gonna say kink rule is like you know so obscure that yeah and not making yeah it was actually decently popular yeah yeah you know he's he's semi popular but you know your average person walking down the street doesn't know who the hell he is you know um so hopefully you know when I review some of his music when I do happen to like it you know I can get a few more people to check it out that's what I've always valued the most about this is like being able to introduce people the things that they love I feel like she like that in itself is a very important service because you know don't know how to find these things yeah absolutely you know I feel like that's an important part of the process you know I mean I'm happy to review the new you know Kanye record the new Beyonce record especially when I end up liking it you know yeah um because as a reviewer as a critic you want to take part in the larger conversations that people are having in the world of art that you're kind of specializing in you know you don't just want to be out of these conversations you don't want to be out of the loop of these discussions but you know I think it's also kind of important if you do have a platform and you do have people following you to try to do at least a little curation you know which is why I think it's essential that if I like the new Gore guts EP that that's got to get reviewed you know I mean if I didn't if I didn't feel this way I probably would have never reviewed Death Grips in the first place you know exactly um because at the time that I thought that their debut mixtape was awesome you know they didn't have that much attention but then I was just like well you know this is like really cool this is really special you know they're not you know this mainstream music act but it's kind of guided it it's it's got to get discussed mm-hmm no they've blown up yeah and and I think they do stuff like that not only do you help you know you to end up being a one of the forces behind the success of an artist but also you know you help kind of foster this world where you're hearing more of the kind of art that you actually want to hear but also with your audience I think you kind of create a stronger bond because you know you've you've exposed them to something that they wouldn't have heard before and they really value that thing and it's really important to them so now they're coming back yeah exactly it's always nice to be able to introduce people the things that like literally nobody else is talking about there's some things where like so many movies where I review them and they're great and they seem like everything that people would love but it's just the unfortunate reality of like if you don't have X amount million dollars of an advertising budget than you know what are you gonna do it's it's like so many movies that I know like if Fox Searchlight just just actually spent money on trailers for these movies that they would actually do so much better Fox Searchlight is notorious for just for Kurt having contracts with independent films and then just not even advertising them just putting them in like a couple theaters and then being like well it wasn't gonna make money anyway what is it this is an indie movie and then just not profiting off of them in the way that they should it's only when when their movie gets several Oscar nominations that all of a sudden they're like oh yeah maybe we should put this in a few more theaters really notice they're they're they're some record labels that I could probably list out but I won't that they're pretty much are guilty of the very same thing yeah you know they sign all these bands that I don't know what they thought was going to happen um but uh like they would just get popular on their own or something but then they don't you know help them do a music video they don't really promote their record they don't make them a priority and I just kind of wonder why you know what I usually have a sellable product yeah it's like what's much the profitability in putting this thing out and just not trying to do everything you can to promote it mmm but what I've been a lot of people that make those kind of visions aren't really knowledgeable about the art itself and are more interested in running a business hmm a one more question before I think we get into some of the music stuff about your gaming channel and sort of the games that you play and just get kind of get a quick opinion about this um you know I've been playing games video games since I was a kid so you know I guess I probably have a certain bias toward my games being a particular type of way and not that there aren't games out today that I enjoy but a recent trend that I see in a lot of video games you know especially on platforms like PlayStation and Xbox one is that it seems like they're just more and more video games coming out that they just seem more like playable movies than they are actually games at least in what I would consider to be a game and I know that you're familiar with them and you've probably played a few of them as well um you know do you have a particular opinion about these types of uh video games you know do you feel like it kind of defeats the point of playing a video game or is this kind of an exciting new way of expressing in the video game medium a little I don't know if I can give a really like straightforward answer on this I might just ramble a bit more grandma you're you're totally loud um Naughty Dog has been pretty great at making um kind of like really cinematic games and yeah and yes some of their criticisms is that I mean a decent amount of their games are taken up by cutscenes I don't really mind that because I mean you could you can consider the cutscenes as like a reward for the gameplay or you could consider like it's just the two different art forms colliding into one but I thought I liked something like The Last of Us with especially the soundtrack by Gustavo it's ten to whatever that that was that was one of the best examples I could think of like a video game being pushing more towards cinema and doing it pretty successfully it's not perfect there's like stupid AI and glitches bla bla bla but it did such a great job in that opening scene especially of of setting up the universe and you know setting up the characters showing some kind of consequence and threat you know I just thought it was like one of the best openings to a video game ever but then there's also people like david cage of Quantic Dream who you can kind of commend him for trying to take the medium to new places in a way but you can tell that he's like he kind of doesn't know what he's doing at the same time so games that he's made being Indigo Prophecy heavy rain and what's that one with Ellen Page beyond two souls yeah heavy heavy rain was um super narrative mhm and it what's kind of funny is uh my wife seems to be super into those games and not only if she gets a chance that she played them but um uh there are a lot of Let's Plays for these games online and she just watches them as if she's watching a movie or something okay and whoever's you know playing them uh yeah like I just said it's just as if you're watching somebody else watch a movie or sort of play through this movie but yeah some of these games as you were just saying super narrative heavy and it I don't know it just kind of seems to to take away from I don't know the point of a game in a way although for some people you know they would make that same argument of like RPGs where you're essentially taking turns fighting characters you know then just kind of like you know but just very deep into the action of the movement of the game the one thing that I might disagree with you on would be that that you were kind of implying that it's now there's now more of like a focus on those or that the industry is kind of shifting in that direction and where I will say like so I I mean it's kind of gotten there's kind of been a market for it ever since I guess like heavy rain or maybe even the console generation previous to that it's it started out like there's there's a market for it for sure and there are people that will buy these and there's there's you know space in the industry for these things to exist but I don't don't really think that we're shifting towards that as though it's like a logical progression of where games are going I'm really excited for a type of like really narrative cinematic video game to exist in in like virtual reality with the HTC vive or something like that that'll be really cool is kind of like an experimental way to view the medium but with video games right now we're at a really amazing point I think like there's ways that the industry has gotten so much worse and there's ways that the industry has gotten so much better we're literally living in like both the best and worst generation for video games at the same time really for every cut for every type of art form at the moment well so with video games in particular like I I personally think that this is like the absolute worst console generation it's like less features for for no reason you know like oh wow your ps4 can't do as many things as the ps3 can do etc etc those have a crappy overpriced dlc from yeah new video game really like unethical business practices and like shipping your game before it's even finished and just like oh we'll release a patch I'm still pissed off at 343 for the halo Master Chief collection I want I want the game I paid for assholes anyway uh-huh but but yeah I see what you're saying you know the these cinematic games I don't see them as the be-all end-all I don't see them as like something that's going to be taking over I see them as more of just kind of a new interesting trend you know they're not necessarily a threat to you know there's always going to be sports games people are always going to want their first-person shooters you know those are certainly not going anywhere there there are people who are chomping at the bit for whenever the next grand theft auto is going to come out you know people who like to play mobile games you know very much lay the whole steam engine has essentially turned online gaming and computer games into just the wild wild west you know so there's a lot of unpredictability you know for for something as you know uh as narrative as these you know more cinematic games just like kind of come in and dominate and just sort of dictate the kind of games that everybody is making now I think I think the best part about this generation of video games because I did I did say a lot about like the worst parts of it but the best part about this generation right now is that anybody can make a game and that's the perfect environment for you know new ideas and creativity is is not having restrictions behind who can create what art you know it's it we have Toby Fox who made undertale literally just pretty much just by himself if you haven't played that I would highly recommend it I know people have probably overhyped it a bit but it's one of the things that particularly stands out about it is the soundtrack so I think that you would get some enjoyment out of it we've got Jonathan Blow who made the witness which is like one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life very different and not like it's not a story game at all it's like a puzzle game but it's so so like deep and in thought-provoking and very very intelligently designed that I literally just put like like so many hours into it at least 50 hours into that game it's insane but yeah I appreciate that we're living in a point where people who have ideas no longer are behind this wall of people that they're not trapped behind publishers anymore now you can just basically release your game to the internet you can release your music to the internet and in some ways release your movie or your video entertainment to the Internet and people are able to decide for themselves what they like and artists gotten better because of it I think I think we've gotten a much healthier variety of art forms and smaller things that 10 20 30 years ago would have no chance of even existing in a mainstream market are now able to compete and able to be called the best game of the year we have something like Minecraft which is like the best selling game of all time yes like that would give you know ten years before it got released it wouldn't be able to really exist you know you'd have you would have to have a sort of publisher doing that for you no that's that that game could have only existed now for sure exactly it I think that we're in a great point for for creativity and just overall variety in our art forms I'm looking forward to what the future holds and now especially with all these new generations being raised with the internet seeing what people come up with as everybody gets older - all right um as far as the whole music thing mm um we know your we know you're in the Death Grips a little bit yeah not only do you just enjoy their music but you've managed to beautifully work them into your own videos so you know appreciate that as a desert rips fan for sure but um uh you know what other music do you enjoy and what kind of you know what genre would you sort of place your own music into you know the music not only that you created in the past but the music that you're sort of in the midst of composing right now that you're going to be releasing down the road um so I don't feel like I restrict myself to one particular genre so in my videos I used like a decent amount of like either hip-hop or classical or like almost like 60s infomercial or TV dinner kind of vibe music and I enjoy that stuff I enjoy all that stuff um but the the the band that has been my favorite band for a long time now is bright eyes and they've got such a versatility of what point in their career you could pick an album from and it sounds completely different you know like even even there I'm wide awake it's morning in digital ash and additional earn got released like what a week apart from each other or something and they sound completely different literally one they just do their Lee fo ones like Liggett it's all in the same vein I guess but no it's true you know it's it's very much in that Conor Oberst vibe um I have to say though I hated digital ash could law I could I could not get into it oh no it to me it was like uh you know I I appreciate Connor for trying to keep up with the times that record you know and not to say that the indie folk thing was irrelevant at that time it definitely wasn't but it was like just before that record had come out and he wasn't the only one who attempted this you know if the Postal Service had dropped and then that sort of created this ripple within the indie scene which was usually you know electric guitars acoustic guitars but this was like you know synth pop that like you know the emo and the indie kids could listen to because it's like cute little quirky sad little songs and then that sort of you know turn everybody else to like consider hey maybe I should try making some electronic music you know and you know there were so many records and that was one of them probably one of the better ones but that was one of them that everybody was like going this electronic route because everybody was sort of jumping ship in a way just to kind of change up their sound and sort of you know it's like experimentation absolutely you know and and you know you definitely know that all these people were like listening to each other so closely because many of them shared in a similar audience you know feel the same way about so that people's keep the people's key liked a little bit more you know I felt like it was a more like a mature and refined way of doing the same thing it's very similar in sound I guess but I feel like they did it better I feel like it was produced better and it was less experimentation and more just going back to it but doing it better in a way but also you know speaking of going back what did you think of a connor going back to days of piracy dose with that newest record bill haven't even checked that out over time I like to listen to list for quite a while still haven't even checked it out I mean some of his lyrics are pretty biting on the record you know I definitely give it to him you know he has a pretty politically charged and yeah and very very thoughtful lyrics on the record I mean I think the the instrumentals that were kind of one-dimensional like if you know you're not going to find the instrumental diversity on that record that you know it on a Bright Eyes record for sure I am part of the reason why bright eyes is my favorite artist is because of the Lear music has always more or less been sort of therapeutic for me and that's also why I write it is is a lot of the pretty much every every single song on this album that I'm working on is is literally just me confronting a different problem or issue that I've had in my life and it's I'm literally so I I did say earlier how I haven't been promoting my music as much because because everything that I've recorded has been so old that it doesn't really reflect what I would put out today or it doesn't really reflect the production quality that I could put into it today what I'm actually doing with this new album is I'm taking songs that I've written from the past ten years so the the album starts out with a song that I literally wrote like ten years ago and it'll end with a song that I've written this year and it'll it'll kind of have like this logical almost kind of a progression of not just like the story of my life but how I've changed and how I deliver things differently or how my music has changed or how my writing has changed and lyricism etc etc and I feel like I feel like with music playing of such a close kind of emotional part of my life I feel like Bright Eyes is just the closest that I've been able to come to towards a sort of like therapeutic understanding in a way like there's so many there's so many things that he talks about in his albums that I feel like to almost even understand what he's talking about you almost kind of have to experience these things for yourself he's been very thoughtful and I guess my lyrics aren't don't progress to be like as cryptic as he winds up becoming in his later albums like now he's all about spiritualism and stuff but I mean I I feel like I feel like he's he's the closest to me and then in terms of actual musical sound I would say that there's like a bit of Regina Spektor in my album maybe a little depending on which album of hers I don't know it's tough to pinpoint I think we're kind of gonna get to like what what music I would define myself as but I even though it does sound sound a bit like bright eyes it's not the same at all in the same way you know no I know you're just kind of throwing your influences out there yeah and everybody's got to start somewhere you know it's not like the people who are influencing you aren't without their influences exactly it's like it's like alternative piano based rock and I try to the the piano is what I use as the main instrument for most of my songs and whereas a lot of bands might have piano is kind of like a backing instrument that's not really doing that much I'm I in my songs I'm like I guess just seriously rocking out on it or trying to do something that's like complex or or like fast-paced but yeah I mean we all it's not like it's not like that type of thing hasn't happened before you know it's like it's it's it's not like you know that that idea is so alien dazed it's almost like Midway state uh uh I guess in terms of tone but I feel like it's different at the same time no I'm trying I'm trying to think of a you know other artist for example you know like man man had the piano pretty prominently in their music Dresden Dolls for example who I know toured with Regina Spektor right um for a while I'm trying to think of who else like mates of State wolf parade as well you know Spencer Krug in general who's like a pretty notable indie musician who uh the piano is really kind of his axe um I don't know I'm just throwing stuff out there Tom Waits although he's not really a rock musician yeah but uh you know very very well known for his piano playing but uh but you know whatever so so moving away from a from that but you know outside of kind of this piano rock world singer-songwriter world you know you're talking some of this others that you listen to I'm trying to remember the composer's name if if I'm correct I've heard you know like if you laurie johnson compositions in your videos like like you were saying sort of that 60s yeah commercial music yeah yeah like that definitely but spent a lot of time trying to find all of those yeah there's there's albums i call called them like music for TV dinners or a lot of them are from anyway but yeah we're using uh i was just gonna ask you I remember I used to be big into that stuff too just because I found like those old musical like commercial music relics so funny and so entertaining they've got they've got a very useful tone for for what I'm doing and I feel like I've used more and more of that tone in in my reviews more recently just because it's so it fits it it fits it very well they complement whatever message you're trying to deliver as well it's like as soon as that music ops up he has very upbeat and it just makes you want to listen into whatever's happening so I mentioned I mentioned a couple artists that I that I'm into I didn't really go full extent I really my music taste is kind of here and there it's kind of all over the place so obviously Death Grips although I haven't got given their really new album a serious listen yet I don't know how'd you guys do that yeah exactly I hope I've almost just been like putting it on so much of a pedestal that it's like I can't do it now and just put it off another day anyway um so there's that there's a really like Daft Punk's a new album or newish now it's not really new anymore but yeah I like that I want to I I like Coco Rosie I think that tales of aggressive it was probably their best album I it's really odd are like you know I mean Coco Rosie's a unique artist oh yeah I mean the the vocals have always been slightly off-putting for me oh yeah but I appreciate you know what they're trying to do you know it's it's it's one of those things where as like I see your intent but I can't you know but exactly what you mean and that that's why I only really really like the tales of a grass widow album I didn't think that their heartaches whatever it was it heartache city I don't know I didn't think that their new album was amazing but I really I really liked a tales of a grass widow anyway I thought you would to us joanna newsom at all oh yeah actually you know what what's really funny is as soon as you said that you couldn't get past the vocals I feel like that's been said to a lot of the music that I listen to I feel like more or less uh like 90% of the artists that I really really love have a very very unique sounding voice or a very unique sounding tone I always kind of go for like what can I not get anywhere else in my art forms I guess absolutely things I do to them what are you thinking to the same thing I absolutely love and want to seek out because it's like if I'm just seeing a copy of something else I've already seen then why do I want to see it why would I want to pay twelve whatever dollars to see a movie that I could just imagine at home instead if I'm already like twenty minutes ahead of it if I've already seen it before what's the point rightfully fully agree you know it's just that when I when I seek out those weird sounds and those weird artists it's just that I I go into expecting that okay I know this is going to be odd I know this is going to be kind of one of a kind but that might also the the idiosyncrasies of the artists that I'm seeking out might turn me off to you know I guess idiosyncratic is kind of the word to look for they're you know the things that make an artist or a piece of art unique could also be the things that are not selling points to you about it you know and and I guess you know as a critic you you try to do your best to even if some of that stuff is slightly a turn-off you know you try to appreciate it I guess that I guess that is an instance of me valuing intent ya know even if something is a little bit of a turn-off to me if I think it's done well you know that I could definitely you know give it a compliment give it a nod for sure just say like even if it's not for me I can still appreciate what it's doing or I can understand what this might be to somebody else sure think of joanna newsom by the way i liked her music quite a bit I think have went on me while I did I was really impressed with it when it came out um in the long run I think it's kind of just the length of the album has kind of worn on me a little bit but I thought her last record was really good use of course is really great that's my favorite only Anne is like one of my favorite songs yeah and you know her debut record is just kooky and out there and you know I definitely appreciate that about her earlier stuff but yeah I enjoy her music what do you think of Dan lowsec versus Scroobius pip um that record I remember I remember I am on record I'm trying to remember which one it was the one was kind of the two clay faces on the front angles yeah yeah I remember I tried that record out because pitchfork had given to such a scathing review at the at the release of the record when I was like still following their reviews on a regular basis and I thought it was kind of fun I mean I didn't love it but that record definitely put me on to Scroobius pip and had me checking out everything that he had done after that okay and yeah he's a pretty quirky rapper yeah again just another like unique voice I absolutely and and it seems like right now the UK is definitely getting more attention for its hip hop than it has over like the past five or six years Yeah right right now seems like to be a pretty pivotal point for UK hip hop especially with the an artist like Skepta who's been around for so long getting as much attention as he has off of his new record it seems like Americans uh through the internet are slowly trying really finally gain a taste for grime and you know like they know a good grime record when they hear it now I mean not only do they know like a decent grime record when they hear it but you know they actually kind of want to hear some of the stuff I feel I feel like we're getting to a point where Americans are slowly realizing that there are other countries that make art I feel like I feel like America has had a bit of a problem when it comes to trying to seek out art whether it's film or music that's from outside of their own country and I guess I don't know I'm Canadian so maybe it sounds a little racist when I said but I feel like I feel like just what Americans are exposed to in in advertising is always going to be just within their country whereas American art and media it's projected all across the world like everybody's already always paying too attention to America even with American politics like this whole Trump thing is like a reality TV show it's kind of fascinating yeah you definitely have a point when it comes to heart you know um and and even me myself you know when I'm reviewing stuff I'm most often you know reviewing stuff that's from my own country uh I mean not only just because it's more often what I'm being exposed to and more often what my audience is asking me to review but it's also you know most likely the types of norms musical norms artistic norms that I'm used to hearing also my native language as well you know it's kind of tough - oh yeah the stuff in a foreign language sighs I mean I love stupid flip but I don't know what they're saying yeah you know I mean occasionally here and there there are some records in another language that you know I'm head-over-heels for but sometimes when you know language plays a pretty pivotal role is - well yeah music healing actually there's no titles for an album yeah exactly yeah with films it's a lot easier I feel we get into a foreign language but like you were saying you know I feel like we're just kind of finally now getting over that whole accent thing a little bit uh yeah but uh you know maybe it might be the language barrier one day you know I feel like a another thing that kind of makes finding foreign music difficult especially for somebody who's into alternative music is when I go to try to find out about like Chinese music that I might be interested in or Russian music that I might be interested in the artists that I'm hit with instantaneously first are you know the big popular players those countries you know um and not necessarily the the obscure artists who might be doing something that I think is kind of unique or what kind or whatever you know but uh the the Canadian indie scene has seen a pretty healthy growth over the past you know like 20 years or so you know the a Canadian and he artists have been getting a lot of nods in the music industry but it's only been until recently that you know the biggest rapper on the face of the fucking planet has been Canadian yeah no Drake okay yeah oh yeah I mean Drake has definitely broken down a lot of barriers in that regard well with Canadians is pretty easy to just like there's no there's no moment where an American audience is going to be like oh they're Canadian and be turned off by it usually they're just going to assume they're American and then be like oh I didn't even know they were Canadian whereas with with like somebody who has a thicker accent or like somebody from the UK it's there might already be that first impression that's already apparent in their music or apparent in their artwork that might I'm not gonna I don't know and that might either turn some people off or just might not want to make people advertise them as much at the same time I guess oh absolutely you know but I mean still you do have to you do have to admit that I mean as far as rap music I mean up until the Internet age very geographical you know in terms of like the the support and the relevance of an artist within a certain place you know so so in a Canadian artist trying to market themselves in America wouldn't necessarily be easy because that artist wouldn't necessarily have a home base in the States for there to be local promotion to really kind of support them and push them to the local community and you know but now in the internet age when you know not only can you be from anywhere and get an audience from anywhere else if people happen to like your music you know but you also have artists who are from New York and they're making records that sound like records that would come out of Atlanta or out of Houston yeah which you know more than a decade ago was something that was unheard of you know it's like if you were from New York you sounded like you were from New York you know and then on top of it you have artists like little B or artists like Death Grips who are effectively making hip-hop music but they don't really sound like they're from anywhere ya know it sound like they're from another planet yeah I think we're gonna leave it at that I want to thank my guests Adam of your movie sucks diodes so much for him coming on it was great yeah no it was great uh thanks for coming on and talking about your reviews about criticism about music about videogames about everything everything and uh we did do it man we did a really fucking hard this is a long passionate podcast and and you've been a great guest so uh you know I'm sure paths are going to cross again in the future dude yeah for sure all right thank you later thanks for having me on 
7pJ3EFwY1Pw,hi everyone welcome to this new review on the needle drop this is the brand new format that we're going to go with and the reviews here the reviews are posted on to my forehead and then you just basically sit here and read them off my forehead while I sit here in silence so that it will be easier for you to read my to me read a note here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of David Bowie's the rise and fall of Ziggy Stardust and the spiders from Mars gotta say the full title guys the late and the great mr. David Bowie multi-instrumentalist producer singer songwriter his untimely death rocked the music industry earlier this year not only because we lost one of the most iconic figures in modern music but also the album that coincided with his death Blackstar the album was very much about it Bowie's death his spirit the afterlife his fame his memory in the public eye if you want to hear me talk about this album there is an album review of this LP on YouTube I will most likely link it at the end of this video as well but I thought I would take this classic sweet opportunity since we lost David Bowie in the first half of this year to talk about his most popular album yeah now this record is a part of several notable phases in David Bowie's career we have the early years which showcased a lot of baroque pop and a lot of folk influences later down the road in the late 70s and the early 80s we would hear a lot of pop rock art rock experimental rock but in the early in mid 70s Ziggy Stardust here is considered to be the pinnacle of David Bowie's glam rock era pairing with albums such as Aladdin Sane and the man who sold the world as well as hunky dory the album that directly preceded this one not a perfect album it does have a song kook's on it please don't kill me but an important record all the same because it did set the foundation for what was to come on this record you could catch these very theatrical and incredibly catchy rock songs with prominent lead guitars that are very sharp and melodic as well as some wonderful and rich pianos that are kind of playful and jumpy this album featured iconic David Bowie singles such as changes other tracks were direct references to artists who David Bowie drew an incredible amount of influence and inspiration from David Bowie an artist who always wore his influences on his sleeve we have a tribute to Bob Dylan on this album Andy Warhol as well and the song Queen bitch is deeply inspired by Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground the baroque and folk influences on this record still come through on cuts like quicksand but there is one track on hunky dory that is incredibly important to take note of considering the themes of Ziggy Stardust and that is the song life on Mars it ends at a question mark you got to say it like a question and the theme that I'm talking about here is space at this point David Bowie had long been obsessed with space as a theme in his art I mean one of his big breakout singles Space Oddity can't can't forget that and life on Mars isn't so much about life on Mars instead it uses Mars as an escape or just an idea of an escape away from the mundane struggles and cliched commercial art of planet Earth it only makes sense that a song that would make such a statement would be wrapped and just lavish arranged instrumentation and be just instrumentally grand and showy kind of like a peacock anyway he explores these themes of rock and roll and space and fame through these really ambitious instrumentals and inventive characters and while Ziggy Stardust may not be as heavy and punchy and instrumentally crisp as the follow-up album Aladdin Sane which was drop just a year later it's really the themes concept of Ziggy Stardust that makes this album so CheY CheY CheY seminal record for bowie the record kicks off not only with some beautiful pianos and some very dramatic vocals from David Bowie but also with a storyline that sounds like it's ripped straight out of a sci-fi movie and that is that essentially the earth is dying and it has five years left to live the track has this gentle groove and three-four these beautiful piano and string crescendos a sort of get dissonant and chaotic at the end with David Bowie's vocals just shouting and going crazy and the lyrics have this rush of nostalgia like David Bowie's life is just kind of flashing before his eyes and he's thinking about all these things that he's gonna miss some of these things are very mundane everyday stuff whether it be boys and toys and TVs and electric irons all these things he feels like he needs to stash away in his mind his mind he compares it to a warehouse and it's all cluttered and he needs to jam everything in there because everything is literally about to be erased from the face of the earth and there are so many things going on lyrically in the track I mean there are references to everyday life as well as political jabs like when a cop sort of kisses the feet of a preacher and David Bowie says this causes a nearby queer to throw up the entire track is just a mural with numerous characters and things going on at once it's a beautiful open to the record and sort of gives the album a very do me and gloomy tone but it deviates from it really quickly once the song soul love pops in which is a very lovely love song very sensual and smooth but with Bowie's very odd and doubled singing voice on the track it almost sounds like he's an alien being beamed down from another planet to deliver a message of peace and love set to some saxophone and some springy hand percussion and some very tinny acoustic guitar and while it is a love song I think it avoids a lot of the cliches of the love songs of the day because Bowie sings about of in this very abstract and philosophical sense we get into the song managed a dream which is a little more eventful not only because I think it gets back into the concept the narrative of the record but it features these punchy guitars loud blaring great drum fills one of David Bowie's most iconic opening lyrics I'm a mama papa covered for you which might have been his way of censoring himself from saying the word motherfucker not totally sure this track in a sense is also an introduction to the Ziggy Stardust character even though the track itself predates this album still though Bowie portrays himself as a space invader who is leaving quite the impression on Earth's population he seems almost like this object of infatuation or he wants to be anyway especially when the chorus comes around and he's saying keep your electric eye on me and I know if we take the narrative of this record and we look at it just on the surface Ziggy is supposed to be coming down and saving the world from this five-year oblivion that's going to be suffering but this track and the album itself is really more of a statement on Fame and attention and wanting attention and there are other interpretations that people can pull from this track but that attention that Fame narrative becomes more and more apparent as the album progresses now I don't want to leave this track before saying that I love the instrumental here the guitar solo passage is fantastic the psychedelic effects on the vocals are wonderful the strings get totally wild toward the end of the cut the horns and flute passage in the middle of the track is beautiful too in a way I see Bowie portraying himself on this track as an artist or a figure who if he had the platform if he had the opportunity he could leave a real impact on people leave a real impression on people and that feeling is kind of confirmed on the song Starman where Bowie literally sings about the star man being in the sky and he would like to come down but he feels like if he does and he exposes us to these new ideas and sounds and whatever he'll blow our minds in his own art David Bowie is telling us that he feels like he has something special to offer something that's going to leave a mark on musical and artistic history and maybe it's this mark it's this new set of ideas that he sort of given us that have actually ended up saving the world from this five-year peril that he's singing about earlier on the song it ain't easy we deviate from the narrative of the album again because the track is essentially a cover song of Iran Davies track which is a actually very soulful and wonderful country song that dropped in 1970 has a really plucky acoustic guitar intro as well David Bowie's renditions here is much heavier punchy er his very yell P vocal delivery on the cut I imagine could have left a strong impression on like a young Jack White but once we get into the song ladies start us we have David Bowie reflecting on image once again now in respect to glam rock and specifically Marc Bolan of t-rex who the song references he was notorious for his performance makeup and his long black hair and like sort of this star man that David Bowie was singing about earlier he is this artistic he is this rock-and-roll figure who close minded people are just baffled by so in a way David Bowie is kind of commenting on this new wave of expression in rock music and the way that the public is kind of interpreting it in it then you have to consider the themes on this album and in glam rock in general that dealt in homosexuality because glam rock was home to many superstars that were either gay or bisexual or use the characters they would play onstage to bend gender what I find so interesting about this record is just how popular it still is and I tribute that mostly to the music of the album which is wonderful it's beautiful it's awesomely produced glam rock music with great detailed lavish instrumentation but when we dive into the lyrics of the album they're very dated in a sense because it's very meta and it's very of the time that this album was released in the type of stuff that Marc Bolan and David Bowie were doing back in the day wouldn't turn any heads today but you have to think about just how close minded a lot of people would have had to have been back in the 70s not only to just be blatantly rejecting homosexuality but just the mere stage show that artists like Bolin and Bowie were putting together so yes this is one of many moments where David Bowie is just reflecting on the image of glam in the public's perception David Bowie dives directly into the idea of rock stardom on the song star which I guess in a way is still space themed since Star space haha but lyrically David Bowie portrays a rock star is something to transform into mutate into and it's not only something that he wants it's like he needs it as well because by the end of the track he's telling us that he'd be able to sleep at night if he was a rock and roll star he'd be able to fall in love if he was a rock-and-roll star the song hang on to yourself isn't one of the more lyrically intriguing moments although we do get a direct reference to the spiders from Mars on this track which is Ziggy Stardust backing band which he addresses directly on the very next track but this song is pretty awesome because it features these punky guitar riffs that feel like the something that would have come off of like a New York Dolls record just her tales or you arrest so wild Bowie was an artist who very blatantly borrowed from a lot of his contemporaries he was also an artist who in a lot of respects was ahead of the curve now Ziggy Stardust song isn't really this heroic entry in any sort of way in in this track Bowie explores fame even deeper and in a way the fame that Ziggy Stardust has received due to just being so great a guitar and being a great musician has kind of poisoned him because by the end of the cut he's sucked up into his own ego and the band ends up having to be broken up because as David Bowie sings in the song he's taking it too far which eventually leads us to his uh I guess in a sense his rock-and-roll suicide that ends the album off because even though David Bowie has portrayed stardom and fame as this wonderful beautiful thing for much of this record something that he very much wants and very much needs the star that has risen on the album now needs to fall because on this record this song is essentially the curtain closing on Ziggy and it is a very epic curtain close as it really feels like on this cut that just the spotlight is on the character that Bowie is playing you know Bowie one of those artists who one of the earliest examples I could think of who in his music when he singing it really feels like I'm listening to a stage show it feels like I'm listening to a singer just on a hot spotlight and he's delivering not only just great singing and great lyrics but also a performance on a theatrical level and sure there have been many artists who have played characters in their songs over the years and have told great stories in their songs over the years but I feel like Bowie more than any of those other artists who came before him embodied this sense of drama and theater in his music like to the extreme especially at the end of this track is he's just shouting give me your hands give me a hand and just before a big rush of instrumentation oh no you're not alone a really beautiful and dramatic finish to this beautiful and dramatic and very meta and self-referencing album an album that when you really get into the lyrics again David Bowie makes some interesting statements on the artistic and the musical politics of the time in relation to glam rock and in a way art and public image and sexuality to all these things I think continue to make ze start us an interesting and relevant and an influential record sure the music is fantastic I mean it's beautiful gorgeous rock music with again that extra instrumentation which is added into it so tastefully doesn't take away from the viscera and the excitement of the bass instrumentation of the bass guitar on the guitars and the drums and the vocals and then on top of that many of the statements on Fame which I think are very relevant on this record to this de themes that have not only been explored again and again and again by countless rock stars such as Marilyn Manson but also many rappers today are now going through a very similar meta cycle where a lot of rap albums from artists like Kanye West and Drake and Kendrick Lamar where they're essentially rapping about their own fame but also about how it's not really all it's cracked up to be but what's funny is that some of these statements are put so subtly or at least they're buried in hooks and choruses and instrumentation that are so beautiful unless you were really looking for David Bowie to be saying these things you might sort of miss it which is why I urge people who may even be you know familiar with this album instrumentally and really love the sound of this record - next time you're listening to it dive a little bit further into what David Bowie is saying and think about the time in history in which he is saying and I think I'm gonna leave this album review right there yes a lot of cool contextual things about this album that I feel like we addressed here cool narrative awesome lyrical concepts and above all wonderful music wonderful rock music wonderful instrumentation and I hope you give this record a shot if you haven't listened to it already your best da anthony Fantan Oh David Bowie Ziggy Stardust transition thanks for watching the review check out some of the other reviews over here rest in peace David Bowie you'd best anthony Fantana music forever 
hfHWgzkRtUs,ah hi everyone yeah the d-pad day no Internet's better and it's time for review of the microphones the Glo part two of course this is a classic review taking this opportunity to review one of my favorite records of all time it's about 15 years old at this point kind of short of the time span that I would usually consider an album to be classic however I kind of feel like this one's in the bag this is too creative and too fantastic of a record for it to be just completely forgotten moving 10 or 20 years into the future and hopefully I can I can make the case for this record in in this review right here the microphones is essentially a now-defunct recording project started by singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist and producer mr. Phil elver 'im now around the time of the release of this record and just the early years of the microphones in general phil was also known for his involvement with other washington-based rock bands like d-plus as well as old-time religion a really fantastic weird fusion of folk and jazz and noise rock really cool band that I wish sort of got a little more shine you can even catch some of the microphone songs on the d-plus album dandelion seeds and at this point in the microphones existence it is a very different musical project than it is at the point of the release of the glow part to go back and listen to the microphones 1997 release wires and cords or 1998 tests there are a lot of songs whose lyrics deal in like recording and recording equipment songs like buzz-buzz and preamp and sound waves at this point the microphones is is kind of a weird experimental musical side project for Phil that kind of reflects his hobbyist approach to home recording a little bit but over time as he dabbled in this project Phil was also developing this kind of quiet shy introspective textured melodic and noisy indie folk and rock music that the microphones would come to be known for he made the almost complete transition into this style on records like don't wake me up and 2000's it was hot we stayed in water both decent microphones records but they weren't really the magnum opus that the globe part two would be I think actually the microphones had two magnum opus --is of the globe part two and then later the Mount Erie album that would be the microphones last record before Phil essentially kind of changed this recording projects name to Mount Erie where I feel like Phil made that full transition into making that really dark lo-fi rock and folk music that was incredibly instrumental maybe some ambient stuff worked into there as well and a lot of the lyrics dealing in a lot of these nature themes which sure that was there in the microphones music but I think it's it's kind of pivotal to Mount Erie's identity to the end of the unity Phil continues to drop great music under the Mount Erie name some of my favorite albums of his or under that name and but still even though Mount Erie has a very defined sound right now as does Phil's music just in general I think he's always transitioning into something he's always changing up something about the sound or going into a new record with a different concept looking back on Phil's entire discography from the microphones to mount jiri today it's like his whole back catalogue is this endless state of transition or evolution as much as I like a lot of Phil's music there's very little about his music that feels whole or complete or very fine-tuned and and groomed his music is often very rough around the edges especially on this album over here but it's that feel that makes Phil's music so interesting and appealing while yeah it may feel a little haphazard in some sense it may feel a little rough it may feel a little messy and amateurish it's also very adventurous and wildly experimental takes a lot of risks takes a lot of chances it's very visceral not only that but in the performances and in the mixes of his songs there are a lot of I guess what you could call flubs or mistakes or blemishes or abrupt endings the music of Phil Mount Erie the microphones is is very unpolished but it's also very unpredictable the instrumentation on this thing is messy at times it's a disheveled that's cluttered the singing is really weak it's boyish it's it's like listening to somebody cry out as they're lost in the middle of a forest and dying of dehydration or starving but the lyrics on this record are so haunting they're moving their arm ence the melodies they're sweet they're warm they're instantaneously just memorable they stick into the back of my head I'm humming along with them and not only are they that but they're also frightening at times too and even if the instrumentation does feel a little you know rough around the edges at times the way that the instrumentation is layered on this record it's really intricate it's dense it's wonderful it feels so arranged and planned and yet kind of unplanned and just barely keeping it together at the same time this album reminds me of a time when loafing music and home recording was kind of like an opportunity to do something weird and do something different Phil's approach to arranging and mixing especially vocals you could call unorthodox or rule-bending it's strange but it's so a part of the aesthetic and the musicality and the the personality of this album from the very stripped back folky ballads on this record to the crushing distortion of the title track on here at the intro of that song to the towering drones on the song map and the and the crushing noise rock of the song I want to be cold there's actually quite a bit of musical diversity across this record various forms of rock music and acoustic music and ambient music and no music show up on this record some tracks are incredibly abstract I widening Li weird while others have some very sharp song structures to them and really memorable sing-along choruses and the sounds worked into these things are are fantastic as tattered and is dirty and as grimy as a lot of them are just buzzing guitar distortions warm resonant just droney bass shimmering pianos booming drums and that's just the stuff that's recognizable there's tons of sounds and miscellaneous noises worked into these tracks that I'm yet to completely figure out and I don't even think could could ever really be pulled apart unless you were kind of asking Phil or anybody else involved in these recordings about every single detail that went into these tracks and that's the thing about these songs again they're so intricate they're so layered on the surface they sound like a demo and to some probably a really bad and rough and unappetizing demo but once you dive into what's going on with these tracks there's actually quite a bit of detail there's a level of detail and beauty on this record and on a lot of microphones records that you wouldn't find on a demo and it's this disheveled demeanor of these recordings that that makes the experiments on this record sound so live and in the moment and and human the glow isn't just some rough recording pulled together by one person there's actually quite a bit of personnel on this record including fellow K records artists and and d-plus member Carl Blau there's kala Mehra such on this record kyle field eddie Blau nate ashley dave Mathies Jacob Navarro Jenn Cleese leo Visser and this is actually the most amount of people I believe that Phil has had on a microphones record up until this point no wonder it sounds as huge and as vast as it does this thing is 20 tracks long it's about an hour in length and occasionally there are tracks on here the transition from these very tiny quaint indie folk tunes to these panoramic instrumental displays that while they are noisy and things come together in a very cluttered junk pile type of way they sound very why they sound very gorgeous tracks like I felt your shape or the track instrumental where all of a sudden out of nowhere we get these reverb soap finger snaps and ascending gentle pianos let's try to get into what happens on some of these songs individually this whole thing kicks off with the song I want wind to blow this track kicks off with these really great dueling doubled acoustic guitar melodies with a little bassline popping up in the background that skips along on the tempo that sounds like it's played by the same acoustic guitar you can expect a lot of this very same acoustic guitar layering to happen throughout this record this track does a great job of setting the tone for the album in that respect I love the intimate cracked vocals on this track and a lot of what's popping up on this song lyrically the wind the rain the night the Sun these are lyrical elements that despite the array of different stories told on this record pop up again and again and again and again this track in particular though feels like a description of very simple surroundings with some beautiful poetry and a lot of natural elements woven in and the song kind of sounds like in a lot of ways a sunrise in a sense it isn't really the dark and the hellish and then in the very solemn soundscape that the last two tracks on this record are which very much feel like an ending it's almost like this is the start of a brand-new day and then over the course of this album we are going to be put through a musical ringer a musical and emotional ringer of sorts across all of these songs now this track develops a really beautiful guitar lead melody that the instrumentation builds on with these very hypnotic but distorted drums and it's a great ending to the track as transitions into the title track on here and that's the thing a lot of the songs on this record flow into one another making all of the tracks feel very whole and very cohesive and even the tracks that end abruptly and transition into songs with a totally different flavor even this disorienting feel kind of adds to the character of the record and keeps things really stimulating the globe part two features these crushing distorted riffs at the start of the track and then these acoustic guitars break in with this heartbreaking little tune that Phil starts singing some of the most cutting lyrics on the entire album occur on this track and these very vivid descriptions of his body and his mortality in his blood his heart pumping that blood appear on this song Phil's lyrics kind of have this way of putting on display just how fragile and just how finite my mortality and my existence is his lyrics make me feel like I'm a very tiny insignificant just speck of dust in this huge vast powerful dangerous never-ending world and the music is as powerful as the lyrics because occurring in the background of these simply strummed acoustic guitars and Phil's vocals we have this very heavy bass in these pianos that sound like a thunderstorm happening in the distance on the song the moon Phil smothers his vocals once again with these ear piercing droning organs and a kind of hypnotic krautrock ish drum B and there are some wonderful horns woven into this drone as well the whole track starts off though with a really stringy crunchy layered arpeggiated acoustic guitar intro that I like a lot I think the guitars on here have a really specific tone and flavor to them they're buzzing they're stringy each chord and each note is like stepping onto a bed of crunchy dry dead leaves as you walk through a forest the song headless horseman is one of the Salam's many very somber acoustic ballads which make up for some of my favorite tracks on the entire record like the song I'll not contain you which is way more piano-driven or the track you'll be in the air but on this track it's one of the songs that I think is maybe a little breakup or relationship oriented I'm catching lyrics on this song talking about standing outside and all of his stuff is outside as if it had been Moo moved out of an apartment or something and he's talking about returning from hell and turning from a stray dog to a mighty human man it's another one of the moments on this record where Phil's lyrics are are really interesting and symbolic and I guess intriguing while they describe a very personal real moment they're esoteric but relatable at the same time and I love the little piano ballad my roots are strong and deep as well I think the descriptive poetry on this track is really sweet as well Phil talking about how he's like this tree type figure and he's swaying in this other person's breeze from the song the mansion - something - something continued we have these kind of dreary interlude ish tracks that are very drone heavy the mansion has these fluttering acoustic guitars playing throughout and this really repetitive somber stone-faced poetry coming from Phil while something continued is very dissonant it's very ominous and unsettling drone music very different vibe from the gleam part - which has this really prominent percussive element to it it's just plotting it's like a funeral march dun dun dun duun that track in the song map are two of the most immense songs on the entire record as far as just emotional anguish goes and I love how multifaceted this track is not only with its heavy intense drones at the very start of the track but also the piano melody it suddenly breaks into in the in the middle of the track boom been done done done done done done done in that pump organ or that accordion at the end those long droney chords those aerodrome chords at the finish of this track really nice touch then comes the amazingly loud I want to be cold which I mentioned earlier in this review and the song I am bored which has maybe the loveliest piano no tendon tendon those chords right there not only are they really warm and fun and very cool but they also remind me of like some older vocal pop or something Phil really borrowing from something else on that track right there but still turning into something all his own and these pianos his vocals the the kind of rolling drums on the floor Tom on this track it's something that has a really strong amateurish charm to it but again it's another one of those moments where everything feels a little too planned to be completely just you know we don't know we're doing especially during the Roaring bridge on this track where all of a sudden this very gentle little piano tune turns into like this a roaring tornado of hell for a second from the song I felt my size to the track I felt your shape Phil writes two of his sharpest songs not only on this record but on his entire discography really great choruses on this song some incredibly cutting emotional and moving lyrics especially on I felt your shape where I think Phil pulls out one of the sharpest coolest acoustic guitar licks I've ever heard on any record something that I remember when I first heard it I had to learn it and I didn't even know if there were any tabs out or anything for it I just completely taught myself at least some kind of weird recognizable version of the song on acoustic guitar because I just thought the song was was that good I just had to force myself to learn it by ear just off of just being first exposed to it I just was was that floored by how good the song was and it's another thing about this record in general it's kind of one of those albums that reminds me a little bit of The Velvet Underground in that The Velvet Underground had this quality to their music where it was just deceptively simple and an amateurish to the point where you would think that if you picked up an instrument and got together with three or four other people and started some awful rock band that that you'd be just as great as The Velvet Underground the thing about Mount Erie though is that the music is so beautiful and wonderful and the recording itself is so deceptively rough and I guess bad by traditional standards that it would make you think that you could pull together some kind of lo-fi home recorded folk album it would be just as amazing and creative and just off-the-wall now the song samurai sword one of the final tracks on this record as I mentioned toward the beginning of this review is really hellish it's really loud it's kind of like Phil coming in observing everything he's built up until this point for 50 or so minutes on this record and then just toppling it and destroying and just throwing it all into the toilet it's a sort of like a hurricane that just clears the entire slate of this record it's kind of like the hellish wind that Phil wanted to blow at the beginning of the album coming in and just erasing everything while the final track to me kind of sounds like Phil dealing with death at the beginning of this album Phil is singing about electric heat and fluorescent lights and a load of other things but here he's singing about the power being out and it being night and the Sun is going down and it's dark and he's alone except for like some insects or something and this song is very long it's nine minutes or so although he's just kind of playing a bit of piano at the intro and then breaks into this acoustic cut for a few moments just kind of paint the situation just kind of give you an idea of the imagery that he's surrounded by and then the song cuts out entirely and all we hear is this lone drum that kind of sounds like a heartbeat which eventually just goes silent I'm to guess that maybe that means he's dead at this point his death is there nothingness it's black and then after that aside from a Jeron that pops up occasionally the song is completely silent very faintly in the background I kind of hear the acoustic guitar melody that was on the very first track to this album I want when to blow the melody is occurring just so faintly it's kind of deceptive you might think that you were coming up with it on your own head I'd have bored him just from nothing happening at this point in the song but I'm again to guess that the silence at this point in the track and the fact that we do have this reference to the beginning this record that they're connected somatically or story-wise in some kind of way that that the life and that the newness and that the brightness that was there at the beginning of this album is now gone as a result of either the wind coming or nature destroying everything or just kind of the death or the finite mortality that has been referenced throughout this album up until this point it's a great record I think it's a fantastic record it's experimental it's Avant folk singer-songwriter noise rock indeed I mean there's just so much stuff going on here there's so many elements so many different musical styles woven into this record it's so dynamic so many different emotions and and things expressed across this album although again a lot of it deals with life and death and mortality and incredible emotional pain and I feel like there are very few albums of the 2000s that that go into those issues as well as this album does and with so much character to not only with the instrumentation and the production on this thing but I think Phil's attraction toward a lot of these natural themes and backdrops gives his music a bit of an edge or at least a very unique characteristic that that doesn't turn up in a lot of other records or at least when it does it doesn't seem anywhere near as authentic or organic I don't really think I could say much of anything else about this album I'm just floored by it every time that I thankfully get an opportunity to really sit down and listen to it and remind myself of why I continue to love it so much after all these years and I hope you guys take the opportunity to give this album a listen to and try it for yourself and just basically see what all the hubbub of it is about cool cool I love you transition have you given this record of listen if you have let me know what you think of it is it one of your favorites of all time is it not let me know Anthony Fantan oh the globe part you forever 
hJvihpuvPbg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of the yes record close to the edge famed progressive rock band from the UK yes and this is easily their most acclaimed record created while a band was in the middle of their most celebrated lineup you had John Anderson on vocals Chris Squire whose very crunchy roaring bass tone can be heard all over this LP Steve Harris on guitar Bill Bruford on drums and then we have of course Rick Wakeman on keyboards possibly progressive Rock's greatest living keyboardist and also at this time yes was kicking off a string of fantastic progressive rock records that they released throughout the 70s including this LP the yes album fragile and later albums such as but yes discography featured more than just progressive rock the band's early work actually had some influences coming from the psyche rock realm and later in their output from the 80s and 90s which is maybe some of the most polarizing and controversial stuff they would ever drop there was a huge pop music influence coming into the fold it was on records like this where you just heard yes playing like some hard rock or some adult oriented rock or synth pop and new wave the band even put out a remix album in the early 2000s which I'm sure a lot of their fans would like to just kind of assume doesn't exist and it's also worth noting that yes has been incredibly active since the release of their first album they have consistently dropped records throughout the years even if some of them haven't really been as well received as others because they kind of changed their sound and style a lot of those yes records from the 80s and 90s haven't really been looked upon that favorably with time passing but the band still kind of stuck to putting out music and they evolved as I guess they kind of saw fit and kept up with the times and I personally don't really find albums like 901 to 5 to be terrible I just think that a lot of people who tend to gravitate toward yeses music love them mostly for their older stuff love them for their progressive rock stuff and as far as progressive rock sits on the totem in regards to pop music it's definitely a lot higher with progressive rock fans but in a way I think what set yes apart from a lot of the other progressive rock bands of their day was their openness toward other more accessible expressions of modern music cuz across yes is discography there was this really high level of versatility shown from albums like close to the edge to some really well-crafted pop music and I think that diversity in that versatility in a way is also shown on this record where we're getting these really flashy fantastic keyboards some very colorful and funky guitar licks growling bass lines very punchy drums and some awesome heavenly soaring vocal harmonies and all these things are assembled into this winding complex web of ever changing and morphing rock symphonies this record kicks off in a very serene fashion with the sound of birds and some flowering pretty electronics which actually pop up periodically throughout this record it's a very beautiful very psychedelic but then as the guitars the bass the drums pop in we're getting these ascending melodies and guitar chords that are creating this really tight monstrous Jam there is this fluidity to the playing on this record that you really only get when you hear a group of people performing and playing together just very natural you know no click tracks or anything like that but the band just has this amazing ability to stop on a dime to make way for John Anderson's just really bright vocal harmonies it's it's awesome the level of detail that the band has worked into this record by not only experimenting compositionally but just with the way that they're able to sort of perform and lay all these incredible details to tape which must have been an arduous process this introduction eventually gives away to the tracks theme melody which is fantastic it's an amazing theme melody and then we get the initial groove of the verse the first verse on this track and it's a hard freakin groove and for a moment this groove stops to allow these fluttering keyboards to come in once again is just another moment where yes is incorporating these really awesome bits of color playing these little instrumental games to keep things interesting and just make this a highly again detailed album yes had a very maximal approach to rock music composition and it's part of what made their songs especially on this record so engaging and it's also worth noting that this track also kind of reminds me of something that rush would be doing just years down the road in the 80s but in a way that was a much more sleek and I guess commercially viable a little later down the road the first big refrain of the record pops up seasons will pass you by it's a very catchy moment on the record maybe the first moment on this LP where yes is pop sensibility is shining through and the band's prowess for vocals sweet vocal music is shown a little bit later as you get all the instrumentation kind of melting away and then we're just getting all these vocal layers harmonizing in a really beautiful Beach Boys s Quay these vocal harmonies trade off with some very grand organ sequences which are huge they're gorgeous they sound like this massive church organ this organ is powerful it is just monstrous it's emotional it's a very emotional moment these vocals and this organ sort of trading off and the organ occasionally sounds very dark and very sinister for me is kind of a tearjerker moment in in the middle of this record and matching this part up with the refrain of the next track thee I get up I get down moment on this album was just great and yes continues to hit us with just one compositional idea after the next and what's awesome is that they all flow together so well these screaming keyboard riffs just enter the fold and they change the vibe of the song entirely and they're just kind of meant as is a bit of a palate cleanser so that the band can incorporate these squelchy Warped just bouncy gegege keyboard riffs against these bustling drums which kind of reminds me of stuff that battles would be doing experimental rock band battles we would be doing decades later down the road I mean if you listen to the plinky just ear piercing gang equality of the synthesizers against these drums I think you're going to pick up elements that have showed up on mirrored and gloss drop yes packed so much in to these songs and this is all technically like the title track the first track on the record it just has these multiple phases or sub songs within it this opening song is about like 18 minutes long takes the first side of the record and when this track is over I feel like I've gotten a whole album already and the final part of this track seasons of man brings back all the previous refrains showcased in the song and again it's like another powerful emotional moment especially as refrains like I get up I get down or sort of stretched out and we're just getting these long long long grand notes it's on moments like this where yes it's showing that they have the complexity and the refinement of like symphonic or a classical tune but they're giving it the immediacy of a rock song now side two of this record features a couple more tracks it's kind of like yes is giving us this a handful of many little rock symphonies and the second side of this LP kicks off with some really lush acoustic guitar very rich progressive folk music kicking off the second half of this LP and as more electric instrumentation creeps into the mix this song gains just a panoramic huge just monstrous heaviness that is almost inspiring and once again yes kind of melts this extra instrumentation away to only put the spotlight on the acoustic guitar again in a moment that feels very emotional very somber I wouldn't say yes is as theatrical as some of their progressive rock contemporaries like Jethro Tull and King Crimson but this is just another really compositionally powerful moment for me on this record and really showcases how dynamic the band was and from here yes glides into some really Pleasant beautiful 70's style rock music and I think again just the the word of the day with this record is versatility also that this album comes from a band that understands the significance of songwriting flashy playing is fantastic but if you're not great song to plug it into you're only fighting half the battle this records final moments are delivered by this nine minute cut called Siberian katroo it kind of finishes this record on a very upbeat note not really anything too grand or ambitious to sort of end this album off it's a really good track don't get me wrong but it definitely doesn't feel in line with the previous two songs and that you're kind of getting this symphonic grand musical statement with a bunch of sub tracks held within it rather this track feels a bit like a medley of a bunch of different popular genres of the day there are guitar licks and there are bass lines and there are keyboard parts throughout this song that have a very clear and obvious influence coming from blues music or country music as well as just hard rock and classical throughout this song yes is making these very bold and intentional genre references for the listener to kind of pick them up and be like oh okay wow we're really bouncing all over the place stylistically I wouldn't say this song is as cohesive as the previous two tracks nor is it I guess as grandly composed it kind of feels like at the first moments of the previous two songs the band is really focused on setting up some kind of really big musical stage for what would be coming up later in the song which is some kind of big payoff whereas on this track it doesn't really feel like the band has any kind of big payoff coming it's just this constant barrage of very energetic upbeat rock based musical movements so again in that sense I'm maybe not as head-over-heels over this closing track as I am the previous two songs but again it's still an interesting experiment a cool way for the band to end the record on an upbeat note and also that fade out at the very end didn't care for that fade out but again I appreciate how difficult it must have been to lay this kind of music to tape and even though this isn't one of the best songs or one of the best musical moments on the entire record it is something special and it is a really cool piece of music and and something that I could see and understand that they wouldn't want to leave of the record especially since omitting this song would have made the album so short overall gotta say this record is a progressive rock must for multiple reasons spray songwriting the fantastic performances and on top of that yes was able to on this record make a great prog rock album make a prog rock classic while keeping some very clear connections to the styles of music the more accessible styles of music that influenced progressive rock so much some of which I think a lot of progressive rock fans who are of the more snooty variety would like to imagine in their heads that progressive rock has no connection to the the peasants music it's one thing to be a great virtuous musician but to be a great virtuous musician with just a wide palette of tastes and a lot of different influences and a lot of versatility I think is a greater thing and something that yes showcase themselves to be throughout their career especially on this record where I think they hit a perfect balance between more progressive complex rock stylings and then mixing that with some catchy er elements - I love this record it's a great record I hope you can give a listen to it and that's it man you're the best Anthony Fantan oh yes transition have you given this record oh listen if you have what did you think of it what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why would you hate it it's an amazing record you're the best Anthony van tan yes close to the edge forever 
r9gIGBuF6ao,here we go let's go hi everybody Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of Nirvana's in utero Nirvana was a Seattle rock band and this was their final studio album released about seven months before the unfortunate suicide of the band's frontman Kurt Cobain not much at this point can be said about Nirvana culturally that hasn't already been said a million times so to kind of sum it up and put it simply Nirvana was maybe the most defining moment for rock music in the 90s really a sight Geist their breakout record nevermind and their rise to popularity sort of marked a changing of the gaurd for mainstream rock music a shift away from a lot of the overly glitzy pop music and New Wave music from the Hard Rock and the power ballads in the hair metal that were ruling the roost at the time during this moment in music in the mid 80s in the late 80s there was kind of a dark underbelly of rock music of underground rock music growing on the west coast specifically in Seattle you can catch a lot of these artists and a lot of these records on some compilations like deep-six from CZ records on this comp you can hear early cuts from The Melvins for example even Sub Pop straight out of Seattle was dropping compilations around this time like the Sub Pop 100 while Nirvana wasn't on here there were grunge acts from the west coast like you men on this compilation for example and Sub Pop did release Nirvana's full-length debut bleach which was an incredibly successful record despite how raw the recording was and this album essentially gave Nirvana the opportunity to go to that with a major label record supporting them for their next full-length album the grunge sound had been there for a while with Melvin's and Soundgarden and the like but it just didn't have the the national stage yet nor did it really have the record to kind of create interest in it and that's where nevermind came in this album really sold the mainstream public on grunge with fantastic singles like smells like teen spirit and lithium and come-as-you-are and while these tracks weren't singles it's kind of easy to hear the influence in the connections that were drawn and sort of made on tracks like lounge act as well as on a plane the more easygoing and sweeter more melodic cuts on this album had a huge impact on many of the alternative and grunge rock and sort of post grunge bands that would follow after Nirvana and had a more commercial sound for a long time after Nirvana broke and Kurt Cobain passed away the major labels tried really hard to create the next Nirvana and while there were many very successful rock bands after Nirvana broke in the 90s its it just wasn't happening but still the ripples the waves of influence of albums like nevermind as well as in utero over here were felt for years so after such a successful break out record with never mind you could imagine that Nirvana was feeling quite a bit of artistic freedom from their label at least it sounds that way with this record being a tad more raw than what the band had presented on nevermind they also teamed up with Steve Albini of shellac and big black fame to produce this thing while Kurt and Nirvana did get a lot of criticism and maybe were shafted a little bit by the mainstream in the music media a bit simultaneously they had kind of this imperviousness because their fans just love them so much I mean there were such a cultural phenomenon it's kind of crazy to sort of see Nirvana continuing to be successful despite having such destructive live shows and on numerous occasions kind of just flipping the bird to the music media so coming together with a record that was a follow-up to never mind not only did Nirvana just come through the more animalistic just noisier album but this record is so very much a reflection on just the sudden popularity of not just Nirvana as a band but also Kirk Kove there's so many lyrics on this record where it's clear he's just reflecting on how the media and just how people perceive him as far as the sound of this record goes there there's so many guitar blemishes all over this thing so many shots of feedback and Steve Albini pretty much leaves all of it in the bass is really thick and heavy on this thing Dave Grohl's drums are pounding which were also characteristics that turned up on nevermind I think Steve Albini just gave nirvana a little bit more body and more layers of noise his his his he did a great job pulling this record together and I think the band sounds fantastic as well on some of the more subdued moments here like on the song dumb or even on all apologies where you're catching just a little bit of a strings hanging in the background kind of coloring the the I guess more subdued spots of the song and making things sound really dreary and sad so yeah there are moments where this record is kind of tender but simultaneously their spots of real extremity on this album sort of like where Kurt just blasts some incredibly sensitive and touchy imagery on the song rape me the self deprecation and the self-hatred and just these feelings of worthlessness are really strong throughout this thing and it's kind of a testament to Kurt and Chris and Dave Grohl's musical abilities that this album didn't come off as disturbing as it actually is when you just read directly into the lyrics the music itself is so entertaining and it's so visceral and it's just so hard hitting and catchy that Kurt's lyrics being darker than they've ever been on this record they tend to hit after the fact when looking into the lyrics on this album it's really no wonder that Kurt was going through what he was going through just all the information about his life up until the point of his suicide that has leaked since his death and since the investigation and so on and so forth the drugs his relationship with Courtney just him being upset over being so popular and just the eeeh kind of just keeping this lens on him as well as just being a father also his depression things that unfortunately fans tend to obsess over and think sort of made kur the person that he was and think made him a great in an interesting artist when that's not really so much the case I think it's the fact that Kurt was a great artist which made him able to channel all those things in in such creative way the songwriting on this LP while it's not as concise and not quite as single driven as it was on nevermind there are a lot of raw and very noisy tracks on this record many of the cuts on here being very riff intensive and on top of a lot of these riff heavy and very noisy and very loud tracks Kurt delivers some of the most animalistic vocal performances he's given so far like on milk it and Tourette's and one of my favorite tracks on here scentless apprentice the layers of ear piercing guitars right at the start of this track are something to be whole it's funny to think just how much extreme music has come out since the release of these Nirvana records and some of the hardest loudest tracks on nevermind and on in utero are still like some of the craziest things I've ever heard and the distorted screams that Kurt gives the shrieks that he does on this track some of them are just like bone-chilling some of my favorite cuts on this record provide these moments of like extremity and just real depravity and they contrast really well with some of the more subdued cuts on this record this album flows very nicely there's a good balance between these harder hitting tracks and the softer cuts as well as the songs that fit a little more snug lis into that single formula his formula is formula like on the song rape me which has some incredibly raw vocals at the very end of the track record is just going off although really the selling point of this track are the insanely self-destructive and ER self-hating lyrics they are disturbingly real and and I think even more disturbing when you bring the context of Kurt's life into what he's saying on this song it's just super sad I mean I enjoyed this record a lot when I was in high school and at the you know the very intro to college but since then admittedly I haven't listened to it too much and not that it's not good not that I don't enjoy it I've just been kind of wrapped up in what I'm doing with the needle drop and it's it's rare that I actually get the opportunity to visit old old stuff it sort of depends on where my tastes are pushing and pulling me and a lot of the alternative rock and a lot of the punk rock that I used to enjoy and man I played a lot of those records to death man is sometimes they don't get as much play not because I don't try to make the time to listen to them but I don't know they're just the desire kind of the the idea to listen to them just isn't there but digging through my older stuff and seeing this record I was like yeah you know what I should revisit then just see you know how it's been sitting for all these years and it's funny because after learning so much about what I know now about stuff like noise rock and post-punk and so on and so forth this album I really gained newfound respect for it because the sound is just immense it's fantastic and not only that but I feel like as an adult I understand and I've experienced and I've known other people you know I've known and seen firsthand the effects of a lot of the problems that Kurt had and sort of seeing him really beat the out of himself emotionally on so many of these cuts can be kind of hard to listen to and not in a way that makes me cringe or anything like that but it's it's just disturbingly real hopeful about moving on to another single from this record heart-shaped box a fantastic track that as a kid hearing it played on the radio I have a lot of fond memories of and I love the musicality of this tract is kind of the the personality of the bass and the drums especially during the subdued versus Nirvana had this fantastic quality where they would just explode into these heavy hard-hitting courses and they do that once again here but I really love the verses here not only for Kurt's very pained vocals and his lyrics that are another very sad moment on the album where it seems like he is just paralyzed with fear and anxiety over this relationship or kind of this very tainted love that he's singing about in the song as well as things like fatherhood but also I love the way that the drums and especially the bass kind of tiptoe in this really weird way keep this very strange rhythm pattern on the verse not anything I've ever heard any band in this style attempt again since Nirvana and the song all apologies is one of the many moments on this record where Kurt is reflecting on his fame on his popularity on the media's perception of him and he's asking questions sort of in this very aloof way like what am I supposed to write what am I supposed to do what am I supposed to say I feel like I'm this dancing monkey for you guys and that I'm just this puppet up here and I'm just here for your entertainment Kurt had this knack for delivering vocals that had just a mix of emotions and them not only sadness and depression self-loathing but also sarcasm and he had this way of making fun of himself while simultaneously making fun of them taking shots at the people who didn't really think very highly of him in the music media so yeah the song says a lot but I think musically it has a lot of great things going for it as well I love the hypnotic mantra on the tail end of the track that sort of brings the album out I like how if not a big guitar lines on the track get and I like how simple the guitar line leading into the song is and the intro is too it's it's so simple but so effective and this track while I don't think many people were predicting what was going to happen to Kurt down the road just six or seven months from the release of this record this track certainly feels like a last hurrah and there are other tracks on here that when you read into them they say a lot about Kurt's feelings about the band's popularity and just their place in the music industry at the moment way Frances Farmer will get her revenge on Seattle where we have mentions of people being paid and just making a buck off the band and if Kurt were to I guess kind of rebelled against that our fight against that in any way there'd be a suit my one critique of this track though is that I think for nirvana at this point in their career the sound that they were bringing on this track was a little stereotypical I wasn't totally in love with what they were doing riff wise on this track but even the more inconspicuous tracks on here Kurt manages to say a lot especially on the song dum which is the most somber cut here with like I said earlier those dreary strings hanging in the background and the poetry here is disturbing with Kurt talking about really just how happiness is such a fleeting and elusive thing for him it seems like in theory maybe that's such a silly thing happy being happy such a silly thing to obsess over but when you think about again how difficult it was for Kurt to just attain that mood and hold it and keep it it just makes this track another hard listen and I think he also kind of makes a point about ignorance being bliss a little bit how you could be happy it's easy for you to be happy because you're dumb and Kurt is essentially saying that when he does feel happy he feels as if he's dumb maybe when he's happy he's not really being fully true to himself or aware of everything around him maybe because of a you know sort of the addictions that he was going through as well but rather than being happy and aware and intelligent and sort of totally coherent and there he's happy because he's in this dumb down state Kurt was just in this really weird hate triangle between himself the media and sort of his audience as well because while the media sort of saw him in the industry too is this cash cow where he didn't feel treated very well which was reflected in his music he didn't really care for the Messiah role that his fans in his audience were placing on him as well on the song very ape he refers to himself as the king of literature and on the track loyalty he refers to himself as being drained of his lifeforce and just sacked of his resources and finally with the track radio-friendly unit shifter this track seems like a bit of a a nod and end I wouldn't say a throwaway I like the track but it doesn't really seem to kind of have an overall point to it it's kind of like a lot of psychobabble nothing really adds up but each individual line says a lot like each single line has a bit of satire to it or at least a point to be made I think the real message behind this track comes through on the title to this song I mean it seems like a bit of corporate jargon radio-friendly unit shifter like as this track's supposed to be a single that's going to shift sell more units because it seems to be the exact opposite of that it's kind of this abrasive noise rock CrazyTalk if this track illustrates anything again it's just kind of the artistic freedom that Nirvana had on this album to kind of parity and satirise and and and just take punches at the industry the fans and Kurt himself all over this album this record is not only a great rock record and I think one of the most important albums an alternative rock and modern rock and obviously grunge as well but it's an album that has just I don't know just it's it's so mentally disturbed and simultaneously so catchy and so immensely popular it's strange to think that something so abrasive and so unsettling is simultaneously so enjoyable and and widespread it kind of makes this album intriguing and I think the other thing that makes it intriguing is just how deep of a look we get into the mind of Kurt Cobain when it was at its most volatile sorry to be such a downer at the end of this review but I mean that's what I think this album is it's kind of a downer but a very enjoyable and very well-put-together downer and I mean that's that's for me what uh what what makes a lot of art great I mean that it makes feel something and it makes you think about something and I guess it makes you reflect on something it communicates emotions and this album most certainly does that if you're into heavy hard-hitting rock with some noise mixed in there with the guitars and some just crazy ass vocal performances some great drumming some solid and strange is very creative bass lines too and some very clear and nicely layered production as well give this thing a listen I mean it's it's a 90s classic you're the best I love you transition have you given this record to listen if you haven't why it's a classic listen to it forever 
DjVrJ1kSmRA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review a classic review of nas's illmatic nas AKA nasty nas is a New York rapper and this is his 1994 debut album the 20th anniversary of this record just passed and with every new year this thing's reputation as a pinnacle of New York hip hop grows sadly this is a high-water mark that nas has sort of failed to reach again later in his career however it's nothing to hold against him because it's it's very few rappers that actually have a record as great as Illmatic under their belts New York hip hop in the 90s is an era of the genre that over the years has been defined by boom bap drums gritty descriptions of city life but it's not a trend that would be in full swing until the release of albums like stress and 36 chambers and died and back to up the main ingredient the infamous and of course Illmatic now New York saw its share of mean and very masculine and braggadocious rappers throughout the 80s people like care as one and Kool G Rap as well as Chuck D of course Run DMC and rock him of Eric B and Rakim and of course the west coast had delivered its share of very vulgar violent and toothed gnashed records up until that point as well the chronic and Straight Outta Compton and Ice Cube's debut the west coast made hip hop so much more aggressive so much dirtier and New York hip hop artists were responding to that while simultaneously sticking to the kind of detailed storytelling and and vivid wordplay and word usage that New York had come to be known for now nas didn't just pull this album to get by himself he had some of the best and brightest of New York's hip-hop scene working with him on this project people like q-tip also Pete Rock DJ Premier and Large Professor brought all the instrumentals these really jazzy loops very beefy crunchy drums backing those loops up also MC serch of third base Fame executive produced this album back to the instrumentals though the beats on this thing are great they're simple but effective they perfectly set the tone for what nas is saying on this record like on New York state of mind where we get a slinky upright bass line this very sour piano chord that repeats every bar just sticking out occasionally these skipping echoed guitar notes which I think are guitar notes ring out very eerily the drumbeat brings a great groove each element of what's going on in this beat adds so much character to the song the very smooth and jazzy and sweet instrumental on life's a bitch contrasts very nicely to the very morbid point of view of the song the world is yours has a golden hook on it it's Mama's man an amazing couple of piano samples layered over one another which are so pretty they're so fluid they're so key to the song but it's crazy to think that these little sections of piano were merely just embellishments or passages on the way to something else five minutes into the song I love music by the Ahmad Jamal trio the beat on halftime it's loud it's brazen the drums are some of the just heaviest nastiest on the entire record and the very bright horns that pop up on the hook really give the song some flavor especially since with the verses the song tends to be so skeletal which just enhances those horns when they pop in there is surprisingly a thumb piano sample on the song one love which it's it's a catchy little melody but it's sort of something unique for its time as far as hip hop samples go but easily one of my favorite instrumentals in the list here has to be for the song represent it sounds like in icy New York morning 7:00 a.m. in the middle of January the gang vocals on the hook here represent not only can I hear them so clearly but it's almost as if I'm hearing the frosty breath coming off of those vocals too and the sense on this thing are just icy as hell they are ice-cold and a very ethereal but a pop Pepa and horns on the closing track here they seem almost dreamlike in in how light and how breezy they are but the drums and nas's vocals are just very hard they're upfront they're in your face they kind of keep the song grounded in reality none of the beats on this record change up significantly once they've been sort of giving you a flavor of what they're doing on the first verse and the first chorus that's pretty much what they're going to do throughout the whole track which is fine the beats are simply meant to kind of just play back up to what nas is doing and not as is so captivating of a voice that the beat doesn't really need to distract from what he's doing anyway on this project nas had a never-ending flow and the lyrical content to match on New York state of mind we get these gritty tales of gun-toting gangsters and drugs money base heads selling amps presumably to get their next fix but easily my favorite line out of this track is a repeated one or nas raps about not sleeping because sleep is the cousin of death however this track and a lot of other tracks here I don't think boiled down to any one single line or anything like that I think one of the most impressive things about all these songs collectively is that nas is rapping and his lyrics are so articulate and they flow so logically that what he's saying in his songs is about as easy to follow as like a conversation which shows that in his songs he wasn't just there to self-promote he wasn't just there to brag he felt he had something to say to the listener even if that something is as simple as his passion for sneakers or bitches with beepers the lyrics on the song life's a bitch take a kind of defeatist direction a see you can hear featured on the hook here and he yells this hook at the top of his lungs like it's literally going to be the last thing he ever says and Nas comes in with a verse that's pretty interesting because it sort of flips the narrative of the song he raps about his age his birth how he's lucky to have seen another birthday he raps about being caught up in drugs and crime and then eventually something changes and he starts living for the long term saying that he wants to live for tomorrow that that book that he spent on the bottle could have won the lotto it's like in the verse the one verse II writes on this song he sort of grows up before our very ears you could say that the verse doesn't really fit the theme of the song and the way the AZ verse does but this could be for a couple of reasons I mean nas maybe is sort of breaking this cycle of death and I guess early death that is wrapped about on the song or maybe he's just kind of the other side of that coin point on the song the world as yours we get another career-defining refrain where nas is rapping that he wants dead presidents to represent him which I understand that the idea of dead presidents is is pretty cliche today in in hip-hop lyricism but for its time it was a pretty sick line and a lot of the lyrics on this track sort of deal directly with nas's passion for hip-hop and the craft of the genre rapping about his creative process notebooks with lyrics going into the margins the song is essentially kind of about nas's takeover or the takeover that he anticipates will happen through his passion for this through his talent which I think he proves with three very meaty verses and he proves that again on the song half time which to me this song isn't really about anything as much as it is just kind of nas delivering some lyrical flash with imagery in this track like nas rapping on slave ships two lines such as because I'm an ace when I face the bass and one of the most unpolitical e correct lines on the track actually has some of the most interesting wordplay where he says his style switches like sort of meaning which is sexual preferences or sexual preference changes but simultaneously a switch is something that you can hit somebody with a stick and a is a bunch of sticks and it must be said that nas also says in this song ly he drops Jules he wears Jules but he hopes not to run them run those Jules run those Jules fast the album cools down with the song memory lane which takes a little bit of a nostalgic tone but maybe not as much as I would have liked maybe it doesn't really stick out as much as I think a song with this type of angle should because there's so many other songs on here we're in little lyrical bits in single bars nas kind of gives you bits of background when it comes to his passions his love of hip-hop and on this track I guess don't let the nostalgic tone trick you because there's still some very deadly and violent lyrics in these verses like which here's my bassist my razor embraces many phases it's on the song one love though where I think nas really proves himself as a storyteller not only is he telling tales of the hood where he's from but he's telling them to someone who's in jail it's almost as if his buddies in jail and he's writing a letter to him in these rap verses which to be honest is a pretty sick concept for its time and incredibly well executed now the song represents stands out to me not just instrumentally it is one of my favorite instrumentals on the record but also one of my favorite performances from nas because this track sticks out to me as not sounding the hungriest on the entire record his aggressive delivery is just so high-intensity on this song his flow feels a little bit faster too like he's just trying to pack so many words into his verses and they're actually a few moments where some sound effects are added in and post to sort of add a little bit of character and I guess a background and submerse avala tease - what nas is saying on the song of course they're funny and clever lines on here where he says that he needs the green but ur yard he's not talking about a yard you how about 100 grand and the song it ain't hard to tell the ending here I mean it was a single that came out that help promote NAS and helped him get where he was and it is a great track but it's not you know I guess a that conclusive of an ending although I guess it is probably lyrically more than it is musically it still does feel like a very heart pounding single with a lot of power it's not really like a goodbye or anything like that and and that's the thing about this record it's it's not a lengthy heady concept album or anything like that we're still talking about an era of hip hop here that while we look back at it lyrically and we appreciate it for how skilled it was in that regard hip hop advanced so much further in the next two decades when it comes to production and and musical qualities which with that stylistic shift of course we lost a bit of an emphasis on lyrics but I still think there are artists out there who are lyrical and do go that extra lyrical mile if you look for them the Golden Age of hip hop the 80s era of hip hop was so rudimentary in a lot of ways and the 90s wasn't too far past it when you sort of look at it with hindsight and even though this album might not seem as grand as a Tampa butterfly or a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy it's still a supreme benchmark in the world of hip-hop especially when it comes to this decade and it's for one reason and one reason only in my opinion all of the slang and the descriptors that we typically use to describe an incredibly talented emcee an incredibly talented rapper Nas embodies all of them not only that but he lives up to and in a way this record kind of sets the very standards by which we kind of define great lyricism and great rapping today sure it's not the only album that does that but it's one of the first that comes to mind and even though the production is fantastic and does a lot a whole lot with a little this album is a great reminder of when the rapper was the storyteller the rapper was the spotlight and and I don't mean just kind of in the way that we see somebody like Drake or future sort of you know as this really famous person who is a celebrity while being a rapper I mean I'm talking about we are hooked into what nas is saying what nas is saying is primarily the focus of the song he doesn't need celebrity he doesn't need infamy in order for you to be hooked into what he's saying order to be engaged with what he's saying all he needed was a microphone and that's about it Anthony Fantana classic review check out this album if you haven't already it's a  great album forever 
4dsfcdje6rA,much to me hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of Miss Patti Smith's horses Patti Smith one of rock music's most revolutionary voices most exciting poets and this is her debut full-length record horses 1975 this record came out years before punk music was a trend but in this year Patti was helping to lay the groundwork for this exciting explosive game-changing genre of music shoulder to shoulder with other artists that were taking more simplistic artsy visceral approaches to rock music bands like The Velvet Underground and it should be known that the Velvet Underground's John Cale produced this record also mc5 of whom Patti Smith's husband was the lead guitarist Fred sonic Smith also the modern lovers the Stooges John Cale also produced for them Richard hell and the voids as well again these are artists that were taking a more visceral approach to rock music for their time a more chaotic approach chaotic sonically chaotic emotionally and on this record Patti and her band came through not with a focus on flashy playing or SuperDuper catchy slick songs but instead poetry passionate musical performances and vocals songs that had a strong element of storytelling and also like some strong philosophical convictions on this record Patti was really trying to make an urgent statement of some sort even if that statement doesn't always ring through very clearly there's just a very great sense of that on almost every single one of these tracks and even though horses is maybe not as explosive sonically as a record light kick out the jams or like raw power what Patti was saying on this record her words on this record make this music just as earth-shattering as any of the music of her contemporaries the importance of Patti Smith's vocals and her lyrics on this record is shown in the fact that her vocals are turned way up in the mix and not really at a detriment to the music give a listen to the opening cut on this record Gloria which is actually a cover odd for a record to start off with a cover song but this is Patti Smith and her bands version of essentially the Van Morrison song that he used to perform when he was with the band them and on the surface of this track when you just read into the lyrics the song seems to be about a man who is sort of lusting after this sweet young thing and this guy has plans to sort of make her mine as he says in lyrics but in Patti's hands this track takes on a totally different meaning with Patti Smith you've got to kind of read beyond the surface level of these lyrics in order to sort of get what she's getting at she's someone who was very much into symbolism and esoteric references but she leaves you enough clues to kind of pull it all together for yourself if you read into her verses enough before I get into the lyrics I do want to say that Patti Smith's vocal performance on this track is fantastic her voice is passionate it's over-the-top it's emotional it's yell P it's intense at times it's animalistic however it starts off very somber and very quiet with a bit of a poem written by Patti where she boldly states that Jesus Christ died for somebody's sins but not mine so here she's open to the idea of sin and sinning but she's rejecting this whole concept of of religious guilt guilt guilt guilt she's embracing this idea of self-determination rejecting these rules rejecting his regulations as she says later in this bit of the poem where all these words being thrown at her by other people saying to her beware beware it's just a way for someone to sort of step in and try to control her life which she just outright shoves away as violently as possible the intro to this track is about self determination and just the freedom to make one's own decisions good or bad and I think that's what the underlying message of gloria is when patty and her band are performing it anyway and this track is also kind of about the excitement of one's own lustful pursuits and also on top of that all of this meaning behind this song kind of an added layer of context something that makes this song even more interesting is the fact that patty is singing it we have this very androgynous sort of image on the cover of this record not really sort of the sexy portrayal most female artists sort of get on their cover art and then we have the same female singing this song that was at once written from the standpoint of a man through all of this this song ends up getting kind of gender bent and playing with the idea of gender as well as sexuality that theme is continued on to the next track of the song Redondo Beach which lyrically was a track that was inspired by an argument that Patti had with her sister that sent her out for the day and she was confused like where is she oh my god but instead on the song we get this starting point very similar starting point but eventually it ends up with this person seems like they're looking for their lover and they go down to Redondo Beach and they're kind of hanging around the shore and then eventually their lover because of suicide a suicidal decision that this person made the body washes up on the beach and all of these people are like oh my god pretty freaking dark and morbid especially considering that the instrumental on this track has kind of an off kilter just fruity reggae vibe to it that a lot of American bands that were sort of doing this proto-punk thing weren't necessarily embracing it's definitely a bit of a left-field kind of thing for Patty and her band to be sort of you know doing what they were doing on this record with this instrumental reggae was definitely in full swing by this point but Patty and her band got to it before the punks would end up getting to it in the late 70s and sort of embraced it through like all these second wave ska bands as well as groups like The Clash and all that and I just love the groove on this song - moving on to the next track on here Birdland this is the album's first lengthy cut standing at nine minutes and Patty takes this opportunity to tell a pretty vivid and detailed story of a man's first moments of Solitude after the conclusion of his father's funeral and this track is for me it just kind of seems like this moment when this man are really anybody it's like about that moment of initial impact when it finally just hits you that you're never going to see this person again and your brain goes crazy trying to rationalize that the whole concept of this track is actually pulled from a passage of Peter Reach's book of dreams hope I'm pronouncing his last name correctly and this track is a lot like many other songs on here that are also inspired by other poems other writers dreams as well as personal experiences and each one of them whether patty has experienced them or not she sort of takes them and puts a different spin on them in order to sort of make them an interesting song topic and she pretty much does that one track after the other now Birdland I wouldn't say it has the most engaging instrumental I mean that's really kind of a one of the downsides of this record the instrumental sometimes are just okay but I think that's mostly because it's it's really just all about Patty during moments like this and that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're going to get something out of this track and a few other tracks on here especially the longer ones you've really got to tune into what patty is saying because there's a lot of viscera in the way she delivers the poetry on this record if you're looking for the excitement if you're looking for the oomph on these tracks you've got to tune in to the stories that patty is telling you've got to tune in to the way she is delivering her lyrics on these tracks songs like free money though are a little more direct and hard-hitting this track has a beautiful piano opening and I love the way the drums and the guitar speed up toward the very intense finish of this track really catchy refrain on the song free money and the lyrics are beautiful as well sort of about growing up poor and just wanting money to get things and fix things and have that peace of mind of just being a to help your loved ones and just live a drama and worryfree life there are references to just having dreams of winning the lottery on this track as well as also just stealing money because that's just how dire the need for it is and because of Patti's upbringing just the idea of not having money in the idea of being poor and money less it's an emotional nerve as does the song Kimberly which is a bit of an ode to her youngest sister and the song is kind of two-sided it begins really beautiful and and kind of like a another moment on this record where Patti lyrically is exploring this moment of impact of I guess the first time you're sort of holding this new young life and it just kind of hits you like a ton of bricks and just all your love for this little human being just sort of rushes at you but then toward the end of the song we're sort of seeing Patti clutching her baby sister running out of a barn because the barn has been struck by lightning and it's on fire and there's bats flying everywhere it's actually pretty horrifying at the moment sort of that that feeling of love for this little baby is established and then later in the song that love is sort of put to the test as Patti has to with a snap decision in a moment of danger sort of save this child from death because if she wasn't there being a full-grown adult or a full-grown person being able to sort of carry that baby out of that dangerous situation that baby would have died right there protecting life from harm in the midst of traumatic events and just the power of love to me is sort of what this track is all about and the song break it up is another fantastic track on here not only because I think the instrumental is great the soaring guitar on the hook here is beautiful and reminds me a lot of what bands like television would be doing a few years down the road on records like Markie Moon but also the really esoteric and kind of morbid Lear that deal in sort of angels on here another kind of weird moment on this record where Patti is giving us like this really strong religious reference or just reference to spirituality but at the beginning of the record sort of again rejects that whole guilt via sin whole kind of thing but still the lyrics on this record even though they are a little esoteric they are very stirring as is the case on the next song land which is another very long cut on here nine minutes long and the riff on this track if you give a listen will be very familiar because it's not really that different from the song Gloria it's actually a bit of a reprieve in a way though they don't come out and say it or sing it or reference it in any other direct way then this riff but when I caught Pattie live earlier this year playing horses from front to back they actually started singing the Gloria hook over this song kind of bring the whole record together and the intro to this track of the the moment where she is singing horses horses horses horses as I was giving this record multiple lessons just kind of reef Amelia rising myself with it to do this review it actually hit me like a ton of bricks like that that moment is very obviously a point of reference for savages when they did the freaking song husbands and I love that song and I don't know why it wasn't apparent to me regardless this track is really paddy kind of tying this whole record up in a sense it's like all the intense emotions that have been building up thus far on this record all coming out and this really visceral track not only is the instrumental explosive but Patty's words and the story told on this record are really explosive as well we have a bit of text toward the beginning of this track of this protagonist named Johnny getting into this sort of fight very physical very violent I believe it's a William S Burroughs reference but then from this violent outburst we have this protagonist bringing us through a series of events dealing in drugs and violence and just she your insanity even a moment where he is like at a venue where this band is playing called the Twista let's and there's actually quite a few rock and roll references on here not just with the riff but also a big Little Richard reference in the lyrics here where she's a sort of referencing I do in the wah tootsie and the mashed potato and Patty essentially pushes this protagonist through there's the series of rapid-fire events just hitting us with one idea and just kind of one scary freakish or very fun thing after the next it kind of reminds me of some of the long word of your tracks from The Velvet Underground back in the day like a sister ray or something like that but a little more well groomed a little more clean and and sort of put together and this tractor sort of shows how great of a poet Patti Smith is and how great she is when it comes to just pulling words together in a very explosive way and delivering them as if the the situation is actually just happening right there in front of her and she's trying her best to describe it to you as this instrumental is banging you away in the background it's a crazy freaking track and again I think it pulls the whole record together because the album kind of starts off with this moment where we're talking about through you know sort of this that song Gloria we're talking about self-determination and we're talking about just kind of breakneck decisions and sort of being in this state of apathy and and boredom and just like oh just this sheer lack of satisfaction and all of a sudden this situation presents itself and when that situation does present itself to jump into something that seems like opportune or seems like hey that would be way more fun way more interesting way more awesome than what the hell I'm doing now than this boring party then this original sin crap I'm going to go for it however patty knows full well even at this point her career that sometimes these risky decisions come at a cost especially this stage of her career where she's seen so many people who she came up with in music pass away and when I caught her live she openly said that that's what the final final song on this record is is really all about it is a moment of mourning at the end of this record it's a bit of poetry talking about not only this this moment of loneliness at night where Patti is sort of searching for this kind of outlet for this release for just a moment of I guess solace in the midst of all this misery but the very end of this song ends with a line where she is saying I think it's sad it's much too bad our friends can be with us today and it's sort of just a reflection on those people who she is lost at this point in a way this record is kind of a bit of a reflection on that whole idea of human misery of death and sort of that pain that we experience in our lives really whether we're making horrible decisions or not and then trying to douse that pain and something else forget about it or just escape from it either by doing something stupid or like in the case of the song bird land just facing it head-on and really just dealing with it and just kind of sitting through that emotional pain sitting through that realisation that you've lost someone really important to you forever and it's on that really morbid note that the album just ends and leaves us to kind of reflect on the past four years so minutes that it threw at us which was really just a torrent of all these emotions dealing in money and drugs and family and friends and people who were in love with and self and self-determination it's a lot to take in and a lot of the stuff on this record is actually very familiar very everyday kind of stuff however Patty's very intense words make reflecting on these things very worthwhile and very important because I think she reframes them with such passion and with such intensity that it's like wow man I've never thought about how important all of this stuff that's around me all the time that I just sort of take for granted that I just sort of take as normal I've forgot about how really important all this stuff is and that's kind of a horse's is all about to me it's I think one of the punkest things ever and not just because of just how in-your-face it is and how brash it is but because of how introspective it is in an oddly explosive way Patti delivers her lyrics on this record with such passion that when I'm listening to it I mean my ears perk up instantly because it's just like wow this person's so passionate and so emotional right now what she's saying has got to she's got to be saying something and I often get caught up in her emotions on this record and I really got a caught up in her emotions live even more than I typically do when I give this album a listen yeah she had me crying live she had me crying so I'm just going to put it at that I'm just going to put it that give this record to listen if you have not already it's a fantastic album really a poignant record is how I will put it it's a poignant fucking record Anthony Fantana Patti Smith horses transition have you given the circuit of listen you should have I love you forever 
DVcxvDjmL3E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Senya Rubino's album black tarry cat Senya Rubino's is a New York singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and she is now following up her I believe it was self release but it ended up on bada bing records maybe wasn't self-released debut full-length record magic trix dropped in 2012 and from bada bing records she signed straight to indie heavyweight anti records which this new album is on she had a couple of solid singles leading up to the release of this thing lonely lover and black stars my buddy Jeremy actually did an interview with her not too long ago about her songwriting process and the creation of this new record and I was just looking forward to it's all I could say and I'm pretty happy with the results I'm mostly impressed with the really cool mix of influences that are flowing throughout this record they're moments where this album comes off very funky soulful smooth reads to me a little bit like maybe some Erykah Badu or some contemporary R&B like from the 90s or the 2000s maybe a little bit of Lauryn Hill but there are other moments on here where there's clearly an influence coming from singer songwriters such as maybe Fiona Apple or maybe people from the indie set like Fiery Furnaces a little bit of tune-yards though maybe not a direct influence I think miss Ruby knows here shares quite a bit in common with tune-yards I think stylistically they pull from a lot of the same places a lot of very beat centric and afro centric music and there were some pretty meaty beats on this record no doubt there's a hip-hop influence going on in the production while the instrumentation a lot of the time sounds very organic it's very snapped looped tight and rhythmic like a hip-hop beat would be and the production is a little rough to the point where I think it sort of takes away from the songs slightly maybe the vocals are a little muddier than I would like them to be just wish the e cueing and the recording on them was a little more chrisp especially as the vocals are occasionally layered and harmonized on top of one another and the slight muddiness becomes even more apparent some of the synth patches here and there I think could have been better especially some of the farty synth bass lines but generally the rough production gives a lot of the instrumentation here so nice grit especially the drums which are very punchy like on the song Black Stars where the drums are mixed with this really great piano phrasing that are looped over and over very tightly doomed but didn't bend intend very funky loops and the sense that end up later in the track along with the hand percussion definitely adds a nice extra bit of texture and not every moment feels like a beat I mean you know we have these tracks like Black Stars and then on the flip side the song just like is kind of a piece of punked-out lo-fi his hard rock that sounds like it could have come from the early days of the White Stripes the upright bass loops and the kind of tinny keyboards on the song I won't say are pretty impressive too definitely is some ear grabbing sounds there and the composition here is just hectic the latter half of it sounds completely different from the first half the groove is so awkward the vocals are kind of wild to the point where they're slightly off-putting and the tense piano phrases and the woodwinds on the closing track here are beautiful too a very colorful the odd time signature on this track definitely makes this track stand out apart from many others in the tracklisting and the song also features one of the most fun vocal performances on the entire record dipping a little bit into spoken word on occasion and then we have a bustling funky beat like Mexican chef you know I can really go into each instrumental here because every one has its own little quirks flaws and flavors some of which I love some of which I'm sort of lukewarm on but but mostly hits hits for me the grooves on these tracks are sharp even when I'm not like totally in love with a song I I have to give it to the grooves and there's some nice musical variety on this record there's a spectrum as I was saying you know you have tracks that are very smooth very soulful lovely gentle like don't want to be and then you have see them which is just a little fringe it's a little odd and slightly grading and as I dive into the album more and more I'm equally impressed with the lyrics that are brought to the table - whether that be tracks that are diving into love or a song like just like I which seems to deal in family and family traits I get the sense that she's picking up bad habits or characteristics from people who she's close with like in her bloodline or something I can't quite tell but there is a really standout couple of lines where she says that her teeth she smiles with them but she also bites you with them her lips she kisses with them but she also lies with them the song Mexican chef is about brown people who she blatantly refers to them as in the track and it's basically about how brown people are kind of the gears that are turning in America keeping things going you have a Chinese restaurant you have an Italian restaurant you have a French restaurant and who's working there behind the scenes keeping things going making sure things are working it's brown people and the track isn't about stereotyping or shoving people in these remedial positions and saying hey you should be here you should stay there it's more about respecting the fact that because these people take on these jobs life is probably easier for you I mean having worked ten years in food service myself I can attest to pretty much everything that's being sung in this song and themes of race and politics it seems that Senya is not shying away from them on this project at all they come up again and again and again at a myriad of different angles on the song right it's almost as if the the she's being just sucked in and and almost depressed or destroyed by the pressures of the world she's talking about the world blowing up on this track and by the end of the song wishing she was a time traveler the song see them there's this amazing refrain where she sings how do you spell angry brown girl there's definitely a seething fiery passion to do something or change things or just a rebel against these pressures throughout a lot of these songs on the song laugh clown she's singing about how when the world sort of pushes her down makes life harder she feels like a clown term someone usually throws on themselves when they feel like the butt of a joke or someone who's being just battered by the world but she takes this opportunity to apply this label and then say well now that I feel like a clown I'm going to laugh and the song kicks off in an interesting way with her singing about how she hasn't plucked her eyebrows in a while one day she's gonna let her mustache grow back in and the idea of vanity and sort of how you look comes back on the song won't say as well we're not only is she singing about losing yourself or losing your identity and becoming obsessed with beauty in the midst of selfie culture but she's also bringing up these black features and evidence of someone being ashamed of them in a way because she's singing about not just curly hair but hair that's been fried to the point where it's straight skin that's been bleached till it's brighter so there are a lot of pretty deep seed and very personal issues being explored throughout this LP and they're all done pretty tastefully maybe occasionally with a very colorful or overacted vocal here and there but again my primary issue with the vocals is just I think they could have been mixed in and eq'd a little bit better that's really the Achilles heel with this record I think it's the production but still despite that I think the great songs the great performances the interesting instrumental ideas the very funky beats and grooves all shine through I just can't help but think of how much more palatable Senya as music would be and not just to me but I mean to a wider audience if just the production was a little bigger a little more vibrant just had a bit more of a professional edge to it this sounds a little DIY and I can totally appreciate that because despite the fact that it sounds like this project wasn't done in a big-budget studio they certainly got a lot done and they've put together some very interesting musical ideas and work together some very intricate details especially on the tracks where the the grooves and the beats are like an odd time signatures I think this album has got a lot going for it I wish the flow was a little better - it really does kind of feel like a collection of tracks the closing track doesn't exactly tie things up all that well and all the interlude cuts I wouldn't really say add to the album experience all that much and again the production I think could have been improved but everything else about this project is I really don't have that many complaints about very impressed and looking forward to what zhenya brings to us in the future her feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best one should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if you happen to disagree with this review black tea recap hope you're doing well eat some fruits and veggies fruits and veggies stay hydrated and have a nice day forever 
4WUd8aqZ6UY,ladies and gentlemen that the mixtape review y'all been waiting for anybody talking about mr. Joseph purple they're gonna be a good girl while daddy reviews this Joey purp album yeah be a good girl hey everyone dogs me food Tana here the Internet's puppies not a puppy and it's time for a review of the new Joey purp mixtape ah drops up-and-coming Chicago rapper Joey purp this is his second full-length mixtape I believe following up 2012's purple tape you might have heard Joey before on Donnie trumpet and the social experiment album surf year or so ago also on Vick menses in a net tape I could say it like that and this is exactly the kind of mixtape that I've been waiting for this year an up-and-comer a new face with just a solid impressive breakout project somebody who is coming through and just making you look forward to the future because we're getting some new blood in here and they're making some good music 2016 while it has been a pretty good musical year a lot of the conversation has been dominated by comebacks and big mainstream releases and and very well established artists shout out to a little little yadi though it's called I Minnesota and Joey purp with this tape is giving us good reason to kind of shift focus a little bit now this tape features some pretty versatile rapping some decent lyrics some very high-quality production some of the best beats I've heard all year honestly the the record kicks off with what I would refer to as a two piece and a biscuit the song morning sex which just has three quality parts to it I love the booming soulful beat with the hot horn samples that sounds great Joey perps very steady flow his charismatic delivery what are you doing dog I like his voice a lot its commanding its attention-grabbing it's a little raspy it's heavy and then we have the lyrics which are pretty straight for word but tell a personal tale of Joey coming from the city of Chicago he's been on both sides of the burner the lyrics are a little redundant as he kind of heavy handedly repeats the refrain the hook again and again and again and but the track is a decent taster and and sets a bit of a stage Joey kind of reflecting on all the lives that he's seen lost on these streets of Chicago's since he was young but then after this track which kind of sets us up for a very soulful and thoughtful rap record we get a total mood shift on the track girls with this very funky clunky danceable beat that sort of throws it back to I don't know some clips some Neptunes style production the track isn't deep but it's just kind of funny dumb fun I loved Joey's flow on this track and it's just kind of a silly song about hey the girls hear this song they're dancin we're havin a good time it's a sexy and it's a silly and it's also a quirky pop rap track and chance the rapper's verse on this cut is very conversational and playful to the whole bit about tall girls and small girls and midsize girls you bad that was pretty hilarious so already in these first two tracks I'm hearing Joey being able to make some of these more thoughtful soulful passionate cuts that are personal and kind of introspective and also these cuts that are very catchy I wouldn't say commercial because they still kind of have an alternative edge to them but they're certainly going for a more poppy angle the song money in bitches despite its kind of cliche title is very self-aware we titled that as the track sort of seems to be from Joey's perspective about this cycle of greed and materialism and this track also features another heavy soulful beat with some great horn samples and Mick Jenkins actually appears for a verse too and he comes off super passionate thoughtful as usual his verse is a little Meteor though Joey once again kind of delivers this hook that he repeats ad nauseam there's more hook than there is verse when it comes to Joey it's on the song when I'm gone that he really starts rapping and these kind of mini verses that are interrupted by the really quick shots of an R&B vocal lead from Teddy Jackson his appearance is actually pretty great he brings the song of vibe that feels like this is just a classy commercial rap track from the aughts there's definitely an early Kanye vibe I think on some of these tracks the track is short it's one of the shorter in the track listing here at two minutes and change but it is a contemplative cut as Joey seems to be openly questioning the system and the powers that be and whether they're actually doing any good for the people of Chicago on the song photo booth we switch again to a poppy or catch your track very hooky beat and there's actually a bit of a reference to evict mensis song in the hook here vic mensa appears on the project later the song umad featuring Kanye West I believe and some of joeys versus some of his lines on this cut are pretty funny they're charismatic there's a lot of non sequiturs to his verses I like the beat and I like his flow but at this point on the album I'm just hoping for a little bit more of some kind of lyrical or topical focus this hook about this girl who will have sex off the gram for a photo op it's just not really leaving that strong of an impression on me but I guess I should have expected it at least a little I don't know lack of focus on this project given that our star of the show has like double vision like literally on the cover but here and there throughout these tracks Joey does loop back into some familiar topics whether that be the violence on the streets of Chicago or his brother who's in jail he refers to his city as a jail itself with this cracked voice flow that sounds a little bit like Kendrick Lamar on the very next cut the song corners much and this is a delivery that he returns to once again on the song God body one of the hardest cuts in the track listing here then add a no where with the song boom we get this Latin jazz sample which is kind of odd but it's unfortunate that lyrically the track doesn't really offer much of anything not only is it just lined with all these really dumb silly pickup lines and consciously so I think Joey's trying to make a silly track here but his kind of mo'ne flow on this cut I thought was just a little obnoxious to be honest the production on this track I think steals attention away from Joey because it's a really adventurous B and I do admire him for hopping on this instrumental for how left-field it is despite not really bringing that much in the way of interesting lyrics but then on the song kids gets a little worse I would say this is my least favorite track and the track listing here it's an auto tune cut over a big booming beat with some really obvious lyrics saying that uh kids and drugs like a bad mix and again it's another hook it's another refrain that he just hands out ad nauseam I wish that we were just getting more verses than we are hook on some of these tracks it occasionally feels like Joey is kind of patting these tracks out however one thing I do got to give to Joey on this cut is that his raspy voice and his very passionate very I I guess I want to say a muscular delivery still shines through on the auto-tune and this track doesn't sound like your average Auto crooner ballad or anything like that you know he didn't auto-tune track but did it in a way where it felt like he wasn't directly ripping off anybody and he could have gone that route you know he could have done a future track a young thug track a Kanye track but he didn't you know he sort of kept it his own thing despite the fact that it didn't really read to me as enjoyable the tape finishes off relatively strong with the song winner's circle and the following cut to a winner's circle is a pretty personal track it seems Joey once again going back to those themes of his city and violence and and his personal struggle vic mensa comes in and reinforces those themes with a pretty decent verse overall I would say it's a pretty solid project you know it has its flaws but it's good enough to the point where I'm going to be anticipating the next thing that Joey purp does the verses are kind of scant occasionally the production outshines Joey some of his bars are shallow and I think he could use more in the way of solid topics and following through on those topics but then again this thing has some catchy hooks some good flows great production solid features I think that's gonna be it for this review starring my friend sushi oh what a good baby what a good baby don't go nowhere don't go nowhere don't be a don't be a runaway don't be a runaway I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this project Tran Oh get this hair off my head get it off my head have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

cAUErg7-dGg,my great hand here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new olga belle record tempo brooklyn via moscow singer-songwriter and producer olga bell she is now on what i believe is her third full-length studio album you might also know her because she's performed in the past with indie pop titans the Dirty Projectors and this new album of hers is an one little-endian records and listening to this thing i have to admit i was not familiar with olga belle previously but i was pleasantly surprised by this album you know much like the expression on her face on the front cover which just just in itself even before i listen to any of the music i found to be a breath of fresh air it's rare that you actually see the artists featured on the album on the front cover looking like super happy or excited you know usually they're trying to look mean or mad or sexy or you know just like too cool to be bothered now as far as the music on this thing it is a synthetic smorgasbord of various shades of art pop and electronic music it's kind of all over the place but the stark production and Olga's very subtle sort of subdued and intimate vocals are enough of a common thread to link all of these songs together but the influences on this record at least to me did feel pretty clear throughout the project think of the knife so there's definitely a synth pop vibe on here there's a techno vibe on here there is an endemic house track featuring vocalist Sarah Lucas and given that this thing is on one little endian records it's not surprising to find that there's a pretty healthy Bjork influence on this album too and given how textured and kind of fractured the beats are on this project I'd say there's a glitch pop vibe on here too I would recommend this to Holly Herndon fans maybe like Laurie Anderson fans now even though the production is pretty puzzling a lot of the time I think the tunes and lyrics on this thing are relatively straightforward on numerous tracks here Olga Bell is pretty blunt about what she's singing about and blunt about her feelings - you know sometimes thrown a lot of expletives in there to sort of you know get her emotional message across right from the beginning of the album the song power-user which is typically a term put onto somebody who is very proficient in using or sort of fixing updating computers but instead she uses this term power user to describe someone who she seems to be in some kind of relationship with who is really manipulative and controlling a bit of a taker if you will and there are a handful of other tracks on here that actually feature really catchy refrains like the song zone get in the zone connect the on your own or the song stomach it where over and over we hear in the song kind of the mantra is you know you have a taste for it but do you have the stomach for it and then there's the song doppio which I enjoy quite a bit despite the fact that it is criminally short at just 2 minutes and change but on this song even Olga herself seems to be pretty pleased with how quirky and odd the tune the layers of harmonized vocals in the and the beat that she conjured here came out to be because there are several moments on this cut where she is audibly giggling in the middle of her performance and there's actually even a beat build-up at one point in the track where it kind of sounded like for a moment first but second she was gonna bust a rhyme and I actually wish that ended up happening you know this record is left-field but it's fun and Olga is audibly having fun when performing and sort of delivering this album and it just doesn't take itself too seriously we have with the song randomness a hard-nosed techno beat and with the lyrics here Olga describes just the unpredictability of life using terminology that kind of brings up imagery of just flashing lights and colors kind of overwhelming you I also think kind of the weird awkward bassy synths complement the very rigid be incredibly well the closer though America is kind of underwhelming I would say with this track the handful of other tracks on here there really is a lack of development like there could have been more to these very odd productions there could have been more to this album as it's just under 40 minutes or so I would say what this album does best is leaves me wanting more like with almost every track but there are a couple other issues that I have with the album one being that Olga's vocals I think are a little one-dimensional I I just wish her performances were a little more lively on some of these cuts it definitely would have changed the album up a bit though I do appreciate the appearance from Sara Lucas she definitely gave the album a little bit more momentum when she popped onto the track and most of the moments though when Olga does reach into her upper register or really kind of digs deep and ups the volume with her performances she gets such a York vibe coming from her vocals and from her inflections that it's kind of distracting and I guess that brings me to my second issue that occasionally she drowns in her influences most notably on tracks like ata or on regular which is a track that is anything but regular and while it does start off sounding like Abuna I like how the song sort of develops and unravels as it moves forward and kind of loses itself and just turns into this really abstract electronic instrumental I admired that about it I think it's a decent record if you're looking for some art pop if you're looking for some abstract electronic music with some prominent vocals I definitely recommend this any of those artists that I mentioned previously I think this is going to have something for you for sure but again I just feel like there's potentially more to olga is doing on this record and I think she didn't fully explore every song and every option that she had but those are really my only complaints generally I think the album is very good and Olga through this record has certainly become an artist who I look forward to hearing more from in the future I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die Olga Bell tempo good record give it a shot have a nice day drink your water stay hydrated eat your fruits and veggies forever 
Ar0B5Qcpqgc,hi everyone don't really find Crisco here the Internet's busiest music and it's time for a review of the new Vic Mensa EP that there's a lot going on vic mensa is a Chicago rapper and songwriter former member of the band kids these days and he broke solo back in 2013 with his inane tape release and while he's gotten a lot of attention since the release of that tape he's yet to really leave much of an impression on me in my opinion he's he's always seen just half way to making something interesting and it seemed like he was getting farther and farther away from doing that once he started dropping more features and more singles that just had a way more commercial appeal the track feel that is certainly a great viral hit for him but the the song down on my luck the pop and hip house fusion of that track combined with a really bad singing from Vic just could not get into this cut and that no chill single that he just did with Skrillex not too long ago week but I was pretty surprised with this new EP over here is seems like Vic is showing way more potential than usual now this thing is just seven tracks but this project features some of Vic's best material yet some of his worst so far to the song dynasty is a solid intro track I like Vic's voice in his delivery on this cut even though the song doesn't come through the really hard-hitting beat and gives Vic a lot of space it's very sparse instrumental toward the beginning of the track he commands attention really well on the cut and when the be eventually explodes with some very basic and heavy percussion that's a little trap inspired it actually goes off really well lyrically Vic is trying to paint a bit of a picture here he's been around for a while now but it's almost as if he's introducing himself to us for the first time in a way he raps about his city Chicago one line that I liked was when he was talking about there were days before people refer to it as chiraq and then Chief Keef blew up and now it's a drill but then the track eventually devolves into a bunch of rock nation shoutouts since you just got signed to jay-z's label they're actually quite a few of those on this EP there's some decent similes and metaphors and vixx lyrics but again the thing that I'm most impressed with is his delivery his hunger on this track is very steady flow and I could tell as he's rapping this track he's really feeling every word and the more intense and passionate 16 shots comes right after which is in all respects a protest song a song not only about police violence but the tensions that the police force are having with black communities and black lives matter protesters not specifically naming the movement but you know you know the recent history that Vic is referencing here on this track citing the the deaths of Eric garner and and others - and the outro is really chilling which goes into a very grave detail discussing a particular police shooting these two tracks so far are great the cover super gritty seems like a big image change for Vic and at this point I'm just ready to hear the rest of this gray EP but then the EP essentially makes its downward ascent into a series of incredibly lackluster songs the song danger whose refrain sounds like it was written by a really edgy bar band that performs every Saturday night at the chicken wing Hut and they perform a mix of new metal originals and some of Metallica's greatest hits you know me I like the danger the singing on this track is not good I don't get the appeal of Vic singing still his singing voice doesn't really sound like it's improved by any stretch of the imagination and then his lyrics on this cut start getting super general to the point where there are some bars or I guess a few flows here that remind me of Big Sean except I I will give vic mensa a compliment here and say that he does have a a more bite to his delivery you know he sounds like if Big Sean could actually sell being tough but still man the Steve Aoki line on this track and the in the og MACO line on this track the best thing about the track was the instrumental which features some kind of weird grainy vocals that reminded me like the first Crystal Castles record the song newb a super cheap sounds like what could have been a Travis Scott song if it had better production you know I like these kind of dreary woozy strange auto-tune rap ballads but they kind of need the sound to make it all work and this track does not have the sound and the song liquor locker is even worse I knew that I was going to hate this track the moment I heard the guitar right at the start and it's kind of one of these funky contemporary R&B cuts sounds like something that could have been on the new ty dolla sign record except it just pales in comparison to the tracks that were on that album vic mensa is one of those artists who feels like he needs do everything and i don't know why is it because he doesn't know what to do he doesn't have a particular sound to stick to or a particular idea or narrative or theme or story or whatever he does a little bit of everything okay so he's not really great at any one thing as a result instrumentally and melodically I think the track is sound but the incredibly insipid lyrics combined with the bad singing and the auto-tune on the singing just make the track unbearable now then we have the very jazzy and slick shades of blue where we actually come back to some incredibly thoughtful lyrics some of my favorite verses on the EP here turn up there's some pretty powerful bars on this track about dirty water in Flint Michigan poor communities being the first to be hurt when budget cuts come around the sound of this track is so borrowed it sounds like a mix of Jay Cole and Drake like if Cole was on the verse and Drake was on a few bars here and there but did the chorus most and then we have some lackluster bars in this track like I'm a prodigy in these prodigies and even though Vic does a great job of pointing out poetically some current events that are very important and should be in the public consciousness the the entire track just kind of boils down to this really cliche conclusion of yeah I care about these things I'm sort of down for the cause mentally but I don't donate any money not spending money on the movement instead I'm in the strip club spending money on the the movement of that ass it's just another one of those I'm flawed I'm flawed I'm flawed tracks you know it's like I want to be good but I can't be good but like what's stopping you from being good like no explanation it's like the personal shortcomings he's laying everything on keep him from actually analyzing his shortcomings in a meaningful and compelling way then there's the title track the closing track of this EP and I guess in a sense it does wrap the album up and it does live up to the title as the entire track just kind of feels like an update of everything that's been happening to vic mensa up until this point from when he was in kids these days and the band folded and that you know really hurt him and just kind of rocked his life a little bit too getting signed to jay-z there's even a point where he goes into a weird detail about getting into like a physical altercation with a girl that he was with and I think he ended up like doing a little choke on her the neck as dirty as some of the laundry is here that Vic exposes whether it be drug addictions or trying his hardest to sort of navigate his way through the music industry and build a solid career the track it's only going to be compelling to people who are invested in Vic's come up up until this point you know if you've been a victim you'll care about this track if this is your first exposure to Vic and all the previous tracks didn't wow you then I don't see why this song is going to be of interest to you he put a lot of heart into it but then it's kind of like at the end of a movie where something horrible happens to a character and you're just kind of left emotionless because up until that point the film had done a bad job of actually making you invest emotionally in the people who the film starred again a couple of my favorite vic mensa tracks have managed to make it out of this EP I see more potential in Vic than I ever have before however this thing is just so inconsistent it lacks identity and there are a couple not really good songs on air it seems like Vic really wants to have one foot in the conscious world and one foot in the pop rap world and I think there are some rappers that that play that balancing act well I can't say I think Vic is playing it all that well here I [Music] think the conscious tracks come ahead of the poppier tracks on this project I think they're the most riveting cuts on the EP and hopefully Vic pursues that in the future a little harder because I again I think it's where I see the most potential with him but you know even if you were to sort of put that down and concentrate simply on the pop rap tracks maybe he'll get better at that all I'm seeing is just a lack of progress with him trying to spread himself too thin and do everything here I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die drink some water eat some veggies have a nice dude vic mensa there's a lot going on watch another

x8VimAqOqZc,hi everyone Mega Man here Internet's busy history it's in there it's time for you a new stroke CP past present future present past this is a new EP from the famed pop rock and indie rock outfit known as The Strokes they are two albums deep into their comeback now and obviously an EP as well which is coming three years after what I think is probably the worst album in The Strokes discography however The Strokes returning to putting out music has not been all bad recently there was that Julian Casablancas and the voids album tyranny and this is a pretty polarizing album four-strokes fans a lot of people hated this record however me the needle drop in general we dug this record we dug it it was surprisingly experimental very textured adventurous some of the parts a little difficult to digest not for everybody an acquired taste but if you're looking for some noise rock that's kind of slick and catchy and is actually a little out there you know this isn't a safe record then give this thing a shot now again while this album is not for everyone this new EP over here I have no idea who this is for we have three new tracks here and a remix of one of the tracks on the EP and the batch of songs The Strokes offer here feels like an odd mix of some of the experimental elements that came from that Julian Casablancas and the voice record paired awkwardly with the the the same kind of slick swagger attitude that you expect from a Strokes project and I just can't say it sounds like a winning combination Julian Casablancas sticks out like a sore thumb on a lot of these tracks and not in a good way because he just sounds like he's off his rocker he sounds way more while old and out there in left field then the music is a lot of the time either that or he just sounds really disheveled or like he just doesn't know what he's doing which is typically the case when you catch the strokes live usually Julian Casablancas is visually inebriated in some kind of fashion and as a result it does make the live shows an interesting spectacle but usually the band sounds pretty sober and you know just really together on record and performance you know in the studio not really the case here as Julian's vocals and his vocal melodies on this cut feel really aimless and like he's just doing this weird the directionless moaning thing the chorus isn't bad I like all the menacing layers of guitars and since on this intro cut but the verses are awful the loose messy instrumentation does not sound good at all and much like many cuts off of comedown machine this this cut drag-queen has a really awkward New Wave element to it that just the strokes cannot they cannot grab ahold of what makes for a good New Wave track Julian's vocals also sound weirdly chipmunk down this track almost like they were pitched up a little bit can't can't quite tell because there's so many things about this cut including the vocals that just seemed off in some kind of way and the song oblivious isn't much better it's a little sweeter on the surface I think instrumentally it sounds like your run-of-the-mill Strokes track but when you actually get down with performance and the writing it's it's such a mess number one this thing has the worst guitar lead of 2016 worst lead guitar on the verse 2016 this little - note riff and then you sort of bring it up a few semitones or back down a few semitones gets so old so fast no compelling melodies on the verses here either again the chorus is ok but it doesn't make up for how lackluster almost every other thing about this song is and Julian's vocals on this track are even worse there are parts during the song where he is straining to reach into his upper register so hard that I can't tell whether he's singing or screaming for help because he's being strangled and this gets it's worse during the final passage of the song where Julian is essentially singing and I'm going to do my best impression here really a vocal performance that makes Yoko Ono sound tame now the song threat of joy the song doesn't just threaten to be decent it's it's actually somewhat decent and I wouldn't say it's the best track here because it does anything especially good in a lot of ways it feels like your run-of-the-mill stroke song maybe a little loose and rough around the edges kind of like a track that maybe during the band's first two albums period would have been a demo and they could have kind of cleaned it up and then performed it on one of those first two records and it would have become one of the less memorable songs in the track listing but I guess it doesn't do any of the stuff that makes two previous songs horrendous that kind of makes it a plus and then we have this completely unnecessary remix of the worst song on the EP and that's just the EP guys I'm not really sure what to make of this batch of tracks is this where the strokes are going next now in theory I don't think it's a bad thing with The Strokes are experimenting they're long overdue for a sound change I think you know they've been at it for a while now and they have been evolving in a way with each new album however this could be the worst moment of their evolution so far if this EP and the sounds and the the vibe of this EP were to develop into a full-length album and that worries me I'm going to be leaving this EP with a strong to to a light three transition have you given the CPU listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and have a nice day The Strokes new EP forever

Myles clairee he is the founder of sound way records one of the most interesting and eclectic record labels out there on the market at this very moment they specialize in music that is really outside of the purview of the West dipping into records and artists and compilations from ghana nigeria panama colombia and many more you can check out the many compilations and original album releases that they have put out lately that feature rock and funk and Psyche rock and soul music even high life music from across the world and we're basically unbe talking in this podcast about the history of the label the latest releases the older releases what exactly what what exactly makes sound way records tick so Myles thanks for coming on man so give me a bit of a rundown exactly how the record label began and you know what was essentially the inspiration behind trying to bring all of this music from other countries to a more Western audience so yeah well I started I guess from just the the need in the want to find obscure records to to put into DJ sets and and mixes that I was making when I was there's something I've been doing since since since I was about 14 years old I guess so I always used to look in the obscure bins the International bins the world music bins at record fairs trying to find reckless debar under the radar not necessarily things that other people were looking for as well as kind of obscurities within you know genres like electronic music and psychedelic rock music and and just sort of kind of join the dots between different musical cultures I started going to West Africa and that's how that at that point is where the label would born I spent time in Ghana especially and also in Nigeria looking for the records that didn't really kind of fit into the established genres that people kind of expected from those countries and records the bands from there were were kind of making that were a sort of a fusion of different styles so trying to find records that would surprise people or or just sort of blow people's minds and and think what really that came from there and then that idea that blueprint was sort of transformed into other countries and we've ended up doing compilations and reissues from East Africa West Africa Asia South America character Caribbean so yeah that's that's how it started really and I mean a lot of the early compilations on the label you're really kind of pulling back decades back into some of the musical histories of these countries and you stumble across these records when you're visiting them but you know what exactly is the process of trying to ready this music for commercial sale in the West on the sound way label I mean Matt I imagine some of these bands whose music you're kind of reissuing on these compilations aren't even around anymore you know how exactly are you getting ahold of some of these artists who show who've made this music well it's Boris process it usually starts by well it always starts by first of all trying to find the music so trying to find as many records from if we're doing a compilation that reflects a country or sometimes a label or a specific kind of period in time then the first thing is just to try and amass as many of those records or listen to as many of those records from that time or that place as possible and that that's always the hardest thing because it's amazing especially when you're looking for the more obscure records the records that weren't necessarily commercial hits because quite often these were found these were pressed in tiny numbers like a couple of hundred or or a thousand and so yeah these that that's the first thing trying to find the music then you have to try and find the artists or the copyright holders and yeah that that is also an incredibly hard thing to do but most of the time you'll always find you'll always find the guys that were making the music the hardest thing is to find the records and even after 15 years of looking for certain records they still haven't surfaced so yeah it's it's it's just a piece by piece kind of bit of detective work really it's it's finding the music finding a clean copy of the music the tape if possible if that doesn't exist a clean record then the people that then the finding out who owns the copyrights sometimes into disputes amongst the the artists about you know if you have a band of six guys who wrote the record there's no information on the label they didn't put that on every label or every covering in seven in some instances and sometimes people wolves will squabble you'll find one guy who was on vocals who claims he wrote the song and then the dude who played the guitar claims he wrote the song and mmm a lot of the time it's very easy and straightforward and a lot easier than a lot of people expect you know most people 90% of people are just happy you want to do it and and they're cool with it sometimes it's a bit more complicated but yeah it's just a you know it's detective work and it's it's laborious and slow and yeah can be tedious at times go into the discovery process a little bit more when you're trying to find music to release on the label I mean you know where exactly are you finding these records is it sort of in a dusty old record store like you would over here or is there something more to it than that well things have changed a lot in 15 years I mean when I started the label nearly 15 years ago there were still a lot of record stores around in some of these countries and there were still there was still a direct link to the 70s and 80s there were there were guys who produced music who and still were actively sort of kind of you know the catalogs were still active in some way and in 15 years a lot has changed a lot of stores have shut down a lot of guys selling records aren't selling records anymore a lot of record dealers from the from Western countries have gone and just bought the whole the whole the whole lot lock stock and barrel up and ass telling setting them on eBay the price of records has gone through the roof a lot of the guys from that era have got a lot older and have stopped and some of them have passed away so it has changed a lot about 15 years ago and even ten seven eight years ago like it was a lot easier to find records and like you say in dusty record stores in market stalls asking taxi drivers if they know any guys with records in the house and you'd sort of go to one house and say oh I know I just threw them out or they're in the lock-up on the other side of town and your button car and you know in some cities like Lagos in Nigeria it's like just three and a half hours in a car and traffic to get from one side of town to the other so a lot of the time there's just spent you know physically in cars and buses and just traveling from one place to another and knocking on doors and yeah just get it coming questioning people about where so-and-so is have you seen that guy I haven't seen him for 15 years old I think he lives in that town go there you know it's again it's it's just laborious kind of piece by piece picking and and and and piecing that piecing the puzzle together so yeah it's but it's incredibly incredibly um what's the word it's incredibly oh my jet legs kicking in it's a it's a good feeling when you know when you when you get to their end of some of these wild goose and the guys there and and up for what you're looking for and has that has the recordings or the records or the tapes and is in is is is down with what you're doing so yeah I mean it sounds like you're continually on this like you said wild-goose chase it's a scavenger hunt yeah it's kind of a musical anthropology exercise in a way also like I say I mean you know 15 years ago a lot of the guys that I was dealing with in some of these countries didn't have an email address or didn't have a cell phone and yeah how quick this process of everyone being online all over the world has has changed things you know like these days at the moment we're doing a compilation we're doing a compilation of a second compilation from Kenya volume 2 of our Kenya special compilation that's coming out later this year and you know a lot of those guys and much easier to contact now everyone in the world is on is on some kind of electronic communication device you know whereas 15 years ago that was not the case it's incredible how how much easier these things have become and also how much more information there is about music just the sheer volume of human endeavor that's gone into cataloging music from all over the world that suddenly up on the internet it's it's again you you forget how in the dark we were about certain recording industries and and and bands and music from around the world only 15 years ago some of these records would show up in record fairs in New York or Paris or London a long way from the countries that they initially started in and they'd just be these little kind of snippets of wild exotic information just sitting there with no story or link to where they came from and who the band was and now so many people have worked so hard to try and piece together all these different scenes and recording catalogs and and and stories and so it is a lot easier these days there's a there's a lot more to go on is it fair to say that technology in some of these countries that you you know have been bringing music back from Kenya and Nigeria Ghana Panama has kind of revolutionized the music listening and the music consumption process over there as it has over here yeah it's some to some extent I think you know it's country by country there's different different stories but yeah I think you know there's much more of especially with younger generations I think that something has changed quite recently there's been a much there's been a bigger interest in younger generations in the in the kind of musical heritage of certain countries but I've just been in Indonesia researching a compilation there and you know there's now a whole generation of guys in their 20s and 30s who are really interested in the music of the 1950s and 60s and 70s and the that just wasn't quite the case like 10 years ago most of the people that were listening to that music were the people that who were living who had lived it the first time around and young guys just weren't that interested it was like their dad's music or their uncle's music or or whatever and so yeah it has changed a lot of places like one of the guys helping us out with research and licensing on the Kenya on the Kenyan special quality record is saying that now in Nairobi there's a you know there's a final record Club that's quite often you know mostly attended by by guys who weren't around in the 70s or even the 80s you know so yeah there's been there's definitely been through technology like you say or online through blogs through this kind of international communication that's come about in the last 10-15 years at a much more invigorated discussion about old music and musical heritage and and how that can influence modern music as well little taneous lee you know you also described this time where the record stores themselves aren't doing too well you know is the IMP is the internet kind of having a negative impact on on the record stores or is it just kind of the aging process and just kind of people not being able to keep it up like they used to that that are kind of making some of these you know bundles of records that were once in stores you know a little harder to find because they're kind of fractured now and all over the place well it's you know to do price a lot of that as well you know the price of old records of every genre especially rare old records it doesn't matter which country they're from whether from the USA or England or Kenya or Thailand or wherever has gone through the roof in the last you know it's become they've become you know almost artifacts rather than rather than just music you know it used to be a stamp it used to be a standard price for an LP or a cassette or a CD and that's changed a lot in the last 10-15 years as people who've started took more and more people who started to collect things and and the price goes up so yeah that's kind of been a sad thing because like old music is in a lot of places sort of unaffordable unless it's sort of you know the rich middle classes or or or international collectors and I suppose the flip side of that is that you know not everybody needs to own the thing you know the music is out there and that's kind of what I hope to do with our stuff is just to make it available it's whether that's on a streaming platform or do you want to download it from you know although although all that the digital stores out there or if you want to own the reissue on the fly on vinyl and pay a little bit more and stick it on the shelf so you know there's there's a variety of different ways to to hear their music and hopefully that you know even people that download it for nothing and don't pay anything you know at least some of these guys hearing it and a lot of the time they're musicians who are incorporating those ideas into new music and you know hey if they can't afford it they can't afford it you know the most important thing is that music continues to that the whole story of the music of music evolving and and fertilizing other different areas the world is the most important thing to me and I think if you know if you speak to a lot of musicians hey they don't like to get to lose money they don't like it that they're royalty cheques are going down because people aren't buying music but if you really get to the bottom of things with most musicians and ask what it is they're in this forest it's to get their music out there is for people to hear it it's to express themselves so you know as long as that's happening then it's a good thing there are a couple things I want to go off of off of what you just said so one of them is more of a tunnel that we're gonna have to go down you know in the midst of this interview but the first question I want to ask you and this is just kind of a quick aside yeah just reflecting off of everything you just said you know there's certainly a widespread conversation going on now amongst music writers and music fans you know especially when it deals with music in the West this whole idea of cultural appropriation and just that being a very negative thing and you know you're here kind of openly discussing the idea of this but you're kind of talking about on this international level and you know what's your opinion basically of you know kind of painting this idea of a Western musician directly taking influence from you know one of these obscure gems that you've unearthed from Ghana for example and sort of incorporating that directly into their music you know is that essentially this really horrible cultural appropriation well you know where were you kind of stealing in a way well I don't you know we could have a we could have hours long conversation about cultural appropriation and it's often be a very thorny issue for certain in certain ways I mean it works both ways though like you know do you say that a band who who wanted to do Beatles covers or was influenced by Elvis Presley who happened to come from Indonesia or Nigeria was also culturally appropriating something is that band too is that is that not is that not allowed is Cuban music that made it back to Senegal in the 60s and 70s is that cultural appropriation I mean you know it's more obvious and more apparent when it's the West you know the Western ban ripping off or incorporating elements of music from some countries that have often been you know subjugated or colonial eyes by by Western countries and so it's still a prickly a subject you know it's I think there's ways to do it I think you know sometimes there are cheesy corny ways of doing it and you like that that's you know that's not cool and then there are subtle ways to do it and you know we live in 2016 you know I do believe this comp this conversation is one that's going to be more and more and more watered down as as we evolve and move around and culturally mix with each other and that happens in different different rates in different places you know places like places like London or New York it's it's you know it's it's almost the norm that's what happens you know we have bands on our label that are based here in London that literally every different band members from a different country of the world and they're based here doing their thing and they're soaking up all the different influences of the places and the cultures the strands of their lives from which they come in a place that's inhabited by people from all over the world and so like I say that's just going to become the norm all over the all over the planet and I think eventually it can be a positive thing you know there's always going to be there's always going to be some haters out there and people to get across with it and like I say I can understand it when it's done in a crass way but I do think that you know music mixing and fusing has always happened it's the story of modern music show me a kind of music that is that is culturally especially modern music that is culturally kind of independent of everything else you know sure but cultural isolated inside the way doesn't exist you know with human beings we've always we've always talked to each other culturally and we've always exchange ideas language you know you name it that's not gonna stop yeah I mean it's it's kind of a I mean I fully agree with you you know that I mean there's so many it's it just seems like such a one-dimensional way to kind of paint the whole idea of cultures kind of influencing one another to make certain kinds of art you know because while there are you know Western acts over here that take quite a bit of influence from foreign styles of music I'm sure that you know you've seen firsthand the incredible amount of influence that American music that British music has on countries all over the world yeah and you know American music and British music in its own way was influenced I mean you know the whole kind of you know the whole kind of explosion of British bands in the 60s those bands in their own way were taking black American music and reinventing it and then that American music was coming from where was it coming from it was coming from New Orleans or West Africa or the Caribbean and you know this is a story you can keep tracing this back and back and back and get it just it doesn't stop you know it's it's again I've been I've been researching this compilation from Indonesia it's a fascinating place it soaks it's been a place that's sort of different cultures for millennia you know there's an Arabic influence through religion and trade there's an Indian influence through like Bollywood films that came in the 50s there's a Cuban influence through the Cuban records that were allowed by the communist country to be to be there when they were trying to suppress rock-and-roll and then there's the Roman role influence that they were trying to suppress but couldn't because when you try and repress something what are the kids want to do they want to listen to it more so you know there's all these different threads and it's it's ever been with us yeah it's it's a to sort of just paint it in that one single way you know sort of Western musicians and artists kind of stealing from other places it sort of discounts all the other ways that music can influence other cultures across the world you know just like specifically in a like you were just saying in Indonesia which is a pretty which is actually a story I'm sure that we could do an entire podcast on if yeah yeah because I mean that sounds pretty crazy all of those different kind of bits of art and culture were kind of culminating in that one country in those in those particular ways well you know one thing that's always in always interesting to me is just how and it how many of the music scenes that we've that we've concentrated on or looked at have been port port towns like you know towns that if you think about it like you know the big some of the big centers of music in Africa or the Caribbean or Latin America or Asia a port towns these this is a measure entirely although all the travel or the shipping yeah the sailors coming off ships they come into town they want a good time they go to the hotel that cloud that's where the musicians come the musicians are doing the same routes and and that's how the songs and the rhythms and the arrangements travel and the music and and the instruments quite often as well you know you have waves of different implements instruments from you know kind of Spanish guitars through to stringed instruments and then brass instruments in the Jazz Age and then electrified guitars in the late 50s and 60s and then guitar amps in the 70s and then the 80 synthesizers and keyboards you know and and that's how music is it is spread those channels you know and it's amazing you know from Havana to New Orleans to Lagos to a crowd to Port of Spain to Panama City to earth you know Bombay you know that these are poor towns this is how the music travels hmm all right the the other row that I want to go down now that we're kind of stepping away from that cultural appropriation thing that question has been kind of explored as far as I'd like to um is once you have found the music you know you've got everything squared away to release it and you know what the compilation is going to be you know what the collection of songs is going to be what exactly is the the dissemination process after that you know who is the intended audience for this music and how exactly are you sort of reaching out to them you know because uh I guess the the next hurdle to kind of get over is is not just putting out the music but actually kind of convincing an audience of people to give something a try that they didn't even know existed in the first place well I think quite plainly and simply from my point of view if it's if it's if it's me compiling something and if I'm working with other compilers it's just a case of boiling down the quite often thousands hundreds and thousands of records into 20 or 30 that's that disband out and and quite often records that appeal not just to you know I if I make a compilation of music from Panama I'm not just trying to appeal to a Panamanian audience like an if a Panamanian guy was to put that record together it would probably choose records it was slightly different because there would be there would be more of a you know an insider's opinion on what should what should be sure in that condensed sort of collection so it's it's really nothing more sort of complicated and right what are the best tracks and if it's these days quite often I'm compiling with two or three other people and it's just a case of sending lots and lots of files between each other and game I don't sing that one and if and just boiling it down quite often it's to do with production qualities or just you know something that just like is so completely outside of the the usual bounded generic boundaries like a regular come along and everyone would be like wow where did that one come from how did listen to the way they recorded the guitar on that or listen to how they recorded the keyboards on that like where did that come from sometimes the obscurity but the obscurity never Trump's musical quality so yeah and it's trying to also within you know like this Kenyan compilation that we're putting together you know Kenya is is a country with many different musical cultures and tribal linguistic boundaries within that country and then it has countries around it at the bands from countries around it that came into Kenya to work with in the music industry and live within Kenya so you have Tanzanian bands and Congolese bands also working within Kenya so you have like in that country like 10 or 20 very distinct musical cultures and so you're trying to represent them all and in one or two compilations and but trying to pick music that sits together well that's there's a story and narrative between how these tracks have influenced each other and how the different languages and tribal areas and cultural areas have influenced each other and yeah at the end of the day just the best piece pieces of music as well you know once that's all kind of assembled how exactly you know are you guys eliciting a reaction from the audience's that you're looking to reach though you know because I guess and from my point of view and this this isn't the case for me personally because I do enjoy a lot of records off of your your discography you know but when trying to say hey you know you got to check this out I sort of you know run into this issue where it seems like a lot of the time people associate with music on a cultural level where they enjoy music that sort of feels familiar to them you know not only in terms of stuff that they've heard before but I guess I guess a song or a or an artist that they identify with in a way you know it's like oh this artist or this music is from where I'm from you know and in trying out music from another country can feel so alien to some people I'm sure yeah well yeah I mean that's something that I guess to a certain degree you just have to leave to the audience you know some things some things can be too out there for certain people you know or too far away from their comfort zone I guess you know when we first put the compilations together from Thailand you know we had a lot of fans of the of their West African compilations I remember that cart that was really a change of pace for you guys yeah and you know some of the compilations from from South America as well you know we had fans who'd come from that whole kind of jazz funk hip hop sort of experience I suppose a lot of people who just sort of grown up in the you know sort of early 90s hip-hop scene who had been into a rare groove jazz funk as well and that kind of hold that kind of culture who'd be a totally on board with the West African stuff because it you know it's it's close in a way it's it's you know it's got sort of funk elements jazz elements the arrangements are quite jazz there's something familiar about yeah there's something familiar and then with their ties like whoa this is this is different and like you know I'm not sure if I can get down with those vocals there - there - kind of alien to me so yeah you know you you kind of it's down to the audience some people got them and some people didn't and then actually a lot of hip-hop producers were really into those records in fact there's a sample from one of those tie compilation well there's a couple of samples but I Dre sampled one of those tracks on his last album really yeah and there's there's an Argentinean hip hop and I've just sampled one of them the guy from what was that project not the black seeds it's a guy from the black seeds the one with the what's the record called I remember the name of the record now came out last year it was um what's he called Dan Auerbach okay yeah from the records yeah what's the what's the record he put out last year and under different guys anyway they were yeah was it like his solo man that he just wrapped a record with yeah anyway they sampled they sampled the the a track from the time the tired compilation as well so you know even at first when we didn't you know we when we put those compilations out and I was I worked with a Thai guy from Bangkok who who was helping us on that and he has a record store and a record label out and a band out of Bangkok we weren't sure who that who the audience would be you know there was there was a scene of kind of guys in Bangkok and and Chris menaced who's a co compiler it's been putting on these sort of events where they played Asian music in London but yeah so you take a kind of leap of faith thinking well I think this music is is good and and deserves a platform internationally to be heard and you know after that it's down to the audience as to how far they want to go with different kinds of music I guess and I do believe that people are way more receptive and open-minded musically all across the world I think you know especially younger generations these days compared to when I was a teenager in the you know in the in the late eighties early tee's I think the the generations these days are much more musically evolved and mature in a way that we kind of weren't and and the boundaries are much more blurred yeah most certainly with the internet you know and then with the ability to just kind of listen to anything at the tip of your fingers on the internet there doesn't necessarily need to be a cultural in or an up heel to actually get you to try a song out you know if it's just clickable like any other song on the Internet yeah I mean at the end of the day do you like it yeah that's a shirt right and that's the thing a lot of these again a lot of the countries we go to you'll find people that can sing and recite whole songs in in a different language to the one that they were brought up speaking but most but a language that happens to come from the same country in which they were born but because these tracks are hits within their country because they're the kind of multicultural countries countries like Indonesia and Kenya and Nigeria have multiple different language groups and so you have a hit that people will know even though that they don't understand the lyrics and you know we find that in the West you know a bit unusual especially the Anglophone west like the US or the UK where was so we're so kind of you know the music we're hearing on it on a day-to-day basis is all inning well with the exception of Gangnam style exactly in brackets world music well it's it's moments like that that actually makes me think like wow you know like if somebody were you know the it's moments like that that makes me think there is certainly potential for a foreign artist to make a hit over here that isn't necessarily a novelty song you know I know exactly and you know if you talk to people in France they laugh at us because you know French people have and other European countries as well like they have amazing Oh stations to play you know this they're much more used to it you know they have they have this kind of multilingual kind of way of listening to music that we don't have in the UK in the US you know we're kind of you know it's just a different way of listening to music sure no absolutely um so what is next sort of on the docket in terms of countries that you're looking to visit again do sort of you know dig up more musical experience use achill obscurities and you know are the countries that you visited before when looking for music for the record label and you know if so what kind of keeps you going back to some of these was the label these days has sort of two sides to it so we still doing compilations of music from from generations past but we also have the contemporary side of things where we put yeah I wanted to ask you about that too senator some of them some of the newer artists that you guys are working with so you know that's one kind of difference between the label but at the moment we're just putting together like I said the second compilation of Canyon of Kenya special I'm going back to Nigeria with the compilation of kind of disco and boogie from the 80s so that's a country that I spend a lot of time in historically I haven't been to for a while but I work with a Nigerian research blog DJ music clavichord Janet echo Nate who is based up in Massachusetts but of Nigerian heritage so he's helping on that side of things like I say I've been spending quite a lot of time in Indonesia working on this compilation of music from the late 1950s and early 60s so I don't know I get you know go where where things take me it's as the label has got has got bigger it's and has more day-to-day stuff to run as I've got older I've got children now a little harder to travel and so we kind of have a sort of a range of different people involved in the label these days as well like so you know in their early days of samway quite often the compilations were just kind of me and me alone and it was like a sort of hobby thing in this small label that I ran from home and these days is much more there are many more people involved and people pictures compilations and and they they take years some of these populations I mean you know some of them take 3-4 years you know somebody might come with an idea and go oh I'm working on that and you know I've got this idea for this compilation from here but you know how do we do it and it's a long painstaking process sometimes like there's a couple of compilations I'm working on now that you know we've only just started and and all say that there's there's a lot more competition these days as well you know it's it's become easier to sort of self distribute and self promote record labels which i think is a fantastic thing you know I think there's so much music out there that you know the more the more people that do this this kind of thing the better I think I think possibly the market can get saturated to it to a degree which will remain to be seen but yeah it seems like there's an incredible hunger and desire for so many different kinds of music from all over the world and you know we're already moving into people doing compilations of music from 15 years ago when I started the label you know and you know 90s music and music from the early 2000s and I'm sure there's tons of music being made now that will not be that will that will die a pretty quick death or it won't get hired properly and in 20 years time people would be doing compilations of it from from from everywhere yeah all that all that stuff from the 90s in 2000's that to you or I probably doesn't seem that far away is now slowly getting older and older yeah exactly yeah now we've got this whole kind of you know that ease with which people can make music digitally it doesn't even make it onto a tape or or a vinyl record or or or CD it's just you know people will be digging through hard drives in 20 years time yeah people must be trading obscure mp3s and exactly yeah okay so tell me a little bit now about the more contemporary side of the label because I know that you guys have been ramping up with a lot of newer original releases from a lot of up-and-coming artists you know it seems like you guys have kind of built the record label on you know sort of this one idea of obscuring all the unearthing all of these obscure gems from across the world but now you're kind of using the fan base you've built to put on some other artists who you know or maybe either a little pre-established or you know you're kind of a giving them a home that they wouldn't have had otherwise on the label yeah well I mean for starters I think that personally I think right now is one of the most exciting times in music because of a lot of what we've spoken about so far I think that there's I think the musicians are so they're so musically mature and aware because of all this you know all this movement of music and the consumption of music and so I think it's there's just so many great bands out there at the moment that I got to a point where I started hearing records that were you know brand-new recordings that I was like I really should be putting some of this stuff out and and I had a realization that a lot of the bands that were on our compilations or a lot of the recordings that were on our compilations quite often especially in in terms of the kind of more progressive African music were and some of the more obscure recordings from all over the world would sort of only there because producers had taken a chance and put out records that they you know that otherwise would never have been would never have been recorded and for posterity and for or you know the continuation of this sort of story of Music at evolving I just sort of realized that I really wanted to start putting out contemporary music as we're a long side that older stuff I also kind of came out of a period of just looking and digging and playing and DJing music from a very specific kind of era and sort of felt that I wanted to start listening to more contemporary music I'd always listened to all different kinds of music my whole sort of child my whole sort of teenage years and 20s and then sort of went into this kind of wormhole of 1970s tropical music and came out thinking yeah you know I'd like to start listening to two more to expanding my horizons and so yeah and also people would starting to send me amazing demos and recordings that I just thought you know I'd like to do this and move the label into it now that we have a kind of audience and we have people is it would be almost you know it always me a missed opportunity not to start hitting them with other staff and to pushing them into slightly different directions and and especially when some of the bands have kind of specifically told me that they've been influenced by the compilations that we've been put out yeahbsolutely you guys have been dropping compilations for so long that there has yeah it's out there making new music that are taking inspiration from it yeah so you know to me is a pretty logical progression and it's certainly tougher in some ways some records were a lot tougher and unless a band can tour and get into certain markets or get out of their home market it's it's hard to start records as internationally as something like the compilation of classic 60s and 70s recordings but you know I said other bands like you know for instance under tropica that record under tropic correct but that's the best-selling record on on sound my period like it's out sold out sold all of our comput and is a contemporary record you know it has its it's has its its feet firmly in a specific era but it is a contemporary record yeah and so yeah you know it's for me it's it's as a record label it's it's a natural progression and and the two sit side-by-side quite quite well they're very it's it's it's they're different they're different beasts in terms of how you go about trying to market them and and promote them but yeah you know just to kind of get into a few of these groups that you guys are of contemporary groups that you guys are releasing music with you know namely a group like Meridian Brothers I mean they're a group that like owned a truck because their feet are placed firmly within a certain type of music that comes from a certain era but it doesn't really just have the contemporary vibe to it like the onda tropical record does it's also in a lot of ways kind of wildly experimental yeah well you know they're a unique band you know yeah they sound like no one else and I'm pretty sure no one else would ever sound like them and so you know when I get sent something like that I'm like how can I not put this out it's you know even if only and when sometimes you get records and you think is there a market for this is there an audience for this but you know they're a great case in point when I first signed them and I put their first record out I was a little bit kind of you know I I know these guys are great live and they have a live scene in Bogota and they have it you know but they've totally exceeded expectations people love the fact that they're so out there and so so wild and so experiments or and it sounds like one of the stranger obscurities that would make it on one of your compilations except it's happening now it's happening now exactly yeah and if those records hadn't been put out I put you know I think the world of beer you know would be slightly less a slightly less musically rich place and you know that's the case for every record everybody puts out you know but these days it's very easy for things to disappear on you know just by getting put out on digital formats or something and so to actually be able to put things out on vinyl and and know that they'll you know they'll be there physically forever is is a great feeling another group I definitely want to mention before I ask you a couple more questions about wounded tropica is the this other group tell me if I'm pronouncing the name correctly uh fumaça Preta full mass up that's it yeah Fuu masa Preta okay they're like this wild Latin psyche rock group and the recordings are pretty crazy yeah yeah I mean just you know they're a band that yeah like you say they started off being very sort of influenced by psychedelic rock from Brazil the first track would had a guy called Joel stones on vocals who is a Brazilian guy that runs record store and in in the USA plus a guy called Alex forget who's from Venezuela on drums and a couple of English guys on bass and guitar who have been in funk bands for 20 years so the dad every diverse band who kind of reflects what I'm talking about really lots of different strands and elements but they come together to make something their own first listens it sort of sounds kind of yeah Rio care can I can hear some of those influences of 1970s psychedelic rock but then in other areas that do you know they're like mixing Fuu Nana drums from Cabo Verde or like 808 sort of three or three acids kind of squelchy stuff that from you know from her sort of acid house influence and so all these different influences and then recorded in a very sort of garage di way garage rock style in in Alex's studio in in Amsterdam and they're an amazing live band yeah they're just totaled son of kind of you know punk rockers who happens is to sing in in Portuguese and Spanish but who listens to all kinds of music you know and that's very much kind of raison d'être of the contemporary sort of side of samway I guess you know sort of this this sort of mixed up you know from all over the place another of our bands at B Bo ssam machine who are like a kind of their band based in London the lead singer ni Williams is of Nigerian heritage but brought up here her native tongue is a language called Bibby Oh from from Nigeria so she's on vocals and there's a guy called Alfred Bannerman who's a good Ghanaian guitarist who I'd worked with on some of the old Ghanaian material that we'd reissued the percussionist is from Brazil the drummer has Trinidadian roots the horns guys are from England in Australia then there's another band called family Atlanticare who like the lead singers Venezuelan there's guys from Ghana and Nigeria all different you know this this is kind of the world that we live in if you grow up in in in a western city in 2016 and that's that's kind of you know the you know these records just reflect our cultural mm-hmm all right into it to end things off you know can you tell us much information about this upcoming own to Tropico record you know a lot of people listening to this podcast and watching this YouTube channel should be familiar with their debut album and the project because you know I did give it such a glowing review when it came out one of my favorite albums of that year when it dropped it's definitely my favorite of the contemporary releases that you guys have put out um you know what's going on with the latest record I know they've got an IndieGoGo campaign that was semi successful yeah well firstly will and Mario had raised some of the money to do the the recording down in in Colombia firstly thank you to everybody who helped those guys get get their money and don't worry your records will be coming soon and you will be you will be at the front of the queue I believe me we've just been talking about that this weekend with well world Quantic the record is a slight it's very much an order tropical record but it's a bit it's a slight change of direction in that whereas the first one was a very ambitious project with forty-four musicians that was funded by the British Council and recorded at discos for went as the kind of legendary studio in medicine in in Colombia this one was recorded in Bogota and in the island of the islands of providencia now providencia the islands of Providence here are a group of islands off the quite a long way off the coast of Colombia that are politically in you know owned by Colombia but the culture there is very different in that it's english-speaking and it is almost its kind has more in common with to make her and and Trinidad in that it has a kind of Calypso calypso and kind of reggae so kind of element you know it's it's it's more because of their Anglet the english-speaking nature of the islands it's it's more related to those those cultures so it's this record has a dual side to it has the half of the record recorded in Bogota that is kind of classic Leon de truc apparel ated to all the sort of the more Latin esque cumbia and Pacifica music styles from from Colombia and then it has this kind of Calypso reggae Island side to it as well so a lot of the musicians from the Colombian mainland went over and then they recorded with statins with some vocalists and musicians there so it's a great record it's it's yeah it's been it's been a while coming but it's all mixed and ready to go it's gonna be out at the end of January next year and yeah I don't think people are going to be disappointed it's it's beautifully mixed it's got that kind of depth of sound and yeah it's it's a fantastic record so we're working hard on that at the moment just getting the art work together and the videos and planning tours in North America and Europe and there's also going to be a whole all they've also made a whole dub dub album of versions of some of the of some of the cracks as well which we're going to be following up with later in the year next year so yeah we'll be we'll be releasing kind of more information about it as the year goes on and yeah what's this space ok great man

time man 
mKPDR7m99EQ,hi everyone no than anymore here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most arduous monthly segment on this channel the why you know review where I go back and discuss in brief my feelings on a series of records that people were asking me to review over the past month but I didn't get a chance to review so I just want to you know address them real quick never quick while doing this hitman suffer you must today is my final letter can't say that I'm doing better ever since my brew making with me laughs now filled with numb sensations worried now with past relations my doppelganger triumph livings just another form for being there I thought of you constantly remained in my head a cow true gesture boy do I detest it with everything is saying everything you do Danny Trump for president let's go this is a sickeningly saccharine and schmaltzy album for Bob Dylan this is exactly the type of vocal pop overly arranged vocal pop that his older work was just a very necessary alternative to in the 60s and the 70s and now he's making this kind of music and it's giving me a headache and his voice just doesn't even have the dexterity at this point to actually deliver this music with the upbeat kind of vibrant feelings that you would want to hear in this type of music I mean I guess it's cool that he feels up to trying something like this out and he's just doing whatever the hell he wants at this point but not not not not for me this is this power violence and hardcore punk bands final record over here and if you're looking for something heavy and aggressive and hard give this thing a shot I mean as far as I could tell weekend nachos are doing what they do as well as they usually do it what they do is never really stuck out to me but you know it's it's a decent swan song I guess uh inside to stuff this album is like if the Arctic Monkeys during the recording of their most boring album AM decided to try to write a bunch of songs based off of strokes impressions that they would try out during practice this guy is a Chicago rapper known for his pretty savage freestyles many of which end up on this record and sound pretty great but this album is over in our long not only that but he just jumps around and tries so many different styles of new very commercial sounds and hip-hop music and as a result I think the the project just suffers like there's all these auto-tune cuts on here all these cuts on here where he's clearly trying to like pull from Fetty WAPs audience I think this guy's got a great flow a great voice his lyrics aren't exactly rocket science but they're blunt and to the point and entertaining and aggressive as hell I guess I'm just waiting for him to make a ballsier and more direct project and just not kind of water his sound and water his appeal down with all these more commercial tracks I guess this album is for anybody into their 30s pushing 40 who's still keeping it emo this is one of the most annoying things I've heard all year this is a pretty decent ambient record from miss Julianne barwick and I don't know if there's much more to say about it than that it didn't really leave that strong of an impression on me I like the organic instrumentation the pianos and the strings and the way that they come together with Juliana's Area Theory Ilocos which of course are layered on top of each other pretty nicely the soundscapes are very relaxing and aesthetically pleasing not too much of this album really stands out to me but I guess that's kind of the point it's not supposed to be jarring or ultra attention-grabbing it's just kind of Airy and just very sweet mood music Congrats you still have one good album this band unfortunately just really took a turn for the generic on this new record over here as far as like emo and indie rock goes it's just so by the numbers and it's not even really as energetic and as lively as their last album unfortunately even though their last LP again was also pretty cliche by emo standards at least they had kind of a fire to it you know there was definitely a fire in its belly that made it entertaining to listen to not so much on this record this very very mild it sounds like the guys in the band are sort of you know in their twilight years as are the group of nude old people who are featured on the cover a cover that I want to erase from my memory as fast as possible thanks guys the vocals on this record are good as they are usually with ariana grande but I don't think the record over here really lives up to the dangerous label and I guess that's probably not a surprise to anybody by pop music standards it's pretty run-of-the-mill it's pretty formulaic it's pretty cliche Ariana going for the same very ethereal kind of moody contemporary R&B sound a lot of other artists are there's even a really weird reggae trap infusion on the song side to side featuring Nicki Minaj ariana grande just kind of continues to be a pop artist - I don't really love but I don't really dislike either you know when I hear her sing and when I hear her perform it sounds cool but she doesn't really have that strong of a style to me or anything like that people who like this record and like ariana grande I don't begrudge them that at all I mean I think she's a very accessible artist and surely a talented singer but there's not really anything about her and this album - that swings me one way or the other it lucid you may know him not only as a solo performer he's in New York rapper but also part of Armand Hammer a collaborative duo that he's in with the legendary the dark the mysterious Billy woods this new project over here is on backwoods Studios label and it's decent you know a lucid is just such an esoteric abstract rapper that sometimes I have a hard time connecting with his music you know if you like guys like Aesop Rock who are just super deep super metaphorical their songs lyrically just work in so liars he also has a similarly raspy voice you're going to dig this project some of the beats are a little meeting potatoes but you know they definitely bring that kind of dark nocturnal mood that I think his lyrics require and they're a little obtuse too you know if there's one word I could put on this record it's obtuse five years later and these guys are still kind of working with the same mild not really that engaging UK garage and bass sound some of the productions are a little busier a little more bustling I guess I could describe them as something that Machinedrum would have put together of course machine drum is in this duo if you didn't know already you should but something that machine drum would put together but a little more Airy and smooth which I don't think is a bad thing in concept it actually would have made this album better on the whole if not for the fact that there are just so many lackluster vocal features and I I think that's really all I have to say baby you gotta review me you better review me oh you're a bitch IIIi don't know what are you a you're just so long you're like four hours long and I just I just haven't even made the time yet it's not that long why can't I just leave I just need time to review your guy want to listen to you that leads several times I will fill you well you gotta be a boy he'll you session hey everyone not not totally sure if I'm going to review that the odd Tech er records yet I haven't fully decided yet classics week is coming up this this June because we're do include to class this week a year now so I might take the time that I have during that week to listen to that album so there's that and have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it also I want to give a shout out to Flo know you an illustrator in musician a youtuber a SoundCloud er who created that fantastic counter justice song that you heard in the beginning of the episode his information his stuff is linked down there in the description box down there so go check that out and that's it guys thanks for watching hope you're having a good good month week day second minute whenever you're watching this goddamn video ah forever 
k4GIbeZzyIM,hey everyone there's the back ten oh here and it's time for track reviews where we review tracks and in this episode of track reviews I'm going to be talking about the new avalanches song Frankie's so not draw legendary Australian music producers the avalanches they're back they are pretty much known for dropping one of the most significant contributions to instrumental hip hop and plunder phonics the album since I left you came out in the year 2000 it's now 16 years old but more relevant than ever in a musical age where remixes and sampling have become a cornerstone of modern music now for a while there have been rumors of a new record on the way there had been talk of Danny Brown being involved in some way at least on one track and now that's all pretty much confirmed not only because Danny Brown and MF doom or doom appear on this cut but an album title has been delivered a release date has been delivered the track listing has come out and other features from the record have been listed as well we have father John misty on this record Biz Markie Toro y Moi is going to be on this record and there are other people listed as well now I'm not here to talk about this record or give much more background on it because I don't have much more let's just get into this new single that's teasing to this album the whole track is based upon this really prominent vocal sample a will mouth Houdini song he's a Calypso artist and this vocal sample as he's singing this Frankie Sinatra chorus that is repeated throughout the track is combined with these heavy tubas lumbering punchy hip hop beats and some jazz instrumentation - it sounds like swing instrumentation and if you wanted to you could probably categorize this track is electro swing but as far as that goes I don't think this is too bad the production on this track I think is pretty much part of the course for what the avalanches have set in the 2000s it's cool to see coming together and sticking to what they know especially since it seemed like there was so much more potential in what they were doing and it was just kind of a shame that they only ever released one record and not only does this feel like a true-blue avalanches production but it has that modern heaviness that I think a new track from these guys would need to turn a younger head I think the beat on this track is vibrant it's funky and it's fun there's an intentional note of silliness and goofiness to the track as well which is usually the case for the avalanches music that note of comedy comes out strongest in the music videos that they pair with their tracks and that is no less the case on this new single I think the beat is a little meat-and-potatoes for 2016 but that very instantaneous and and hard-hitting simplicity is part of what made since I left you so good and I guess it still has an appeal to it on this new cut but I do have an issue with this song and my issue lies squarely with the features on here from doom and Danny Brown and not to say that they're rapping was terrible or that it was off on this cut I think lyrically and flow wise Danny and doom did pretty much what you would expect Danny definitely had the better of the two verses I liked all the drunken and just drug fuelled debauchery that he described in his lyrics and the way that he rode this kind of quirky lumbering jazzy beat it reminded me of the song exotic off of his hybrid project but but I think this song could have been much more than just kind of merely inviting Danny and doom on to just deliver a bunch of playful non sequiturs and not only that but both of them were mixed solo into the beat that I could barely make them out half of the time they didn't really have that much presence in the instrumental and as a result I think they took away from it again not because their performances were bad but I think they were just badly placed into this beat the tuba really smothers both of their vocals goals goals and I can't help but feel like the avalanches had to structure the song in a weird way just to fit in here because he doesn't come in after a chorus there's real build up to dooms verse no tension release or anything like that he just kind of pops in randomly after Danny and he delivers what I could only categorize is just like a disjointed mini verse in the past the avalanches production stood on its own and I think that it can do that again on this new record and I'm sure it will on a lot of these deeper cuts and there are a lot of cuts on this new record that don't feature any singers or rappers whatsoever but having heard this track I feel like I'm skeptical now of all the songs that are going to feature other artists because on here it feels like they wanted the feature recognition and the feature hype behind the track but they didn't actually clear out room in the mix for these guys to do what they do so that it sounded great and actually made the track what it is so in one breath I like the track I think the production is really good I think it's the avalanches doing what they typically do as well as I would want and expect them to do it but the group's attempt to actually get people hyped about this new cut by bringing on features I think has made the song a bit of a disappointment and those are my thoughts on the track transition have you given this track a listen did you love it to chain it what would you rate your best your best what should I review next hit that lack if you like and have a nice day everyone Anthony Fantana for avalanches let's hope this album is good forever 
eImoMBuxLyk,hey everyone the best chief in the game here Anthony Fantan oh and it's time for a review of the new flume album skin this is the latest full-length LP from Australian music producer and songwriter flume the highly anticipated follow-up to his breakout album breakout self-titled record that came out back in 2012 which is a little long to be waiting for a commercial follow-up although in the interim between these two records there was a deluxe version of that debut album released with a lot of extra songs and features added to the track listing and now flume is signed to mom-and-pop records and this latest release of his has come with a mess of interesting features vic mensa vince staples alunageorge Raekwon the chef beck and little dragon and flume even though his breakout LP i wasn't that big on it i still did see him as a very versatile producer and he has had a lot of time to incubate his sound and this project so didn't really know what to expect from this thing so just I just don't but there is a central sound linking a lot of these cuts together and that is flume taking the heavy lumbering off-kilter grooves and rhythms of the wonky genre and trying to package them up with these punchy pieces of percussion and very glitzy glossy synthesizers and then topping these instrumentals with these singers and performers that have a very radio-friendly appeal it's like he's trying to make wonky go commercial on this record which in a sense is a pretty ambitious undertaking basically lifting this very abstract and experimental form of electronic music that borrows so heavily from hip hop and trying to make it palatable to an audience that usually listens to radio pop or club music and aesthetically I think flume is on point I mean these tracks really do have the high-gloss finish of a radio song not only do a lot of the singers and rappers on this project have a very wide appeal but the smooth digital synth lines all over this record sore quite gracefully and beautifully over the very hectic percussion that hangs below which is the case on tracks such as say it featuring low although I will say that a weak point of this cut is that the lyrics are kind of trashy and this really isn't the kind of vocalist I would like to hear over this instrumental style this really isn't the kind of thing that I go to a wonky track for and I pretty much have the same issue with the song never be like you featuring Kai but in a way it's worse because the rhythmically off-kilter instrumental doesn't fully support the commercial songwriting style that the track is going for when the chorus eventually explodes the hook just feels really cluttered because the synthesizers and the percussion don't really I guess coalesce into anything that really backs up the refrain the beats are just very sporadic and all over the place the synths are sputtering just not that consistent the track glides pretty nicely and the following cut lose it featuring vic mensa I liked his verse on here his performance was really animated though I will say some of his bars were corny like when he said that he feels like Nagasaki he's about to drop the bomb I thought the production on this track was really great - I like how all the synthesizers kind of meld together in this really psychedelic way thanks to the phat oversaturated compression it's moments like this that make me kind of wish this was an instrumental record and maybe that's also partially because some of my favorite tracks on here actually are instrumental cuts like these songs three and well fuck these tracks in my opinion show a lot of growth for floom as a producer previously I thought a lot of his production was really bland nondescript and didn't have that much punch to it on this record some of these cuts are super clunky heavy they have a lot of color and character the song free is semi obnoxious with its relentless kick drums that don't really build up that much tension against the swelling synthesizers but still I think flumes instrumental game on this project has improved if only the beats weren't paired with so many weak songs and nondescript singers now there is a decent trio of tracks and features in the second half of the record with little dragon and M Yeti an R and alunageorge I won't say these songs are incredibly bold or anything like that but the vocals and the sense take a very dreamy chill easygoing approach and I actually think this complements that choppy beat style that usually comes from wonky much better than this glitzy commonplace pop music with a forgettable singer there are also a few filler cuts in the tracklist here very very short instrumentals that would be cool detours if the song surrounding these tracks were really dense and satisfying but many of them aren't and then the cherry on top is the closing track featuring Beck which not only is one of the sugar East and most unfulfilled sums in the entire track listing but this is just one of another in a string of awful vocal features that Beck has been dropping lately I don't get what the appeal is of this really soulless singing that he's putting onto these features his voice has absolutely no personality nothing really appealing about it and then furthermore flumes sort of manipulates his voice and sort of renders it down into all these effects and I think Beck's voice loses even more of its character through that process again just like with the last Beck feature I'd heard this year I wouldn't have known it was Beck if I hadn't been told there were highlights on this record for sure but every good moment is balanced out by an incredibly lackluster or a barely tolerable moment the album is just inconsistent and all over the place I mean maybe it might work for somebody who just wants to hear really glitzy electronic music with a kind of alternative flair to it but anybody who's hardcore into wonky or has been following it since its growth in the underground probably won't see as much appeal in this as they might in many of the classics that have come up in the genre thus far again this just kind of seems like a commercial revision of a sound that's just been around for a while now hopefully this record finds an audience and floom can continue doing what he's doing because I do think there is potential in his work on this project again I do think the production is better it's just that the most commercial moments on this record I think just kind of weighed down the quality of it to be honest I'm feeling a light a decent 5 on this thing transition and one more thing I want to say about this record is shot up to that Raekwon verse on this record that had a pretty nice and interesting narrative to it if you're into that whole violent gangster rap crime family angle that Raekwon usually takes and he injected it there pretty much as well as he does just about anywhere else I do give him credit for that sometimes these rappers their guest verses on these producer curated albums can be kind of lackluster but it seems like a great quantity really put in work on that verse and that's going to be it for this new flume record those are my thoughts hope you guys are doing well have you given the Trekker to listen did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it everybody Anthony Fantana flume skin forever 
jPAdqn0X48Q,you know there are these girls fighting at Drake's house and like he's totally saying in response to the girls fighting come on first cheesecake and now this first you find a cheesecake and that's my favorite place to go and now you're fighting where I live hi everyone don't touch tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a great album segment it's at the end of the month so now I am coming to recommend to you what my favorite releases have been over the past month and the month of May has been incredibly fruitful for this channel quite a few records I fell in love with this past month let's recommend them there are links to listen to music from all these albums down below as well as all of my reviews of these records are linked down below so you could watch those too this record came out back in April but I got to it eventually and found that even though it wasn't you know my usual thing my usual style I found it very impressive very melodic very heroic very triumphant the New Moon sorrow record if you're looking for some very full key progressive black metal infused metal is a very progressive a very linear very epic and a very ambitious metal record with a lot of instrumental diversity across it it may not be in your typical style either if you follow the reviews on a regular basis because I don't review a lot of metal like this and if so I ask for you to give this thing a shot because it surprised even me just how much I enjoyed it next the new Marissa Nadler albums strangers this is a very dreamy eerie chilly mystical beautiful and pretty singer-songwriter record and easily Merson Adler's most instrumentally diverse album yet most instrumentally dense album yet and I think it's the best crop of songs I have heard on a Marissa Nadler album so far and yeah she's a good classy singer-songwriter record with a very easygoing but very beautiful sound to it next the new car seat headrest album teen of denial a bit of a loaf I indie rock album over here that's also pretty ambitious a little long-winded some people were pissed off that I liked this record and I don't give a I think the songs are ambitious I think they're a little over the top I think some of the experimental and odd instrumental passages are pretty cool and lyrically of all the songs here kind of follow this metamorphosis of frontman will Toledo going through this process of I don't know kind of losing his mind and falling apart I enjoy the spectacle of wilt Alito's insanity and the very catchy well-written tunes on this project next an EP from Gore guts Canadian death metal band technical death metal band and this new project over here is essentially one very ambitious 30-minute long piece with multiple phases to it it's very heavy it's very abrasive it's very dizzying gore guts being one of the few technical death metal bands whose output that I love they came through once again with a solid piece of work on this one not a whole lot of complaints you know it certainly is is very much similar to their last full-length album but I think some of the new sounds they explore on here combined with the fact that it is kind of this one big cohesive piece on an EP makes it worth you know kind of revisiting the sounds it's got a bit of a different angle to it next another metal record man wanted metal records this month we have vector with their latest full-length LP terminal redux almost a thrash metal opera here where the band is telling this tale of this evil guys totally insane this freakin record it's insane it's so long all the songs tell a story when they come together and the the the character that frontman David de Santo plays as as he's singing these songs he really sells it in order to get the full experience I recommend doing your best to try to find the lyrics of the album so you can kind of read along with them as you listen to the album but it's still a decent set of very progressive thrash metal songs I wish maybe vector experiment a little more and tried a few new things here and there because a few of the tracks just kind of seemed like vector by the numbers even though they are very creative and idiosyncratic band there are some ways I think they could have pushed it a little further and I think they do on a great deal the cuts here I mean there's a great ballad toward the back end of this track there are a few songs here where they bring fantastic group vocals into the fold so you have these really cool chorus vocals combined with these thrash guitars and they actually meld together really epically so if you're looking for one of the most ambitious thrash metal records ever recorded ever conceived ever released then you're gonna want to give this thing a shot moving on to the latest Radiohead record a moon shaped pool Radiohead comes through with a great record easily the dreariest record in their discography so soft so subtle it's such a grower this is not the type of album that's gonna just hit you on first listen it's gonna take a little bit to kind of I don't know place yourself into the mood that I think this album requires you to be in in order for it to appeal to you this is not a communal album this is not a party record this is a very introspective very somber release that I think works best when listened to in solitude couple more left guys man a lot of albums I love this month we have Death Grips goddamn they came through with a new record and it lived up to all my expectations bottomless pit' definitely one of the catchiest records in their discography has quickly become one of my favorite records of theirs in a lot of ways I think they return to what they were doing on the Money Store writing such catchy direct songs but they're so abrasive too it's abrasive ear candy and they're continuing to perfect the art of that with this release I just think it's one of the most well written set of songs that they've come out with in a while I think the topics of these tracks to ring through really clearly and the instrumentals are killer you know not only do I think they go back to that sort of catchiness and directness of the money store but in a lot of ways what they do on every single track here it's like a calm and a of all the sounds and all the experiments and all the sonic adventures that they've taken on every album they've released thus far and kind of bringing it all back to something that has this immensely clear crisp HD clarity to it it's super destructive it's super in-your-face it's very bombastic I love it next the new Aesop Rock Album impossible kid on this record Aesop Rock comes through and essentially proves why he's still relevant as one of the most creative MCS on the market this is also a very personal album for him I think he actually runs back revisits some topics having to do with family with friends with his career he gets a little nostalgic on here occasionally reflects on his age and his outsider status in these songs if you really want to hear aisa self reflect in a big way in his music and he also does it in a way that I think is very coherent like he really wants the audience to understand where he's coming from you know he's not buried so deep in symbolism and metaphors that it's actually kind of difficult to to tell what exactly he's getting at with these tracks if you really want to hear Aesop open up and not only as an artist but as a person you know the man who is actually making the music then I would give this thing to listen and there's also hilarious  track on here about his cat and finally we're gonna end it off with the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album nonagon infinity this is one of the most interesting psych Rock and psych punk records I've heard in a while the album actually works in a continual loop there's not really a moment on the record that feels like it's it's like the ending or really the beginning you just kind of start the album probably really wherever you feel like and it just kind of goes on and on and on and on and on the closing track segues perfectly into the opening track and every song from there on out actually segue into one another really nicely and the entire release is just this amazing intense propulsive throttling psych Rock experience man there's so much guts this thing there's so much balls to this thing King gizzard and the lizard wizard the performances just have so much chemistry on this record I I'd just love the way all the guitars and all the drums kind of empower one another and also I think there's quite a bit of influence coming off their last record here to where they were just doing strictly acoustic instrumentation so this isn't just kind of this fuzzy psych rock very noisy very I guess chaotic kind of experience you know there are some great melodies weaved into these tracks and some great extra instrumentation to to just add some beautiful color to the abrasive and very heavy sight guitars and those are all the recommendations that I want to make to you guys this month check these freaking albums out I think they're great don't let them slip through the dispatch I'm recommending them to you so you give them a shot you too best anthony Fantana great album's transition you should give all these albums a listen and love them and love them and love them and love them I hope you are all doing well eat some fruits and veggies drink your water stay hydrated forever 
3DzaDySzer4,I like to try and guess the score based on the thumbnail it's a fun little game I play with myself there's no such thing as true love and we're all going to die anyways have a nice day hi everyone don't the knee touched an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review of the latest Death Grips track moon featuring mr. Primus himself Les Claypool on the bass the experimental hip hop trio known as Death Grips is back new track striking while the iron is hot fresh off the back of their new full-length album bottomless pit one of my favorite albums of this year one of the best albums in their discography so catchy so direct abrasive ear candy digital destruction ah and this new track isn't just simply an extension of all of this material that Death Grips has recently released the band throws us a bit of a curveball here with a surprise appearance from Les Claypool playing the bass on this track which is interesting to me for a few different reasons one I was totally obsessed with Primus in high school and college one of my favorite bands and not only that but les has long been a fan of Zac Hill's music and drum playing dating back to his days in hella Les Claypool also made an appearance on Zack Hill's solo debut astrological straits and that was like back in the late 2000s so it's pretty cool that they were able to come together once again and collaborate under the Death Grips name basically lessons contributions on this cut can be heard in the insane slaps style playing that seems to be sampled throughout much of this cut I'm not sure if this song was conceived with less in mind or if he was a part of the writing process or if he simply just kind of gave to the band some original just kind of improvisation xand playing in the same way that Bjork donated her vocals to the band for them to use on the first half of the powers-that-be I'm assuming it's most likely that which isn't necessarily a bad thing since death grip very creatively work samples into their music it's not necessarily going to take away from the song or anything like that and this track to me is incredibly disorienting very busy very dense reminds me a lot of the song hothead in that regard and lessons base is a pretty prominent element in the mix here I would say it actually plays a pretty key role in separating this song from many of the other tracks on bottomless pit the skittering busy slap bass that is all over this cut is nutty and let's just pull so many sounds out of his bass whether it be again this very rhythmic slapping and popping which is just so fast and then there's also these kind of squealing whoop sounds around the three minute and ten seconds like this bass and drum break where it seems like just jack hills drumming and lesses bass are coming together maybe this was recorded in a live jam I'm not totally sure but even if it wasn't and it was just kind of less playing and then Zack came on to the track after to sort of complement it with percussion it still came together really well like this bass and drum break is amazing and it's great that they were able to work these sounds into what is pretty much another very catchy Death Grips tune not only is there very solid refrain to this track but ride has worked and weaved into the song really well - whether it be is kind of monotone hypnotic vocals right against his bow the very shouting or his pitch trapping vocals at some point in the track where he's a little chipmunk I wouldn't say rides performances so off the wall or amazing that it's the most memorable thing about the track I think the most memorable thing about the track is just how the bass and the drums come together but maybe the lyrics would have stuck out to me a little bit more if I had a lyric sheet to this track I looked around online couldn't quite find a complete set of lyrics but I think it's a decent track and it went over way better than I think a collaboration like this should have honestly I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did I wouldn't say I prefer it too many tracks off of bottomless pit it is one of those Death Grips songs where it feels like there's just so many elements packed into it that it almost fails to translate much of anything sometimes still though like the track a lot and could this potentially mean another Death Grips album around the corner if so that would be pretty insane and I'm just going to dip out before I even try to make sense of this cover art cool cool transition have you given this track a listen did you love it did you hate it what was your ad or the best you're the best or should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe please don't die Death Grips more do the bird forever 
190SH2l-ulk,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a very laid-back relaxing as our style review of the new pop album the dream is over pup is an Ontario punk band and this is their second full-length LP for the side one dummy record label their debut album which dropped a few years ago was energetic enough for a modern punk album with some shades of pop punk and post hardcore mixed in however I wouldn't really say the band came through with a very memorable sound or style there are very few songs that I actually remember from this album and on this new record over here I think the band is still yet to completely come into their own however some of the bold lyrics and explosive instrumental performances on this record are leaving a greater impression on me right from the start with the track if this tour doesn't kill you I will which is probably the most hilariously titled track on the entire record not only is very fast short well-written and very catchy song but the track has this self-aware wit and humor about it that reminds me of the last Jeff Rosenstock record just this very loud and very brash pop punk that's kind of suffering from an existential crisis which is exemplified on tracks like can't win as well as some doubt or the track my life is over and I couldn't be happier which is another one of my favourite tracks on here as well as one of my favourite song titles now this record is very downtrodden album and it kind of faces these very negative feelings and these life struggles with just pure anger and aggression honestly it's it's not really the attitude that I was hoping for because even though there are a handful of acts on this record that I think are very clever and kind of funny and very fun to listen to the album as this was me vibe to it that I think is a little saturated right now and I'm not really sure what bub brings to the table that many of these other bands don't already that are going for a similar emotional appeal the blaring guitars and relentless drums and the kind of throat shredding very almost shrill vocals I like them on tracks like the introductory track as well as uh the song DVP but on the more melodramatic guts track listing here I think the vocals get really grating and become kind of a turn-off they're very windy and kind of one-dimensional and it's it's to the point where I think they kind of ruin the songs of the core of these tracks and just make them Mar to enjoy like on the coast or sleep in heat or on the song old wounds the production and the instrumentation I don't really have any issues with it's just kind of a standard mix of rock instrumentation with again shades and sounds coming from the worlds of pop punk and occasionally the band will dip back into the 90s with some noisier heavier guitars that seem almost like they're lifting some inspiration from grunge for an album that is so blatantly influenced by pop punk it is very noisy and abrasive record sure and generally I like that about the album I just wish the singing and the lyrics were actually a little more bold and were just less cliche more surprising and actually worth remembering like in the case of the song if this store doesn't kill you I will that song seems like such a funny self-aware interesting moment for the record and the band and unfortunately they don't continually deliver moments like this on the record and instead just devolve into the kind of diamond doesn't whining that turns me off about a lot of modern Bob pumpkins times emo bands for people who are hardcore into pop punk music I could see them enjoying this album but there just aren't really that many special qualities about this record and definitely not as many as I had hoped there would be given how much I liked the teaser tracks I'm feeling a light at-6 on this thing Tran session have you given the sound imma listen did you love it - Jade it what would you rate here the best you're the best so should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe have a nice day bub forever

another episode of the needle drop podcast and in this episode we have two guests we are interviewing two creators YouTube content creators from across the net hailing from the UK and Russia two of the content creators who you might know from the growing community of commentary channels we have no fuckers aka the Moscow sadboy and we have pyrocynical aka Tony uh Bama Tony Bennett no man will be dead in a week it will but you know in this episode we're going to talk about their channels the commentary community I'm sure lots of memes and regrets and personal information will come up in the middle of this episode too and I believe that we also have leafy online as well as is that true hey guys its leafy look into a brand new video leafy how are the memes biting today it's pretty good spring no shots fired leafy by the way that was just a little meme here and there okay yeah little meme in here and there it's okay sorry it's too late guys I hear the other keemstar drama alert intro it's too late it's too late 10 10 ready posts out the focus is abused leafy on the internet don't give a fuck as a plot him to defend himself ok so you guys already just opened up the keemstar floodgate I'm wondering if we should get into that now or if we should just come to it later after we do a little bit more introduction here uh whatever is more comfortable for you to I'm fun to tackle any topic at the moment alright so uh give me a little bit of background first pyrocynical then no fuckers as to what exactly you guys do on your channel why the fuck does anybody watch your your your answers on ten okay justjust give me a short little elevator pitch here you know okay so if anyone is watch my content they've clicked on it until accident I'm pretty sure my entire following is people accidentally clicking on my video like it's it's just a horrible mistake honestly it's it's commentary channels with horrible clickbait titles no substance whatsoever and probably some kind of csgo sir for some kind of gameplay background pretty much hmm it's just a book being serious it's more about uh it's a weird one to to pinpoint because it can be varied in a sense because originally I think commentaries tired up as people talking about life stories in a sense and when I say life stories it was either smoking weed or yeah was either smoking weed or almost died because he like someone tripped over me like almost died experience like open almost died phase there's like seven stories and I think three of them about like the same channel you almost died three of the basics that we basically retell stories of each other if it's in the video uh so they would have started off in a sense as life stories but then they evolved into more of like a reaction commentary sense so it's taking someone's video whether that be like some really old 2012 meme that's gone super viral or something more recent that people have found out I mean for example with me what I do is I used to find the videos on myself and I still do in a sense but I've got like a subreddit page set up now where people like suggest things to me in a sense I mean there's there's a lot of garbage you know I mean it's like some kiddo will show me a video and it's like oh look my mate made a minecraft channel can you rip into it I'm like he's clearly an eight-year-old boy he's got like three views I'm not gonna rip it into him because that's like the most douchiest thing to do like you've really got to be careful when you do a video on so cynical sorrow cynical is making fun of kids yeah I don't make about the kids the fuckers the keemstar insurgent he's already exposed me uh basically you've got to be really careful to avoid to pick on people that in a sense can't take it which i think every channel has made the mistake of doing in some sense you know I mean you've got to make sure it's someone who serve because what I've noticed recently is and this is anything there's a fluff them to defend himself Roman Roman covered this I think it was either yesterday or a few video a few videos ago and it was basically uh you've got these people that right to contact like me or leafy or Roman and they're self-aware in a sense so like they'll make a video saying they want to marry us and all this stuff but like they're basically like internet trolls in a sense like Roman despises them because they're basically trying to leech off bigger youtubers and get their attention so they get a video made on them which is totally true I agree with that but in the sense it's kind of like a safe thing to make a video on because you know you can go in like pretty hard on them and they can take it because they're self-aware and they're like ironic you know I mean like it's all it's all a mean yeah so this is it they're just right there is being crazy on camera because they're looking to be kind of you know Oh lead in a way not exactly literally yeah I'm only night knows I need I'm not mad because I don't don't get any pussy myself obviously on YouTube so that's the problem well I think I think once um you know somebody as infamous as a Katie triggers me I think once pyro finally just fully passes on her she'll just kind of continue down that rung of you know and you're you're the next one down right so I mean trust me I made a video a video Roman made an entire video shittin on my base I'm good you had you had to wait you have to wait until she actually tries to get your attention well you can't you can't just do it right she has no dignity anyway so maybe she would do it even after I roasted her for maybe hold ten minutes pretty much shit you know just check our channel like just got a printout of your face when you were like sixteen just kissing yeah like just just go tomorrow on her channel we see like Roman Roman no fuckers please please take me to Russia okay so so you've set up essentially here kind of the video style that that you're talking about a Roman you know what are you doing in the community that's that's sort of any different from what people can typically expect from from these videos you know sort of what what is your style that your your angle that you kind of take when when you're making these videos you know keep in mind to the audience that you know I've been conscious of you on Twitter for a while but what has brought you closer to my attention recently was that you did a video about keemstar and you also did like a diss track and then you proceeded to review the diss track in insert evasion sir like 20 videos on came stock to be fair I think at this point half of Romans channel is done well he reviewed his own diss track in sort of an anthony Fantana style it's quite funny actually like not not so hard jacket i just say and then roman can say sting but it actually reached the point where keemstar was contacting me trying to get Roman to tell me all his video he says like get get the fuckers to delete all these videos or I'll block you or make some kind of video exposing you also there well messaging other people too delicious what a delicious threat okay well anyway so basically what I do I think with the way I am different I try to differentiate by ok so I have a few things first of all uh I'm obviously I know Russian rights and I think you can bring us those juicy Russian memes from a class exact right exactly because there's a lot of like bullshit happening in the Russian community and you know just stupid did you if you saw my videos about this guy that's the Russian dude a youtuber with over 1 million subs who pretty much like faith his own fucking death and faked being attacked on stream every time i did i did i did see that i video i did see a video he's such a fucking idiot and it's just like kids believe him and it's so bad it's just like the most the worst shit I've seen on YouTube pretty much doesn't just nothing like that goes beneath this level so it just making videos about that I think is really nice and I you know just me I'm trying different she ate by trying to make like basically we know what with pyro and leafy they just make commentaries like all the time and I try to you know sometimes throw in something else like make maybe make like a diss track or some kind of a parody like a date of view or something like that so you know even though I'm still being called a leafy clone which is a title I will never be wait probably in my life I'm self still you know try to make other types of content and basically you know differentiate from you know because this my whole like problem with YouTube is because like what I think of myself is that I will I probably would be able to make like better cancer that I do inhale just if I had more time I mean people like does this uh like what prejudice about commentary channels on YouTube currently because as soon as people find out that your commentary channel if you talk shit over a video game and they just think you're cancer like straight away it's really it's cuz it's oh it's because I I mentioned this earlier it's cuz it's so over saturate you know I mean so people have this like initial hate forage in Armenia it's like whether it's out with a gaming channel you know if you're a big channel log with the following I let's say markiplier and you've established a fan base you find you can do whatever you want but if you're this upstart gaming channel people will be like we don't need another gaming channel fucking out is like 50 of you look at your kappa pewdiepie yeah exactly that they literally just compare you to were whoever you know like for example me and Roman have been called leafy clones so many fucking times I think it's become like a meme now like when people say it's more self-aware but originally they were being full-on serious and it's like yes because leafy was at the comments of my video that went viral about the guide the Russian did like oh yeah on a Romans videos went viral and it got absolutely shat on like it's I think the dislikes like nearly 50 50 or something at this point yeah it's just it's just so retard that that guy you covered actually Roman that Russian guy he's just I don't eat it's so retarded cuz it's minecraft youtuber right and it's literally his channel has devolved so much because he used to do Minecraft videos minecraft mods' and now it's literally his profile picture on YouTube it's like a happy old man like a Minecraft man right and you see in the videos like this such a contrast you see happy man in the youtube profile pitch a happy old man and then in one of the thumbnails she's a guy she did agree me with his hand stays awesome yeah just start it's such a it's just like the video is basically fuckin Isis beheading challenge like however it's listen like a fucking like there's like a video of him like fuckin Isis members break into his house or something like that oh one of the points Roman made news video him sir basically he would the guy that Roman talks about he pretended to work get his apartment set on fire yeah then people search the image up and he literally just took a stock image of a burning door and then he makes the excuse later saying oh yeah it's a stock photo but that's because I don't want people to know where I live would you get would you even do that in the papers it's clearly licensure given your line is our self and he just keeps bullshitting more stuff cuz here you know what happens right we've all told that one little white lie then you tell another lie to cover it up but this guy is just next-level is literally just lying off a lie at this point but it is hilarious so we're also gonna have a boxing medicine with another guy actually happening yeah I'm looking forward to it are you there you gonna go no I'm gonna go okay yeah it's like another CT very very sure you should actually go though I just vlog it like lasers no fuck I said yeah you see gotta get punched in the background but you shouldn't like you should go the reason why Russian community is pretty cool is because like basically like in Russia there's like this thing there's like a called versus battle basically it's a right like Russian Russian people in like the Russian rap game they like do rap battles with each other like in a tournament or something and like there were that two big issue burrs in Russia or like both with like a million subs and they actually got got onto this like show and had a proper rap battle with each other and that's like what you never see like on the you know western side of the you know you see like diss tracks like rice gum or whatever but not like actual to youtubers like just no general you know meeting meeting up in front of a child and actually rappin it's pretty fucking awesome um yeah okay so you guys have given me kind of like a you know a bit of background on your channels and what exactly you do going back earlier to something pyrocynical said when you guys are picking videos to commentate on picking memes to commentate on you're talking about sort of having to be careful about what exactly you're talking about because of the person who you're talking about there could be repercussions to what exactly you're commentating on you know and let's sort of describe and you know get in clear exactly the kinds of videos and things you guys are looking to react to you know you're not like starting up the channel hey Blazers no fuckers here Romo knows the best intro just everyone you have I love it so much and you know today we're going to get in - today we are going to look at a video of you know a cat cuddling up with a dog and it's just going to make everybody feel really good by the time we're done with the video and I wish it was like that I wish you was like what everyone along and it's it's a little thing with you know you guys are looking for stuff that is specifically like eliciting like kind of a cringy really yeah it's a it's that kind of reaction that even if you don't tell your viewers hey guys you know go on this person's Channel and tell them that they're a fucking moron and they should die um you know it's it's the kind of thing that when people see it they just inherently want to do that no matter what you tell them even if you tell them just to not do that sort of thing yeah which I which I know guys do do I know you guys just try your hardest to tell them not to you know so you want me to go first or joint Roman - just about cable you can go first okay sure uh yeah I've actually had that come up a few times with what you were talking about then uh because I don't think anyone on YouTube has ever explicitly said attack this person channel because that that's pretty much suicide you'll have all the fucking social justice warriors attacking you Plus as well it's a pretty scummy thing to do sure uh I've noticed is that there is a huge lack of people attacking channels I mean with Roman Romans pretty much excluded from it because he's never really attacked anyone there uh I guess couldn't take it in a separate analysis and it was like a story I can tell like a divine girl remember that they made the video about like vines and I don't remember that I remember leafy making a video on a bouquet I can I can I can I can I can tell you now well yeah I've meditated you could tell made out of I've made a video like two weeks ago something like at the beginning of the month it was about our basically like reacting to a bunch of vines and I was like the vines are like just fucking like jacksepticeye and markiplier just fucking having sex or something like that's literally like oh yeah I remember now yeah so basically like I made this video and uh the girl who like runs this account she's like to play the video of yourself crying or stuff like that and I didn't know what to like say but like basically like the whole fucking tumblr and vine community just the whole like gay shipping community of tumblr just went over to my like channel my is just my even my Instagram my Twitter and everything and I was just like attacked by fucking everyone being like cold like a would like the most ridiculous insults and shit and you know it's just it was just fucking stupid so but like the worst part about this is that like keemstar is like trying his best every time I'm I like every time I fuck up or something he's always there to like try to fuck with me pretty much basically he's my James does shitless basically so anything Roman does like he fucking Breeze in the wrong direction keemstar leader he were he won't ever report on it but he'll like trying to intimidate Rome and saying all the parents on the line I'm gonna call them like what it's bullshit like it keemstar is pretty much infamous now for just messing around with people like I I know some people that have been in Skype calls with him and he'll just like constantly try and fuck with you and stuff I mean to the point where it gets incredibly obnoxious but like yeah so once you kind of understand that h-he was facing millions uh making videos and Twitter saying how like I'm a fucking asshole like I make girls cry and shit like little kids cry and he like he's he actually made a video saying that he made like tweet saying that he's got like the girl your parents on drum alert already like an interview but actually like the the thing is that the go herself we actually like friends now serif I guess because we made up that girl the one who was like crying but she actually like fuckin despises Kingston she was not ever like going on drama lot or anything so he's pretty much Kim says just pretty much trying his best to you know just fuck with me anytime you can just do anything keemstar if anybody doesn't know is a youtuber who runs the dramaalert YouTube channel which is a channel where it's kind of like a fusion between philip defranco and TMZ if all the drama were centered around youtube but it's actually a perfect comparison i've never thought of it like that he's a philip defranco TMZ who is um a gnome who loves popcorn and he tries to hide his gnome heritage under a baseball cap but not working no heritage well I mean you know no heritage it goes back a long way and I mean there I'm sure keemstar himself is thousands of years old gnomes live very ripe old age and live in the souls of small children to stay alive standing himself yeah so on a regular basis he sort of makes these videos where he in a very delusional fashion convinces himself and maybe some of his viewers as well that he's delivering the news when in fact he's just kind of you know throwing out a bunch of allegations about various youtubers and yet popular internet personalities just for you know Internet drama and views and for whatever reason you know a lot of these people who he reports on on a regular basis you'd think if he's a journalist he's a reporter he's trying to remain unbiased and sort of stay out of drama himself but for whatever reason he sort of embroiled in a lot of very dramatic online battles with you know your your commentary channels and your other youtubers who you know he sort of digs up dirt on and sort of delivers it as soon as possible on his YouTube Ron is Twitter without actually vetting any of the information it has the abyssal he has top falls in supple files fun anybody sit on swing yet swing back up yeah yes I would recommend anybody listening to this watch the video idubbbz recently made about uh about keemstar because beautiful video that video is pretty hilarious it's blowing up you know it so I think it's a think it's Ian smoke spewed video I think and now it's 2.6 million views now so yeah yeah it doesn't that make it as much food should it I think it is I think is yeah it still get interaction because like there's just so many people in the community that don't like keemstar as a person but like they don't want to speak up about him in a sense but like him he knows that you know I mean he knows that people don't like him and he knows that no one will speak up about it because they're like intimidated by many a he likes it that way but in Ian's or fucking just idubbbz as a whole he's gone over such a weird transformation he's gone from fucking overgrowth Let's Plays and slowly my Gangnam style yeah yeah and now he just became this self-aware Jesus absolutely just yeah exactly Savage he's become a lot more cancerous but in the best sense possible he's just such an amazing you too but it's a how self-aware and how Mimi he is he's out like that when I told you about the hope you'd apply transformation that became a lot more cynical and self-aware idubbbz is like that but like literally tenfold it's just insane the transformation it's good though in every aspect you know I can't I can't judge but it's just amazing how much it's like I what I'd like to call it now I'm probably going to trademark this shit just call it the YouTube effect it's the more time on YouTube the more pessimistic and cynical you become I guess you just found the like what he really enjoys making like you know maybe maybe in five years you're gonna be like I don't know do it fucking family vlogs or something oh so much so my lease here videos on on YouTube are sort of those weird family vlogs where people are just like pimping out their family for views essentially interesting like look out keep my children are just watch my children all day so the Kennedy rec videos actually they just present people just going to have miscarriages oh Anthony do you know about that oh god no yeah it's basically this channel and they were like full-on religious like a Christian and they were like forcing it down people's throats and stuff and they were like you know with this beautiful Christian family and they had all their videos just uploading daily doing happy daily vlogs and then they do a video called my wife's pregnant with this guy the husband checks on a pregnancy thing whatever isn't she she comes as pregnant and then the very next video they have a quote-unquote miscarriage right and that again racks or millions of fucking views like one of the most viral videos on their channel it's quite funny actually because I've no it's just on youtube if you want to convey something quite dramatic or emotional have all your videos and all caps but then have the emotional yo-yo in our case yeah exactly and obviously everyone felt sorry for the like HD reproduction has everything multi like leaf events and then it's like we're being sued in like just important but yeah uh you so much it's like you know as well it's like you oh no no I have liked about this like the sexiest weed onion ship and then you go yeah and then you go to make a video titled I just fucking cuz I don't never each like my videos are terrible already the title in but that is just even worse please kill me forever happy room but then they found out a couple days later that the whole thing was staged for views mmm the entire thing was staged and they they they that they did that thing where they didn't admit that it's fake but they did in a way but they worded it really well like in a really manipulative way to no I mean I they didn't admit it was fake straight up even though everyone knew it was they said it was just an act of God or something like that it was a prank it was a guy pranked us it was a prank from God yeah it's just it's weird actually what I've noticed is uh god I hear it so many times but everyone everyone's always compelling to everyone on YouTube fake you so many fake people on YouTube but in a sense I can understand what people are coming from because I've met a lot of youtubers and honestly in my opinion apart from a few people like for example leafy I don't talk to big youtubers you know I mean I like to keep the people I talked to quite select I'm not one of those people that I mean I've got some people like fucking Jesus like PewDiePie incredible cobbler I talk to them in DM sometimes but like not really regularly still just more of an acquaintance level you know I mean and I'm happy in that sense I remember coming onto the YouTube scene about two years ago with fucking MLG Teletubbies shrek is like the worst videos ever made it any of you listening to this podcast please do not search them and I was always like oh my god I've got to meet this big youtuber I want to Mel by watch up but then there's the medical then I got then that yeah just kind of ate it's not I'm a nurse exactly I'm happy where I'm at I'm happy that I'm talking to people like making click they can so for example yeah making fucker from and you make clickbait as well like anything you say could be applied to yourself as well I know I'm not saying I'm it's not through the roast it doesn't make it any less true though yeah it is it is quite cancer yeah I remember this whole meme going around with Roman Rovers like a Roman will basically copy my videos but hehe wouldn't really but like people would take it out of context and make it into a forced meme you know I mean like that like when someone when Roman would attack one of my videos in a jokey way because what me and Roman do is we attack each other on Twitter a lot so I part the community like people think this actual beef and they start tweeting a key start to cover it but it's just like an actual it's just a joke there's just like same person calls a loser on switch yeah yeah exactly just like really in your shit and Roman would like attack one of my videos and then you get someone else respond saying what this is your videos and they just literally send a screenshot of the fucking copy/paste shortcut on someone's keyboard it's just a lot of it really takes place on Twitter but yeah it's a pretty weird community but it is a nice one at the same time if you can get past the basically being roasted every day yeah yeah and another thing that I sort of you know talking about a you know this sort of weird I don't know miscarriage thing um you know another thing that I kind of like that the community consistently does is just find these really odd internet obscurities and kind of unearth them for other people to find you know it's it's not every day that you see like I don't know some of the fucking ridiculous Russian shit that you bring up on your channel or you know that other video that I saw just on your channel today where the girl had sort of violently taken apart all those Teletubbies which which I found pretty disturbing well you are you talking about my video I was talking about your video and then I was talking about one of no fuckers videos earlier uh yeah the telescope you think oh god dude I've literally got PTSD this but whenever someone mentions tele to me I just think of MLG Teletubbies oh yeah that that's one of the that girl was the girl I did a video on she was a lot like that Katie triggers me girl in the sense like someone who's ironic and doing it for attention Jan I mean like she didn't directly send the video to me or anything you know but and that was an old-ass videos I was done in 2012 which on a side note a good thing to do is when you're reacting to a video do it on an old-ass video because there's more of a chance the channels inactive so there won't be any kind of backlash yeah but yes until like cringe reactions are very often like what I do on my channel is if you look at it it's I mostly talked about like the trends on YouTube those like stupid shit on YouTube I find like that's because like I don't know I just don't really like like sit in the insane oh my god guys the video self fucking crying it's like no substance storage for paying oh my god because the worst thing you can do and you make a youtube video is literally like and everyone does it it's repeat what you see you know I mean like no substance or no show or nothing well no that's what's so that's what so ever so many reaction channels it's no structured it's like they see something cringe oh my god that's so cringe they see something gory oh my god there's so much blood like you're not adding any kind of substance to and I gotta be honest like uh in my early days when I was making commentaries I was uh I was just fucking terrible I had no substance I probably haven't improved at all since then I've just added more force memes into my videos to cover that but still it's you just got to learn to out substance into videos and I sending like uh even you know leaf he also has you know he still makes like reactions to like crazy stuff but at least he puts like more background now so every single like think he's talking about but you go on like YouTube and search up like all these small commenting channels for like up all the videos code like the craziest video on YouTube or something and you just open the videos like a kid like sitting at 3:00 a.m. whispering his roommate exactly like a DUI issues like a hug oh my god gosh that's that's so great cheapo yeah how could you love up a pair of sleeping so much it's just horrible and it's like my step of idiocy you know you know the whole thing Anthony like 90% of all commentary channels have csgo as the background footage sure yeah yeah I just imagined I played csgo surf once and there must have been like out of the 16 people on the server I reckon about 14 to 15 of them were probably recording that gameplay for their commentary channel that is all csgo service devolved into now people recording it on bandicam or fraps to put in a commentary video you know I was talking with lieutenant Corbis about this who I know you're a big fan of because I had her on the podcast a few weeks ago oh yeah about you know sort of a lot of these cringy videos that people are sort of looking out for now you know people are actively you know typing and searching for cringe compilations and the cringy estudio on youtube you know sort of in the search bar and I remember when I was first getting started on YouTube this is not something that people looked for at all you know occasionally here and there like you know the like you would look for I don't know like the the Star Wars kid video like obviously there's that's that's an old viral video that's an older meme and that has a very like kind of strong cringe factor to it but it seems like cringe is seeing a renaissance if you will in the YouTube community and people are just like actively looking for this I don't know this kind of reaction they're looking for something to elicit I don't know well this is a cringy reaction like I think like the commentary like I think what if you just look on YouTube right now the most popular thing on YouTube currently is uh to critique something like all the channels that are blown up right now like leafy like rice gum I hate everything like I don't know HTH tree whatever great a great day under a they're all you know talking shit about something stupid like on YouTube or whatever so or react to something that's cringy like in the community whatever so I think in a sense that also like makes it more uh you know people just so shy it's escapism in a sense really isn't it because they're basically especially we greatly under a they're saying things that you agree with but you couldn't really agree with openly in public do not I mean that's why like in my opinion I perceive that kind of stuff as like a form of escapism I mean not not with all the videos like for example I'm pretty sure like people who watch rice come you know like they're not all like people that want to roast little kids daily but uh I think leaning more towards grade a on dirait he talks about relatable stuff in a sense for example people in public that say awkward things that put you in an awkward situation it's really relatable stuff in a sense and that's why it Garner's so many views because it is relatable and a lot of people like you just get like the everyman person watch it and be like oh my god this is me this relates to me you know but Roman Roman is totally right I didn't think about it in that aspect like YouTube seems to really be pandering to people basically mocking others or taking the piss or critiquing in a sense it's totally right especially a like with rice gum rice curbs channel is literally just his channel has become attacking well just roasting little kids and I mean not not in the negative sense because you know they're all probably like child pop stars and that and they can probably take it you know it that that is all his channel is because it's it's a successful brand it's a successful thing to do so why stop doing it mmm in a sense oh yeah like the most the most part that's literally the most or you know trending thing on YouTube is to critique and talk shit about others I don't know how it became like that but it is it's just it's just like what I was talking about with the whole evolution of PewDiePie nights people have became more self-aware more pessimistic and more cynical which is it's good in a sense because it adds an extra value of comedy you know I'd much prefer this then fucking funny doge memes or nyan cat or something you know it's it's definitely a lot better there's more substance to it but in a sense it does make the community more pessimistic and more hate-filled I'd say in a sense because again what Roman is saying is right you know the community has what is trending is basically mocking others or taking the piss out of others in a sense sure no it's like the YouTube community as a whole is kind of going through its like angsty rebellious phase yeah latina at the FIR a at the start it was just like you know kind of really dumb obscure vlogs that nobody really watched and I remember back in the day on YouTube you know like you could go on a part of the website and sort of see the top 100 youtubers and you know they were all like vloggers and looking fred or something yeah no no with like even earlier than him um and you know and and we're talking about like you know a around a time when like several thousand you know youtubers following you were being subscribed to you meant you were like the shit you know I'm talking about a time when you could probably look this guy up his name is renetto he was like one of the big early vloggers he's super obscure now nobody watches him anymore um you know like from an era where guys like like the Angry Video Game Nerd we're kind of getting their start and um uh you know it was pretty rampant back then that you could actually game the system pretty easily just by over and over and over making Sauk accounts and then just subscribing to yourself and there were several people who were like you know in the top-ranking channels who basically got called out or caught doing that I just look at this guy's channel and he has like a video with 18 million views yeah he was super popular back in the day he was very relevant back I've gone on his channel and he's only got like 600 she's like yeah but it's open like his very first video and it's like 18 million used yeah like he used to be very popular very relevant back in the days is that this is the earliest clickbait I meet you because it has an S in the film email and you know depending on kind of what the vibe is and sort of what the trends are you know YouTube sort of just shoves certain videos in your face you know also depending on what you've clicked on and it's kind of funny because this whole community that you know we're talking about here I was completely unaware of its existence and you know what fucking you know started to put it in my face was YouTube after I clicked on that video where I Ethan was talking about leafy and once I clicked on this video about leafy then in my you know suggested videos and my featured videos you know it was like hey watch this leafy video watch this leafyishere video watch this other video about leafy watch that and then once I watched leafy it was like hey check out this pyrocynical guy and then it like started suggesting other people all sort of in the same community yeah just like this endless loop of being suggested by other people and you know kind of in the same format are a lot of these other channels where because you should sometimes like you should somehow seize like you should somehow still I don't know how YouTube does it but in a sense like how I see it is that YouTube has a grasp somehow it like the algorithm can like see like a see like what community is what and it's like sort of like puts people between like into each other's related channels related videos and stuff so it's more it's all with interaction in that sense like for example if someone puts another youtubers name in the title so let's say it's like with King star for example when I was a woman during the h3 h3 leafy drama in the playground in so much my name was in the title of Kim's video so now I'm a featured a I'm a featured channel in his channel box and related he's a related channel related yeah yeah not featured sorry to dislike like he put yeah when you put them in manually it's like a YouTube because you got to channel boxes I mean you got featured that you put in yourself and then the one below that which is like the algorithm which chooses being a boy yeah mmm-hmm surround them actually good witty place I gene a gene PewDiePie's like related something you know actually I'm just gonna check this real quick I don't I wouldn't believe it because I've had like no interaction with the guy but I'll check real quick and I think Leif he's probably in Harrison's legally being able that I don't know now I'm not in its vanossgaming leafy drama lighting cursor yeah I was going to say earlier um uh you know these other channels where you have these people who are sort of critiquing all these feminist videos and whatever you know they're very much in a similar format to you sort of just have this static image of you know whoever I guess whatever logo the person wants to represent themselves with and they find some video or vlog that they want to react to and they just kind of very methodically go through the video and respond to whatever point is being made you know that service seems to be a really popular format as well you know sort of like wow me like breaking down someone this video is all you yeah yeah and it pretty much checks yesterday you know look it's a very popular form at right now Jen it's like those pots or thing to do they did yeah they just raised on that as well we exactly so flow Antonio look he just like Tube videos on him so like what you guys are doing and sort of between that and these other channels where you're kind of in a very debate like way like you were just saying taking a part of video it seems like the most relevant content now is content that's Conte that's commentating on other content yeah exactly that's what I've said like earlier like five minutes ago that basically yeah that's everything is just like everything on YouTube is a remix now it's good because well it's not good but it's it's more of a promoting the algorithms because like you said breaking down a debate video a response video that in a sense technically is drama isn't it and the thing is what I've learned is a drama does promote channel growth unfortunately and a lot of people like for example keemstar are aware of that and they use it to their full advantage you know I mean like for example when the h3 h3 and leafy drama went down when Ethan made the video on leafy and that all went down I got a shit ton of hate on my channel even though I was never mentioned in the video he literally said commentary channels which still includes me in a sense but I was never directly named I still got a shit ton of hate on my channel but at the same time I got a lot of views and I got a lot of subs as well because people searched out leech people probably went out of witch-hunt these channels they clicked on mine or Romans and they were like oh actually he's not that bad we might as well subscribe to him because unfortunately yeah there are a lot there are a lot of people who didn't end up sipping that kool-aid yeah yeah yeah oh these all these channels are bad all these people are terrible it was yeah it's it's a real oversight honestly I don't think anyone has the right to announce whether an entire community is cancerous or not because you're really not because I'm sure there's a lot that there's probably a lot of commentary channels were like fucking 30 40 subs and they do an amazing job and no one listens to them and they don't have their voice you know I mean like it's really I would be an absolute faggot if I made a video saying how an entire cute life for example if I said the fucking call of duty community's cancerous or like they're the worst thing on YouTube like that is such an overstatement like seriously you're literally trying to say an entire you're trying to label an entire community it's impossible to do that because there's so much diversity and so much variety you're not going to be able to give every single person a label yeah just like one exactly exactly I mean nobody will take me seriously if I just came on my YouTube channel and just been like hey guys like this entire genre is bad don't listen to anybody who makes this genre of music don't take anybody listens to it seriously the entire genre is bad it's not good just ignore it and right away I mean especially if you know is a very vibrant and thriving community of artists sort of like I don't know like the vaporwave community if I call that the vaporwave community as being cancerous or shitty like there would be people just tearing me down 24/7 yeah not like like nyle said that you know if you get hate you still like get like people who will stick around you for that make sense because like with my video that's gone viral it's got like fucking like 11,000 likes in like my past and dislikes but like the thing is is that it's still like it's given me more me more subscribers still because even though the majority of people they come on to this video they see like you know most of these people who wish my this video lack of - the thing is that they don't even bother to watch like longer than like one minute and all they say they just say in the comments like oh leafy copycat clickbait whatever right and but be like they're still like you know some percent of people who actually have a fucking brain who can actually like understand that yeah this is not actually that bad and stick around with you yeah exactly in a sense the the hey is short term but the the fans that stick around is long term and by throwing yourself into drama you're therefore giving yourself more exposure and I think people like keemstar nailed this perfectly Jeannette I mean like you've really if you want to really insert yourself into drama you've literally just gotta remove all moral guidelines do not I mean like you're literally just got to sit there and think I'm willing to throw myself into anything I'm willing to instigate anything as long as I get channel growth from it and it does work unfortunately and it's you know it's a proven method they're instigating things on YouTube and causing drama unfortunately makes it relevant therefore gives the person who made it originally more traction on YouTube that's that that's the problem with it any any big change like for example the whole situation with Ethan and Gila h3h3 being sued at the moment they are getting fucking mad views and traction because of it the views on their video that's what I'm though like it's good that ok so I'm a little bit salty about this whole topic ok I'm gonna explain my point of view now basically do you know this damn Daniel thing right sure the absolute cancers like video so basically uh I made a video about it and uh basically I got a like a copyright claim for like the whole video so I got you know I could monetize it and I got a copyright claim for using the clip of damn Daniel which is obviously I thought it was bullshit right you just use like a fucking clip of kids saying some retarded shit and you get like a copyright claim like you use the song as something it's really dumb well likely visually copyrighted the fuckin clip or something yeah unfortunately YouTube does not favor or you know sort of sand in support of the content creators that help make the site work most of the time and unfortunately just kind of bend to the whims of you know whoever comes up claiming that they have a copyright to something you know even though the videos that you guys and many other people are mating making it's it's fair game because your your remix in your dropping an opinion on something yeah you know I remember my whole first year videos had to be deleted because I used to song clips and my reviews and you know so like a few you know almost 100 videos just like completely gone just because of all that song clip stuff you know just the DMCA just like pretty much anybody could throw but you know yeah you know you are you not managed at the moment then if you're if you're managed you basically uh your channel isn't detected by all old claims on YouTube obviously if someone makes a manual claim then yeah he still goes through but the majority of those claims wouldn't have been manual it would have just been YouTube's Content ID system checking it sir because one thing to happen with angry joe was his network i think it was polaris or maker i'm not sure but they released him and just like literally half his videos got claimed it's because he wasn't under any form of protection yeah I was talking about a different thing I was talking about like how negativity brings more business and so what was talking about okay so basically I got a copyright claim on this damn Daniel video about damn Daniel and I won like at the same time I think I hate everything plotted the video about the in Daniel as well and he's got a copyright claim on his video as well right so he's got a couple claim on the video with like four four hundred cabe uses hump and I think I got like in one day so then he uploads that video like not him I think it was not him it was a I think some other person you know I posted it basically uh or in on reddit on the video subreddit and he titled the the post like I had everything gets a strike for like Dan Daniels inton well it's not it wasn't even a strike right it was a claim okay so basically that that fucking post goes viral is as hell you know and I had everything God gets like 1 million views in a day from that video talking about the claim just talking about it and it kind of gets me pissed off because like first of all it's kind of like clickbait T in a sense to say that he had a copyright strike he actually didn't have a strike right the video didn't get deleted it was just a claim and second of all is that I pretty much made like the video on the same like topic talking about the claim but actually gave it a little bit more background because the company that claims the claim then Daniel back then was called this company called Merlyn and I already had like experience with this company in the past and I know that this company is like just a bunch of scummy you know cunts so I actually gave like more information in my video and objectively I thought like my video put like more information about this whole situation but the problem is that nobody gave a fuck about my video ok but it's because I in a sense lie I wouldn't really blame my hair everything for that honest and leaving him I'm not yeah yeah I'm just saying it's because you're a smaller Channel and I do understand where Romans coming from because it is annoying and I mean Jesus if it's bad for us I feel incredibly fucking sorry for like the smaller youtubers like Jesus when someone gets to copyright strike now the new trend is to make a video about a try to shower and get the offense yeah get your audience motivated to defend you it's not a bad thing to do because I really basically you basically make a fucking video that nobody cares about get a strike on it and then make a video about this right you can get more videos more views on the street in the video but to strike like I've I've made one video in the past you know where a lot of these videos are kind of posed in a way where it's like hey you know you like this channel you like this thing that I make and it's sort of under threat of being taken away from you and that sort of thing motivates people yeah yeah and it just it's a not more with youtubers striking youtubers but it is more like these horrible huge faceless companies like Merlyn like Merlyn is this fucking terrifying shadow company I don't even know whether the idea and they I've had problems with them since the montage party days they would literally because apparently they cut they copyrighted the fucking rap battle reaction like they yeah they basically they own the rights to basically pretty much every single non royalty free audio source on ever used on YouTube now whether they've actually acquired that legally or not I'm not too sure you know because they could be one of these companies that just by those investments in them and you know because obviously they don't own it they're more of like a middleman like someone might employ Merlyn to strike it on their behalf but I think it's a bit suspicious that they have so many different resources under their belt like for example that the rap battle parody and damn Daniel book again in the same sense you know the the parents of the fucking kid that made the meme could have been like oh yeah we want some revenue Merlyn please strike these people I don't know but uh Merlyn are really even if they own the rights or not and even if it is a legal practice they are really broken in the sense they're they it's YouTube's a quality system as a whole with Content ID it's incredibly broken there is it's completely black and white either you have kind of a pretty serious a little bit they mean like one advance that when yeah when you get a yeah they made they made the money thing so now yes it's still broken like for example it's black and white really like white in the sense that you know it's good and you haven't used the alleged footage then you find if you have in any sense the BART will not try to verify any form of fair usage or anything instantly claimed instantly unless your channel's managed for example and then it just totally ignores you that is why it's incredibly broken I mean YouTube you've got this system now where it's uh it's more like money money has held the money the problem the problems were the problem with this time Daniel thing was that like it was all like manually claimed and there was like a video some guy like tricked the system he was like he made an experiment pretty much what he did was he uploaded a video called damn Daniel like just damn Daniel reaction to something right and the video was not even related to damn Daniel there was no like screenshots no like the video of damn Daniel itself in the video right but yeah the commenting climbed anyway yeah yeah yeah yeah they claimed it and YouTube is like ok ok then whatever you know basically this company goes along and just fucking claims this video that's titled them Daniel but has no clips actually of the video itself in it and you know you just go get they just get away with it you know the guy just gets a claim for his video that's just fucking hilarious because that's just so bad and this is a problem like you can pretty much claim and strike people with like no legal background because you know behind it like I had this problem with casting basically if you don't know Anthony I had a problem with my channel I had had an intro I used in every video of mine from like like past five months or more and basically I use like a song the same song and you know every intro obviously and basically a haha there like there were like two artists featured in the song one of them gave me consent like the guy who was like in the title not the one who was featuring the guy who's like the who's like the author supposed to be an author he gave you an author you sugar he owns the song and yeah yeah yeah yeah and then the second guy comes along and like strikes like he strike like four of my videos and basically I had to private all my shit because I was you know scared that he's gonna like take down my channel and he started like back but Malin means she had saying that I should pay him like money or something and if he's gonna take me to court and stuff and I was just really fucking stupid you know you're the fucking he literally is intimidating Roman to the point where he literally says I'm this became a meme Muncy literally says can we get a response then like the next day he just goes okay bye yeah like basically how it happened is that he sends me like a message okay he sends me a message saying okay like no basically he says me a message saying okay so I am this guy rice from who made this song and he was like straight up the first email he sent me he was already like threatening to take down like my channel pretty much she was like okay so I'm the author of the song right I think I need some like monetary like you know from sell you some money from you so that you we can make this alright and if you don't respond like I will take action or something like that so then I respond like okay what do you want from me like he says okay I want a thousand dollars I'm like okay so much dude he says that he's like five seconds later he replies to me says okay then like six hundred dollars and I'm like this is kind of like scummy rights because this is dude like you've been like two minutes and he's already like lower in the price maybe this is like a fucking scam or something maybe it's like not even him right so I just stopped responding to this to this dude and then like he said to me can we get a response and then just for like five minutes later okay bye and that's it then he just fucking strikes my videos that's fucking she's just so retarded yeah and then that that's another thing I got to point out which is really broken the the claimants I guess you could say have a lot more they have a lot more jurisdiction than the defendant and they in a sense really and it's really fucking stupid because if someone claims your video I mean Jesus there's even cases where someone will literally reupload your own YouTube video and strike it because youtube doesn't compare the dates or anything like that that has happened in the past don't know whether it's been marked out now but it still happened in the past um the problem is in the way YouTube is made is with the Content ID system with the claiming system there is no backlash if you make a false claim like did the worst thing that can happen is your claim fails in the video stays up that's it that there is no backlash there isn't any kind of I mean YouTube does give you this warning and it's like you know repeat fall strikes will get you banned but I don't know anyone who's ever been banned and if you've been banned you'll probably just fucking make another gmail account make the YouTube account and do it all over again you know the only people the only people who I know who have gotten banned for doing that have done it to such an extreme that it's it's habitual you know and like guys might end up making yet they end up making another account and especially if they're an obscure youtuber an obscure channel on YouTube they're not really on YouTube's radar so what are you going to do exactly it's just totally broken honestly one more thing before we get into a bit of a music conversation and we end the podcast of it is you with these commentary channels and specifically with both of your channels um you you know what exactly do you see is kind of like the the tone of the audience reception a lot of the time or exactly what is your relationship with your audience you know is it generally positive or do you you know in some ways kind of fear that there's a bunch of I don't know Katie triggers Me's kind of hanging out in the audience you know just waiting to get that piece of personal information about you where they can track you down and sort of uh no peg you after they tie you up when you go to bed at night yeah okay for me like I think doing my audiences is I mean I think like I think generally I could say that the audience of the commentary channels they're know like okay so basically like uh this like two sides of the coin here on one side like the the audience of like commentary channels they they just less like mature very pretty much younger you know we could just say then audience of like channels that are like you know HTH 3 or something but on the other side I think that like all these channels like h2 h3 and so on like their audiences just uh they're just like like I don't know like a Kaka that I said was like like frequent reddit visitors like they just basically they penned it to like one specific opinion and they have like I don't know just have like no they basically stuff that they're like favorite issue pandas they never can like stand up against it basically you know there's been some bullshit that you know HT tree is done like I think the whole situation with like don't give arsenic or platform to defend himself and so on it's really stupid which is a good meme by the way is it's it's it's on the process to becoming a meme now like someone someone today actually made a Twitter page called don't give pyro a platform to defend himself and it's only made one tweet and it's literally just tweeting at me saying don't give them a platform to defend himself and it's already got look at a thousand likes or something I think nice kind of worry aware that's kind of what I'm doing right now in a weird way to defend yourself so what was that basically like the people who follow these channels they cannot stand up against their bullshit if that makes sense but I think with me my audience at least a lot of the times I guess my like audience kind of respects my opinion but if I say something they still can contradict and I actually like that I mean I don't of course I don't like saying like I don't like any comments like you know nigger retard kys something right but I like seeing when somebody I see a lot of comments on my videos sometimes actually with really really good points and really really you know great arguments against something that I've said in my video and I actually look at it and I'm like yeah this guy's actually right so I think that's like the greatest part about my audience is that they actually a lot of the time can argue with me and not in the way when they say you know this guy's a fucking retard let's just subscribe from him shit know that they just actually you know prove their point in a very very good way and I like that a lot yeah it's like healthy disagreement and they you know and I think it's because you know you're you're sort of going in depth on a lot of topics and giving your thought-out opinions in your videos so you know people are going to your videos for those thought-out opinions you know if you were just coming on you know the microphone going oh my god guys it's so cringy at my head I think what Roman was saying was good in a sense like if anything happens to you as a youtuber your fan base will just jump on it but it is a double-edged sword no I mean if you're if you have malicious or manipulative intense then you can easily manipulate your fan base to do your bidding do not mean like for example carrying out something or hating on a specific person it's incredibly easy to manipulate your audience and it is a double-edged sword like for example if you get a strike or something your fan base will defend you to the death but let's say for example a good example of it going bad is let's say to a fan bases attacking each other right but not not in a sense with Leafeon h3 more in a sense of one of the fan bases one of the channels being incredibly smaller it's just incredibly unfair fight because you'll have this huge tidal wave from the bigger youtuber just absolutely smashing into the smaller youtubers community Janna I mean and they no matter how justified or how good their opinion is unless another youtuber speaks on their behalf a bigger one to project their thoughts then even if their opinions right no one's going to care you know I mean because people I mean people are so exact like that that's like the problem with with you know Nick cash hey watch your mouth and rice gum she made like a video about rice gum like roasting him and saying a lot of the you know good points because you know I don't like I I follow rice game he follows me back but I don't think like he is like the best concert on YouTube honestly but well he made a video at rice gum and he got like shat on pretty much because all these people came on his channel and said like basically it's a problem where a lot of youtubers have this very very well-liked fanbase that's very very manipulated and any anyone who ever dares to say anything about their like favorite youtuber they just come and share on him without even listening to his points you know at all so that's exactly like why I said it's incredibly easy to for people to manipulate their fanbase and if you have a if you're a small youtuber critiquing a bigger youtuber chances are it which is back yeah I'm sorry yeah exactly it's not it's not a fair platform or it's a lot like for example with me uh I've just saw eye tracking a little bit here I've made videos on people in the past like kids with incredibly small channels and what do is that was actually this one kid needed like a five nights at Freddy's videos and they were they weren't the best bought in the sense he was a really young kid so he gets it he gets a pass you know I mean but uh basically what was the that's a problem here that if you make a video about somebody who's big you have a danger of getting destroyed by his fanbase if you make a video about somebody who's small you get in danger by called the fucking pedophile book keemstar something you know so there's two sides of the coin here which is you know you gotta and I made a I made a video on this kid and the kid got quite he got a lot of hate and I mean a lot of hate and he was saying how he wants to quit YouTube it's too stressful for him and it actually reached the point where I had to talk about it in a video and I had to say you know this kid is young as fuck or I mean him a bit in the video but just because I have explained that he is annoying and obnoxious which I agree to this day that he is doesn't give you the right to attack his channel and tell him to kill himself and stuff and what annoyed me was as well I remember keemstar was having a go at me on Twitter and he was saying how it was quite hypocritical of me saying how I'm basically saying only I'm allowed to attack the individual you're not allowed to and that was he really fucking twisted that that ideal gentleman he really twisted that because what I was saying was if I make a video on someone because like when I make a video on someone I have the idea in my head mark what they're doing not the individual so you'd say that they're doing it stupid you wouldn't like you'd say what they're doing is stupid and it's not good but you wouldn't sit there picking on their appearance because that that is just straight-up harassment and bully and that's not right I trust the proper dude that's why I trust I try to actually say that in my videos now I should try to say before I even like starts destroying this individuals content okay I just say okay I don't hate this guy's a person he's probably like a nice dude okay but like this shit he makes is just stupid okay like it doesn't really help though because but you know myself are kind of you know make myself more secure by that because I don't you make fun of a person appearance but on the other hand people like they still go over to his channel harass him because like I have this video I made about dis tracks on YouTube and that was this guy cause like reacting to diss tracks and calling everybody arising I'm copycat and he was like reacting to my district on Kingston he said it's really like shitty and I'll made like a response to him and I said like I don't don't fucking attack this guy you know I'm just saying that he his point is stupid and stuff but actually ended up liking him like delivering his channel something because of my video so you know you still can never be sure yeah yeah it's what Romans saying as well as it's that there's a lot of herd mentality on YouTube in a sense like a lot of people will gang up on an individual but if the if one of the individuals is called out they then tend to back off and retreat you know I mean sure because I mean I mean everyone knows what fucking head mentality is at this point it's literally just you know if you're on a group of people you feel more empowered you feel more confident more outgoing and you know it combine that with the anonymity of the internet you know not a YouTube personality some kid that made the channel just a shit talk you know they'll join in and now just shit talk someone but if one of the individuals is actually called out they'll just totally change they'll probably just go into full panic mode and retreat because they've been singled out from the herd I guess you could say genomic that that has a big impact as well because uh the kid that probably did a video on Roman was just in a sense probably just with the group of people like oh yeah this kids talking shit you know when I like rice come on part of the community I bear back him up but then when Roman singled him out that's just like such a shock you know I mean and that would be the same for anyone you know it's applied universally pretty much it is anonymity kind of an important element to this video format know would you say I mean I know nobody is like completely anonymous sort of is community because you know everybody sort of you know their pictures get leaked derpy you know real names get leaked and I know that you know in your case you know you have had yourself on camera of course but you know a lot of the videos sort of seen the center around you know this surf footage and and not just because it's kind of hypnotic to look at but also you know it's sort of a sidesteps the whole requirement to I don't know be this kind of trendy looking youtuber or whatever you know even though you know your personality definitely comes through in your vocals or you know whatever kind of logo or picture you kind of use to represent yourself you know it's it seems like less about you as an actual person and more about you as you know just kind of this persona that you craft for yourself I think and I and I think there's kind of a shade of anonymity to that you know I say in a sense people like gobs and h3h3 to the sim do the same thing it is a reaction commentary just in a different style of for example uh ether Nathan Ian o dubs he has a series where he would basically shit-talk projects on cast a crap if Democrat yeah exactly and that is a reaction commentary in a sense he's watching the video he's watching the substance and he's breaking it down and analyzing it which is erection commentary book because he shows his face and he is more of a vibrant personality he's a lot more successful you know I mean I think not showing your face uh it does curb you in a sense but then again I say that boy leafy is like one of the most fastest growing channels at the moment and he's never shown his face in video except when he hits some milestone so showing your face is a little easier I think it's just pretty much when you just sit and you know make a taco a gameplays just basically you know simpler to make a video and it's you know enough to in order to like have a face cam you need to be entertaining not just with your voice but you need to like do something in the video as well because I think Y you know Ian it's all and Ethan is so successful is because you know Ethan does all this like stuff like with all these like chub and tuck like coughing in weather you know yes he makes he makes like his own force memes I guess in a sense and that is good because it bill more integrity in the community love for example if you go on the comments oh one of these videos it'll literally just be appreciate you will pop a bless or something like that like a me Mia he's made really great loops its strength yeah exactly and it strengthens the community so it is it's weird because it seems like such a little thing but in a sense it's like a really perfectly calculated business practice isn't it it I was losing all that yeah it's it's all this it's like this stuff that happened on YouTube is the HISP am and small loan of a million dollars your channel you know in a lot because you know that's his thing pretty much godly if you like noticed in the community so much like every single youtuber ever knew who leaf he was after that whole whole thing happened and you know that really you know helped him out in a sense but then you know but then there's definitely something to be said about the simplicity of the format that guys like you use you know because I think I'm a and I'm going to go against you know the whole leafy argument clone thing because I think when you assert that argument even though you may enjoy leafy and it may sort of annoy you to see people out there kind of copying that format or using that format in a way if you're a big leafy fan or whatever and leafy was kind of the first channel that exposed you to that format um you know when you make that argument I think you kind of give credence to the whole idea that people like the fine brothers had where they were advancing this idea that hey this is our reaction format so you know since this is our format and if anybody else makes a video like this they're going to comment on us saying you guys are just copying the farm brothers you know that sort of thing legitimizes the idea that oh well I should go ahead and copyright this since this is my format everybody online seems to agree so you know but the thing is it seems like the the format is purposefully simple so that if other people kind of want to take part in this kind of conversation that they should be free to do so as well you know I mean there have been dozens of channels since I started my channel that have come up where it's essentially the same format as me with the album superimposed in the corner and you know the person's placed in a certain way and the vinyls and a certain way in the background and all that shit and that's totally fine you know it's when when I was making my videos the whole purpose was you know not only to make the channel bigger but if somebody else won to do review as well you know it's I'm making it simple I'm making it straightforward the formulas is is obvious and it's right there because you know other people are different personalities than me and other people a different musical tastes than me and you know even though other people out there might be using a similar format than me they're reviewing different albums and they're giving different scores and they're giving different perspectives yeah everyone else throw an opinion to share in my opinion is just this format is it's not gonna like go like this because little it's impossible because final process are just fucking idiots like copywriting like reactions is just the stupidest thing and I don't think anybody on YouTube is gonna try and do the same thing with any format because just seeing how much backlash finebros god i think they actually they gave ethan the most amount of money to push a bluff on to defend himself they gave they gave ethan and he'll I think it was 10k or something and again that is it's a business move isn't it because you're doing it to were to look good in a sense you know I mean like none there goes all the youtubers they gave Ethan money they didn't do it as their real name that they had to be there YouTube named you not i mean because driven like people were doing it from like you know every single person who gave the money wasn't doing it entirely entirely a hundred percent from the kindness of their own heart they they at least a little part of them was like you know I'm gonna get some moral points for doing this sure in a sense yeah especially with the finebros because you know that everyone fucking shat on them everyone with two videos on them including myself anything them giving them yeah yeah exactly and then giving 10k to possibly one of most trending youtubers at the moment because of his current situation again that was a very good business practice because you know they've got extremely disposable income because they're a huge company and it makes them look good doesn't it so sure yeah to achieve another end in my opinion all right let's uh let's finish things off because this is a music channel let's just talk a little bit of music I know that pyro you you were especially hesitant to get on the top pop I thought I was gonna fuckin kill you i watch your videos and I'm like this man is like it's just a god with music he knows every genre every so very this this guy sent me so many messages and he's like well I don't know man I just don't know that much about music and I'm like dude I'm not just gonna like fucking you don't know what the fuck this record is you fucking idiot do what you think about post-punk noise garriage UK rap district mixtape horrorcore figures up Romans taking the piss below I was legitimately thinking the conversation was gonna go like that have you heard of a garage Radiohead post neo-nazi music model oh and I'm just like trying to quickly I'm trying to agree with you while googling it at the same time so I can like quickly learn about it just bullshit pretend that I know about it well one of the things that grabbed me about your channel when I first came across it was that you know your intro song is pretty much like a vaporwave remix yeah it's like synth wave stuff isn't everything yeah it is yeah I guess I guess you could say it like it's got a vapor wave it's got a chill wave vibe to it I'm just hooked into that music unfortunately line it's the hole because everyone everyone jumped on the vapor wave bandwagon in like an ironic sense I mean it's gone from main stream vapor wave now it's a you know artists like come throughs or Trevor something yeah yeah yeah I love music like that got that very wavy dreamy kind of psychedelic said yeah sure vibe to it feels very trapper trapper please if you want the trap influence you have to listen to blank Banshee blank Banshee has that vapor wave but there's a little bit attracted listen a teen pregnancy yeah I was a really good one I really loved that I was hooked on that for a couple days you know you know when you just listen to that one song and it's kind of like a double-edged sword because you love it and you want to listen to it again but in another sense you're scared that you're going to listen to it so much you're just going to desensitize yourself to it and you're just going to get sick of the song Jeremy oh sure yeah so we're all listen to a song a couple times probably stick it on a playlist a really big playlist so the chances of me listening to again is next to nothing well then I'll go out of my way to try and find the song and I'll probably just go listen to again and just bore myself of it do you like any of that kind of early chillwave stuff like you know the first records from Neon Indian or Toro y Moi or like washed out I know like a curly one of heard of his Neon Indian I've heard of some of his stuff because I take life yeah like that stuff came out in the in the late 2000s and that stuff it's like a precursor to all this very wavy synth wave music and comp throughs actually didn't come to long after them so you know you could actually consider that project sort of in in that same sort of era you know although they have they've done a very good job of sort of even though that trend in a lot of ways kind of really came and went they've done a pretty good job of really sticking to their guns and just being like no you know we didn't just like rise out of this because it was a trendy thing to do like we're literally just making this music again and again and again because this is what we want to do yeah I mean like I don't like instrumental music like much now I used to like listen to like dubstep of something like in 2013 or whatever that was your cringe phase the dubstep yeah yeah Linkin Park face yeah but now I was like nah buddy no basically like I think my favorite musical artist is uh bones actually because oh really he's just really fucking silly I thought you stopped listening to bones are you still in the bones phase yeah I still listen to I've not honestly though I listen no his music is good he did I think it was Columbine and there's literally this video which I think it was the first video Roman shown me and it's literally bones inside Columbine High School and like actually to the odd I don't even think he was allowed to be there it was like it was a pretty decently swing is my first my first exposure to bones was that mixtape that was whole that was that was a concept around Columbine yeah and I thought the whole mixtape was terrible and and then he ended up coming out with some stuff later that I liked so yeah basically like he's changing because he used to have this like very edgy oh yeah aesthetic but now like it's more over your edge a school shooters that yeah exactly but he's Bennet she's kind of changed a lot a little bit he's changed you sounds and stuff so I think I still listen to him because he actually like evolves himself as well and I still do listen to like some of the older stuff because like the song that was in Columbine actually I think it's still a really really good song as big as song is uh it's HDMI isn't it that's the one that really blew him up that's like his most success yeah it's for five million views on his channel yeah the best the best fucking song ever is a rest in peace it's just so amazing hmm have you listened do you know that one anything not off the top of my head I don't think so it's like uh it's only useless oh is it okay so then yeah I have heard it is that the one where he sort of incorporates those screamed vocals yeah it's like the crazy bass yeah yeah instrumental Spacek yeah a lot of the instrumentals off that tape are pretty fucking sick like the bass is really intense yes super noisy and oh man that trap influenced me in that Travis I'm watching the video now 30 seconds in and I already see the fucking Yeezy shoes it's not easy it's why three I think usually oh I know you're talking about it's still like it's boosts though it's like adidas boosts or whatever is yes expensive sure so you know both of you what is your opinion on sort of yung lean what what would be both of you let rate his last album oh the thing is I haven't I personally haven't listened to warlord I think I was like I was at a mate's house and he was like blaring or something and again like the thing is what you go into something about yung lean is you don't listen to it for yung lean you listen to it for the music janar mean like for example yeah like like a perfect example is Grey Goose like if you try to understand what he's saying you're just kind of a mental breakdown is it some kind of it's some kind of snake tongue you you can't understand a single thing you saying well it's something worse than me yeah but in retrospect the with Grey Goose it is good that the music is really good I like what uh because a lot of people make this argument that young lame is pretty much nothing without the sadboys and in a sense I can understand understand that because they do make really good music they're companies with the with young lean because like I can see why people like his lyrics if you can even call them that like the kind of ramblings and link's because it's kind of like psychedelic in a sense and it is nice but I'd much rather listen to most of the music instrumental which night I mean instead of like some guy just like mumbling and like I'm Jesus I've looked up lyrics for yung lean and even the lyrics like I'm genius they're just like sorry guys we don't know what the fuck he's saying you'll just have to wait yeah like in my opinion warlord was kind of shitty because like the only song from Waller that liked is Hoover and that's it pretty much because if it was fucking banger man yeah and where God was a mega Remy he yeah you still really like yung lean like in 2014-15 I guess but like he's uh unknown uh no memory yet that was a really good one but like uh - although like like I listen to a couple songs that I just didn't like it's not a standing to me it's just like an auto-tuned mess over like something like very like a washed out beat is just not like I really very much prefer bones now - yung lean because he's just I don't know at least he's he can like at least he can he he makes like actual coherent fucking sentences made like hips back to a minister necks because he realized that he was a meme and he can basically like the problem there's a problem with yung lean because he started off as a meme and now he's like a fucking hairy net heroin addict or something like no no but like I'm saying it's good like respect to him see he took the opportunity to know I mean it wasn't like humble about it like his his old stuff like gene a ginseng stripe and Kyoto that really blew up and that's that that's what people knowing for gene arming I'm looking now so like each one has got over 10 million views that's why he's known for and it genuinely is good music you know but then I think what he's tried to do is is try more experimental stuff in an attempt to branch out and it just hasn't really worked too well honestly I'll always I'll always listen to his older work like jin-sang but I'm not too sure about his more recent stuff that's where like bones because he's really diverse he has like you know yeah he doesn't fuck it up there's a he's like it's always like at least like you can listen to the end of it even if you don't listen to again at least you you know make it to the end of the track and you're like these guys don't know like a strong lyrical component to to what he's dealing to his garlic songs like his singing and stuff so it's like baron zemo's nice there there are a lot of music artists out there that like you were saying in the case of young lean that are super conscious of sort of the community of people out there who just genuinely enjoy meme humor ironic human yeah I mean nothin just in an ironic way like they genuinely enjoy memes and they you know advance memes memes I love to just wake up just got a bit of the troll face you're something good me like it was a good twenty ten mean you know there are a lot of artists out there do I think in a way just like their popularity is fueled in a big way by just I don't know how they interact with the internet and how in they almost influenced or encouraged or Steven supply their fan base with material to sort of make memes of them and then once those memes are made and people are sort of like it you know sharing them on YouTube or in other places like you know they actually don't go after them because they want them to share these memes around to sort of spread the word about whatever they're doing and it seems like there's no common thread sort of linking all these artists together some of them are incredibly mainstream like I think in the case of Drake and you know Drake to me he's a like a SMS imel's kid like yeah you know like he's he's really he doesn't take himself too seriously and he's really good at you know sort of advancing and sort of allowing people to kind of propagate these memes about him because it only means more money for him at the end of the day and then you have other artists like Death Grips for example who are sort of on the more obscure end of the music spectrum and they're more raw and more aggressive and experimental but you know they themselves are you know very happy to sort of play into the very meme aware fan base I don't know how aware you are of them pyrocynical uh it's actually interesting you brought that up the thing with Drake because uh I actually wanted to say like what do you think about like Kanye West did you think he's even more self-aware to the point that he's become a meme what do you think he's actually that disassociate from actually being so we made the song that's a lot of candy so that's a mean pretty much yeah I mean I didn't I think it was I think he's aware just the complete opposite and he's just I think he's I think he's super self-aware but I don't think he's the the type of artist who sort of encourages people to make memes about him per se but I do think he is very self-aware and he's very aware of what people say about him and he's very aware of how people receive his music I mean even beyond that I love Kanye track the whole way that he promoted his last album I think was a show of just how self-aware he was which I don't know how closely you followed any of that but the whole process was that he was continually changing the album over and over up until the release of the record changing the tracklist and changing the you know the album cover to title Kenya Luke can us has the fucking worst handwriting I've ever seen daily and so and and I was actually talking with somebody who works over at Def Jam in the promotion's Department and I was asking him you know like it seems like he had complete control over this and you know when when someone like Kanye West sort of in such a crazy way decides to promote his album like this you know is anybody at Def Jam like sweating or being like I know what the fuck he's like completely you know destroying the company or something like that and you know he was just like you know as long as it gets attention we just kind of let him do whatever he wants and and that's the thing you know every single time he would change something about the record it was reason for all these music websites to tweet about it and blog about it and mention it and which gave people more reason to talk about it you know and again I don't think it's necessarily because he's trying to make a meme or anything sort of in the way that like um for example the band Death Grips was they they put out this double album not too long ago called the powers that be and the unorthodox thing about the album was that they released the first half far in advance of the second half and the second half of the album was titled Jenni death Jenya death when yeah so Jenni death when kind of became this big meme and in the middle of the two records they actually released this instrumental album and all of the titles of the songs on the instrumental record spelled out Jenni when um yeah yeah I mean I think I think like would Kenya that is I mean he's literally is just typing up the album so that more people like get it and people become interested in it but at the same time it's a bit of a problem because he hype sup it to the points where people have very very high expectations yeah and and the Canadian mediation was not that amazing to be honest so yeah you know that's that's kind of the thing will you once you have kind of used memes in a dark way you you use the dark magic of me once you use maybe just you can never go back you'll always just talk to your name until you die you know what's much mom has used me insane mana old-fashioned memes not even once so so once you once you've used the dark side of memes and and you've hyped up with means you know whatever you're working on that high sort of so high in the way that a guy like Kanye West did there's there's just no meeting expectations yeah yeah it kind of runs is it's like what you two was saying about him changing the album and the trucks a problem with innocence that was to hype it up in a sense you know I mean there's just gonna be so big it's gotta be perfect you know sure so I feel again it's just like another business strategy in the sense you like change they're open Adam or Ferrari so this is going to be the best thing of it it's like when you've got a just fuckin people promoting their videos on Twitter so then she liked it this video is gonna be lit from it's going to be the best video ever it's just like it's nothing special it's just another video mate like alright calm down she's like the problem with with everything like this in the gaming industry for example like half-life 3 is just such a fucking meme like and basically like everybody makes means about it like half-life 3 confirmed whatever like and it's just the expectations for this game is so fucking high it's like it's it's it like you know unbeatable pretty much like I reckon it's time to die down now the half-life 3 meme Ivan it's two years ago it was like the fucking biggest meme ever but now I feel like it's starting to take it back yeah because people people literally gave up on waiting yeah just looking because valve Alva actually they're really mysterious about their games usually don't hear about it until like a couple months before our games released in the sense and valve pretty much now that they're a lot like Blizzard they don't make new IPs and they don't make new games they just invest what they've got I mean a British or valve can you know every employee can feed their family for the next five generations because the amount of retards betting their entire family to get a csgo you know yeah skill insanity I mean you know I wonder people wait for that last doom game though so I mean the others there's always a chance oh did you do you remember the backlash that the doom game got the more oh yeah absolutely it's it's weird as well because I didn't really think the beta was that bad I mean it was mediocre and it was generic but lucky we really didn't deserve the backlash it did and then again it's not like everybody loves it yeah yeah yeah that's probably cuz of the single player to be fair most people bought doom for the single player and the single player is good hmm yeah all right guys I want to thank my two guests in this wonderful episode of the podcast we have no fuckers and we have pyrocynical and I thank you guys for coming on and talked about your channels and giving your opinion on the popcorn gnome and YouTube is broken a monetization and DMCA system don't forget the memes as well and oh yeah we're talking about memes now in the meme analysis and we talked a little music and uh and I'm sure after this we're probably gonna have some dirty convos that the audience won't be privy to but again I want to thank you guys like someone I appreciate it all all of their info their Twitter their YouTube channels all that's link down there in the description box and I hope you guys have a have a good one yeah thank you very much have enough illness on the show "
iEO6FWFByFY,oh boy love these tweets keep on sending them buddy never get tired of seeing these boo hi everyone laugh in a jet tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new moon sorrow record age oh gods these guys are a finish metal band who's been at it for over 20 years now with very minimal lineup changes across their seven studio albums this is their latest full-length LP it came out in April so I'm getting to it a little late usually because this isn't usually my style of metal I've never been that into moon sorrow before it's high production semi symphonic black metal with northern European folk mixed into it I've seen some people categorize this as Viking metal as well and a lot of the stuff that is in this style it's to me it's just like progressive metal if you brought it to a Middle Ages festival but I decided to give this record a shot the fans seem to be enjoying it a lot and it's been a while since I've listened to an album in this style much less moon sorrow so and I ended up being pleasantly surprised even though this record in a lot of ways is just business as usual for moon sorrow you have the bass black metal instrumentation which is elevated by all this epic arranged instrumentation the horns the keyboards which usually have these very area theory Allah that fill up the space around the brittle black metal guitars and the blast be drumming and the retched vocals of course when transitioning out of these heavier black metal moments we have these folk instrumental breakdowns with some flute or some strings or a very bony jaw harp which pops up again and again and again throughout this record it's an instrument I know Moonstar has worked with before not typically the the kind of instrument that you would catch a freaking metal record much less a black metal record maybe because it's an instrument that doesn't really sound that menacing or but the band certainly plays it off as if the jaw harp is just metal as you also have these ice-cold choir harmonies that pop up throughout this record that sound like the ghosts of Viking warriors coming back from the past to sing and back up the band triumphantly it kind of gives the modern black metal sound that the band has a very ancient edge in edge as sharp as an ancient sold and all these massive layers of instrumentation build up into these 1215 16 minute long songs that come together into an album that's over an hour long it's a little overwrought but the playing isn't so flashy that the band kind of just Bob's itself down in technical ability or anything like that I actually think these songs are quite coherent and fluid the various phases of each song segue into one another really nicely with some really good crescendos and tension builds and quiet instrumental breakdowns and there's not really an element to moon sorrow sound here that kind of sounds like it's the the weakest link or like it's not doing as well as the other parts I mean the heavy black metal passages are throttling and they're exciting sometimes they're triumphant they're usually pretty melodic but harsh enough to be menacing the folky instrumental breakdowns are usually very majestic and beautiful pretty and all of these elements come together again into a very fluid set of compositions this album isn't really a clutter at all some artists when kind of extending past six-minute mark their songs can become kind of a mess and I guess I'm not surprised that moon sorrow was able to kind of avoid this I mean they've been writing songs in the style for so long you know they're kind of one of these bands that kind of slowly over time just fine Tunes their style and it's as a result of this fine tuning that these very long compositions have a strong sense of direction to them each point feels like it has a purpose like it's guiding us to the next section of the song very nicely nothing draws out for too long now the production it is a little sanitary but I guess I can kind of understand the band wanting to avoid noisy instrumentation or just kind of a bit of clutter or grime in the mix here because there are so many layers of instrumentation here you know you're talking about the base metal instrumentation with some possibly horns and keys and choir vocals there's just a lot of sound going on in these tracks it would be kind of hard to make a very raw black metal recording with so many pieces of instrumentation being worked in and even though the production it is kind of clean for black metal and for my personal taste it doesn't take away from the performances on the record which usually feel very live and aggressive I think the album is very balanced for what it is the band is able to make these metal passages sound visceral sound dark like a good metal passage should be but these tracks are also nuanced and beautiful too thanks to all of the folk influences that run throughout the record and no one song and the track listing here sounded all that bad or unnecessary to me or redundant either although I guess maybe you could argue that this album isn't anything too new in comparison with much of Moon Sorrows past discography I guess you would just want to listen to this record if you want to hear the band do what they usually do a little bit bigger a little more grand a little more ambitious but of course there going to be some listeners who don't find enough surprises in this and as a result they don't care for it and there are going to be some listeners who find the inclusion of full instrumentation into these black metal compositions of kind of corny and cheesy and believe me I understand there some groups in this style that I just cannot get into at all like for example of a incorpor clan or a group that I know has ties to moon sorrow and I expected to be pretty indifferent to this record going into it but I was pretty surprised at how much I liked it and how much of these songs were actually sticking with me you know it's kind of hard to call any single track on here catchy since they're all very long compositions but there are many parts throughout the record that I thought were pretty awe-inspiring I guess I'm just really impressed with the developments like the song meme ears well if I'm pronouncing that correctly which kicks off with these very heroic and almost dreary melodies then goes into these triumphant just galloping huge black metal passages which eventually gives way to these cool little folky instrumentals also the very dark deep spoken word moment on the song play Grove which I thought was kind of menacing and the very hypnotic group chanting that follows after that which I don't know just made me think of my Viking ancestors that I'm sorry I have no biking ancestors all I'm saying is that there are highlights on the handful of tracks the handful of long tracks on this record and obviously if you're into this style of metal try this album out right away but even if you're not and you're just morbidly curious and you're just looking to you know give yourself some exposure to something that you wouldn't necessarily listen to give this thing a try too because there's a lot of things that are accessible about this record you know the metal passages they're not too harsh they're not too heavy they're not too aggressive although I wouldn't call them generic either you know even though the vocals are kind of standard at points they occasionally break out of the usual black metal wretch to deliver some cracked vocals or sound like I don't know some kind of weird forest troll if you want to hear some metal it really goes on a musical Odyssey and throws in all this great arranged and just extra instrumentation without losing the rawness of the performances then give this album a shot I'm liking it I'm recommending it I'm feeling a strong step into a light eight on this thing transmission have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that white if you liked please subscribe please don't die Anthony Fantana moon sorrow forever
