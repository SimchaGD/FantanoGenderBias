I4YvFQPplxQ,ninh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new off record wasted years this is the latest full-length LP from California hardcore punk outfit off a band that is pretty much infamous for its throwback punk rock sound a sound that literally works off the blueprint of Black Flag's nervous breakdown 7-inch an early release from the hardcore punk outfit which the lead singer of off Keith Morris was on in the short span of time in which he fronted the band Black Flag then he actually went on to Front Circle Jerks and the other members of offer seasoned vets as well bring experience and connections to seminal acts in punk rock or just underground rock in general and to be completely honest while yeah this record this band is a bit of a throwback I don't really mind this flavor of punk rock coming back especially since I think the sound of the nervous breakdown EP as well as a lot of the tracks from the first four years compilation from Black Flag had a lot more potential than they were actually given in the short amount of time that these songs were made the return of the sound was it's had an offs debut first four EPS back in 2010 release that was a fantastic continuation of these old hardcore punk tropes except with more clarity more composure I think more maturity too but in a good way it's like at this point hardcore punk finally has the experience and the knowledge to justify the incredible anger it's always harbored for all these years and it's hard for me to boy them I love this record down to nostalgia considering how well this sound is being performed on this thing not only that but a lot of the issues addressed in the lyrics feel pretty current now when off came back with a self-titled record in 2012 it was a bit of a redo the same sound a lot of the same aesthetics although a little less impressive because of the redundancy and sound and every in comparison with their last album and on top of that the mix on this thing was slightly out of whack the guitars and the vocals just kind of felt out of proportion however these mixing issues seem to have been fixed on this latest release from off wasted years there's a lot more instrumental balance on this LP although in comparison with previous releases I would say it's a tad heavier but outside of that offf style really hasn't changed in any significant kind of way they are still delivering high-octane punk rock with a vintage flare that couldn't be more convincing if they haven't impressed you yet with their previous releases chances are they're not going to be impressing you with this one and if they have been impressing you I guess the question is how long can they continue doing it as they seem to just be kind of repeating themselves for me personally as long as off continues to do this sound well and do it justice they will most likely have my ear in some capacity and for me doing the style of music well means memorable riffs it means visceral performances it means hearing Keith Morris's uncompromising ly angry and socially aware lyrics as indebted to the Past as they are I think off makes really captivating punk rock music with an infectious energy punchy messages and relatively short song lengths as far as what these songs are about I'm loving a lot of what off brings to the table like being voted out by the powers that be being broken down ground up in the land of the free it's moments like this where Keith Morrison's incredible sarcasm as he recites patriotic lines like this that really makes the track same goes for the track red white and black where the lyrics address things like your possessions being repossessed and surveillance or the song all I can grab which is a track about extreme greed or over our heads which seems to be a track about the imperialistic wars that are being waged right now as I mentioned before the riffs on this thing a lot of power chords they're pretty speedy every once in a while off really changes up the pace by doing a slower riff maybe you break down something a bit heavier a bit more menacing like on the track no easy escape everyone while there's a chaotic guitar solo or a bright wailing guitar lead so yeah there is a very slight degree of variety on this LP but it's just 23 minutes of incredibly fast aggressive socially aware music so it does tend to run a little homogeneous and maybe this becomes more apparent when some of the lyrics on these tracks aren't that gripping because then all that you really have to ride on are the riffs which tend to sound similar to other riffs on this very album like Legion of evil or wasted years the title track on this thing and the similarities run even deeper when comparing these tracks to songs that off.have release on their previous records if there's more than one way to skin this cat off is certainly not interested in finding out about it they definitely flirt with that idea on the track you must be damned which is one minute and 50 seconds long which is almost like progressive rock length for off and generally a lot of the songs on this LP are longer than tracks on previous releases they're not a single song on this record that dips under the 1 minute mark however these longer songs and this extra effort on this record doesn't really add up into any meteor or more detailed songs any increase in ambition and the songwriting style that off brings to the table off does not use this time to make their hooks stickier off doesn't use this time to add any real major surprises into this record I can't say I'm disappointed because I did get what I expected from off I got a good hardcore punk record however I feel like off is at a point where they have proven that yes they've resurrected the hardcore monster it's back from the dead however I feel that well why not experiment with it a bit without completely bastardizing it and continuing to do the genre justice or at least change up the riffs or add more melodies things that are going to make these songs feel distinct from other songs the band has previously recorded if any group is capable of doing either of these two things it is off I have complete faith in their ability to go down that road if they so choose to but as of right now I'm just kind of feeling a decent too strong 7 on this new LP of theirs transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana off wasted years forever 
axr3eLz-URQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tony ballina record distant dismissed Tony Molina is a California singer-songwriter who is following up a seven and she dropped on Matador Records a little while back as well as the embarrassing times EP he has also put in time as a vocalist and a guitar player for the punk band of ins a band whose sound is loud it's lo-fi it's poppy it's sweet its melodic its energetic a lot of these same characteristics carry on into Tony's music as well the dude has an addiction to power pop groups like Weezer and underground or indie rock from the 90s like that is her junior or Elliott Smith heat miser Seba dough plus a lot of the songs that Tony writes and records are vibrantly colored with harmonized super harmonized guitar solos that occasionally show off a classical music influence as well so you know there's definitely some Fitness underneath all that grime on Tony's records and the songs that this guy brings to the table on his LPS on this record are a mix of ballads very pretty interludes and sort of stone-faced power pop rockers all of which are packaged into super short song lengths typically landing somewhere in the thirty second to one minute mark now this LP that we're talking about in this video was put out late last year was a bit of an underground release when under the radar this year Slumberland records is reissuing it it's 12 songs the album itself runs just under 12 minutes and every single one of these tracks are boiled down to their most basic of elements there might be a catchy riff or a vocal melody starting off the track and then there's a verse and maybe if you're lucky the song ends off with a spectacular melodic guitar solo but Tony's ultra simplified approach doesn't necessarily mean that there is a lack of effort on these songs I mean there is an immediate sweetness to nearly all the songs here and the guitar solos are just really fun so not only on a level is the instrumentation on this thing impressive but this is a bit of a concept record a break up record so many songs on this LP about heartbreak the end of a relationship moving on past that initial breakup point Tony sings about missing this person going crazy being around this person having been in a relationship where this person would would build him up just to tear him down and even though Tony's lyrical approach on this LP can be pretty basic at times every once in a while lyric will stick out that's like huh like the glass is only being filled for the chance to have it spilled Oh despite all the depressing breakup imagery it is a fun little album and an LP whose pacing is so fast these songs start and so quickly that I mean it's it's hard not to repeat the album the album is over and done with and starting right back at the beginning before I even know it and the beginning doesn't sound too much unlike the ending you know at least when you're first listening to the record so it's kind of like to me this album is the musical equivalent to a Jif a gift a guy a guy but it's not just how fast these songs start and end it's how quickly they surrender their sweetest moments like a cheap one-night stand that gives this record an incomparable amount of replayability I will try to go into the songs themselves a little bit but they are so freakin brief all the guitar riffs are fairly catchy and straightforward they have a really crunchy tone to them the bass the drums are hidden away in the background the vocals seemed overdubbed for a nice very layered effect that makes them kind of pop out it's a rough recording but the songs shine through even with the sort of apathetic indie rock vocals that are layered on top of this thing I love the vocal melody on the track nowhere to go the song can't believe has one of my favorite chord progressions on this entire LP wandering boy poet is a really nice acoustic ballad on this thing nothing I can do is this really slow heavy distorted monolithic in comparison to the other songs on here slow burner the sick-ass roof is really nice pretty acoustic intro sick-ass riff tony's got a sense of humor and the song don't come back is one of the longer tracks on this LP and stands out was one of my favorites because it has just this genuine feeling of over you girl this is over not only that but it has this really awesome awesome set of chugging guitar riffs on the back end of this song that are matched with vintage in beanie man and the ending song has a really pretty melody to it that gives the LP a sense of finality but the ending of the track is just so abrupt and brings it right back to the start if you are listening to the record like on an mp3 player or on a CD did they have the sound on CD I don't think so to me while this record really where's its influences on its sleeves it's an album that to me and this is something I've always felt for a very long time given that I've been a huge fan of punk music for many years but it really really highlights the power of the short song which we all know has been scientifically proven as a superior mode of musical expression just listen to this 100% true song about short songs short songs are great they don't repeat and repeat they just give you what they've got and then they're complete who wants a minutes worth of ideas stretched into four if you really love that refrain and you wanna hear it some more just play the song again as soon as it's over me to the next short song I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen and a very short listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Tony Malina distin dismissed forever 
csJSEJmKjYc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new timbre tambour record hot dreams these guys are a band the musical project of singer-songwriter Taylor Kirk whose earring deep voiced ballads have been captivating me for like five years now there's a lot of vintage fulk Americana rock and roll rhythm and blues rockabilly doo-wop and country music influentially flowing throughout timber timbres records it's music that really goes back in time especially on the project's latest two releases and this is music that isn't just looking to the past with the style of music or the genre that is playing out on this record but also in the production as well a lot of the instrumentation especially the guitars the keyboards the vocals had this springy echo on them this really nice bright 50s style Sheen however do not take this band as a simple exercise in nostalgia while a lot of the sounds on this record are old the very dark and twisted feelings that feed into the songs on this LP feel brand new timber timbres records have a reputation for being eerie frightening kind of like a psychological thriller shot in black and white in the 50s or 60s or even like a David Lynch film with how he fetishizes the past but presents this very surreal picture of it the music on this record is music that has the makings of a fantastic serial killer it's smart its seductive but just strange enough to put me on edge it's always trying to wander in my periphery or take my focus off of it's weird behavior with a very clean outward appearance like this guy I've got your number freak oh well on timber timbres last full-length LP creep on creepin on the band dropped some of its most creepy material yet songs that displayed a really twisted view on the world of love and displayed stalker-like levels of obsession and I was looking forward to hearing a lot of the same characteristics play on to this new record from timber timber and for the most part they do however there are some noticeable improvements to the recipe this time around for one timber timber is much more ambitious with sound and instrumentation on this LP than they were on their previous four full-length releases and there are some very beautiful catchy kind of well arranged tracks on here that aren't quite so disconcerting like hot dreams meanwhile timber timber also delivers some of the most twisted songs I've ever heard them write thus far such as run for me and both tracks have spectacular instrumental finishes - lots of tasteful but flashy horns strings background vocals easily again some of the best instrumentation timber timber has pulled together thus far and the keyboards on this thing keys have for the most part played a pretty large role in many timber timber records but here they sound so fantastic amazing keyboard sounds on this thing whether they be from piano or some kind of synthesizer there are moments where I'm hearing this really kind of grainy eerie thin keyboard sound that kind of feels like I'm hearing a Mellotron or at least a mock Mellotron nearly every piece of instrumentation just sounds otherworldly on this thing I just feel like I'm really being transported back to the pirate ship of 1950 if you know what I mean like a ghost pirate ship but like for a whole decade not actually like a real pirate ship the songwriting for the most part has improved in a lot of ways the tracks on here are dynamic they're multifaceted they're not quite as hook driven or verse chorus verse oriented as tracks off of timber timbres previous releases which make these songs a little less hooky a little less sweet on the ear a little less gratifying from a pop music standpoint but so many of these tracks feel like an emotional and instrumental journey but still the verses that are on this record are delivered in the very deep baritone Stern vocal of Taylor Kirk the chorus is on here blossom very beautifully and the instrumental interludes on these songs either uplift these track sent two beautiful heavenly soundscapes that really alter the mood of the song or they just submerge them deeper into the depression that they were built out of that is exactly what happens on the opening from this thing beat the drum slowly which for me is a bit of a theme song for timbre Tambor a kind of a mission statement I think it sets the tone of the album really well with some lone acoustic guitars some chili bells a bit of woodwind what kind of feels like a vibraphone in the mix there are also these thudding baritone guitar riffs that march in step militaristically with snare drums it is dramatic as hell it is like listening to an army of zombies rise from the dead the instrumental sounds amazing all this earring is hanging in the treble side of the spectrum the bass is heavy its thick they're all these sound effects thrown against it - they're all these sound effects thrown into the mix - this song really sounds like a horror movie and yeah while in a sense the music is kind of campy it sounds like it was recorded and orchestrated long ago on some kind of Hollywood sound stage but that is the very reason that I love it not only that timber timber embraces this aesthetic so well but they drive it into uniquely dark territory I think it's a great reappropriation now the lyrics of this song which really to me carry the theme of timber timber as a whole speak of nostalgia of a time that seemed illustrious beautiful a golden age in its heyday but now it's just kind of a burnt-out hollow dead depressing shell of its former self that is slowly going psychotic sitting in a very dimly lit room drinking whiskey watching Lawrence Welk reruns the song hot dreams the title track off of this thing when my favorite songs of this year is a wonderful beautiful waltz and it's a love song but the obsession runs deep I want to wake from hot dreams of you baby I want to write to someone so true but still there is a little bit of subversion in the lyrics like on the line I want to follow through with all my promises and threats to you baby and why I do love this song it is one of my favorite timber timber tracks period I love that the band veers off of that love path to dive into some other song topics to like bring me simple men the song that has a really twangy dramatic instrumental that feels like it could fit snugly into an epic spaghetti western I love the watery keyboards or guitars on this thing that sounds so warped and lyrically the song delves and the themes of pride pretense swagger and competition eating up the male psyche and wanting to surround oneself with people who are sort of free of that baggage seems like an innocent enough desire however I'm not so sure that this song doesn't have kind of a darker component to it lyrically that I haven't picked up on yet there are tracks on here that really throw that in your face though like Grand Canyon while it is one of the more strikingly beautiful tracks on this entire LP with an uplifting instrumental finish without even paying attention to the lyrics I just get choked up over what's going on here and Taylor Kirk is beautifully describing some kind of flight over the Grand Canyon area seeing clouds shadows on the ground below on the canyon as well as the plane shadows and then eventually in his lyrical description he says that he prays for the canyon to swallow the plane hole which I'm not sure if that's some kind of beautiful visual metaphor or if he's literally praying for a plane crash the lyrics seem to get even more esoteric for me from there on in and I'm just kind of drawn into the beauty of that the additional lyrical imagery and again this stellar effect Acula I just made up a freaking word finish the song curtains has another great instrumental feels like a sort of weird piece of 60s psychedelic garage pop with an emphasis on upbeat of the track which the keyboard rides pretty hard the bassline sounds a lot like my Sharona though this song is not nearly as upbeat and from what I'm gathering the there's kind of like an element of Fame going on here in the lyrics I'm still in the midst of interpreting it but I can't read out every vocal with the very bouncy springy echoed reverb on this track and it's unfortunate because this song and a few others too are just not hitting me lyrically as hard as many tracks from timber timbres self-titled timber timbres creepin creepin on even on the song locomotion which is a song in here that I do dig quite a bit but it doesn't feel nearly as hard-hitting as other like lovesick songs from previous releases I actually think it rehashes quite a few ideas with being a dog being a machine for this other person's love but that song run from me on this thing is is really the standout when it comes to anti love songs not only for timber timbres entire discography but maybe one of the greatest anti love songs I've ever heard the song starts off like a slow Ballard type song that reminds me a lot of something such as Elvis's are you lonesome tonight but our narrator in this track would love nothing more than for his significant other to run away run for her life I absolutely love the line on this track where he's saying that he loves the idea of her swinging gate I guess meaning that she just kind of ran through us of the gates still kind of moving now not only does this song have a great instrumental finish but right after there is another instrumental there's also an instrumental in the middle of the cell P as well on the fifth track and these two instrumentals are awesome I am so happy that timber tambour continued to put instrumentals on their records and that they came out so good one of my main issues with their last full-length album is that there were several instrumentals on it that were not enjoyable at all simply because instrumentally and just emotionally they felt so out of place with everything else that was going on the record it was like I was listening to a completely different band play the interludes meanwhile we would switch back into a totally different world and mood and vibe on the normal verse chorus verse lyrical tracks here a lot of the instrumentation on these instrumentals remains the same as some of the instrumentation on the other songs it's just that they're very well composed they have great crescendos but I guess I'm sort of left with an instrumental kicking off this record as well just like timber timbres last album I kind of feel like I'm listening to a two-act play on this thing in a sense where I'm getting four tracks than an instrumental and then four more tracks and another instrumental and I'm just left kind of hungry after all of it I feel like this last instrumental while it is good it leaves me kind of on a cliffhanger while I think timber timbres writing some of its best stuff to date I'm still not incredibly blown away by what the band is doing from a holistic album type of standpoint and aside from the ending on this thing and a few tracks just not being that gripping lyrically there is the song the new tomorrow which to me is is really one of the more lackluster songs off of this LP with verses that are incredibly underwhelming there's not a strong melody coming through there but the choruses do flourish beautifully I'm still going to come out here and say that this is the band's best collection of tracks to date better than the last full-length album which I did love so of course I love this new record as well just to smidge more I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing transition if you given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh timber timber forever 
Yc6e--9NCOs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new white hinterland record baby this is the musical project and band of multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter Casey day who is on her third full-length record with this group and album that really came out of left field for me sort of surprised me I wasn't expecting to hear a record that I connected with so much on so many levels from this band because to tell you the truth there wasn't much from white hinterlands back catalogue that really caught my attention their debut slipped under my radar and came out before I even had a youtube channel where I did this and the project sophomore full-length LP Kairos was a little too ethereal for my taste just an indie tronic record that they just laid it on a little too heavy with the reverb but no matter now we have this third full-length LP and I'm assuming that since Kairos came out in 2010 that this album has kind of been four years in the making and I wouldn't be surprised if that was in fact the case because the detail really shows the quality of the songwriting really explosive hooks and moving ballads all over this thing as well as the instrumentals which are incredibly detailed layered and Casey's really stunning singing and voice all over this album I think Casey is one of the most passionate and impressive singers that you can lend your ear to this year and I think Casey's influences tend to run a little diverse to some of the more strict back piano ballads on here sound a little bit like Amos or Apple and some of the more production intensive tracks that feel a lot more electronic in sound occasionally give off a Bjork sound like homogenic Vespertine Bjork and while these sonic influences are very clearly there Casey does come through with a wholly different voice KC's immense talent and winding linear songs really steal my attention away from whoever shadow she might be standing in on a given track like with the song ringing the bell which to me seems like a bus lovesong looking to pick a relationship back up from a point where it seems to have broken apart and the hopes the dreams the aspirations for this move this decision all ring out beautifully in Casey's voice the rich multitrack horns blaring away in the background the very pretty background vocals there's a really nimble bassline darting and weaving through all of these sounds hidden in the background there's a little detail to eat up in nearly every instrumental on this record every time I listen through this thing but Casey and her band don't lose energy and and viscera in the process of putting together this very particular set of sounds I also love the segues and the transitions that white hinterland comes up with to move a track from one point to another and this track rides a really interesting groove too as well as many other songs on here while I do think there is an element of pop and an element of accessibility to this record a strong element of beauty that comes through in the instrumentation and the vocals this is music that definitely walks to the beat of a different drum a different drum than just your normal average pop tune like with the song baby where Casey's voices is slowed down a lot more her her singing is much more emotive and drawn-out this is another relationship centric track with some pretty telling lyrics about how her shyness was an act to give this person a sense of security and the instrumentation on this track is pretty chilly - I can see my breath when I'm listening to this thing I love the really dreary and strange vocal harmonies on this thing that wearing high hats there's a really nice murky bass line that's heavy it kicks the track off sets a very dark tone and then there's like a surprise transition at the midway point where all of a sudden the song really starts to warm up there's some insane vocal harmonies at this point in the track it really feel excites the instrumentation there is a stellar refrain is this my weakness then there is the song metronome which i think is is possibly the catchiest most straightforward song on this entire LP although it is just as layered and as thick as many other songs on here there's all these cycling background vocals creating a foundation for the track and these repeat again again again it kind of reminds me of like an animal collective track or something but what Casey does what this foundation is is very much different I mean she really rides over this and and brings some up-tempo piano rock there's a surprise transition in the middle of this song - Casey really keeps me on my toes with all the surprises that these songs hold but the very smooth kind of easygoing piano ballets catch my ear on this thing - like the song wait until dark the opening track on here a song that is really somber in tone Casey's voice sounds fantastic she sings so wonderfully over the pianos on this track and she transitions right into some very lumbering piano arpeggios just those bass e heavy notes sound great and I love how when Casey really strips back the instrumentation she feels the need to change things up with the song structure even more it's like she can go wherever she pleases without all of these people playing with her because she's just really in control of the flow of the track the song David is a bit more straightforward and is like so close to get me all teared up it opens up at this stunning lyric about how she doesn't believe in God or chance or fate when it comes to what her and this person have together while instrumentally and in vocally this song as well as the closer on here do exemplify some of those typical slow burner piano ballad cliches I still feel that these very familiar troops don't take away from the quality of the song or the singing definitely as far as downsides on this record there are tracks on here like no devotion or dry mind whose beats I might be very impressed with but I'm not that into the pacing of the song I feel like with how much Casey weighs these tracks down in sound and in detours the songs 10 to kind of lose their appeal and overall I loved listening to this thing I think Casey has a really great assembly of tracks on this record she shows some real vocal chops some piano chops there's a strong lyrical component to nearly every track here while I wouldn't call this thing a concept album many of these songs do seem to be relationship centric I'm loving the creative instrumentals on this thing the adventurer's song structures just how beautiful so many moments on this record are I'm feeling the light a decent eight on this thing Tran vision what did you think of this new white hinterland album did you love it hate it why and what should Anthony review next white hinterland baby forever 
nQ9h3KOYNhY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bull album no mythologies to follow this is the deluxe debut full-length LP from Danish singer-songwriter and pianist Karen Murray Oersted she has come seemingly out of nowhere with instant electro pop it's like pilgrim glass off of the strength of these tracks she got a pretty quick and very nice endorsement from Diplo who produced a beat off of this LP and Karen is showing a ton of promise so early on in her career I think she's at a point right now where she is yet to really chisel out a distinct or memorable or a unique sound for herself but I think she has shown a lot of prowess in the realm of singing in the realm of hook writing I think this girl's mystical sound in her vocal range as long as she continues to do them well are going to take her far and earn her fans from people who find her style to be similar to that of like Lourdes or Grimes or purity ring or churches or Nicki in the dove or Glasser or the knife her music has a really strong pop appeal but I think her instrumentals are a little eccentric there's a ton of atmosphere surrounding the rhythms and the synthesizers the beats the the percussion sounds that she tends to use feel kind of organic a little primal every once in a while she switches out these drum sounds in favor of a sort of 808 drum sound where she gives a bit of a nod to trap music and consistently the synthesizers whether it be the melodies that they're playing or just the the the tone the the effect the sound of the sense that she's using have a bit of a in 80's chart-topping pop hit vibe occasionally Karen veers from this formula and sort of ends up in a totally different genre entirely like on the song never want to know a song that feels like a synthetic take on some kind of vocal pop song from the 1950s or the song dust is gone which is a bit of an airy ballad where the way she sings in the way she pronounces her lyrics on this track she sounds a lot like Lana Del Rey or the song don't want to dance which is like the most blatantly poppy track on this entire LP I don't wanna dance with nobody dance with nobody oh but with that hook the groove is so infectious it kind of is a dance song you know you do want to dance just not with anybody get away from me or the song slow love another favor of mine on this LP which is just like a pop ballad straight out of the 80s there's there's nothing really about this track that feels new at all the synth bass line is amazing some of the synthesizer leads feel like something out of a todo song loving the drum fills on this track too when the chorus hits I go insane but the songs that ended up appealing to me the most on this LP are the ones that sound most like the singles that led up to the release of this record like the vocal layering on the song fire rides is awesome I love the snappy snares on this track I love it when Karen reaches up into her upper register on the song - she doesn't have the most distinct voice on the block but I think her singing is emotive I think it's sensual and I think in comparison with a lot of these artists who I find her to be similar to she shows a little bit more technical talent she harmonizes over her own vocals really well and I think she has great pitch control I love the pan-flute synthesizer leads on the song red in the gray as well as the bubbling synthesizer arpeggios just rhythmically playing into the tempo of the track I love the glockenspiel and the Phil Collins like drum fills as well as the synthesizer horn leads on the song pilgrim the song xxx 88 where Diplo handles the instrumental here the beat actually complements all the songs on this record and Caryn really well it doesn't feel out of place or anything like that however the melody and the vocal harmonies on this track do feel eerily similar to that of Lords which I guess isn't that big of a surprise considering last year's when Royals really blew up last year's when the song originally came out and the song glass is really good as a closer to the sort of normal non deluxe version of this record with its really jittery very colourful instrumental I think Karen has a lot of great ideas and the hooks are especially good on this LP but here and there I think she's a little too quick to embrace the sound of her contemporaries also I think there's maybe a little too much similarity between how each of the tracks here are mixed and just how they sound overall and while I do like a lot of the hooks on this record I think Karen has a bit of a weak spot in her songwriting in that her approach to vocal melody on the verses of these tracks feels roughly the same - it's really the synthesizer leads and the hooks that give each song on this record their distinct flavor it's not so much Karen's voice which I mean sometimes doesn't sound like anything special sometimes just sounds exactly like another artist who's already popular right now and you know those verses again they're just not that distinct sometimes don't get me wrong I think there are a lot of good characteristics to this record the rhythms the instrumentation all of its very tangible all of it is very well assembled and put together and like I said consistently I do get into these hooks I mean there's only really one track I was just outrightly disappointed with and that was a song walk this way which to me the the production the sound quality of this track was sort of that of demo however the hook is really good on this song so I could sort of see why Karen would want to include it on the tracklist here but still the recording quality of the track really does have this song feeling a little out of place though you know that this this LP while there were some bright moments and there were some tracks on here I really liked it's just really really hit or miss for me and that's all I'm kind of feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana well forever 
UuvtAqrcSOo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Matt DeMarco record salad days this is the latest full-length LP from singer/songwriter Mac DeMarco following up his modestly successful full-length LP - which turned him into a pretty massive personality in the jangle pop world and I say personality because between numerous music videos and interviews that he's done since the release of this really lacks easygoing record he has come off really eccentric playful hilarious Mac DeMarcos persona to me is so enjoyable that I can only hope that his music continues to stay relevant just so that one day I can sort of see his goofy smile on a billboard somewhere now I didn't love his last record but I did think it had some fantastic tracks on it tracks that made for great singles great music videos like my kind of woman or Oh - Viceroy or dreaming really gentle combination of bass and drums twinkling guitars were some really expressive strumming the whole vibe was really chill however the melodies on these tracks and sometimes the lyrics and the song concepts but mostly the melody is really sharp I was hoping Mac would come through develop a bit more on his next record drop some stronger singles bring a little more variety to the table but personally I do not feel like that happen I think Mac came through with an even more homogenous record than he did with - not only that but I think this record has less single power as well I mean sonically melodically I don't think there's a single song on this record that rivals one of the better tracks on - and I think with Mac putting out more music touring more signing with captured tracks he's almost lost the spontaneity that was there on some of his stuff like rock and roll nightclub Mac's really smooth gentle easygoing sound seems to be the only likable quality about his music that has stuck around for this record then some of the different song topics that he tends to address over the course record some of which may not be apparent from first listen just because of how emotionally disconnected and just sigh of relief this whole album feels in terms of its vocal delivery there are some true heartbreak songs on this LP however emotionally it doesn't really feel that way necessarily because the the emotional pain doesn't really ring through all of the sonic lethargy that I think the instrumentation brings and that's unfortunate you know I understand that to was a really big breakout record for Mac but I think salad days kind of shows where his ambitions lie at the end of the day salad days just feels like a hit of the reset button it's a record that acts like its predecessor never even existed even the songs that I like off of this thing I feel like I'm merely enjoying them just because they sound just like moments off of Mac's previous album like with the song passing out pieces which initially grabs my ear because of its shimmering synthesizer arpeggios I do love the increase in the use of synths on this record overall they do add a really nice touch but as soon as the twinkling guitar solos pour through on the course I get this extreme shot of deja vu and then a pretty surprised fade-out right after the second chorus on this track and this isn't the only track this happens on unfortunately and in this song in particular it's like it's really truly over and done with 30 seconds before it decides to completely and fully fade out it's moments like this that make me feel like Mac DeMarco isn't putting as much effort into this record as he did his last record and I'm kind of sitting here wondering why I feel the same way on the incredibly underwhelming acoustic ballad let my baby stay or the song go easy where essentially the hook is done to death the intro to the song treater better extreme deja vu there overall with the groove on the song blue boy to either Mac is just unashamedly repeating past successes in his musical career that all have occurred very recently or he's indulging in some really unenjoyable ideas like the end of the track Blueboy which is one of the more sedate tracks on the entire LP and then all of a sudden at the very finish this shoegaze II wall of guitars is hit with this horrible off pitch falsetto that is not pleasant to the air in any way whatsoever honestly I'm pretty on the fence with this LP I do like the vibe I do like the sound that Matt continues to bring to the table but I feel like this record overall is the sound of not succeeding not failing horribly but settling just settling instead of shooting for something more ambitious Mac has settled he's settled for dishing out the kind of tracks that play between your favorite songs on am soft rock radio in the 70s he's settled for a redo he's settled for sounding like a sleepytime aerial pink and in the process didn't even finish some of the tracks here that he started did not give strong endings to some of these tracks like I know he has on his previous efforts there's just a lot of loose ends on this LP even on the last track of this LP which is just a kind of forgettable instrumental we're finally as the song just decides to stop Mack pop sentences hey everybody thanks for listening bye bye which is is is pretty cute and does show Mack DeMarcos personality this is something I wish more artists did however you know I would much rather have succinct well-written memorable songs than sort of this really nice goodbye message so in its best moments this record is is very pretty on the ear it's seductive but in its worst it's redundant it's stale its unimaginative and it's it's kind of short of breath - I'm feeling a light - decent 5 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Mack DeMarco salad days forever 
mM40Rp0m5AA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new no-can-do record jimmy the burnout no-can-do is a West Coast rapper and founder of the Hellfire Club record label home right now to some of the most progressive hip hop music in the genre today music from Milo busdriver open mike eagle together as a collective with some other emcees as well like rhetoric Ramirez they dropped one of the better hip hop mixtapes of last year I didn't love it it was a little all over the place but I think it's still perfectly showcase the talents of Hellfire Club as a collective there are some really standout tracks handled by individuals on the label from Milo or the song barbs over breakfast those bus driver or the song qualifiers from open mike eagle or give a from no-can-do and there are some pretty hyped collaborative and Posse tracks on this LP too that I absolutely love like Degrassi picture day or DVT and a lot of these sort of nerdy bars were mashed with some of the more hard-hitting beats I had heard last year two really eccentric bangers so after the really unifying attention-grabbing statement that was this tape I think it's going to be up to each member of Hellfire Club to be coming through with solo albums and collaborative albums that sound as good as the Hellfire mixtape that sort of blow people away after the Hellfire mixtape as a group they essentially have to keep that momentum going and no-can-do is kind of the first up to bat with Jimmy the burnout and my expectations for this record were pretty high considering that he is the head of the label considering that between the release of this tape and today I've seen at least two really hyped live performances from this guy but I ended up with a record that I only at the end of the day feel is pretty good this LP to me is kind of a mixed bag in terms of sound quality it's just a hit or miss kind of album and when the song is amiss it's not always for the same reason like on the song little green monsters which has one of the more wild crazy track beats on this entire P buzzing synth bassline the tone of the instrumental on this track and even the flow no can do comes through with once he pops in reminds me of like an odd future track or something like that I wouldn't see this track being that uncomfortable sitting on that odd future volume 2 tape that they put out a little while ago there's some decent verses on this track but I think the song really falls flat on its face once the hook pops in which melodically is not a bad hook lyrically is not a bad hook but this female vocal Thompson that is really cavernous there's no change or significant contrast and the instrumental itself it's almost like instead of exploding the hook implodes it's like there's a void there in between the verses is there's the song too much to ask which is a bit of a self-aware slow jam on this LP but is is nowhere near as captivating as some of the more hard-hitting tracks on this thing and there's the song any day now which is a very slow pace slow moving piece of jazz rap which conceptually seems like a good idea it does bring variety to the LP but the momentum of the instrumental the really weak forgettable hook on this thing and the just uninteresting flow that no can do performs with on this song makes it one of the worst on the entire LP not only that but I feel like in this spot where everything is so slow that the enjoyability comes down to lyrics so much no-can-do brings some of his most uninteresting bars I'm a virus I'm influenza when I'm inspired I'm influential my people run this city like hardcore a line about opening girls legs like a car door or he shines so bright he makes the suns Quinn then there's the song lucid dream as well which seems to be a bit of a weird kind of epilogue toward the end of the LP the beat has this vintage hip-hop groove really dated synthesizer bassline a very stale R&B hook I don't really get the sonic direction that the song is going and however I do like the very surreal dream influenced imagery and story that comes through on the lyrics on this track you know there are moments where I'm not really liking the lyrics but I like the instrumental there are moments where it's totally flipped and I'm loving what no can do is doing lyrically but the beat just isn't doing much for me but when songs on selphie do appeal to me through and through it's because they've got great infectious energy clever lines good hook like the song never looked better which is a bit of a love-hate song where essentially no can do is rapping about having been with a girl or numerous girls at some point in his life and coming along and sort of seeing them with another guy and saying you know what you never looked better you never looked better since the day I've seen you with another dude essentially the song has a really deep voice hooked a really heavy bass II beat and all these self-deprecating lines that delivered in this way feel kind of creepy and sort of stalkerish there's the song break even which is this really playful heavy Hornbeck piece of hip-hop magic that essentially becomes the soundtrack to the downtrodden in the rat race of today's economy I live by the bee I live by the be like you live check to check the song addresses the financial situations of a few different people as does the song third world hustle which kind of delivers the same message but in a much darker way becoming one of my favorite tracks on this entire LP in the process nocturnal trap beat on this thing with some gurgling bass tones just bubbling away in the background and there's the song grown man work which is easily the most energetic over-the-top insane hyped track on this entire LP just crazy bang or beat on this thing however with all of its just forward momentum just going at high velocity just the song still does not come off as crazy or as memorable or even as clever as some of the bangers on the Hellfire Club mixtape I mean I prefer no can do is give a over this tracks for example even with the hilarious refrain on this track we don't play we know blue there are some tracks on this LP that are genuinely catchy as well like the song zero hour which has a beat that's helped along by mono/poly insanely psychedelic track on this thing I love how eerie the organ sounds on this thing I love the smoky sound of the instrumental the distant saxophones the skittering wailing synthesizer leads I dig the flow on this track while the song is at a slow tempo no can do changes it up every once in a while it's definitely one of the better tracks on this LP lyrically and and it's definitely a top three instrumental on this thing as well but I think what has even more single power on this LP is the Hellfire Club anthem which has a great hook sung by open my Eagle I think one of the better moments of him singing on a rap song ever the instrumental sounds like it samples like a really sad soundtrack moment from a kung-fu movie which is totally totally awesome it's a bit of an underdog track you know it really is the perfect anthem in my opinion for Hellfire as a collective there are a few pretty funny sketches on this thing as well one of which comes from Eric Andre who has one of my favourite television shows on Adult Swim right now but overall I'm just sitting here with a pretty decent LP overall while I think no-can-do is is versatile you know he does display versatility on this record there is a lot of variety on this record I do think that's one of the strongest points of this album and I think he sticks out in the Hellfire Club collective you know he's a voice in Hellfire that I think brings balance I think Hellfire Club needs a guy who is as straightforward and as as blunt as no-can-do however I still think he's working to find his voice his distinct voice in the wider world of hip-hop and it's it's not coming through completely on this album but if he continues putting out music with Hellfire Club which I mean obviously he will since he's fronting the label but I'm saying if he if he continues putting out music with people who are as eccentric as busdriver open mike eagle milo no doubt that's going to happen I'm feeling a strong six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana no can do Jimmy the burnout forever 
MO_DTx7DOTo,hi everyone Anthony blonde tan oh here the Internet's washing machine music nerd and it's time for a review of the new planning to rock record all loves legal planning to rock is the musical pseudonym of Janine rostrum over the past several years she has made a name for herself as being a frequent influence on the music of the knife as well as a collaborator on their most extravagant and experimental album to date tomorrow in a year and in her own music which has been released on various labels one of them being DFA record she has experimented relentlessly with pop and electronic dance music matching them with a manipulated vocal that sort of strips Janine's voice of its female characteristics it's kind of a gender-neutral vocal it's androgynous it's a female voice that seems deeper to the point where it could possibly be male the androgyny of it is eerie and the purpose of treating her voice like this is sort of spelled out in the lyrics of planning to rocks music especially on this latest record of hers like with tracks that were dropped before the release of this LP misogyny drop dead patriarchy over now songs that while they feature really strong political message feature some of the worst music I've ever heard in my entire life period for example misogyny dropped at a track that is well intentioned with its jab at society's mistreatment of women but did she have to abuse the art of music as well in the process of making this song I mean in comparison to music misogyny actually gets off pretty easy on this track the foundation of this song is a pretty decent dance beat but planning to rock tops this beat with one of the most horrible melodies I've ever heard and syncs it directly with the basis if it's just the basis job to repeat whatever the lead melody of a track is and while I appreciate the really weird vocal effects I mean I love love love love them on fever raise solo LP when she pitches her stuff down and sort of goes into a darker deeper tone of voice but here planning to rock and barely hold a pitch even as she's singing along with tutu tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu i know that seems like a really ridiculous over exaggerated impression but that's literally what it sounds like i'm not even joking the more I listen to this song in this record in general the more I feel like I'm slowly being transported without me fully realizing into this musical hell where sound really only exists to torture the listener every beat is bland every tone annoyingly pierces an eardrum every lyric fails to advocate its cause like with the song patriarchy over and out which works as the closing track off of this LP and it also features these synthesizer string melodies that feel like they're straight out of a vintage disco tune but as planning to rock is playing since over this track the performance is so off tempo it's just so loose and uninteresting and boring it just feels so amateurish it's laughable especially the lazy solo she throws on top of this thing it's like planning to rock only cares about the message of her songs and completely ignores the musicality the musical basics at every single turn and I guess there's room for the argument that maybe it's bad on purpose maybe it's weird on purpose and I am and I understand to an extent it is but in the grander scheme of things is this record that weird not really I mean it's just kind of uniquely funny and how sloppy it is and the message in the song patriarchal life is out of date okay I'm sure a lot of people would agree with the the sentiment of the song but if someone made a song called murder is bad but the only lyrics in the track where murder is bad well I mean for sure most people would agree with the message of the song but that doesn't mean that the message is being put artfully or thoughtfully or interestingly it's weird because this record brings up utilitarian questions for me like is it worse to advocate bad ideas well or advocate good ideas terribly and you know I don't know which is worse but planning to rock is definitely doing the latter the singing the bad playing the beats that repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and get boring by the end of the song I'll make these very sympathetic and positive tracks seem kind of laughable sometimes like all loves legal on paper the song is a really nice ballad I dig the beat I dig the melody but again it's like another objective in planning to rocks music is to abuse sound as well with her unbearable voice it's like she takes music down to this subterranean torture chamber taking off individual fingers with pliers smashing toes with hammers tooth removal electrocution and planning to rock can't even keep all this destruction to herself she has to bring in the infamous refrain from one of the tracks from the latest knife record shaking the habitual from the song full of fire let's talk about gender and this whole song rides a beat that feels like it was lifted from the DFA records of all before she got kicked off the label with her last album and she vocalizes over this track again annoyingly with these deeply pitched vocals and yet doing them in falsetto let's go baby again we have another bad lazy lead synth melody that mimics the bass exactly the beat just kind of goes and goes and goes and goes it's like planning to rock has no concept whatsoever of how to keep a dance track engaging from start to finish it's the same issue on the song public love which is the longest track here at 7 minutes long and the vocals are more torturous than ever on songs like human drama the horridness is a little more ambiguous kind of like on all loves legal on paper it is a nice ballot I do like the plucked strings on this track it sounds much more refined musically than a lot of other songs on here execution a whole nother story pretty much the same annoying tale that every song flips through aside from all these highlights on this record planning tracks segues a lot of these songs with horrifying interludes interludes that feature either some of the worst singing on this entire record or just sort of repeat or tease toward a melody or a synth part that is going to be on the song coming up why I don't know maybe to warm people and give them ample time to run away before the song actually starts you know I've heard a lot of weird and sort of unpleasant intros over the years listening to numerous numerous numerous records that sometimes turn into fantastic and and maybe some of my favorite songs of all time however that does not happen once here it's always a bad start and it evolves into just more badness a headache turns into a head Splosion a sprained ankle turns into a compound fracture why every single bad song on this record means a bad preload is beyond me maybe to sort of pad the record out I just don't understand but to tell you the truth there's not a lot about this record I understand all I understand is how I feel about this LP and I have no positive feelings toward it whatsoever well aside from the messages and sort of the political philosophy of this record which I accept but that still doesn't excuse this record for being one of the most unappealing art pop albums I've ever heard in my life you know I understand that sometimes very simple basic writing and loose playing and off pitch singing can have admirable qualities to them they can be kind of endearing they can show personality or some kind of raw energy however in the case in the context of planning to rocks music all of these elements add up in in the worst of ways I'm feeling a zero on this record yeah a zero transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it planning to rock all loves legal forever 
l7ovkjrJFMI,hi everyone Anthony blonde tan oh here the Internet's washing machine music nerd and it's time for a review of the new planning to rock record all loves legal planning to rock is the musical pseudonym of Janine rostrum over the past several years she has made a name for herself as being a frequent influence on the music of the knife as well as a collaborator on their most extravagant and experimental album to date tomorrow in a year and in her own music which has been released on various labels one of them being DFA record she has experimented relentlessly with pop and

that seems deeper to the point where it could possibly be male the androgyny of it is eerie and the purpose of treating her voice like this is sort of spelled out in the lyrics of planning tracks music especially on this latest record of hers like with tracks that were dropped before the release of this LP misogyny drop dead patriarchy over now songs that while they feature really strong political message for example the song misogyny drop dead a track that doesn't just feel like a rebellion against hatred toward and the mistreatment of women but a song that smashes musical norms as well I mean I guess while planning to rock is going against some societal norms she might as well go against some musical ones as well the foundation of this track is an irresistible but very subtle dance beat there's an oddly shaped melody on this track that is backed up in sync with the bassline really thick very punchy as it comes together and what an odd vocal melody on this thing it is just jaw-dropping leave freakish it matches up with this pan-flute synth sound and just goes in with tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu these are sounds that the more I listen to them just the more strange they felt but simultaneously I feel like I'm being transported into planning to rocks head where for whatever reason it all kind of makes sense every beat rocks my body every note twists my brain every lyric flips a gender nor the song patriarchy over now it works as the closing track on this record and has all these synthesizers string leads that feel like they're straight out of an old-school disco song the very airy synth solo being performed over this plays into a bit of a self-aware corniness in the track - I think I like that planning to rock plays with very accessible elements of pop and dance music but then has a pretty unorthodox approach to it as well I think in a way moments like this show off influence from fellow avant-gardist like yoko ono and then laurie anderson but with more of a bleeding rejection of tempo and pitch which planning to rock ignores abuses completely forgets about on numerous points of this record and the results can be wildly fun i'm not talking about a lot of quantized instrumentation or sequenced sounds on this record i'm just talking about a lot of raw in the moment performances it's like all planning track is focused on is this really righteous message and she uses the music as a vehicle or as like a horse which he rides aggressively until it's within an inch of death and the message behind this track patriarchal life it's over its passe it's stale it's out-of-date there's not a lot of detail in the lyrics but I think there is a lot of subtext in the way planning to rock performs this song in the vocal she applies to this record the androgynous vocals delivered in this male female hybrid voice it's kind of unifying it's like acknowledging in order to throw these shackles off genders must get together to make that happen when looked at conceptually in this way so many songs that are pretty grating from planning to rock all of a sudden just make sense it makes already beautiful tracks on this record like all loves legal even more gorgeous which is one of the more powerful ballads on this LP it sort of points out the futility of governments or societies standing in the way of two people going into a consensual marriage whatever their genders may be because truth be told you cannot eagle eyes love love is the one gift that gives life its purpose wonderful message on this track I think the vocal is catchy I love the strings on this track good be planning to rock really hits a pocket on most of these tracks here where she makes accessible music she conforms to accessible ideas but still then again her approaches is so unorthodox in a lot of ways that she is far from being normal another track on this LP I find very catchy and strange is the let's talk about gender baby track off of this LP which is kind of a rework of the refrain off of the track full of fire from the latest knife record shaking the habitual and this song is backed with another really infectious beat that sounds like it could have come from the DFA records vault or something like that some kind of post-punk disco hybrid and the very sour gender-neutral falsetto is all over this track are oddly alluring very sticky let's do baby good stoke about you at me and the synth reinforced bassline rides the groove of this track perfectly I get the same enjoyment out of public love which is just this freakish dance track with this distorted skittering 3 note synth bassline and the beat on this thing is so primal as well as the vocal delivery to spelling out the title to while there isn't a lot to this track compositionally I do think it's raw energy makes it one of the most appealing songs in this entire LP and it just stays intense for the 7 minutes that it lasts and then there's the song human drama 2 which is maybe the most powerful and moving and beautiful wonderful ballad on this entire LP a song that is about the fluidity of gender and sexuality and another winning vocal melody on the cell P 2 that is delivered in this kind of gentle emotive demeanor with all these plots since strings playing in the background very refined very pretty but still maintaining a very strong element of weirdness which plenty to rock just oozes in every direction on every song on this LP and lyrically she just had me on this song at like nummy a human drama this track is so beautiful it really just sets sexuality is being this societal battleground on which people are currently deciding the the future of so many lives and aside from all these major highlights on this LP planning to Rock segues nearly all of these songs with some pretty ear grabbing odd and at times freakish interludes that are very tone setting and and one in particular feature some of the most avant-garde singing on this entire record but for the most part the interludes here sort of tease out toward a forthcoming synth part or melody that's going to be on a song that is about to pop up maybe give it more of an atmospheric backdrop or kind of an eerie tone before the beat sets in and the song becomes kind of danceable i've heard a lot of weird intros to songs over the years with the numerous records i have listened to for this channel and just you know for personal time and these definitely ranked as some of the best some of the most interesting because they definitely do compliment every single track here and sometimes it's not completely apparent as to why and I'm not even sure why 100% of the time you know there are just a lot of elements of indescribable magic that go into a record such as this the message behind these songs the beats the manipulated vocals the melodies on this record I can't tell if they add up into something nearly indescribable and amazing or if there's some other element being thrown into the recipe that I just can't put my finger on all I know is that all these characteristics add up into what is most likely one of the most amazing creative fantastic and mind-blowing records that I think you can listen to not just this year but in your entire lifetime I'm feeling a 10 on this thing a 10 transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it planning to rock all loves legal forever 
CU2q6SQqfpQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a y-you know review where I touch down on a series of records that I didn't get a chance to formally review in a single video at some point this past month so I'm going to talk about them in brief right here right now starting with the new Black Lips record if you're looking for some really grimy just loose sort of chaotic garage rock with a really strong hooky poppy Sensibility check out the Black Lips they have a ton of Records nice back catalogue some real highlights throughout that back catalogue too however this new record of there's two sort of quote a Talking Heads song it's just sort of the same as it ever was for me with them which which I felt to an extent with the last record is well Arabian Mountain however here I'm just not feeling as much single power not only that but with Arabia mountain it felt like the band was going for a cleaner production sound the sound was better the production was more impressive it feels like on this latest record of theirs they're going back to uh there'd evolving into a grimy er aesthetic which they have done in the past with the record two hundred million thousand we're you know consciously they went into more of a low five direction with their recording but I think they brought strong really strong songs along the way too that made listening through that loaf i recording worthwhile and kind of fun however here i'm just not feeling as many tracks you know and and and and that's that i mean you know to not have his great production this time around and less interesting songs yeah the new vince staples mixtape a lot of people have been asking me about this you know this guy's a West Coast rapper really understated delivery that is is very alight to that of Earls Earl Sweatshirt has had him on his records I imagine uh you know he is pretty much Odd Future affiliated not in the group per se but you know he's appeared on records with people who are associates of the group and I'm just having a hard time getting into the stood you know every once in a while especially on this tape he drops an interesting and personal story like on the song Nate and I think he's rapping over his best production yet on any project he's released so far really colourful beats on this thing too but I don't really think the dude is that interesting I mean his is just delivery is is just not there for me you know it kind of sounds like Snoop Dogg he definitely has flow he's in the pocket but just hearing him rap feels a little mundane to me and that's all I mean I just need a I just want a little more variety out of out of what this dude brings to the table not only that but I think he shows very little prowess in the way of writing hooks on this thing too if he's gonna continue to put stuff out either write more stunning hooks or just give me straight bars moving on to the new Kid Cudi record satellite flight an album that a lot of people were also asking me about this past month and I didn't review it because I have zero interest in reviewing this record I just don't see the point I feel like Kid Cudi has disappointed me numerous times this past I don't know how many years I mean I didn't really like man on the moon too it was just okay was completely disappointed in wizard thought his track on the cruel summer soundtrack the cruel summer compilation was horrifying and indicud was one of the worst albums of last year how many times am I gonna give this guy a shot how many times am I gonna be like oh yeah I have completely no expectations going into this record whatsoever I have no premonition that it's going to be horrible you know I just need a break from from Kid Cudi and and maybe he needs one too I mean I think we should all get together start a petition for NASA to send him to space I mean it's it's what he wants throw him on a shuttle send him to the moon maybe have him fix a rover plant a flag do a moonwalk I'm just you know I'm just over Kid Cudi for right now right now you know III have no issue with returning to his stuff later but this new record just just just just skipping it the new Eagles record if you're really into noisy post punk music totally down with Joy Division Bauhaus if you like Holograms as far as a new artist or like savages or ice age I know the stuff is coming back and then check this record out I am horribly just terribly into this kind of sound however this time around it wasn't really just just wasn't really grabbing me just wasn't grabbing me for sure they have the energy they have the ferocity the Reaver be chaotic production is decent I just wasn't that enthralled with the vocals which I didn't I didn't find to be that distinct or interesting and and none of the songs were really sticking with me either but if for whatever reason this bands aggression somehow translates to you then by all means listen to this record the new men record tomorrow's hits these guys are a multi genera rock outfit from the East Coast it has been pretty interesting following their trajectory since they've been signed on to sacred bones records they have covered everything from punk rock noise rock power pop to country punk and it was on their fourth full-length record where they went into that country territory and it was their most disappointing record thus far in my opinion mostly because of the badly sung blandly written western ballads that were all over this LP I just didn't get the appeal of hearing the men perform this genre of music so badly it's kind of weird because up until this point they did such a great fantastic sincere job of embracing numerous genres and doing them justice and it hasn't been until that they've stepped into country territory where they just sound like they're on incredibly uneven ground I don't know what it is that they just can't click on I don't know what it is what wavelength they need to be on to be performing these country tunes well but it just does not happen on this record however with this latest LP there's a little less of that going on they deliver some more hard-hitting jams that do feel country themed more in that cow punk country punk vein however there still are some of those very weak ballads on this LP that knock the enjoy ability of it down a few notches so for sure while I do like it more than their last album I'm not in love with it either the new CyHi the prynce mixtape black history I wanted to like this thing and there are so many likable things about it this good music rapper who sort of had a really nice breakthrough into the game on Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy you know really nice introduction on that LP with with a very enjoyable verse he's been relatively silent ever since then and hasn't been doing all too much and now this new mixtape of his is kind of you know bringing him back into the spotlight reminding us that oh hey this guy's on good music and he's a doing thing and there were a lot of good things about this mixtape I mean the production seems really lavish and seems like there was a ton of effort put into it he's not just going for a generic sort of everyday production sound and he's got some clever bars as well and it seems like there is a really conscious theme running throughout this mixtape i I guess I'm just not that captivated by what this dude has in terms of charisma or personality or anything like that I mean I sort of liken him to wale in that I just don't get a sound or a direction from the way that he raps or his voice however I will say that you know on the surface just even on a first listen it'sit's plain as day that SIA is much more talented than wale in terms of you know the way that he spits the quality of lines that he writes I'm just getting a similar vibe in terms of okay this guy can rap but like who is he where is he going I'm not completely sure don't let my lukewarm attitude toward this tape turn you off of it or keep you from checking it out I do recommend that if you are a hip-hop fan you do give this record a listen it does have some good moments and you know while CyHi may not be eccentric enough for me he could totally click with you because I do sense a lot of talent being delivered on this tape the new Mantar record death by burning I really wanted to like this LP and this duo this German metal duo did have a lot going for them on some of the tracks here despite being just a guitarist Slash vocal stand a drummer they bring together a ton of different genres from rock and roll thrash doom sludge death metal but as good as some of the grooves here are and as raw as some of the vocals are and man are they raw I just wish there were more layers there were more detail to these songs and and I realize that's kind of lacking because I mean we're just kind of listening to a guitar a drum and a vocal I mean if only there were another guitar or two in this mix so that we could actually get you know just a little bit more intricacy to the songwriting and it's and it's that blatant lack of intricacy that makes this record so kind of boring to listen to from front to back for a song or two they have a lot of grooves and they're really heavy for just a duo I mean they definitely bring that heavy sound that a five piece band would bring but they don't bring the layers they don't bring the dynamics that a five piece band would bring in and and I feel like that's that's really what this LP is missing overall dynamics the Nucci Marengo renaissance record I really wanted to love this LP this is a bit of a side project in association to Shabazz Palaces and genre wise sonically is is in roughly the same vein I mean we're talking about a lot of African music centric instrumentals on this thing sort of chaotic sort of trippy lots of layers lots of synthesizer however I'm finding some of the beats on this LP to be a little kooky er a little bit more messy maybe a little noisier I'm finding the rapping and sort of the vocal delivery to be a bit more straightforward maybe a preachy er maybe a little bit more conscious not to say that Shabazz Palaces isn't that I think that Jim Arango Renaissance is is a little more straightforward with its message and that's all if you're into Shabazz Palaces if you're into colorful hip-hop with an eccentric edge I recommend you check this LP out but I just wasn't finding anything on this LP to be all that catchy outside of the few tracks on here that sonically sounded so much like serve as palaces that I mean these tracks could have been slipped in onto black up and you know it would have felt completely comfortable and there are a few songs like that on this LP and those alone make this thing worth checking out but I just wasn't captivated by this record that's all the new Foster the People Records supermodel cannot get into this band people ask me to check out this record I cannot get into this band I couldn't get into their first record not getting into this record I mean it obviously has less single power than their first record there is not a pumped up kicks' on this thing unfortunately and you know without great singles on this record I feel like Foster the people are pretty much more obviously than ever what they've always been and that's just really unmemorable bland pop rock with very little in the way of personality this LP is essentially the definition of middle-of-the-road the new body record I shall die here a collaborative record for the body with the haxon cloak who brings a ton of strange eerie just ambient sounds to this album that the body are putting together if you don't know the accent cloak dark ambient artist if you don't know the body sort of weird experimental avant-garde sludge metal doom metal band noise metal band who has some very twisted albums in their back catalogue and for as frightening into strange as they are I've just always had a hard time connecting with this bands music and sort of I was excited hoping that that would happen this time around because they were collaborating with an artists whose solo work I think is fantastic however I just don't feel like that magic occurs on this record I feel like I'm listening to just another body album with these noisy just buzzing distorted very slow monolithic riffs very sparse drumming and freakish vocals that kind of sound like man turning into a werewolf under a full moon I feel like I'm listening to what the body normally does but with just a few more weird noisy dark ambient sounds hanging in the atmosphere around it there are only a few moments on this relatively short record in terms of tracks that actually hit me as being something totally different and unique to both the body and the haxon cloak I guess my most major disappointment is that I feel like each artist didn't really push one another outside of their comfort zone enough but if the idea of just there being more atmosphere more colorful already surrounding what the body currently does if you already like what they do no questions asked and you want them to keep doing that but just maybe with a bit more color in detail give this thing a listen the new Black Milk EP glitches in the break this Detroit rapper and producer put out one of my favorite hip hop records of last year he's following that up now with a new EP that is just okay feels like a bunch of no poison no paradise kind of afterthoughts nothing quite as amazing but some decent features on this things and decent jazzy instrumentals if you're a huge Black Milk fan give it a listen and finally the new perfect albums say yes to love another record a lot of people were asking me about and I don't know it's all right I do love punk music I do love noise rock I do think this band showcases some influences from artists who I think are really good like melt banana there's also something about their production sound the way they record and mix their tracks that reminds me of a lot of the low Phi artists who were not only big around the 2009/2010 era sort of like times new Viking or even a lot of those artists who are blowing up when that California music scene surrounding the smell was getting a lot of attention sort of like me Kimiko all of those sonic characteristics got me listening to this record because okay this totally seems like in my comfort zone I totally dig this kind of thing but to me there's not a lot of variety to the vocals there's not a lot of variety to the way the guitar riffs are written and there's not a lot of variety or at least there's not a lot of room for variety in the way this album is courted because it's so low fie and you're so cacophonous that I feel like these very loud intense just aggressively perform songs have very little breathing room so you know what what little details separate these songs are sort of just lost in the smudging that goes on with just how low Phi these tracks sound unfortunately if they were to improve the recording quality on a future record I would anticipate liking a lot more than what they're doing here but you know until then I just kind of feel like this sound that they're playing with right now is just a little too redundant for a full-length LP and that is it everyone thank you for watching those are the records that I didn't really touch down on this past month that I wanted to make sure I touch down on and uh thank you for watching Tran oh wait hold on there's a few more records that I wanted to talk about a lot of people then asked me about the new Animals As Leaders record just never really been into this ultra sterile clean progressive metal sound sort of these a gent staccato guitar riffs and and I can't get it into this new record from the band either I'm not gonna lie just cannot get into their music just doesn't really say anything to me it just feels so technical and flashy and and not much else you know and and you know if you're the kind of person that appreciates merely that then you'll probably vibe with this record but there's not much about the grooves the composition I mean not really anything aside from how technical the record is that I appreciate so yeah I mean again just another Animals As Leaders record that I don't have very much interest in and on top of that the new Hold Steady record as well to me this is just generic bar rock this this this also speaks to me not very much either just passing on this

qvNjCNBVs9k,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dear Anthony I've seen your videos around YouTube while I'm looking at my favorite artists and I have friends that watch your stuff too that's pretty much all I know about you because I avoid your videos like the plague the reason I don't watch your YouTube page is because I don't see the point in taking whatever you have to say seriously you're just a regular guy what do you know that the rest of us don't do even play music what insight could your views possibly hold as far as I know you're not an expert you're just an opinionated nerd with a camera so why should anyone be watching your reviews Derrick Ross PS I also remove your review scores from Wikipedia pages when I see them because they don't deserve to be there sorry but it's the truth PPS your hair sucks everyone Derrick is right right right right right I may have shot and edited hundreds of music reviews since I started this channel earned a quarter of a million subs as well as respect from fellow critics musicians music fans as well as industry professionals I may have interviewed makjang I may have been interviewed by NAR doir as well as the wire magazine I may have won a beyond the blog award from MTV spoken at Wesleyan University had my own radio show that aired on about a dozen stations written for NPR music on numerous occasions I may have been front page Don YouTube and BuzzFeed as well as numerous music forums across the internet publicly and privately insulted and praised by the artists I review as well as some that I don't review but Derrick has seen through the big fat facade that I wasn't even trying to put up in the first place to realize I'm just a regular guy yes as hard as it may be to believe I am just a regular guy unfortunately God did not come down from the heavens when I was a child and gift to me the power of an infallible opinion what you all will agree with no matter what no instead I'm just a passionate music fan who's heard a lot of records loved a lot of bands and has some pretty strong opinions that I spend a lot of time forming writing editing sharing I started this thing with absolutely no industry ties whatsoever and have continued to be able to do what I want on my own terms with it as it has grown into my full-time job you might not always agree with what I say but at least you know or at least I promise you that there is nothing in forming my opinion of a record other than what I sincerely feel about the music on it all that being said I can't tell you why - like my videos I just make the content it's the audience who decides what they get out of it if I had complete control over why people watched my videos I would love nothing more than for everyone to go through my entire review list and only watch the reviews of bands that they haven't heard of sort of just taken my opinion and then go into the record and try it out for themselves and see if they love the band and if they do either buy a record or go see them live support them in some way continue watching leave a comment like a video share it with a friend but that's not really how it works some people only watch my mainstream reviews some people only watch my obscure reviews some people only watch my hip hop reviews some people only watch my metal reviews some people only watch my negative reviews some people only want to know the records that I love some people watch the reviews for conversation a second opinion or reinforcement of whatever their opinion is some people are into the debate of the whole thing some people are in it for the new artists some people only watch my videos for couch' chesta who we all know is pretty much the reason why we have any female audience whatsoever you if you don't take me seriously or if you don't have any use for my reviews that's on you man don't act like you know something my audience doesn't just because you don't see my reviews as being anything worth your while because I fully understand that you are an independently thinking snowflake who is constantly in awe of his own uniqueness you cannot be influenced by anyone and I really do appreciate you taking a moment to step away from the mirror to write this email but it's not like I grew up as a kid reading reviews and worshipping music reviewers however the opinions tastes and views of others on music played a really important role for me when it came to expanding my tastes into diversion Rah's different musical movements and some of these great and informative opinions came in the shape of music reviews I think one passionate music fan who is just a regular guy can be an entryway into some life changing music for another music fan hmm if I hear the greatest record I've ever heard in my entire life I'm not the kind of person who just kind of sits there like hmm this is really good I think I'll just sit here quietly by myself and just listen to the record over and over and over until the day I die no I gotta kind of tell somebody you know and the thing is getting on my rooftop with a megaphone just was not working out so that's when I started randomly calling people in the phone book and then after that I started doing the whole YouTube thing where I forever continued to be our regular guy transition are you a regular guy forever

T2i-R2Bru2s,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new onyx album wake the fuck up Queens hardcore hip-hop outfit onyx they're back after 10 years they're back back with a new full-length record back in the group's heyday they created some of the angriest grime iasts grittiest hip hop known to man very few groups out in the early 90s were as ferocious aggressive and as voluminous as onyx their early singles awesome stuff like slam and shifty and they have one track that I think is often overlooked when it comes to these rock metal hip hop fusions they did a track with biohazard called judgment look it up and even though there were a lot of groups in the 90s that also had memorable but very violent lyricism as well as solid boom-bap production it was the extreme tone of onix's songs that really kind of made them a standout fixture in new york hip hop and of course I could not do this review all by myself know I had to bring in Mike c-town of dead end hip hop to talk about this record with me transition again magic of the Internet here with Mike C town of dead and hip hop appearing in the videos again coming with me to do this collaborative you review Mike what was your take on this onyx album man um after the last couple of albums that they dropped I did not know what to expect but you know I've always liked snowgoons production something okay well at least the beats will be good but man this shit I I love this shit man I'm really yeah yeah I'm kind of I'm almost certain I think you're gonna say but um but ya know I really I really enjoyed this like like this is not for do to want only conscious hip hop this is not do to only want like content-driven hip hop you even for do to want like super overly lyrical hip-hop this is just that straight-up nasty felonious hip-hop and I love it no I mean it's a I I think this record works really well in a lot of ways and and and truthfully I think snowgoons and onyx are a freaking match made in heaven on this tape and I think they benefit from one one another so much on this thing I mean you have snow goons who while they are a really good production group uh are not one of the more well-known out there right now and could use the shine that comes along with working with a classic artists like onyx and I need somebody because I mean the the two records if they dropped in the 2000s were like incredibly weak yeah I mean they really needed to come through with some hard-hitting grimy production if they were going to make this kind of return after an entire decade you know like they they came on well I mean they didn't come out of the scene because they did have you know an early single I remember that's like not as grimy as like their back the fuck up stuff but when they blew up when they got huge it was off of just like hard-hitting testosterone and adrenaline driven shit and I mean they need to come back and sort of you know that's what people remember them for um and they need to come back and kind of prove that they're still like the kings of that and I think with these snow goon beats they pretty much did it you know it was just like one angry ass hook after another and is ridiculous and as basic as some of the verses on this LP can be I mean the choruses are always just like bam bam bam you know there's like there's not like a there's not an underwhelming chorus on this entire thing and I feel like you know in a sense they do a good job of picking some some more skilled or at least more colorful or rappers that have dist different personalities than they do to come on and do features I mean I thought wrecks feature was really good um I mean you know I'm kind of a sucker for him but like I like the ASAP ferg feature he was the best to me he was the best feature on there really I thought so I mean you know Shan Shan price does what Sean price right sconce yes I mean but I was actually really surprised by a stepford's feature he was really smooth but I like to slow like and if you if you really listen to the way he's rhyming it's it's it's not it's not really that simplistic it's not like what we heard on untrap Lord I thought his first was actually pretty fresh yeah I mean I thought his verse was good too I mean with with ASAP ferg I listened to him mostly for flow and for personality I'm not like digging too deep in his lyrics or anything like that I thought the Pappu's feature was really good too yeah Pappu's was nice very nice and cool mega did his thing too but I'm um you know he didn't surprise me as much as Papoose there wasn't a terrible guest verse on most on this LP but those three verses each time when I listened to this record my attention just like heightens yeah as soon as they pop out I'm like yes you know it's not like I really have to force myself to pay attention to it I'm like yeah you know that's pretty decent every time that they play through its like wow like serious highlight um I mean overall what did you think of snowgoons on this thing that they ever disappoint you like even on a single track not once like you know of course when you when you put this on the theme of the album as far as the sound goes it's pretty similar like none of the beats are really super different they all kind of blend but the beach themselves are really really dope like they're nicely layered um they're all dark they just had they gave onyx a really really really good sound that they in my opinion I don't think they've had a sound this good since shut them down this is this this is their best album since shut them down I think they definitely come through with those hard Bhoomi beats but you know they put some nice scary tones on top of it to give onyx a really kind of grimy eerie cinematic sound but like you said they can be a little one-dimensional but I think that's mostly because they're kind of tailoring everything to what onyx wants and onyx themselves are kind of one-dimensional a lot of the time on this record I think they I mean in terms of tone and mood I think they do a decent job of coming through with some different song topics from time to time like dirty cops is easily one of my favorite tracks on this entire LP really yeah I like the idea of it you know I don't know I just thought it was a fun chorus and I was like well woody about trust no bitch that was my favorite track that was your favorite track yeah I don't know why but it like it got in my head so easily and and and it was just like that chorus was just perfect trust no bitch nigga should have known not to trust that bitch like you're singing it right now in your head aren't you I mean it wasn't a bad track but I think the sticky-fingers verse on that track just like would fucking overboard for me yeah I check people you know just like whoa okay did you even fucking R&B dick yes yes yes it was like wow you know and then he said like she slept with a bunch of Atlanta rappers or whatever went down south I consider myself a fan of aggressive music but there are some moments with onyx when like like fuck he's mad he's angry yeah but that's that's always been what I love about onyx is they're always so pissed off and yeah of course like the piss off it he can get a little bit too much where it gets kind of like a little annoying but you know I think I think we need groups like onyx and I'm so glad they made a comeback like they're they're totally trying to go complete opposite of what's really popular now like they don't care about making pop tracks they don't care about making soft tracks for chicks they want an entire album of nothing but pissed-off rap yeah not many not that many artists now can pull off a whole album of this like onyx is just perfect for this as rap is getting older you're sort of starting to see which emcees are able to still perform at a really high level of energy and which MCS are still interesting lyrically in which MCS are staying true to their sound now out and and onyx is definitely you know one of those groups now and I hope when people listen to this album they don't come back and they say oh you know how bad the lyrics were because yeah the lyrics are not great onyx group to like they're not going to throw all these crazy metaphors what they say they mean like when he says I'm gonna I know some nigga that I'll kill you for a bucket to like he that's probably true that's probably true and that's not meant for you to sit there and think about it really hard like what does he really mean yeah definitely not I mean I I think uh I think that they don't you know get enough credit in the grander scheme of things for being you know one of those early adapters of such angry aggressive hip-hop music I mean you know I mean back the fuck up came out you know just before 36 chambers did right and and took that angrier sound and and brought some more dynamics to it you know definitely and you know had a number of emcees on it with different voices which I'm sure you know added to the enjoyability of the LP just simply because of the variety but I mean onyx was definitely you know at home plate earlier on when it comes to just uncompromising anger that it's pretty cool to see that you know even ten years since their last record that they're still able to just keep that up um you know uh like Mike said the lyricism isn't like really worth dwelling over you know it's what what you do with the lyricism what you do with the beats what you do with the hooks here is you just react to them yeah I mean physically for the most part uh that it's it's you know you're not going to rewind this album to hear a line no no unless unless you're like ooh that was mad or like or maybe that was bad or something oh wait what was that line like I think he said on we don't fucking care I think with sticky fingers again reset I'm an enigma a shout fish gonna live forever like a shellfish or something yeah that was which I had to Google that to find the age of shellfish like how long to shellfish live and like this dudes on some Discovery Channel shit right now is like watches some animal play eat y'all know he was D no sleep no sticky fingers complexity you just you went to the aquarium and you know you had attended a local caring they were giving a lesson on shellfish and they're talking about the I'll remember they'll put that diverse watch watch because that's that's way more complex than you know wash it off fucking care I never had shit mom gave mom's gave birth to me on a pissing match oh good oh it's so good I love it it is a fun listen you know if you like angry head nod and just like body earthquake music onyx and snowgoons came together and put together a pretty a pretty solid LP I haven't banged my head this hard to a hip-hop album in quite some time and like you were saying like you react physically like when I'm driving down the street listening to this I can't help but just be like the whole time and it's like it's so infectious I don't think we were angry enough during this review the phone yeah we've laughed way too much for an onyx review that makes no sense we did we've done fucking Canadian dry Canada Dry ginger ale haha work sweater like this is this is not right enough we should both be in wifebeaters sorry man wasn't good was like oh not good like yeah get outta here everybody see I'm fuckin on me when he was checking out close the door sub asking questions I had class thanks for being you turn up yeah I see he did you turn to fuck up you know feeling like a strong six to a light seven on this thing it's a pretty decent listen you know it's not going to be one of my favorites of the year but still I mean it's it's it's it's energy is undeniable pretty much totally agree 100% all right man XE town onyx snowgoons wait the fuck out like the fuck not forever you 
MBkph9YoG8w,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new wild beasts album present-tense these guys are a uk-based art pop outfit and this is their fourth full-length album a band that's known for its whimsical songwriting and incredibly theatrical and dramatic singing from dual frontmen tom fleming and hayden Thorp the singing on their LPS really is wild beasts most defining characteristic however across many of their records the most persistent issue for me has just really been the sound of their instrumentation the sound of their music in general I think the Achilles heel of the band's last LP smother was that the instrumentation sounded so plain on that record while the vocals and tunes are fantastic and really sharp a lot of the time I find the guitars and the drums and occasionally since to be just a little too dry a little colorless a little lifeless however it is their sound that the band is Overhaulin on this newest LP of theirs as I heard in an interview I did with frontman Hayden Thorpe earlier this year he said that this new LP from the band does not rely quite as much on live instrumentation and explores a lot more synthetic electronic textures and I suppose in a way present tense is wild beasts electronic record however this album wasn't really the shift in style or sound or aesthetic that I thought it was going to be based on the conversation that I had it's not like this was the kind of change that Liars made for example from their LP sister world to wishyou which was a significant change in the band's sound and how they wrote songs while beasts however even though there is a bit of a sonic change on this LP they still rely on a lot of the same slower smoother sexier grooves more sensual melodies and they bring their usual vocal style along for the ride as well on this LP - and the inclusion of more synthesizers on this new record of theirs isn't real that overwhelming of a change since the drumbeats and the vocals are really what kind of take reigns on these songs anyway which isn't necessarily a bad thing since that is exactly what is made wild beasts sounds so seductive over their past few albums anyway for the most part the band's strengths remain the same but I think their weaknesses do as well the dynamics between the band's two lead singers are still really impressive the songs on this LP overall are very enjoyable a lot of the tunes here continue to set a kind of sexy tone however I'm still pretty lukewarm on how wild beasts approaches sound and even though there are some tracks here where it seems like while beast x1 synth sound on top of another I'm not finding this record to be nearly as colorful as the cover that they've slapped on it and I think they're really touching vocals and tunes and occasionally very bold lyrics do kind of get hindered by the sounds that wild beasts lair into these songs like with the opening track the lead single from this LP wanderlust I think they're really still flat rough bass synthesizers that just sort of warble away in the background on this song don't really set that great of a tone neither does the very numbing drum be in one stiff synth phrase after another it just makes the songs momentum feel non-existent by the time the track is halfway through again if it weren't for the singing and the fact that the song has a pretty epic ending I don't think I would have dug the track at all I think the stiffness pervades other tracks on here like daughters and then there's the closer on here which to me sounds sort of like a Kate Bush 'like eighties tinged art pop ballad that could have ended a movie and played while the credits rolled despite really blunt lyrics on this LP like don't confuse me for someone who gives a I think there are a lot of sounds on this record that feel a little sterile occasionally I just get the feeling that wild beasts did not dig too far or manipulate too far the synthesizer sounds the electronics that they actually went into this record using it felt like the band just went down another Avenue to execute what they typically do as opposed to use this opportunity to find a plethora of entirely new sounds to build their songs off of for someone who is hoping for more of a significant change on this new record of theirs it's a little underwhelming but for somebody who loves wild be sounding exactly the way that they typically sound that it could be a good thing I guess at the end of the day wild beast is never going to be that kind of sonically spelunking sort of band and that doesn't mean this record is disappointment to me merely because of that because again they do deliver good songs like the song Mecca I love the descending vocal melody on this track because a serious highlight on this record for me and I love the stuttering guitar solo in the second half of this track - there's the song pregnant pause a really powerful piano ballad delivered by Haydn Thorpe on this track really beautiful singing across the song and I love the way that the instrumentation builds from the beginning to the end of the track it does show a significant amount of progression from the start to the finish and I love how well the abrupt ending comes in based off of the phrase in the hook pregnant oh we're just we're finishing what I would there's just silence you know pregnant pause you know couldn't have a girl then there's the track of simple and beautiful truth which in my opinion actually should have beat out wanderlust for the single off of this LP yeah for sure it does not signify as bold a change in the band's sound as wanderlust but I love the synthesizers in the background of this track it seems like they would have been more fit for a set of stringed instruments to be playing them but still I love the way that they just lightly pump away the falsetto on the hook the Haydn delivers on this track is absolutely sexy and this song I think has maybe the most irresistible groove on the entire album there's a dog's life which is one of the slow burners off of this LP and maybe the only Tom Fleming lead song that I really loved mostly because of its huge climactic ending one of the few moments on this LP where I felt like wild beasts really made use of the additional electronics on this LP and built up a lush wall of sound to climax this track a really powerful moment on this LP and also something on this record that makes me think how amazing it would be if wild beasts incorporated more epic spots in their albums like this but hmm what do you know wait for the next record and listen to that that's what I'm gonna do this record for me was a very good listen there are some tracks that truly do pale in comparison to others and I'm not one over completely by the incredibly slight change in direction at least what seems slight to me change in direction that wild beasts made on this LP still whatever shortcomings wild beasts do have instrumentally I think their songs and their singing continue to be impressive I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
19ecDCf3iLY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Liars record mess whoa it's a great looking record yeah it is a really cool record beautiful it's actually really interesting it is it is blue blue man yep it is a good record experimental music outfit liars has just dropped their seventh full-length LP P and they're a band that's kind of hard to put into words or at least a couple of words they've been creating really abstract adventurous rock electronic and dance punk music since their formation in the early 2000s and their sound has been in a constant state of evolution ever since their inception and even though it's been a little while since I've all out loved loved a liar's record maybe not since 2006 as drums not dead it has still been interesting watching the band's progression from one record to another because of how dedicated they are to changing from album to album the closest they came to really exciting me since the release of drums not dead was their last full-length LP wish you a record that showed the band making a sudden and hard shift into a really electronic and minimalistic sound it is easily Liars bleakest moment on record with a few exceptions on the tracklist like the song brats a track that was actually so good just loaded with throbbing electronics a faster pace in tempo just a little more upbeat but grimy er just more aggressive I vaguely remember wishing more songs on this LP sounded like that particular track and the thing is Liars do exactly that with mess the band does not hold back in a single aspect of this record they essentially deliver a series of alternative dance tracks on this LP that mix elements of techno house ambient music synthesizer punk and we with lots of twisted keyboards delivering sinister melodies or just some really rough unsettling textures the songs on this LP like liars previous albums continue to be fronted by these really unaffected disembodied vocals that range from just really low lose to really oddball falsettos and I actually think the deadpan delivery of the vocals matches the instrumentals on this LP quite a bit because the instrumentals are just so bombastic they're just so aggressive to have vocals there that are just really chill and maybe a little eye widening and weird as a nice touch and the beats the rhythms the grooves on this LP range from monstrous massive industrialised nightmares to kind of upbeat high tempo glitchy and strange dance tracks there are even a series of songs on this LP that head back into that ambient direction that you remember from wish you but with a lot more colors and layers and like the album wish you I think Liars comes through with a record cover that matches the music perfectly the sounds on mess don't feel organized in a really kind of clean and succinct way they are matted they are grimy their while their uncompromising ly colorful but even though the record is kind of hectic I think lyre still comes through with some songs that are kind of catchy like the song mess on a mission which has one of the more lively tempos on the entire LP punchy snare and the song also features some of the most memorable vocals on the entire LP especially on the course which just burns like a forest fire for me anyway I love the wailing synth leads in the background and the speedy refrain on this thing and the song Pro anti anti maybe one of the more attention grabbing songs on this entire LP with it's kind of chilly catchy reverb organ riff playing at the very start and then immediately busting in all of these heavy bass synthesizers in this gigantic kick and snare drum a beat that I can see almost rocking on a Nine Inch Nails record except way heavier I love the eerie eerie falsetto background vocals I love the lead vocals which are fantastic and so there's and the very last verse on this track as well just brings up all this imagery of like a a robot army marching in to dominate the human race and then there are tracks on this LP that I wouldn't necessarily say are catchy but function more on just creating a really enthralling sound set and an irresistible groove that I can kind of just get lost in and then like the opening track on here mask maker which has all these bubbling synthesizer arpeggios keeping a really tight pace and there are some pretty weird vocal samples playing throughout this track too like my face but their placement into the song seems so much like I don't know just like electric body music from the 80s or something like that and the song actually transitions into the song immediately after Vox tuned EE D making these two tracks feel like one long continuous tracks since they kind of keep up the same momentum although this song does to me is as fantastic as it is with its groove and its synthesizer layers it does expose kind of an issue on the record and that is the vocals though I think they're eerie eerie delivery is is is really good a lot of the time occasionally I feel like they're they're a bit of an afterthought on this record whether it's with the lyrics like the people tell me why or with so many songs on this record just featuring elongated moans or on the song can't hear well which is a bit of an intermission a pretty slow burner that is kind of short thrown into the middle of the LP I like the synth line on this thing the the patience that it requires to really enjoy it but the vocals on top of it just sound like I'm cupping the microphone with my hands and doing a cartoony boy to me the vocal delivery on this track is a bit of a stretch but if vocals are an issue for you on this LP the band actually goes without them on the song darkslide which is a bustling busy piece of electronic music very dense and the way the song progresses it doesn't really make a huge significant change in the midst of its runtime er anything like that it just progressively gets noisier and noisier and noisier I wish there was a bit more change across this tract though it feels more like a motif than anything but the last third of this LP is really where liars makes the creepy kick in the song boy zone grabs an international groove and then throws some moaning vocals on top of it with a set of incredibly unsettling dissonant synthesizers both high and low and it creates one of the weirdest spots on the entire album and there's the two closing tracks on here too like perpetual village the longest song here at 9 minutes long there's some pretty minimal atmospheric beats on this thing the falsetto vocals return it's again odd it's unsettling it's just so out there and yet the production seems so close the grooves seem so close to something like nicolas jar could have made and then the closing track on this thing is a bit of an ambient ballad which i love the really pretty melodies playing in the background of this thing but it's met with this wailing buzzing synthesizer that's so just wool and I mean wool in a good way because I love how this record is just so just so twisted again twisted throughout oh man is it sick this record is one sick puppy and even though that is kind of a constant thread I do think that the songs here do a great job of transitioning from one vibe one feel at the start of the record a more aggressive feel to something much more relaxed at the finish I really love the flow of this album I love the grooves I love the vibe I love the sounds on this record I think the way Liars treat create and manipulate sound is so great to me in no way has Liars half-heartedly transitioned into electronic music this record really is a true-blue blend of techno house and some kind of undefinable third element that can only be described as liars because even in a different genre entirely the band's appreciation for eerie atmospheres and sound manipulation dissonant tones and strange ass vocals still rings true there are a few underwhelming songs along for the ride on this thing but I was massively impressed by what the band had to deliver on mess I'm feeling strongly to a light 9 on this thing transition if you view in this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it y'all that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Liars forever 
a1eL0IQk5VI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Skrillex album recess Skrillex is an electronic music producer most known for being a leading figure in the rising popularity of noisy drop centric dubstep aka brostep love him blindly as an EDM fanatic or hate his guts as a slightly snobbish fan of more refined genres of electronic music Skrillex is rise to the top has made him a pretty polarizing figure and I personally have never really even hated his sound right from the first moment I ever heard it on his scary monsters and nice sprites EP a handful of years ago at the time when I dropped my review of that EP I was actually pretty surprised at some of the negative reactions to my positive feelings on the thing and while drops and very noisy bass frequencies do play a pretty huge role on the songs from this EP a production technique that a lot of people equate to pure buffoonery these days I personally not only enjoyed that but saw beyond that to see a lot of very jittery detailed rhythms I loved the fact that these tracks always seem to be shifting and sound and groove and also brought a lot of color and texture to the table I thought a lot of tracks on the CP were fun energetic hard-hitting and detailed too however even though I do like what Skrillex was doing here I'm not ready to really defend every move he's made in mainstream music since then for one there were a few potholes on his bangarang EP even though I think he did come through with some of his hardest bangers yet on that thing did not really care for the Dores track they're also really didn't dig Skrillex's work on the dubstep infused Korn album path of totality and he actually dropped an incredibly weak EP last year titled leaving where out a few tracks here if felt like Skrillex was trying to emulate the airy more atmospheric more subtle sounds of underground tone down dubstep producers like burial and while in a sense taking on these sounds felt Cincy it really sort of came up short in terms of being as entertaining as some of those artists so last week out of the blue Skrillex decides to just drop his debut full-length album with this kind of tacky alien cover and title however as far as party music goes I feel like you could do a lot worse the Skrillex so I didn't go into this thing with maybe the same level as anxiety some of the people who hate listen to this thing did I'm sure but for Skrillex what I think this record comes down to essentially is versatility versatility he's really pushing himself on this record to work with a variety of artists and musical styles incorporating his typically loud drop centric heavy party-ready sound to different styles of music he's really pushing himself on this record to work with a variety of different artists and sounds seeing how many different places he can take his typically loud heavy production style and apply it you know to different genres and sometimes it seems like he's taking just a really weird sonic detour as well I think this is maybe his least cohesive record yet I don't think there's a whole ton of strings these tracks together and I would say the single power of this record isn't quite as strong as it was on some of Skrillex as earlier releases as well I think the closest Skrillex comes to dropping a track of that intensity of that quality is rageh bomb with the ragged twins I love the distorted vocals all over this track their really attention forcing the groove on the song is fantastic and the drop is insane the eerie synth arpeggios that float throughout this tracks at a really nice tone and I love the way that the bass and the rhythm sort of go double-time toward the end of the track I love the song but Skrillex doesn't really concentrate on churning out a massive banger with each track on this thing which like I said earlier does leave this LP feeling less heesu than previous projects but I guess it's sort of a silver lining in a way that you know nothing kills an albums listen ability like taking a great idea and then just copying it 10 or 12 times instead he brings a lot of variety which does lead to some hit or miss tracks like usual Skrillex does deliver some heavy dubstep bangers with some ear worm vocal samples or contributions maybe some bright screaming synth leads as well like on the track try it out or the song recess - although the incessant vocal samples on this track of put your hands and weed okay and the fake crowd noises on this song making a sound like the song is being performed live or being played to a crowd or something like that it really kills what little is enjoyable about the rhythm and they're really sweet just candy candy sweet vocal samples on this track and there's another track on here that features the ragga twins as well the opening track on here all is fair in love and brostep a song that unfortunately while it does embrace all the tenants of brostep that we have come to expect from a guy like Skrillex it's just kind of an inconspicuous sort of average song for school unfortunately however there are tracks on here where he does show that he has some tricks up his sleeve and he's not just a one-trick pony for one the song stranger a pretty chilly subdued piece of dance pop that has a really great vocal contribution on it I love the melody on this track the vocal melody that is however the beat the groove just the overall tone of the song seems like it is the result of having listened to our upon hour upon hour of the new disclosure record settle with the very choppy groove in the background on this track and the boyish lead vocals I think this song might have fit pretty snugly into settles tracklist along with the song fuck that too and even though the influence on this track seems really a parent I think Skrillex puts his own play on this thing once the heavier drums come into play and he throws this absurdly squeaky ridiculous synth lead over the track that as weird as it sound I think I love it it's great the song coast is clear has chance the rapper which is another huge surprise on this LP and while lyrically the song is pretty trashy it is really surprising to hear Skrillex come through with an instrumental that complements chance so well and sounds like something straight out of the acid rap mixtape that came out last year except maybe a little bit louder brighter punchy er featuring the kind of dubstep rhythms that we typically expect from Skrillex and then there is sort of a surprise remix on this track of the Nicki and the dub song DJ ease my mind which is titled ease my mind on this record and while I think the song is really great I loved hearing it on the record that they put out a little while ago I don't really see what Skrillex does with the track here other than just sort of make it more appropriate to play in the midst of a DJ set other than that in my opinion he's really added nothing to the track and made a really great song a lot less dynamic than it originally was but my least favorite of all of the surprise tracks on here easily is the song dumpy pump a really dinky piece of glitchy electronic music that has these just weird cartoony sound effects in it that sound like they were lifted off of just like a general sfx CD or something like that it's colorful but the pace of is really slow there's nothing much about it that's all that memorable and it kind of creates this very unnecessary intermission toward the back end of the album as nice as it was to hear Skrillex just go down some different avenues on this record I mean the songs were he's experimenting the most are among my least favorite here unfortunately while I think the more heavy brostep tracks on this record are sort of average for him they were at least passable for the most part I mean the song that he has Diplo on dirty vibe is this fantastic piece of moombahton with this killer rhythm high-energy and I love the insane vocal sampling on this track and as the vocals are being sampled the the crazy paradiddles that are being played with them and I love the way these trap high hats fly in as some of the rap versus start on this track its its highlights like this that for sure will have me coming back and listening to each new Skrillex release at least into the near future just to see if there's some killer bangers in the playlist and I think Skrillex could potentially continue going down that road if he brings these bangers together onto an EP and is just sort of concise with his releases and isn't putting a lot of filler onto them and unfortunately I feel like that's kind of what we got with this record while it does show that Skrillex is a more versatile producer than I think a lot of people give him credit for you know he really does kind of push himself out of his comfort zone proving that he can do one thing do another thing do another thing I think he's considerably far away with all the potholes in the tracklist on this thing from putting out one of his better releases I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
UT4gpKs2G8Y,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big Ups album 18 hours of static New York Bands big ups this is their debut full-length album which they have built up to with from what I understand a split a 7-inch and it's a record that I love the more I listen to it there's a lot of noisy punk rock on this record a bit of old-school lo-fi indie rock as well and with these influences the band essentially delivers a series of songs they have some really strong in-your-face very opinionated lyrical content reflections on the world at large the fast pace of life really spittin some big fat loogies into some societal norms it's angry its rebellious and it's looking for the first person that's gonna give us some crap because right away it's gonna say hey I'm not gonna take this crap the band might seem like they're kind of looking for a fight but at least they choose their battles wisely the song wall being about what seems like self trickery the lyrics sing about pulling the wool over one's own eyes on the slow burner of a track that features some guitar leads and some vocal deliveries that sound pretty akin to something from like a slant record I love the very tone down subdued verses on this track and how they're matched with a really passionate vocal delivery on the chorus and the explosive finish on this song too we should switch this we've gotta get the drive Like Jehu in here man for this one the lyrics on this track and others here are very simple they're straightforward the rhyme schemes can be pretty basic as well however the sentiments for the most part do feel powerful I know there's a better way but I just can't say what will make it okay if I could have just one wish I would wish for this I would wish for justice or maybe my favorite lyric on the entire album people say it's always getting better all the time but it's bad still bad I love the song disposer with these very subdued guitars in the back goes through this take-out-the-trash mantra disposable camera disposable razor disposable income disposable wife everything we throw away the song is essentially really quick to point out how many things we buy into knowing that we're just gonna be tossing them in the trash months days weeks maybe years down the road and the drum groove in the background of this track is a little funky to kind of in a Fugazi sort of way the song atheist self-help is another track on here that while the guitars the drums are good they're punky they're noisy we get some lyrics that are satirical hilarious in a way where the singer of the band is saying that you know I don't need religious doctrine to tell me what a jerk I am I sort of do that pretty well on my own the song goes black has all these speedy guitar riffs and drums matched with these lyrics that are just going a million miles an hour talking about the fast pace of life and how life is just going by so fast that manat really living in the moment or enjoying the little things in life then there is the song TMI which essentially sings about being a self medicating emotionless numb to the world robot my operating system runs on complacency I think it's fine it doesn't really bother me then every track on here pretty much delivers a very plain as day message and occasionally there are songs on here that sort of segue into one another really well really kind of feel like one track or just complement one another where one track sort of carries the momentum of the one that came before it like the song little kid which switches right out of TMI with these insane spiraling just dizzying noisy as hell guitar riffs we're against them the singer of the band is saying stop it almost as if he's pleading with the instrumentation itself as he is singing and the sound of the record the sound of the instrumentation on this thing is just so great it's just so top-notch for this kind of songwriting I mean the guitars are so brittle the drums just kind of get lost in the mess a little bit the bass guitar is really guttural it feels like every pick being stroked onto the strings it's just like killing the guitar and in a way that kind of reminds me of Minor Threat the band toes this line between being very fast precise and sort of having just enough looseness and enough chaos to just make it feel like the group is just on the verge of total destruction there's just a rough around the edges quality to this LP that I really like Plus for a record this noisy the vocals are very readable which again is great because messages do play a pretty strong role on a majority of the tracks here there's nothing too esoteric about the lyrics on this LP and while I think many of the tracks here really are in your face with what they're trying to say there is an element of cleverness and and satire that keeps these songs from feeling too preachy or like they're trying to jump down your throat or look down at you or anything like that the downsides for me on this record is that there are a few songs on here there are a little short of breath and don't really leave an impact on me because of that or feature such a simple lyrical approach that hmm I'm left groaning a little bit like the opener body parts or some of the verses on the track wool other than that I think this is a fantastic short little noise punk record that has a lot to say and will definitely go down as one of my favorite rock records of the year I am feeling a strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
Zr4YJIqx31c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future islands record singles Maryland via North Carolina's synth pop outfit future Islands has come out with their fourth full-length record whoo I have been a follower of their exploits for a while now ever since I heard some of the more popular cuts off of their 2010 album in the evening air songs like tin man and welcome through that duel and on this record and the band's next record as well I found some really simple straightforward sort of bare-bones drum machine backed synth-pop that made up for its simplicity with some very solid good song writing strong melodies and the incredible vocals of frontman Samuel T herring which have kind of been a selling point for the band lately ever since they did a surprise Letterman performance a few weeks ago what was jaw-dropping about this late-night performance was the level of intensity that the band especially Samuel performed with there were plenty of tight dance grooves in the performance rushes of synthesizers as well as Samuel singing over these tracks with his trademark very soulful rasp that went through a range of pitches but the real high notes of this performance are when he sort of pulls into these guttural death growls that really are something different for the genre Sam really does have a set of pipes that could possibly rival that of some of my favorite death metal singers which is a move I suggest the band go into if this whole future islands thing does not pan out either that or dancing anyway with this electrifying performance of the band's lead single from this new record it seemed that a lot of people were kind of finding out about this band for the first time and my faith in them as a band was rekindled a little bit because with each record of theirs that I have been following so far they've always dropped to three or four songs on to it that I loved but then the rest of the record I can kind of take or leave so I was kind of hoping that singles would just push me over the edge into full-on loving a future Islands record from front to back especially with such a lead track off of this thing and an album title that kind of insinuates that maybe every song is going to be as catchy as the next however singles does not really deliver on the level of intensity that people might be expecting from future islands given that they may have seen that letterman performance or have caught a bunch of live dates that the band has performed at recently I mean truth be told their live sets have kind of been notorious for being just a bit more energetic than what they do on record because here with a lot of the tracks I feel like they play it kind of safe instrumentally and vocally while a lot of tracks here are catchy there are really only a few spots where future islands come off as fierce on top of that I feel this record does exemplify an Achilles heel that I think has been following future islands through nearly every record of theirs and that's the production to me a lot of the songs here feature a pretty flat mix of synthesizers drum machines and bass with Sam's vocals sitting atop all of it pretty comfortably nothing sounds too bright I think overall the instrumentation on this thing is a little sapped of color the beats on this record constantly sit on the back burner not even on the back burner but on the back of the back burner I wish they were louder or even just had a crisper tone I wish they were propelling the instrumentation more aggressively especially as these songs explode in two choruses where it seems like it's really only the synthesizers or maybe even some distorted bass that gets louder and I'm not that crazy about some of the synth texture is used on these tracks to like the really squeaky high-pitched tones wailing away in the background of Sun in the morning or some of the watery reverb tones on the song spirit which very messily color the background and I feel like on synth lines like this and others on here too there's a lot to be desired in terms of placement I feel like there's not a whole ton of precision to the way these synths are played and the bass tone leaves a lot to be desired as well it's either this very flat hollow sound or kind of this bland distortion that brings a bit of heaviness when the band's trying to thicken up a chorus occasionally I feel like the instrumentation here shoots for something sort of quaint light a little more spacious reminding me quite a bit of like a beach house record there we are this is especially true of the track like the moon however even though the beach house comparison even though that beach house sound is very apparent it stirs up nowhere near as much emotion for me here as it does here once again on this new record future Islands essentially deliver a record that has a really solid unbreakable chassis and a souped-up engine of great songwriting and really fantastic vocal performances but the body sitting on top of these things is like that of an economy car I actually didn't even start enjoying this LP fully until I listened to it strictly on headphones numerous times because the mix of this album the instrumentation is just not very full it's not very warm and and I felt like the only way to really even give the record a bit of punch or make it seem like it has a bit of punch is to just bring it into a very close intimate setting then I was able to appreciate how good some of the songs on this thing really are even though like I said some of the performances are reserved but that doesn't stop songs like seasons from just being really good no seasons change wonderful track sweetly ringing with synth melodies a very live snare drum with some tambourine mixed in there too and a killer refrain and vocal melody way to know you Sun in the morning as well I mean just really solid song she gives me a daily so and the vocals even though the instrumentation is not that fantastic they continue to be powerful moving very dramatic theatrical doves another great song I love the collective whoo-hoo on the chorus really nice rush of sound with the hook there if there's any way that singles really does live up to its title it is that the record tracklist overall is pretty no BS there are no songs on here that kill the momentum of the record we have one concise succinct verse chorus verse track after another even the slow burners on this LP the ballads don't lose sight of a really straightforward pop appeal one of my favorite slow burners on here song for our grandfathers is not only a sweet song in terms of melody but I think it is the sweetest song on this entire LP in terms of sentiment it's a pretty touching song speaking directly about our elders the influence that they continue to have on us their guidance their guardianship that they have on us possibly beyond the grave again song for song I really dig what future Islands is dishing out and again I mean this band features one of the most interesting vocals in underground or independent whatever you want to call it pop music today it's just that I'm still not very enamored with the sound of their instrumentation and the production they use to present their songs and while I do think this record is an improvement and is much more focused than future Islands last album I'm still not in love with this one I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition what did you think of this thing did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana future Islands forever 
lQ3OTq63SDY,got the old red on hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new war on drugs album lost in the dream Philadelphia rock band the war on drugs this is their third full-length LP following up what was pretty much their breakout album back in 2011 slave ambient an LP that I did not love but did appreciate for its puncher tracks like come to the city as well as it's pretty novel mix of genres like psychedelic rock folk rock krautrock Americana and the singer-songwriter stylings of artists like Tom Petty or Bruce Springsteen in a nutshell this record to me was kind of like combining the music of Noy with Bob Dylan I thought the combination was a great idea I thought these sounds were really trippy as well as vivid I thought there were some great songs on this record but all too often I found the tracks on here sort of getting distracted and lost in the very haze that made this record such a unique piece of music in the first place and as a result of that the band sort of was losing track of interesting songwriting and and was just sort of making music that was a bit too comatose for me and considering ex band member Kurt Vile left the group a little while ago to sort of improve upon the sound in his own records I think in a lot of ways he's kind of beat them at their own game with this more psychedelic approach to Americana folk rock singer-songwriter music so I really wasn't sure what to expect from the war on drugs on this latest LP but still I ended up coming out of this thing pleasantly surprised yes the band does tend to wear their influences on their sleeves there are some occasionally uninteresting moments on this thing too but I still think lost in the dream is a noticeable improvement upon what the band has been doing up until this point the production is far more lush more colorful more layered a bit more saxophone seems to make its way into this sea of delayed panoramic guitars and the band also continues to deliver fast ethereal rockers barnburners with fiery guitar solos and really tight drumming tracks like red eyes and an ocean between the waves two of my favorites on this entire LP really explosive moments on this record that I like a lot but some of the more toned-down songs on this new LP from the war on drugs specifically the song disappearing sort of has me feeling like I'm listening to an extended version of the Miami Vice theme song just a really lackluster eighty style new wave slow jam however the very blatant New Wave influence that the war on drugs showcases isn't always a bad thing for one I think these aesthetics are embraced and executed really tastefully on the song burning which immediately as the track hits it feels like I'm listening to a new order song and not just sort of in the way that they're oh they're emulating it but it hits me with the same rush of emotion and power that a great new order song does except of course there is a completely different vocal delivery to the whole thing its tracks like this that actually make me wish that the current set of bands out there that are writing such hazy blissful music actually went this very tasteful route the music here is joyous it's feel-good it's intoxicating and yet the instrumentation is lively you can actually hear things going on it feels like I'm listening to a band of people who are engaged with the music that they're actually playing they're not about to go to sleep I feel like I'm listening to a revision of Bruce Springsteen's dancing in the dark with a fog machine blasting at it from every single direction and like maybe some laser lights or something and while I'm not always totally in love with what frontman Adam grandis seal is is doing with his vocals I can't really deny that what the war on drugs does with the momentum of their tracks the colors the effects the layering the progression of their songs it's all pretty enthralling for the most part like with the opener under the pressure which starts off with just a guitar some drums vocals kind of feels like I could be listening to a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers track it's passable it gets a little drab after a while but in the second third of the song synthesizers some horns come in the drums really start to pick up and that's when the track really starts to become just Who I am really starting to fall for it to become seductive it becomes enveloping with all these sounds that it's presenting it's like an ocean a wonderful ocean of wonderful sexiness and in the last third of this song there is a pretty relaxing buzzing ambient outro that's a very nice on the ears it's a decent start to the record what actually ends up captivating me the most on this LP though are the slower more straightforward ballads and this is actually a spot where I feel that the war on drugs separates themselves significantly from Kurt Vile they step past the reverb a little bit deliver some very vivid detailed passionate lyrics that have sort of a sense of place like eyes to the wind I love the court pression on this track the vocal melody is nice as well the pedal steel in the background nice touch and the closing song in Reverse which starts off with these really icy tones some vocals it's very spacious that's very open vast it's icy as well I would say listening to the song is like just glass shimmering with sunlight just gleaming through it and as the song moves along the instrumentation really picks up keeps things engaging from front to back it's a strong close and to a lesser extent I do enjoy the ballad suffering on here it does get a little too hazy for me at some spots and a little too drawn-out but it is one of the prettier tracks on this LP as well especially with the very beautiful expressive guitar solo in the second half of this track and outside of that there aren't a whole lot of other songs to address on the cell P other major highlights and that's because there are just 10 songs on this record however it takes up more than an hour of runtime because the war on drugs does not hit you with a ton of songs they hit you with songs they have a ton of length and on this record much more than their last record I think they're doing a better job of justifying these lengths of songs that run almost nine minutes or eight or seven because a lot of the time while there are some pretty simple straightforward verses and choruses on these tracks the band really takes their time building them up jamming leaving space in between them there's not a lot of urgency to move from point A to point B on these tracks the band sort of takes it at their own pace and I don't really mind them waiting and sort of letting the tension build to shift from one area of a song to another since the instrumentation the performances on these tracks typically are so tight and nicely put together again the vocals aren't the most enthralling in the world and I do think there are a few tracks on here that run pretty mundane but the songs are definitely of a higher quality on here the hard-hitting and fast-paced tracks are fantastic overall it sounds like the band really did a much better job of adding detail into their music on this thing and it really feels like they they fussed over the material on this thing longer I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
ZFQzmNCJh6I,how is it going everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Evie in Christ EP waterfall this is the latest EP from rising producer star ethereal banger aficionado and recent good music signee Evie in Christ I dug on his work initially a few years ago with a compilation he put out on triangle records and he is following that compilation up with a new EP and possibly preface amazing production for good music artists into the future now this new EP this waterfall EP is just four songs long still the dude shows a lot of improvement in his production chops these songs are incredibly hard-hitting textured heavy with sound now if you recall any tracks from the kings and them compilation you remember that there were clad rap influences on that compilation instrumental hip hop and trap rap too with a huge emphasis on atmosphere and bass and I wouldn't say that Evie and is changing up his style on this new EP that considerably at least not in the same way that he was with an EP that he dropped last year that was a lot more ambient experimental I'm waterfall he's really sticking with his trap rap guns but is doing it just in a much more punchy way a lot of the songs on this EP bang there are some 808 drum sounds on this thing some rumbling sub bass that will most likely get your mouth watering if you're crazy about that tonight EP so yes I do think you might go nutty if you're huge into this or if you religiously listen to every single song uploaded to the alt wrap everything YouTube channel there are lots of club-friendly drops on this thing really riled up rhythms but Evie intends to back these things up with synth leads that sit on the Erie er more atmospheric side of the fence really icy synth textures minor toned leads a splash of reverb occasionally these synth parts are just flat-out weird and the bass and drums aren't exactly normal either I think a lot of the percussion on this record tends to run little noisy a little roughly textured I think there are some songs where the beats feel industrially tinged and sometimes the bass on this thing doesn't come off as warm or smooth or resonant as it does just really distort it especially on the closing track on this thing evie in Christ is definitely showing an increase in aggression on these four songs here which could be a good thing for those who thought that the production and the songs on his previous compilation were a little too redundant or hazy because I think he is showing a bit more refinement with textures and Composition especially on the closing track waterfall loved this song the high-pitched feedback at the start of this track is just ear grabbing the groove of the really heavy drums on this track the disorienting vocals sampling the very chilling synthesizers this track is nightmarish and then in the second half these piano chords introduce themselves along with some really epic atmospheric synthesizers in the background and the music becomes really cinematic very powerful unfortunately the three other tracks on here don't feel quite as multifaceted I would actually say that the first two songs on this thing while they are decent they function off of roughly the same formula we just have different drum patterns and different synthesizer leads again not necessarily bad but just a tad redundant with the four songs here it's really the third song on here where I get my first major surprise in that the rise before the drop on this track happens is actually pretty drawn-out and tension building in a good way in a good way again overall I think this EP is a noticeable improvement over AVN's production on his kings in them and his previously released EP I think he's throwing more detail in here I think he's bringing more captivating songs I think it's bringing more hard-hitting songs the bass on this thing is insane the grooves and the rhythms at least for me are undeniable I think there is a very strong chilling creepy factor to a lot of these tracks too I think that the last major hurdle for Evie in to kind of jump over if he's gonna continue to put out solo stuff this is also something I had an issue with on Kings and them is he needs a little bit more in terms of versatility if he's going to bring a project from point A to point B and keep it engaging throughout other than that I think he's again shown a lot of chops on this thing and bringing his best material yet especially with the title track on this thing if you listen to no other song on this EP listen to the title track I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing transition so you think about love it hate it what I said I review Nick's you know in the meantime remember Doug Anthony Mike hit you anyhow no she's gonna cook there's some cheese grits with the turkey bacon on the side it might in the night off doing that the cupid shuffle and some Versace penny loafers cuz we got

zWJVs2acHZg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tycho album awake this is the 4th full-length LP I believe from California based music producer Tycho cool it has been a little while since we last heard from this guy I believe back in 2011 with his last flight they'll be dive which at least in my opinion seemed like one of the last dying breaths of what we remember as chill wave really light summery Pleasant easygoing electronic instrumentals on this thing loaded with atmosphere and feel good vibes sweet melodies shimmering synthesizers nothing too gripping nothing too offensive in my opinion music for those who don't want their buzz harshed for me it's music that sets a mood it's not bad for a song or two but it tends to just fall in the background for me as I listen to an entire record of this stuff overall the LP is just a little too pastel for me given that I was not really looking forward to what Tycho was going to do on this new full-length LP of his especially since it looks like it I don't know it's kind of like a different version or a rather a rendition with the repeat of the sunset album art but just kind of in a more minimalistic way however I will say that awake is a pretty impressive change of pace for Tycho he moves from what sounds like a single lone bedroom producer to a full band there are a lot of tight instrumental grooves on the cell peace snappy crisp drum sounds shimmering twinkly guitars warm bass lines I love the tone of the bass on this thing a lot of the bass lines are driving and have kind of a picked sound to them not fingered and for the most part taiko just kind of keeps it instrumental as usual and this time around instead of just feeling like an average chill waver just hazy electronic music project taiko seems a lot more like a more pleasant on the ear version of post-rock act sixty-five days of static or maserati or maybe like battles with zero eccentricity or experimentation and that's essentially what this record comes down to for me Tyco has made a major change to the instrumental qualities of his music but he has maintained that really sort of chill laid-back vibe I think the instrumentation is a lot more tangible which overall makes these very chill Pleasant instrumentals more engaging for me but there are still a considerable amount of songs on this record that to me are nothing more than kind of uneventful I do think that live more raw instrumental element does add positive qualities to this record like on the song die where I'm here a lot of explorative synthesizer leads playing on the track I also love the progression of this song from it's very subtle start to some of the more heavy beats and layered synthesizers on the back end and I actually think there's a decent amount of variety among these tracks to like on the song apogee which surprisingly incorporates some drum and bass breaks into its rhythm section but even with all this production quality being improved and some different stylistic influences coming into the recipe on this taiko album I can't say that this record goes out on a limb even once or even stirs up a really exhilarating moment and still I I don't think that is Tycho's mo I don't really think I can expect that from a taiko record into the future but who knows I didn't expect sort of more tangible instrumentation to turn up on this record and here we are while I do think this record has a lot going for it I prefer just a bit more grit and eccentricity in my music that's all at least what taiko continues to do in terms of his style and his sound on this record is sounding a lot more intricate and engaging I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana music review forever 
H2fc-AaU0Sw,ah hi everyone ouch the knee cramp tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Freddie Gibbs in Madlib car driving by album pinata this is the long-awaited full-length LP from DJ producer rapper Madeline aka Otis Jackson jr. aka Lord coifs aka the loop digger aka the bee conductor and Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs my love for Madlib and hip hop just run so deep he's been the architect of some of my favorite songs and albums in this genre like mad villainy and the unseen he's worked with numerous emcees who might have a lot of respect for like mos def many paths blue Talib Kweli there's so much I can say about this guy and I feel the few artists out there right now define hip-hop quite in the same way that he does he's prolific he's unique a great deal of his output is impressive despite the deceptively simple approach he takes to sampling and beat assembly his instrumentals are jazzy they're smooth they're colorful they tend to be a little dusty a little grimy and occasionally he will put an instrumental out there that is incredibly experimental or off-kilter however I've never really been as crazy about Freddie Gibbs I never thought he was a terrible emcee maybe a little redundant with his flow sometimes and his subject matter he tends to kind of tow this gangster rap line and simultaneously is also self-aware enough to kind of give an objective look at this lifestyle that he leads and not only love it and embrace it but kind of critique it as well however on his most recent projects I think here and there he is dipped into some trashy hooks I've always heard a song or two that I liked but never anything more than that really which kind of kept me on the fence as Freddie Gibbs and mad live announced the fact that they were going to be teaming up coming out with a record and they were putting out some pretty good song and EPS like deeper and shame as well as thuggin because even though these songs were really good who knows if it's actually gonna pan out to a great record it's not like Madlib hasn't dropped lackluster collaborative projects before OJ Simpson but I came out of this record incredibly surprised oh man this thing is good it showcases everything that I love about Mad Libs instrumental style and on top of it Freddie Gibbs seems to be on his best behavior when it comes to the lyrics and these songs the concepts that he has in these songs just generally being focused on the subject matter at hand and consistently he delivers the more thought-provoking side of his typically gangster persona as far as the beats go on this thing there are so many highlights like the very grimy funk groove on the song Scarface the tinny synthesizers on this thing the weird kind of police sirens or what sounds like gunshots going on in the background this thing sounds like it was lifted straight out of a 70s exploitation film and with mad lib while the appeal continues to be the assembly the composition of the beat it's also how he treats the sounds within the beat to this instrumental as if this could even be the case but this instrumental sounds like it was made in the 70s and it sort of has gotten more wrinkles and just sort of flabbier and more experienced over time in a good way I mean it's kind of like a finely aged wine or cheese I love the warm base and the stuttering high hats and the analog synthesizer lead pricks on the Songhai the twinkling guitar leads on the songs thuggin are fantastic this instrumental to me is is really top-notch when it comes to the more psychedelic side of Mad Libs instrumentals and that's another thing I don't think he gets enough credit for while he is you know very very strictly a hip-hop producer I think his beats have always had a very subtly psychedelic quality to them sort of triggers triggers trippy very textured they're Shitsville which is maybe my favorite beat on this entire LP with it's really classical string arpeggios playing throughout the track I love the groove the beat of this song - really one of the more cinematic instrumentals on the entire LP and there are some other instrumentals here as well that the sort of shoot for that glassy high-class soul sampling like robes this instrumental is so beautiful it's like one sample one beautiful sample of a song cascading over another it's so layered it's so beautiful and I think the song shame with bj the chicago kid features a lot of the same characteristics - but BJ's guest vocals on this track are so well mixed into the song and also kind of have a vintage quality to them that I never really took notice of until now just so silky smooth so Golden Age soul that as he's singing over the song is his contribution of the track actually sounds original to the sample there's a really great set of synthesizer arpeggios and some very punchy horn hits on the posse track that ends this song out that features verses from Mac Miller Miche Darko Casey Veggies Domo Genesis gee Wiz and Sunna and the song real the beat that kicks this track off is probably one of the most hard-hitting insane trunk knockers on this entire LP not only does the beat hit hard but I love how noisy the instrumental is and yet Freddie Gibbs just has enough space to kind of do what he does it just sounds like there's so many twinkly guitars or maybe even sitars just piling on top of each other with this track and what I suspect are maybe xylophones or vibra phones kind of littered in the background - and then the track just kind of stops and kicks into this surprise beat transition which is an incredibly blissful piece of hip-hop magic it real highlight on this LP and then there's the song bomb that has a number of different synth sounds watery synthesizer leads a kind of really bright shrill wall of synthesizers that pop in occasionally and yet the song is eerie and spacious enough to give Freddie Gibbs just the perfect stage for what he's trying to you lyrically and that is the number one most important thing about these instrumentals they complement what Freddie is doing and that's important his delivery tends to run a little monotone and and that is part of what has made me so unenthusiastic about his past projects but Madlib does such a great job of setting the emotional tone of each song that it's like almost as if I can kind of predict the sort of track that Freddie Gibbs is going to come through with before he even starts spitting the sound of these beats just fits the tone of these songs so well like for example the track deeper a song where Freddie Gibbs essentially used to be in love with this girl the relationship is over and it cut him deep and every single time he says that on the hook of this track I'm just like damn essentially this woman matured beyond him and his thug life and wanted to date a guy who was just in Freddie Gibbs account more Square and he also makes know that what does this guy got that I ain't got he's just trying to be an astronaut although astronauts are pretty cool but with the twist ending toward the back end of this track this is easily one of the most impressive tracks I've heard Freddie Gibbs pulled together and then there's the song thuggin where essentially Freddie Gibbs is like addicted to this street lifestyle he doesn't see himself leaving it he says he's going to be sagging his pants when he's 40 and even if he does leave the streets are still going to be in him and while he does seem to again embrace this lifestyle he doesn't really paint a very pretty picture of growing old in this world this is a sentiment he expresses again but I think with even more vivid lyrics on the song broken and then for those who are looking down on Freddie Gibbs and the life that he leads there is the track Shitsville where essentially he's kind of putting haters in their place not only with one of the most relentless flows on this entire LP but with the mantra that you're just like me with all the cheating the drinking the drugs he just kind of sees himself as being someone who is making the best of the situation that he's in like anyone else and agree or disagree the passion that he has for this on this track is undeniable and simultaneously this track is a bit of a welcome to my world kind of anthem - with a killer hook that shows off a pretty strong Tupac influence not a comparison I usually make because so many rappers are quick to already compare themselves to Tupac hmm but this is one of the few moments where I think not only the sound of Freddie Gibbs voice the way that he delivers this hook and the level of skill that he shows on this track as well I mean the comparison is legit their tracks for Freddie Gibbs is not quite as conscious and and goes right for the aggressive jugular like on the song bomb where he's kind of putting himself into this coke dealer persona selling drugs getting people addicted of course Raekwon the chef is on the back end of this track delivers a very appropriate verse and the last line on Gibbs first verse of this track is hilariously violent talking about how he's going to be leaving these people's thoughts on his shoelaces and then there's the song reel where immediately right after the intro Gibbs goes in on Young Jeezy really hard for mismanaging him when he was on his CT world label he's pretty unforgiving about the whole thing and he takes some hard shots and then there are some other tracks on here the feel really relaxed laid-back kind of blissful like Harold's where it seems like Freddie Gibbs kind of reminisce is about the past his favorite fast-food fried chicken orders and then there is the song shan with bj the chicago kid again while this track is a bit of a heartbreaker relationship-wise it is a very relaxed laid-back beauty on the first half of this LP Gibbs really holds his own track for track 4 track the only real bump in the road is the Danny Brown feature on the Songhai which doesn't really ruin the track for its lyricism but the song is just so laid back and smooth and then Danny Brown comes through with no disrespect to the delivery or the flow obviously I have already dug it on numerous tracks but for this particular song I think Danny Browns more toned delivery would have done just perfectly but as far as the second half of this LP there are a load of features that seem to pile in all at once and and bring this record to a pretty strong close there's damo Genesis and Earl on robes again and again Damo seems to be just improving with every new feature that I hear him on I respect the hustle then there is Earl's verse on here which I mean you can't really expect a bad guest verse from earl scarface sounds great unbroken then Freddie Gibbs and absol actually come together on the track Lakers and sort of do a tribute to the west coast I can't always expect a great guest verse from AB but he does it on here and the basketball references continue on the track Knicks immediately after which in a way with Lakers here and Knicks being right there afterwards is sort of a nod to New York but this song topic wise is a lot less geographical and more about Freddie Gibbs history his past kind of repeating the violence that he's been living with for so long again Freddie Gibbs comes through with a really focused idea concept message on nearly every track here Madlib comes through with some really great instrumentals every track here there are a few moments that are maybe a little inconspicuous like the intro could have been more hard-hitting I think the song you know does not stick out quite as much as other tracks on here however this is still a hell of a hip-hop album and no question that it's going to go down as one of my favorites of this year I will actually go as far as to say that this record is kind of like the second coming of Mad villain and I can only hope that with time this record becomes just as infamous and that we all kind of sit here with blue balls waiting for these guys to follow this record up this is the best thing I've heard Freddie Gibbs on period and I could only hope into the future with new mixtapes and new albums that he is able to keep up this kind of focus this kind of passion and this kind of captivating storytelling I'm feeling a light a decent 9 on this thing transition if you give in this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Freddie Gibbs mad lib pinata forever 
_7Rfp95Jcw8,hiya everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new la dispute record the rooms of the house these guys are a Michigan band ten years going strong this is their third full-length LP and over the years they have evolved to become one of the most idiosyncratic bands an emo and post hardcore pairing the punk spirit and a lot of guitars of these genres with some incredibly vivid and wordy storytelling and this storytelling really reached a peak in the band's career on their last full-length LP wild life dropped in 2011 and is still remains one of my favorite albums of that year grows on me with every listen oh God such a good record if you haven't heard this record please freaking listen to this record really powerful tales all over this album backed with some great rock instrumentation there's a track on here the kind of details the decline and hopeful restoration of a church losing a child to cancer the destruction of some teenage kids life by anti-depression medication a deadly shooting and then subsequent arrests frontman jordan Dreyer's lyrics and singing are winding they're powerful they're loaded with just rollercoaster emotions climaxes plot twists and the instrumentation the band conjured to go behind these lyrics felt like they complemented the storyline of these tracks at every shift in gear that was made it's not like listening to a rock band cycle through a simple series of verses and choruses and even though all the tales laden into these songs are different it is the themes of emotional exorcism and catharsis and metaphorically getting things off of the chest that brings a lot of these tracks together and leaves this album feeling kind of like a concept or very thematic now widest pews back with the new full-length record rooms of the house and on this LP it seems that the band continues to take underground rock music and apply very true maduk wordy thought-provoking lyrics stories poems to it but there are some somewhat obvious changes that La Dispute presents for example this is the band shortest full-length LP so far and is a little more concise than the records they have put out in the past there's not a single song on here that approaches the five-minute mark and there are a few tracks on this LP as well that have faintly catchy and very straightforward guitar riffs or chords on a lot of songs here instrumentally anyway la dispute is no longer indulging in these winding evolving pieces of rock music in fact there are a handful of songs on this LP that instrumentally are kind of subdued which in one breath is kind of disappointing but in another I do think that has led to rooms of the house being the most varied lot of speed record today take the kind of subdued hypnotic drumbeat hanging in the background on the track woman in mirror these strung out guitars and the sort of lacks spoken word vocals seem faintly Slynt esque on this song and then there's the song extraordinary dinner party which opens up with this winning set of melodic chords that if it wasn't in this track I think could have played well into a an old-school dinosaur junior song production-wise la dispute sounds roughly roughly the same there are quite a few tracks on here where the guitars are noticeably legally louder than they have been on previous LPS and I would say with any other band that could have been a great thing but in this particular instance it makes at least on some songs to me especially the second track here it makes the lyrics it makes the vocals so much more difficult to read to make out there are moments where I really think it makes them kind of unintelligible and again for any other band that might not necessarily be a horrible thing but for La Dispute the lyrics just carry the songs so much it seems like the spotlight on this record even more than usual is being shifted away from Jeremy and to the characters that he's singing about it's again a very slight change not big enough to signify a huge in the band sound which could be a good or a bad thing with rooms of the house because for some coming into this record it may seem like La Dispute is just kind of putting together a by-the-numbers sort of LP which I understand could be kind of a hard feeling to avoid considering how unique and specific La Dispute sound is and on top of that any changes they make to their usual sound could seem really great sort of like the downstroke slow and kind of punky guitar chords on the track the mayor and splitsville outside of the context of this record when I was first exposed to this song and many other people too it seemed like this track could have been a grab for a poppier sound or even an attempt at just a stronger element of accessibility but in the context of the record I do like the song a lot more and I do kind of see these guitar courts kicking off the first verse of the album as sort of reclaiming a rock lovesong cliche because as the song progresses it does reveal some really great chord progressions and pretty explosive moments too now like la disputes last album this LP too seems to just kind of be a mixed bag of different tales however these don't feel strung together by the same themes of incredible emotional and sometimes physical trauma still it does not make this LP any less powerful as it kicks off with the track Hudsonville michigan 1956 a song that sets a scene with a woman who's in indiana her husband is over in michigan there's a tornado there's a storm she's shuffling the kids downstairs for shelter there's a bulletin over the radio the song gets really intense as does the track 35 a song that I believe is actually referenced on this opening track here and on this track Jeremy gives us a view of this incredible car accident involving many vehicles and people falling to their demise on a bridge that seems to give way it seems that this incredibly horrific event is actually a bit of a centerpiece on this record I actually think this records king Park if you will and it is referenced on these stay happy there as well as the narrator of this track is sort of contemplating this relationship he's seeing demise in front of him thinking about everything that could have been in the future whether or not that everything occurred in the past throughout this relationship was sort of a waste of time however there are some tails on this record that do not feel quite as grand in topic but it doesn't seem like the band puts any less effort into the storytelling or doesn't try to put any less urgency into the instrumentation for example scenes from highways from 1981 to 2009 which seems to contain a lot of intimate reflections on the past with this particular character that we're following on this record and while this track and no other track on here as well don't feel like a huge disappointment to me it's very clear that this record overall is not quite as elaborate or as extravagant as a lot of spews pass to falling kelpies the gap here isn't huge but it's noticeable and I think it's due to the Bands more concise approach on this record I feel like they are trying to make their instrumentation a little more straightforward on these tracks and a little louder a little brighter a little punchier and yet they don't try to alter their lyrical approach significantly and I think what they've ended up is just trying to put ten pounds of magic inside of a five pound bag to me this kind of lyricism in this kind of instrumentation needs more space needs more time it does not need a really hooky looped drumbeat it does not need a really obvious attempt to try to pull everything together on the closing track which while conceptually interesting is kind of an anti climactic finish and it doesn't necessarily need slightly louder guitars either overall I do think that this is a very good record from La Dispute but I didn't come out of this thing as infatuated with it as I have been with their two previous records still there are plenty of clever metaphors on this LP and allegory involving rooms houses furniture material things a dying relationship and of course there are a few detours as well into personal and widespread disaster I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you maybe you hated it but well why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana La Dispute forever 
jrtUDqLgfzU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd now totally and and finally back from my trip to South by Southwest I mean I've been back physically just not totally mentally and I took a lot of pictures some of which you can see down there in the description box I have linked to a few photo sets that I took throughout the week of a few of the sets that I thought were particularly good while I was down in Austin Texas and I took a lot of video as well all of which I will be showing you clips of in this video going over all the not all of the but a lot of these shows that I saw about the week kind of the highlights for me let's go Tuesday was a bit of a slow afternoon but that night I went down to the Mohawk with my girlfriend and we saw the pitchfork show no mercy metal showcase because out of all the metal showcases that I was able to scout for that week that one was one that was sort of not to miss it had a lot of my favorite bands metal bands that were gonna be down there that week on it so I figured I would get my metal addiction out of the way starting off with iron Reagan who did a pretty good opening set just like punk crossover thrash metal there was some blast beats in there as well especially toward the end they were playing like some thirty-second songs in the set too they were just really intense at some moments and then after them came wind and and they played some pretty heavy doom metal stoner rock stuff and yeah I mean the bass was especially distorted on that one just really heavy set I moved into another room after that on the other side of the venue to see sanehat play and their set was great a few these guys are actually from my own backyard of Connecticut I remember one of them emailed me telling me to check out their record last year which I thought was just okay but then in person I thought their take on instrumental black metal was a lot more interesting the guitars were especially noisy of course there was some post influenced in there lots of atmosphere but it really was the strong intense playing that won me over during this set and the band had some amazing projections in front of them or sort of projecting on them just like really weird light effects and TVs static it was pretty awesome and then Christian mistress were playing the outside stage open-air stage after that and I really dug their last full-length LP and in person they just sounded like a heavier punchy er version of what I had already heard on the record you know they didn't pull any punches or any major surprises or anything like that but still the performance was energetic there was a lot of momentum to the grooves on these tracks they just had a very good tight performance and then after that man power trip another band that Lake Christian mistress I thought was a lot better in person than they actually are on record I was not totally impressed with the LP that they put out on Southern Lord I thought it was just a little too atmospheric and you know just just didn't have that much of an interesting take on this old-school crossover thrash sound but in person man they kick ass they just like took just they didn't take any names they just just kicked ass all over the frickin set and they just like had the most intense mosh pit out of any artist there and there was actually this dude from PBS who was like trying to stage like a fake news report or something and then like some dude kicked him in the head during the set there's like a video of it all the way get down there it was was completely ridiculous it was like trying to make a joke of mosh pits and you know mosh pits are serious business mother fucka Kailasa came in after that they did a pretty decent set I wasn't like blown away by their performance but the riffs were really heavy and I did think that listening to them live I did like a lot of the songs they play from their new record more in person than I did just listening to the album and then Indian closed out the night with a fantastically loud amazingly loud set oh my god I said their latest record was just like noise metal and they really do just bring that tenfold in person I mean they were so freaking loud like it was ear piercing lis loud I had earplugs in I was down in front and yet my ears were like still killing me to be sitting in front of them it was like 1:30 in the morning and my girlfriend and I wanted to get up early so we could see more bands as soon as we got up so we ended up cutting out a few songs before this that was done but we left the venue walked across the street went down to the nearest intersection still with our earplugs in and then pulled them out it was louder there outside the venue at the intersection then it was inside with our earplugs in it was louder outside with the earplugs out then inside with the earplugs in then Wednesday came around this was a day where I just kind of really needed to be focused and have my head together because I was doing my panel which I will link over here and down there in the description box I uploaded it a few days ago it was basically about whether or not the Internet has killed the album review obviously I personally don't feel that way the title was more of a reaction to something that jay-z had said in an interview about the pace at which people listen to records and how people are listening to records sort of at the same time or before critics due to leaks and so on and so forth and yet how bam review still exists hmm overall the panel did go really well there was a sizable crowd there and a lot of good questions were asked and before I actually went into the panel I was having a discussion with somebody who was a fan of the show meanwhile my girlfriend is standing next to me hearing an amazing band in the distance that is totally going over my head because I'm having this conversation and it turns out on the fourth floor of the Convention Center throughout much of the week of Music Week they are having these all inter national showcases with bands from all over the world not necessarily grouping them by genre or anything like that and this one particular group called John Bandai from South Korea was playing a fantastic amazing set everybody who was already in the room before I and my girlfriend had walked in were thoroughly impressed by what was going on on stage it was like mental experimental rock and God speed style post-rock combined with traditional Korean instrumentation and the end result was just fantastic ended up picking up their CD which I still have to find time to listen to at some point this week but I did of course get footage and yeah the set was just really good and then after that I went down to catch Adrian young after my showcase not showcase freakin panel and everything like that he was actually doing a really awesome set with his band and was coming on after that performing with the singer Bilal coming on later in the night and doing backing instrumentation for souls of mischief but before all that happened I caught a Pete Rock DJ set it was awesome he did Grandmaster Flash is the message which caused a b-boy circle to form in the middle of the venue there were some dudes like you know dance battling and it was awesome and they started playing more boom bap stuff and classic 9-b stuff and then just out of the blue he decides to play Drake and then the b-boy circle just like melts it disappears it just completely dissipates it's like it was never there to begin with and everybody just whips out their phones and starts texting and it's like what why why it's whatever it doesn't matter because immediately after this I actually had to leave the venue because I wanted to catch timber tambour live one of my favorite artists right now Canadian singer-songwriter Taylor Kirk and his band they have a new record coming out in April titled hot dreams one of my favorite songs of the year so far come off this record the lead single from this LP and it was an odd live set not only did seeing timber tambour in person really sort of highlight the amount of influence that Elvis has on Taylor Kirk as a songwriter but maybe two songs in Taylor Kirk started cussing into the microphone saying turn off the lights these lights that we have up here they're awful turn them off so the venue proceeded to turn the lights off and then of the band continued to play throughout their set playing mostly new stuff which I assume is going to be on the new record in in near pitch dark blackness still it did end up being one of my favorite sets of the night the new songs nearly every single one that I heard in that setre I can make out as being new sounded absolutely fantastic and the vocals were just really chilling and yet exciting with their kind of gothic old-school rock and roll hybrid unfortunately immediately after this set instead of going back to see souls of mischief play with Adrian Young and his band my girlfriend and I had just found out about the horrific car accident that had happened this past week over at the mohawk the venue we were just at the night before you know it's just like this really horrible thing and just happened and it just didn't feel right continuing the night partying you know all my thoughts all my hopes go out to the people who were hurt in this accident and I do hope that everyone who is currently injured by it now either critically or not makes a full recovery Thursday night turned out to be pretty good night as well I went over to the force field to the showcase because Daniel Gil who was on my panel invited me down there to see some of the Bands of the years on the roster right now I wanted to catch Tony Malina and I caught his set he you know I like this record that he's about to reissue on Slumberland I heard it last year it's a it's a fun little lo-fi pop rock record the dude played like a 10 or 15 minutes set and then immediately after like the the girl who works with South by Southwest was like you play till like you know 9:40 or something and he's like no no not doing that it just like goes onstage and not only did the song sound a lot better in person because you know we're hearing like three guitars bass and drums and vocals just more of a full effect not low fire or anything like that but there are some fantastic layered guitar harmonies that he executed with his band live that were sort of queen esque and a lot of the core progressions and vocal melodies seemed Weezer esque and yet at the start of the second segwang in between some of these songs there were like some thrash metal riffs really weird addition and not something I expected but was actually like a pretty awesome part of the whole thing I believe it was after this that I went over to a nearby church to catch a few musical performances one specifically from perfume yes I actually had to go see this set instead of going to go see that Stones Throw Records documentary I know I really wanted to see it but I mean you know it's movie it's a documentary I figure I can you know get a copy of it and watch it at some point later anyway it was a tear jerker of a set alright there was a tear jerker of his set really good performances of all the songs as well as an extended chorus version of one of the tracks from you geniuses last record which I always thought you know could have used an extended chorus version so I was like oh my god before him we actually caused singer/songwriter that had a very high pitch and very cute voice her name sea lion it was actually really nice performance I need to check out her stuff or maybe you guys should look her up before I even get a chance to and see if her songs are really good again really kind of cute high pitched voice but a but sort of sad lyrical delivery and immediately after my girlfriend and I went over to catch basha bulat thinking that maybe she was going to play with her full band or something like that but it was actually a bit of us so performance and a fantastic one that it was so good that people did not want the next artist to play until she did an encore like people would not stop clapping not stop making noise because this fantastic song that she led off with just got people so fired up they just needed to hear another also while I was down there at the church I want to say that I was handed a record from a miss Mia cameo I hope I'm pronouncing the name of this project correctly although this is not what the record looked like when she handed it to me we had this funny little discussion about how she wanted to give me her record but we were South by Southwest and bringing records around with you is kind of cumbersome and we will get into the tale of what happened to this record and what made this record look the way that it currently does now later into this video so after this performance my girlfriend and I make our way down to go see mob deep over at this place I believe Pandora was a sponsoring and they pulled together a great performance really awesome just there's nothing else to say other than it was mob deep they played a ton of traction the infamous and it was just one boom bat beat after another people knew the words just everyone is going nuts from op deep and after that my girlfriend and I really wanted to catch the set future Islands was doing over at cheer up Charlie's thinking that the place was going to be closed because it was nearby the Mohawk but actually they had it open and we're doing sets there so we made our way down however before we went off off was playing at a venue that we were walking by and I was like holy crap that's off we got to go inside there we got to go inside there right now because I got to get in the pit we have a few minutes I got to get in the pit so went in there win the pit for like four songs four or five songs through down in the pit then left got it bad there and then we can take our way down to future islands and at the the the 4ad showcase that they have over there and my girlfriend and I were able to make it down toward the front slightly and the more we waited for the band the more apparent it became that some people especially this one dude was incredibly wasted around us to the point where he was just like screaming at Sam the band's frontman on the stage of screaming I'm coming for you Sam I'm a-comin fo you which was kind of weird but anyway so we're waiting for the band to start and really excited to hear future islands just kind of do their thing given how many songs from their latest record I have liked and how awesome their letterman performance was and the band starts but sort of delivers this preface saying that we're gonna do like an old-fashioned punk set or this that's gonna be totally Punk or something like that and everyone was pretty excited for that and two things happened at that moment one thing was that I've been listening to feature islands for a while and I've always thought they had the potential to blow up and it's so awesome to see them actually blowing up now and the other thing that happened was that I'm gonna try to take some pictures and maintain my sanity while among all of these people however as soon as the first song starts taking pictures getting video it just goes completely insane and it becomes very apparent that with all the stuff my girlfriend and I have together it's maybe not a good idea to continue standing in this spot and the crowd shifts pushing my girlfriend like three or four people away from me there's kind of like a mosh pit or something going and to be completely honest I am now holding the record that I have just been handed anymore because my girlfriend is holding it because I said that oh I'm gonna take some pictures they do so eventually as she makes her way back to me because the crowd is going absolutely ballistic near where they have kind of engulfed her she comes back saying I don't have the record and as soon as she says this to me a guy who was crowd surfing just a second ago falls on to my head and it's at this moment that everything becomes hilarious this guy just dropped on me my hat falls off my head I look down I see my hat I reached down to grab it and simultaneously this little drunk blonde girl grabs it trying to pull it out of my hand and then I'm looking on the ground for the record my girlfriend says it's over there I'm like pushing through people there's this guy who's a little bigger than me I got like my elbow on his side and I see the record under his feet and I got my hand on the record and every single time he's tapping his toes to the band I pull on the record out from under his feet and it comes out like this and I was just like completely mortified and horrified and feeling really bad about what what I had done and you know so eventually I make my way to the back of the venue or the back of the crowd where I can actually see the band at a distance and just you know not be losing my and having my stuff getting broken and then I'm able to pull the record out and I see that it is still mint okay still in very good condition nothing's wrong with it although I probably should have not put it in that sleeve anymore but I will be putting this woman's music down in the description box Friday was a bit of a slow day for me I saw a really terrible hip-hop showcase toward the end of the day and I was I was trying to actually see CJ fly and absol but I just was not having it with anybody who was coming on before and believe me a lot of people who were there at the venue we're not having it either because a lot of the artists were not really doing it for much of anybody who was down there but earlier in the day I was able to catch bad bad not good play a fantastic set for the innovative leisure label as well as little dragon who was pretty much the one artist I promised my girlfriend that we would see when we were down there because she is so down with little dragon later in the night we ended up going down to the hotel early just to catch some sleep so that I could be up early and sort of handle my business because I had my showcase Saturday over at the grackle lot of tastic artists played including bully lose weekend the good people over impose magazine brought in people under the stairs they played a great set the pains of Being Pure at heart played as well with a new lineup and they sounded great new songs sounded great old songs sounded great the range played a really good DJ set as well I was really psyched to see YC the cynic play live once again and he wow the crowd in front of him a lot of people who didn't know who he was and then Hellfire came on and totally just like in my opinion like just bodied the set up until that point they just had like the craziest most tour most just like over the top set of anybody there up until that point they just played so many great collective songs from their new mixtape a few solo tracks here and there and then finally I was completely amazed by what I saw a rap music performing live I've heard this guy's music before I'm familiar with his tracks from there with his beats but I've never seen him perform live and if you get a chance to see this guy or if you can at least sort of see him at an angle I mean you know not like far away at a distance or anything like that you've got to see this dude play the sampler in front of you because he really performs it like an instrument right there he's not like playing beats and letting beats ride for like you know minutes at a time or anything like that he's literally constructing the beats in front of you right there and playing a lot of these drops a lot of these high hats and snares is such a fast speed it's amazing watching this dude just make this right in front of you who's so fantastic and what else was fantastic is just how many people showed up man just a lot of people came down to this showcase the venue was like at capacity for about an hour I was just really proud of you know what terrorize impose and I were able to pull together in terms of bringing artists to the table to come to perform at this thing but I was even happier that there was a crowd there to watch these people and a nice crowd too after that my girlfriend and I pretty much ended our south-by-southwest over at a gay bar called Oil Can Harry's where it cakes the Killa was playing in an area that seemed I'm just guessing very clearly partitioned off for like maybe modeling or like nudity I don't know either way he was sort of in this weird partitioned off area that wasn't quite a stage not a musical stage anyway but it didn't matter he killed it anyways no he was just so over the top he was crazy he was nuts you guys saw that hangout where he was and and you know he takes that energy and he amplifies it times 10 and then you know puts it all out there on the stage and that was essentially myself by Southwest that and a whole lot of good food trucks a lot of good food trucks and a lot of walking - just walking walking walking band walking walking walking food truck walking walking walking band walking walking walking food truck and yeah that's like that's like the magic south-by-southwest everybody at least my magic for this year all those artists that I film then that I mentioned I mean those aren't even all the people that I I saw you know those were just highlights for me and there were many other that I caught and I saw I mean I had to have seen like upwards of 50 people play throughout the week but but actually going back to the list I mean my favorite favorite favorite sets throughout the week have to be the San has set amazing the Indian set fantastic the John Bandai set great Adrian young fantastic the timber timber said amazing the Bosch Abdullah and perfume genius sets the future Island set was fantastic and mmm the Hellfire Club set as well as the freaking Arab music set you know those are definitely sets that I'm happy I got a chance to see this dude here ooh transition did you go to South by Southwest this past week if you did who did you see what was your favorite set and if you didn't who did you wish you saw Anthony Fantana sabes wha forever 
CRPhFCPbrpQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pharrell record girl super producer singer and songwriter Pharrell he only has a few albums to his name yet he is so widely known in the world of popular music through his fantastic production with the Neff Tunes and any Rd and he's also been kind of the architect of numerous pop R&B as well as knurl hits over the years both minor and major and he's been doing especially well this past year singing and producing some pretty major songs like blurred lines get lucky he had a hand in Beyonce's latest record as well as my favorite instrumental from the new schoolboy q album and he's essentially taking advantage of this latest success streak with a new record that I was kind of looking forward to once I heard the lead single from it happy a song which the tracklist of this record is quick to remind us is from the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack and even though the song is most likely one of the most feel-good songs of the past 365 days and really delivers on its title with some fun lyrics as well as some awesome vocal layering toward the back end of the track great drumbeat but what makes this track stick out to me the most is it is one of the few songs on this record where Pharrell's songwriting and singing actually pleases me I apologize but outside of my favorite any Rd tracks Pharrell's vocals his singing especially his falsetto I've never been a fan of it I personally find his falsetto singing to be a little too weak frail kind of boyish and oddly enough it's something that Pharrell has been relying on a lot lately and it's no more appealing for me here actually it becomes less appealing because I'm listening to her for 40 minutes in a series of songs that are nowhere near as good as a lot of the hits that we've heard Pharrell appear on lately in a nutshell for me listening to Earl is a lot like giving a listen to Justin Timberlake's latest full-length LP in the 20/20 experience I actually think the production on these two records share a lot of the same qualities however girl delivers hardly a shred of lyrical class not nearly as much extravagance or vocal ability and even though I do find a lot of similarities between these two albums the only track I think would have fit on to the 20/20 experience or at least the 20/20 experience part two snuggly and tastefully is the opener Marilyn Monroe the instrumentation is similarly ritzy expensive sounding and danceable there's strings all over this track there's a great drum beat these soaring vocals on the chorus it's got a strong disco vibe and despite all these instrumental characteristics that I'm talking about somehow the production on here still ends up sounding kind of plain kind of lifeless sort of colorless it just doesn't feel like I'm listening to real instrumentation it sounds like I'm just listening to thin synthesized just gutless Ness and even though I do sense a certain amount of variety among the instrumentals on this LP I think girl ends up being kind of homogenous from the subtly African music influence track lost Queen to the kind of reggae tinged Alicia Keys track toward the back end of this thing which is a favorite of mine on this LP but really only thanks to miss keys Justin Timberlake actually turns up on the second track on this LP brand-new and the song is alright it just kind of sounds like an off-the-wall era Michael Jackson riaj the loop bass horn and drum groove and for those that still think that Pharrell is a decent singer I I ask you listen to the song the hunter on this record excruciating it seems like on the surface it was going for a legitimate disco funk vibe but the gutless base and the strung-out guitars and the weird drum groove on this track leave this song feeling more like a Delta 5 song or like a slit song or something off of the disco not disco compilation series where you're getting these bands that are essentially Punk groups but taking the sounds of disco and kind of bastardizing them and making weird tongue-in-cheek pop and dance tunes and to kind of add insult to injury on this track Pharrell just dishes out some lyrical trash duck dynasty's cool and all but they've got nothing on the females call I'm a hunter you're a hot man I'm a hunter you're a hot guy and a hunter you're a hunter I'm a hunter I'm a hunter and this tasteless lyrical streak continues on songs like gush which for me is one of the most unsexy words you can apply to a sexual situation and yet it happens here and then there's come get it BAE with Miley Cyrus we're essentially using motorcycles as a metaphor there are some sexual situations being described idea free idea free idea here Pharrell go on tour behind this album and get a motorcycle shaped bed or bed shaped motorcycle whichever one you can get your hands on for the least amount of money and then have Miley Cyrus twerk on your face on the bed and then ride away into the sunset because it's also a motorcycle unless it's just a bed shaped motorcycle because then it's just a bed the vocal harmonies that Miley Cyrus and Pharrell have on this track just sound really cheap and and fake and just so thin and just so boring to listen to oh and on top of it the groove the bassline the drums on this track just sound like a really lazy reappropriation of like a classic New Orleans funk beat from like a band like the meters or something like that I could go into nearly every track on this LP pointing out what makes it so unappealing but the truth is is that you know this record doesn't really need to be appealing it's not good it doesn't need to be good and it doesn't need to be good because Pharrell's bread and butter has never been his albums Pharrell is going to continue to great songs I'm sure it's just that a lot of them are not going to have his name in front of them that's all it doesn't make him any less important or influential though some artists are best on the stage and some artists work best behind the scenes and Pharrell is one of the few artists who has made a really successful career out of having a foot in both these worlds girl however is clearly one of those moments where Pharrell tries but both feet into the spotlight and the end result is just silly or really arduous listen really lackluster songwriting production lyricism there's a terrible song on this record for every okay one that there is I'm feeling a light two decent three on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it did it make you happy I do like that song this is a really good song though [Music] Anthony Fantana Pharrell girl forever 
Cw2JEEgVC90,you know and at least for me as an outsider someone who's not a sleigh bell fan sleigh bells fan I see a lot of the qualities in their music maintaining over there three records so I mean if you were really attracted for their first I don't see why their third one wouldn't also appeal to you but to go on to sort of doing a negative review I mean I think like the most intense I can't say it was the most negative reaction but I think one of the more intense moments for me was like when I did a review for my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and that wasn't even my most negative review wasn't even a negative review I mean I didn't like some of the songs on it but I didn't say I thought the record was horrible but everyone's reaction to the record you know like sort of just it was the most negative reaction to anything I had done a video so far and that was like when my in doing that review actually like brought this huge influx of viewers that I never had before and you know it also like cause my audience to turn on me and everything and and then you know it's sort of like I had to do like soul searching for a day and it was like you know you know like toward the toward the liked or the beginning of december so like things are calming down so I just like had a day to do that and then you know after sort of the next year started all any and all negative reaction to what I had said it just like I mean people still ask me about that album occasionally and whether or not I still feel that way but you know people are still like you know hit me up and being like you're an asshole fair to know here's a really um yeah you know you're lucky I still get called an asshole cuz I didn't care for the last night uncle si will call me an asshole for other records oh you know that's not that one that's the thing if you're just constantly putting out new album reviews people forget about your new negative your old negative ones and just hate you for the new days you know yeah you know okay this is just okay yeah sure dizzy there's a new story I've been following it came out about a week ago that I think is relevant here because i think it is sort of proof that reviews do still matter and somewhat in some regard but there's a vault I think it was the Baltimore City Paper I want to get this rate had published a really harsh live review of Jason Aldean and you guys know who that is very very famous country singer yes it was in the Baltimore City paper and basically um you know the one of the main advertisers and the entertainment pages of their paper and on their website is live nation they had presented the Jason Aldean show in Baltimore and they basically live nation came to the paper and said that they would like the review pulled from their website archives and from the paper and it's a whole controversy you can google it its there's a lot to read about it a lot of people have been posting about it but clearly if an f live one measly concert review that was a negative review of this guy could cause this much you know of a harsh reaction from you know up and down the food chain I feel like we're reviews and still definitely ruffle feathers and and and and cause things to happen um I mean at least in in in my personal experience I don't know if this has ever happened with deadendhiphop I've never had this conversation with Mike before first time ever seeing one person I know at least in my case there have been a few negative reviews that I've done we're on youtube I mean it's sort of a unique platform in that any copyright holder for anything can essentially approach your video and say that there's a piece of their copyrighted content in it and have your video effectively taken down for a certain amount of time until YouTube sort of goes through the process of realizing that there's not actually any copyrighted content in here you know they're sort of banking on the fact that the person isn't going to fight back or that you know will sort of just forget about it and it will be on the back burner in their head and you know I've had a devo review taken down that had no audio clips in it whatsoever because the label was claiming that there are audio clips in the video when there wasn't I've had a Neil Young review taken down that was a negative review was then go and negative yeah I mean it was lukewarm you know but it did have a lot of negative points in it and I've had a negative Neil Young review take it down as well for you know pretty much for the same stuff you know and I mean you know artists some some labels you know because in labels are the ones that are the most interested I can't you know I'm not saying that the artists were behind this plot or anything like that but with labels anyway you know that's their bottom line you know and they're a you know sort of on the front lines of that stuff when it comes to I've never done the record sales and stuff like that and you know sort of uh whether or not the negative review is up there I mean that could that could bug them you know I mean even if it is a review maybe they'll sleep easier at night if it doesn't exist like insecurities vent I'm a no reviews a review I can say that that has never ever ever happened to get in hip hop but also yeah I think about to you just don't think that way they just they just threatened to fight you and they could tell you if you ever come to light loxahatchee you're dead um do we hide your Q&A yes yes we are we'd like to we'd like to open it up right now for questions and answers you'll ask questions we do Angela oh and he has a mic ok here we go home in blue is your hand if you got a question here comes hello thank you for speaking to us today my question is or just I want your opinion or advice on we live in a time where everyone's a rapper and if you're a good artist you know it's hard to get your music to the forefront because you have to shift through all the crap and I feel like that's the same thing for a writer for an album review sometimes so what advice do you have to to a writer to get through you know everyone's a critic now and all the other album reviews that are to make yourself more credible and people to actually read or watch your videos / album reviews that you're doing I think it's sort of a two-part process I think the first part of it is finding your medium I mean I was doing album reviews that I thought were maybe not as good but at least as honest and as searching through what i thought was good music via writing and via podcast and it wasn't until that i went on youtube that you know i actually started building my audience i mean i don't i consider myself to be you know better talking publicly than i do writing you know I consider myself that more presence in conversation that I do you know sort of typing out on my computer but some people are better writers than me and you know there are people who write album reviews maybe this is sort of a that example because of how unprofessional a sense they are but the guy who does the big Ghostface reviews you know their rights reviews in the faith in the voice of ghostface killah musically goes reviews are hilarious but it's that sort of unique approach to finding whatever your voice is in your album review how you would like to talk to your audience that I think is important in being able to you know have to start that discussion and have an audience that wants to hear that discussion happened with you and just finding that balance between reviewing major records that are relevant and also taking the time to turn music fans readers onto records that you think are worth while they're sort of slipping under the radar and you know the third part of it just to add on to his patients you know nobody's going to blow up overnight doing an album review you know I've been doing the youtube thing since 2009 and it's always only ever been a very gradual upward hike like the bigger the channel has gotten the wider those steps are that I take but it's always just been very you know slow pace right there going back to the front door Salukis well this gets back to the very beginning we were talking about the relevancy of album reviews I saw panel this morning which was about music curation as our streaming websites and such go and they talked about tracks they talked about playlist they never ever talked about anybody even listening to albums anymore at least not on streaming services do you think that's part of the problem with answering the question about whether album reviews are still relevant or not I think as far as an effective tool and people interested in album reviews I honestly when people talk about the downfall of the album in lieu of like playlists and singles and that sort of thing I just have a hard time connecting with that with that argument because I feel like back in the day in the 80s in the 90s in the 70s 60s if they had the option to only listen to the songs that they wanted to they would have taken it you know I mean if people only wanted to listen to the hits they would have and they had avenues to do that too some people would only listen to the radio some people were just buy the 45 you know some people would just buy the record and then just listen to the three four or five songs on it that they like over and over and over and then just skip all the other tracks I mean I feel like album sales while they have dropped over time you know just because album sales were higher back then don't tell us whether or not anybody enjoyed any of those albums right you know there are tons of those albums those cds that people bought and they went directly in the garbage after you know or ended up in landfills or you can find them at your goodwill sitting inside of a you know CD bucket so do i think you know album reviews are less relevant because people are more into playlists and singles and stuff like that I mean I feel like I feel like album reviewers should be conscious of that culture and indulge in it as well by sort of running a blog and stuff like that where they're also endorsing new tracks because you know let's be completely honest there are some others that function better in terms of just singles then they do entire albums you know like house producers and stuff like that or pop music artists you know I mean in terms of you know lady gaga while I think her last record was one of the best she's only really ever as strong as her singles a lot of the time you know and I don't feel I mean it's it's it's just cold hard fact that her latest singles were not as hot as her singles off of the fame monster you know um so you know I I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that things are moving that way but I don't think it's hurting the art of the album necessarily and I still think there's a lot of hardcore music fans who to listen to full albums all the way to go Cano street I was definitely going to say that like that's something that I do consistently like if I get in my car I'm not going to just I don't skip around for an album if I listen to an album and only three-quarters of it are actually good nine times they're ten I just won't listen to the album yeah I want a full project from somebody if all you can do is produce singles and I feel like you're in the wrong business you should be the background writing for somebody shingles and then also I was like in my office like every monday and tuesday we kind of like scan the internet for full album streams and we like to listen to the full album stream like I go to the NPR you they have 33 or 40 records every week and I usually just even if it's something you've never heard of that I will string the full record they're just something to listen to and like I usually played through the whole record so I feel think there's a lot of people doing that too yeah and i think the album is an art form as a concept still has a lot of relevancy i mean for example take kendrick lamar i mean if you rip the singles directly off a good kid maad city you've got a handful the weakest pop rap singles of the year but as an album that album is amazing and I feel like the reason he's as popular as he is is because good kid maad city sounds great as a whole album you know not just because of one track has Drake on it not just because one track has really having trap beat on it not just because one track is being misconstrued as a drinking song you know it's because the whole thing sounds great as a record next question hey don't I'm starting at a music publication this that's launching this spring it's going to focus on the content create music commission and the creative process and I purposely that this topic is very interesting to me because I you know I love the album review i love the track review myself a stuff right for a blog where we the track reviews and concert views but i'm making the the actual decision not to do reviews with my publication so the you know that's that's the statement part of this the question part of this is when i go ahead and launch this thing do you have any as successful bloggers now do you have any any any advice for me starting out um as i do this with that with that model well yeah what the model is more editorial based it's more it's more based on not yet like sorry you're curating more than you are just giving your opinion all the time exactly yeah i mean that's completely fine i mean i have a website that i run in lieu of sort of doing the youtubereviews and the mp3 part of that website is really more of a place for me to just post stuff I like you know and people are interested in that sort of voice too in the music world i mean i think one website that does that consistently is Stereogum you know i mean they don't do formal reviews or records all the time I mean they sort of do these premature evaluation posts where these are that's the closest that doesn't go to something good and they just sort of invite every you know they'll write a little you know few paragraphs we got something that just leaked and then they'll sort of invite everybody else's opinions about it in the comments um you know there are websites that that I mean gorilla vs bear is another example I mean they hardly post anything in terms of an ability that album cover a release date and then a stream of a song I mean there are successor Asian now right I mean they're successful websites that then do that model and there's you know there's different balances that reviews versus curation and so on and so forth I mean there's no wrong way to do it you know we're just sort of saying that that album reviews as a model you know we think will continue into the future yeah so are you said you were you were posting about the creation yeah I'm noticing so that was what I I heard now I want to make sure I heard you correctly so you're you're more so talking about how the music is made the work in progress is actually I'm going to spend my time like for example um what I think is interesting is most of the like like what you guys do is say hey here's a finished piece of work I'm gonna talk about this finished piece of work and you know to me I think that's kind of been well now like been done you know you've got pitchforks you've got all these sites that are reviewing for me I want to dive in to the part where the innovation is happening where the creation is happening and write a little bit longer pieces about fashion right i'm not i'm not talking about shortening and make anything brief I'm actually talking expounding on the portion where their creations happened Josh what they tried yeah just because you must be a musician gives musicians make the absolute worst music critics no no I thought it did it's true but if you're an artist the last thing you want to do is judge somebody else's art so that's what i was saying exactly yeah i just like to really kind of diet into the press play let's get enough question yeah yeah I think one more I think we got time for one more question we have uh let me see we have three minutes yes my name is Sean SEO from Houston Texas um hoping y'all can spread the word starting as a new company social media company let's get a question if we can't I don't ask a question no I was hoping that you could spared word you all yeah come on man let's get a question and it requires understanding here this whole time at three minutes question thank you this is a legitimate question so I I would love to hear a little bit about like how you guys go so for me I used to wait really I used to wait for my mail to come to read like Rolling Stone reviews and to see like what albums are coming out when I was little to see like what I would want to go and buy and then later on you know um it it started to shift and I would still read reviews and I'm still go to shows and then now with the advent of Spotify and now a lot of the way I find new music is either by seeing what friends are listening to all day and like my god well I trust that person's opinion so I'm finding out that i'm curating more of the new music i'm listening to that way and i'm reading less and less reviews so i was wondering how that has affected you guys in your profession or what kinds of things you yourself are now using today said you're reading less reviews but you do watch reviews because i think that's really important to take into a I don't read many reviews at all but I'll be a lot more likely to watch a review simply because I feel like it's more of a dialogue is more of a conversation if somebody's actually talking to me about the album so even though I don't know you if you watch one of my videos it might seem like I'm one of your friends just talking to you about why I get this out of this good does that really make a difference at all no no really I would rather get it from a friend or okay I mean that's that that's completely understandable and I think it depends on what your music tastes are and what you're trying to get out of the music world I mean there are some people who I mean for me personally I mean I have friends on Spotify and I go by as well and Spotify recommends things to me but i find the aggregation to be really predictable in terms of what it thinks i like sometimes the things that it recommends i hate or its recommending me things upon quotients that I would never want it to like her and everyone else pot if I wasn't as a Casey and jojos all my life was really popular when you're a teenager but you're laughing because I thought we have to and then she ended I said why don't you play it and while I didn't get like a dozen good jams out of that song and after that happened my girlfriend knows you know still it's like I want something that's I want to be recommended something that's going to shock my world you know what I mean and to me other people who are passionate about music and are reviewing artists that are underground an obscure typically that's or that sensation comes from you know typically with my friends who don't dig into music as deeply as I do and with these you know aggregators like I said the recommendations tend to be predictable whereas with somebody who's human there's more of a chaos factor you know they can recommend you something that the aggregators haven't even picked up yet Thank You the cell phone and all the hard work the volunteers Thank You South five 
JeyZHwlpJZY,"do you like bad reviews more than good reviews do you like to read bad reviews more than good reviews really why yeah I mean I mean I totally understand that I mean it depends on what the review is of but I totally understand I needed that that desire I mean some of my most viewed videos and Mike's as well our negative reviews and you know one of my hobbies although I have an indulgent in a while is like going on rate your music calm and sifting through negative reviews of my favorite albums because you can set it so that it gives you the negative reviews first but I like reading like the really well-written negative reviews and the other ones that like break my heart if somebody's communicating that meeting of a more artistic or interesting way all right other people hate it too let's see I won't mind reading on the negative review on an album that I actually like because a lot of times it'll make me go back and listen to you like okay so if somebody says I think that this certain album like let's say the last dates not rock album I think the last aesop rock album the production was just not bazooka to I'll go back and be like man you're crazy this production is way better than bazooka cheese the lyrics aren't is good I'll go back and listen even harder to the lyrics so sometimes a negative review helps it makes you listen to things a little bit differently and it might even make you liked the album more I know that's weird or maybe that's just my thinking but it's true I mean the best negative review sometimes of an album that you like is the one that makes like a point that you agree with yeah now and and in regards to the whole negative review thing you know I feel like that I feel like that is another thing that into the future is going to continue to be something that makes album reviews something that people read something that people indulgent because if the be-all end-all of music enjoyment was simply just home and listening to the record then we wouldn't even be at this festival right now we just be sitting in our houses or apartments and then just listening to the hardest that are playing here this week on our iPods or our album you know or on record or whatever but instead we're going out to shows to see them we're appearing at panels where we're talking about them because there's something to be said about you know discussion of the culture that we're participating in that you know benefits the artistic element of you know what we all love about it and if we're talking about the Internet age I think it's very important to factor in negative reviews because ours can no longer judge how how good their music is by record sales because nobody's buying albums they're not really getting honest opinions anymore because I mean how do they know who's liking it or who's not liking it because there's no real numbers to pull from but and that's what I was talking about earlier is why I like to review out even if it's something that I'm lukewarm with I like being able to to tell an artist exactly what it is that I thought about their album and I agree the hundred percent with that quote I rather be very very very partisan to work but very poignant about my dislike of the album because I even though a lot of artists what I admit it's doing them good do the negative reviews gives more weight to your positive reviews and in general I think most like writers or critics who are willing to dish out the harsh reviews I mean well one thing I want to ask you because you know I feel like with you know we need your voice in on this a little more because of you know you're coming at what Mike and I do from a different point of view I mean in in your profession do you still feel like you know you seek out reviews of the artists that you're promoting what are some of the benefits you see or you know I mean you you promote a ton of different artists and some of them get reviewed welts and the don't some of them don't get reviewed it awesome to get reviewed more you know what are some of the benefits or lack thereof that you're seeing pre and post review with a lot of these artists I think even just getting someone to you know give a enough to review a record has become a lot harder and the post Internet age salute everyone I think what I I think about it is that the music press has kind of like morphed into this sort of like CNN 24-hour news cycle and it's not really focused on the long form piece the long form thoughtful review there's still a few publications doing it but so many magazines have gone out of business and some of the really thoughtful ones have gone out of business so you kind of now have you know the release of a new track or a remix or a album announced or a music video that's your best chance to get Pressburg most of my bands who are mostly starting out just starting out getting someone to consider them important enough to actually review the whole record is now the challenge really so like so yeah I mean if I can get you to review one of my bands then I'm like okay score even if you didn't like it that much it's like hey well there's inevitably gonna be like 10 20,000 people viewing this yeah I may be hearing about the band for the first time and you're usually like fair handed I think in your reviews where you if there are some positive elements even if the review is like a six out of ten you'll bring up certain songs you like or whatever it may be you know whatever could comes out of that I I feel like it's you know it's a win for me if you if you review it anything but with the but with the Internet age I mean in your opinion you know with the music world and the internet sort of being you know fully intertwined at least from what I'm seeing right now there are a lot more ways than there used to be to promote a band and you know obviously outlet reviews while they have evolved over the years are still in a sense kind of an old-school medium and we have all these new avenues to do to do music promotion now thanks to the Internet and sort of where do album reviews sit in that hierarchy assuming that have one time they were like the top you know I mean do you feel like there are other things that with the internet age coming in have topped album reviews in terms of you know effective music promotion editorials yeah I mean is you two better now is social media better now is it better to you know get an artist on a panel like this is it better to make sure that they're also kind of relevant showcase at South by Southwest late night concert didn't get late in that TV anime TV you know even so many you can I mean it's tough I've used a number of different PR companies in the past the first thing we ask for is late-night it's expensive I mean it's paid to play I mean I think in some ways though even there are some artists who go on late-night TV and it doesn't really even make a bump for them I mean it also can make somebody's career I mean it's so it just sort of it certainly didn't have you know heard killer Mike when he went on his run or LP when he went on his run or it certainly doesn't hilar when Jimmy you know yeah Jimmy Fallon broke Tyler the Creator yeah I saw the you know the Yonkers video when it had couple hundred thousand views I mean yeah it came out released you on for that work they can work like that and it doesn't always but yeah I mean get the machines behind it yeah I think you kind of have to do all of the above now yeah the thing that's different is that everything you mentioned is important but like a bad review like pitchfork giving you a bad review is a great review because I mean if you remember a couple years ago when they reviewed mayhem Lorenz project gave it a bad review it took off virally form you know he turned that bad review around and you know really got some good traction for it you know yeah there's like a contingent of people online I think who who see bad reviews from pitchfork and think that's somebody I'm gonna support this must be good this must be good or there must be a reason but they could have in a bad or good thinks it piques their curiosity at least enough to check it out and then it even it'll it'll find it audience there are people that openly say that to me as well when I'm reviewing records you know or interacting with people on Twitter you know they'll tell me that they will specifically seek out stuff that I give like a negative review or like a six out of ten and they're like I usually love this stuff and channel gives us six and I hate everything he gives them eight so I don't know like usually maybe if it's in that range it's at a certain level of like accessibility but not to bash in insane you know or something like that to offend anybody but uh to sort of go off what you were saying earlier about doing everything I mean yeah I just think album reviews while still a tool that works have just sort of you know and not necessarily in a bad way just become one of the many tools right now that artists could potentially use to or artists could you know have at their disposal to blow up you know I mean they're artists these days that are being introduced to music audiences via reviews and they're artists today that are getting introduce the viral YouTube videos and via hype machine and you know the other music aggregators and you know some artists throws a song up on soundcloud I mean there's a lot of different ways that whatever art you're trying to create could potentially spread just album reviews is one of the ways that that could potentially happen okay um real quick let's talk about a review that you guys did that had a real positive effect on an artist just just bring up one instance start with you Mike we haven't heard you talk much thank you well the first one that comes to mind is a rapper named logic we reviewed his very first project it was called Young Sinatra and we gave it a really really good review and then we reviewed his second project which was called undeniable and me and one of the guys Ken did not really care for the project and there was this this poll because we had talked to him quite a few times on Twitter he was like oh man thank you so much this review it really did wonders not you guys are the greatest and then when that second project came out it was like he was saying like work work work required like work it's our job to tell the truth we have to be honest about this I didn't want to give him a bag review but I couldn't get on camera and lie and it was because I respected him as an artist I wasn't going to be like yeah man this is great yeah this is an awesome album no I see the potential of you I think you can do better this album was not good when we didn't interview with him he said he that was the first one he came on he was like man look I love the fact that you you said all those things about my mixtape because at the end of the day I agree and he told us that that review that was not positive is what shaped his third album in which he's now signed to a major label yeah he signed to Def Jam now now I'm not gonna be like oh yeah I can fight a Def Jam no I'm but I try to do it I do think that he would be maybe I love you logic I know let's sort of like in a fake voice use that second something like thank you audio out way there they are whatever they'll be fine I'll live logic knows that you know do you maybe yeah but and the other day yeah I do think that we did help him by not getting on there being yes ma'am we didn't get on there and just say yeah we already liked your first project we'd like you as a person so therefore were just gonna say is I was great we were very very very critical of every single aspect that album that we did not like and it turned into a positive situation yes in my in my case I don't know I mean I feel like I get I feel like I could use one of any one of three instances I mean Death Grips ex-military or clippings mid-city or the young fathers tape tape one all the positive reviews that I came out and I come out with many positive reviews a year you know and and there are tons of bands that I endorse every year and I can't predict just because I say hey I love this that people are gonna love it as well I just think in this particular instance people were just really ready for artists like that that I just mentioned to come through with some really experimental hey hop stuff and after I talked about Death Grips ex-military and just sort of had this really odd description of it calling it angry violent hobo rap noise rap and I just think like that I just think that really weird description of the album just got a lot of people to check it out and I mean it was my positive review that got people to check it out but it was obviously be outlandish nosov Death Grips as a concept is around that everything that got people you know addicted to it and made people go crazy for it and sort of intern with me and a bunch of other websites blogging about their stuff kind of created this atmosphere where people that where there was like an interest for experimental hip-hop music like wildly experimental stuff and that sort of where groups like clipping and young fathers came in like like a little over or less than a year later I think actually a little bit after the money story where I got high and then you know I review clippings mid-city loved that record and then you know a handful of months down the line I'm sort of working with a buddy of mine who's booked them at a showcase I was doing down here South by Southwest or sort of an unofficial showcase and then a dude over at Sub Pop is telling me that they're signing them based off of sort of what my opinions were about a record and now they're going to be coming out with a record over there soon and young fathers is the same thing but with anti Khan records you know and actually through my review David Byrne from Talking Heads checked out their music to and put on a podcast that totally pulls my Def Jam's issues he actually writes on his website you know he's like I heard about the song the needle drop or something well that's like or something you could have been me could maybe be very but um you know I mean I've seen positive effects from reviewing hardest but I think there also has to be you know there's definitely I can't deny that there was an atmosphere that was ready for artists like this to kind of echo yes you know whereas there are groups like like I just said I reviewed earlier white sons who as abrasive as they are and as much as I love them for that it's just not a sound that I see you know just like creating a huge ripple you know and I'm sure they're artists that in your opinion as well you love it to death just as much as more popular accessible stuff but you know inside like this is never going this isn't going to go anywhere as much as you know and and and I think that's and I think that's an important aspect for somebody who does music reviews to have I mean you know you you can pick between whether or not something that something is something you love and something you think other people are going to love so on the flip side of that can you talk about a negative review that just went back where you reviewed it and it just went downhill from there bloody give us the details all these people sad all through this they want to know they came I'm not giving names because these people are much larger deny yes there have been a few artists type that I've reviewed and you know and again like I was saying earlier because I love these artists I feel like it's my duty to tell them when they're up because obviously nobody else is doing that I feel like this is an artist that was on my label know that needs to get it I don't want to die um but there have been quite a few times I've had artists call me on the phone and tell me that I'm full of I've had artists who sent me emails and tell me that I'm full of and if they ever see me they will slap thee this is a direct quote they will slap the hair off my head that's a hard slap so um yeah there's been quite a few of reviews that I've done but the thing about it is that didn't stop me from continuing to give bad reviews but it just shows me which artists are actually mature enough to take it because I uh I typically don't get on camera and just be like this artist is terrible I say suck they should never rap again I have done that but those are artists that I really feel like should not be robbed you know si means it I definitely mean it everywhere I say but the artists that I'm critical of there's a big difference between just being critical and being negative the artist and I'm critical of those are the ones I respect those are the ones I want to continue to make music and but I need them to make better they disappoint you they disappoint me if there's they get angry and they threaten to slap hairs all ahead as far as negative stuff I'm never to kind of preface this I agree with the point that daniel said earlier and said that you know in terms of somebody who does PR and i imagine you know it artists themselves as well to even have somebody reviewing your album period is a good thing I mean one of the eye because I can only review so many things a week a month I have to sort of be picky about what I do and do not choose to review and I'm very susceptible to what the people who watch me are asking you to review and are requesting for me to review and I can you know just totally outside of whether or not an artist appealing positive reviews I can tell whether or not someone's buzz is dying based on how many requests I'm getting for everything you know and there's some artists who like first record they came out with like sleigh bells for example you know they came out with treats and when that record dropped like people were just begging me to you know just tell them what I thought about that record and now just with their third record recently coming out I got very little in the way of people ask me for reviews on that record and I don't even believe I ended up doing anything on it you know and and partially that could be because you know people sort of anticipated that I wouldn't like it although that's not necessarily a telltale thing because people love it when I say that I don't like something you know usually if I don't like something there there's way more gear to give me to say something horrible about it but you know to me in a way even if I don't you know enjoy an artist particularly it's kind of like disappointing to me in a sense to sort of see interest in them wane when I know of one time it had been so high "
h09liVNoMFI,good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to our panel did the internet kill the album review I am Brian Lynch I'm the owner of may abide start records which is a indie hip hop label in Washington DC with us today our panels made up we'll start at the end like see town we have Anthony Fontenot and Daniel Gil thank you very much is most everybody here tonight are you guys all artists musicians writers yeah writers bloggers can speak up it's okay just really make music fans just like alright so this how many people have been to South by before raising hands okay so most we have veterans here huh okay so let's go ahead and start so Mike is from Atlanta based YouTube channel dead in hip hop Mike is actually a renegade vegan with a flair for death metal punk rock and hip hop he's always outspoken when comes to his passion for music daniel gills the president founder of forcefield PR a Highland Park boutique based firm with a passion for helping clients promote their music book film and their upcoming tours Anthony Fontenot who was best known by the title the Internet's busiest music nerd is the founder in the Runner of the needle drop a blog site created in 2007 for reviewing music in 2009 Anthony started doing vlogs on the site and the site has grown to over a quarter million subscribers with over 36 million views alright so it's pretty impressive um we're just gonna get into it right now go with the first question what is the real benefit for an artist to have their album reviewed these days I mean I think well I mean the the the premise that at least Mike and I function under is that by doing the album review we're or at least you know positive album review of a record that we enjoy that we're somehow going to be turning someone who used the video who may not have heard of the artist otherwise on and then they go on to listen to the record they go on to love it maybe they go on to dig into that artist back catalogue or anticipate every album that they put out into the future maybe spend money on that artists merchandise or their music and go out to their shows and you know just sort of help create a livelihood for the artists that we want to continue to see art from yeah and the way I look at it is we were discussing this a few minutes ago is the reason I like to review albums is because I want to be able to give my opinion to the artists themselves you know they might play a show random fan might run out they're not gonna give them a party they're not gonna say hey man I'd like to realize album but I felt like you could have done this this this this this better and if you may have made for a better listen you know I always listen to an album and review an album and think to myself if I have this artists ear for 10 minutes open minded what would I like to tell them so it's more so for me too I think is it selfish because it's it I tell them what I like and don't like so he'll continue to give me good music and the most look bad it helped me choose on here anymore I think it's important to consider you know Lord we're talking about the issue of the Internet I think Spotify and the access to just like basically almost every album ever recorded at your fingertips any time is a little overwhelming for some people and for me kind of like you know some you know when I was scarring up in high school at first getting into music was pre-internet so I would actually read reviews and go buy the record not having any idea what I was getting myself into other than that I knew that spin really liked this record or whatever so for me it was always that was kind of how I got into in it and a lot of times the stuff that they were giving like the nine out of ten - it was really turned out to be really good and kind of shaped my taste so now that you have access to hear everything before you buy it or basically you could hear anything ever recorded for free reviews kind of guide you and help you kind of like cut down on the clutter of being having access to everything and narrow your focus a little bit of like what should I actually be listening to yeah I mean I feel like without even and this is sort of the beauty of you know the whole supply and demand dichotomy if they're still demand for something we don't need to wonder why there's demand for all we know is that there's demand for and I think without even thinking about it the purpose that out reviews serve now has changed since the days since you know when Dania was talking about being turned on to records I mean initially it was because I mean back in the day in order to hear a record you had to pay money now listening to a record is free owning the record is what does will cost money but now listening to it is absolutely free so do you think that takes us to our next question do you think that album reviews are going to need to change their delivery of the message in order to stay relevant in the future I mean in a sense I feel like in a way now they're still functioning in the fact that they're not helping people decide whether or not they should buy that record from that band that they're already really familiar with at least not all the time they're helping people like Daniel said sift through or sort of get recommendations out of the hundreds of records that are coming out every once in our thousands in some cases I agree but at the same time I think that um one thing that album reviews do is they keep the music dialogue going you know if you didn't have music reviewers or critics that are out there and constantly talking about music you know look at jazz you know we'll get classical music look at look at any of these other genres that don't get discussed anymore you know how many people in here have like a top five favorite jazz album over the last two years one person you go girl yes do your thing you're cheating no challenge so I'm going back to zero was it Kenny G yeah Kenny G was naughty I'm sorry Joe is really hitting well I mean to answer the question specifically do Algar views need to change their delivery in order to continue to be functional relevant I mean I think they at least should be conscious of the fact that listeners are going into the music world some of them anyway bombarded with all these albums that they could potentially be listening to and some people you know at least when it comes to the more obscure stuff or the stuff that they're not hearing about necessarily might need someone to guide them through that or recommend them something that may not be getting a ton of press or may not be on a label that can provide them a huge advertising budget and just sort of throw it in your face at every corner that you turn you know the artists like that I sort of in my head are the ones that I in my own perfect world I would love to sort of have driving traffic on review sites but unfortunately you know they're not and and you know it's sort of understandable I mean people don't know who they are so they're obviously not going to be searching for them in a in a Google search but I feel like into the future possibly as people realize that well I don't need to necessarily go on a web site to find an opinion about a record that I've already listened to they might instead realize that but I might need someone to tell me what records out of these hundreds I haven't listened to who are actually worth checking out yeah I totally agree with that you know when I was a kid the way I found new new bands and and new artists or whatever was by looking in the back and reading through the credits and seeing who that particular artist thanked you know so I guess that's kind of the same thing for people that might watch us on a regular basis they might want to say well you know what's Fantana listening to now oh he liked this album he gave this album an age I'm gonna go check it out for what does what does might sit down give a good review for this month I'm gonna go check it out just because they said that it's a good album and you know sometimes like not not some people don't even wait to hear my opinion they'll go straight to my last.fm profile and just like see what I'm listening to over there and I'll just go like right and go listen to it right away you know I mean I feel like into the future album reviews or just people who are supposed to be taste makers in general might benefit and they're they're viewers they're writer I mean their viewers their readers their listeners whoever their audience may be might more from just you know them going for more of like an endorsement model I endorsed this artist is my favorite artist of the entire month is my favorite how about a month what's interesting you bring up the word taste maker do you guys consider yourself to taste makers in the way you choose reviews I mean you know I feel like in some regard I have to because even though I do give in to what people ask me to review because I feel that i have a iot instead they are curious about on my opinion is on particular things I mean there are records as well that they're not asking me about that I don't want to say I shove down their throat because I don't I mean some people are legitimately interested in what I think of things that they might not have heard of I mean I just reviewed this crazy noise rock record from this New York band called white sons and I absolutely loved it and I loved their last record as well but I mean you know still even this time around people weren't like hey what do you think into the new white sons are saying like that you know it's like it's completely abrasive ugly record that you know I've just been like dying to hear your opinion on but you know but instead you know I'm just sort of referring them to these artists that um that they're not necessarily hearing about you know in their artists as well like on this one rapper from Wisconsin Milo who through a review I had done of a mixtape that nobody had heard of up until that point you know after he like emailed it to me you know he ended up linking up with a bunch of other underground rappers that he really loved and now he tours with those guys he's about to go over to LA to be with those guys and make music with them all the time you know I consider myself a taste maker and I think it's important to sort of endorse stuff that you know is outside of what people are widely anticipating in order to you know kind of put some shine on something that's that you think is really worthwhile I feel like we be failing if we weren't actually trying to spread music around and tell you guys you know what we think is awesome you know I remember um do I consider myself a taste maker to answer your question I'm not really sure maybe but there have been artists like my one of my all-time favorite rappers brother Ali he posted on Twitter once he said how did you guys find out about my music and there was like three different people that retweeted him back and put Mike C town and he actually broke me and was like man this is why I love you man love you I love the fact that you do what you do brother you know I'm saying if you guys know profile that you get what I'm saying so it might a snicker I don't know but am I am i doing my job to to to spread the music that I love yes I mean it's it's it's really difficult to I mean I feel like you know that if you're gonna be successful at least right now being a reviewer it's kind of difficult to be a tastemaker 100% of the time at least in my head because I think taste-making is kind of a very specific hat that you can wear because I mean when I review the new Kanye record do I feel like I've taste making no you know I mean I feel like I'm reviewing a really popular record that everybody already knows about that my audience is scary so my thoughts are but I mean when I originally started the needle drop I sort of convinced myself that the only way this is going to work is if I only review the most obscure and an artist that I ever found and came across I don't want anything that anybody's ever heard before and you know that's why I like the first year of me doing this was like incredibly fruitless and you know it wasn't until after reviewing more popular stuff and sort of you know forcing myself to because I they're a popular artist that I like but I figure that if I was gonna do this needle drop thing I was only gonna review the obscure stuff and not talk about the popular bands that I like but you know through just interacting with my audience you know because I've always had a personal connection with the people who watch my videos you know and telling them what I do like that is popular you know they come on not to review this record we already know you like the band so you know it just gave in and started reviewing or popular artists and then sort of realized that through reviewing more popular records you know here and there or like at least one a week or one every other week you bring a new audience that you can then turn on to the smaller artists yes you know which I mean at on the surface it may seem counterintuitive reviewing popular artists to get people to check out a smaller artists but I mean these are my experience at workers that works I don't know if this is one of our main questions but we have been talking a little bit earlier about our certain artists now critic proof because of the internet and you know like that can be looked at in two different ways really popular artists like a jay-z or somebody like that clearly is kind of beyond the point of that it doesn't really matter at this point what our viewer says about empathy is going to be jay-z and sell the million records and do his Samsung deals or whatever like so he's kind of at the point I think he's been for a while a point of being critic we've been and there's also smaller artists who have come up in the internet age like Lil B or hurt Tyler on future and things like that who are kind of critic proof because they have their own popularity their fan base on lockdown purely through the internet and came up that way and their fans are so dedicated to them that what a critic says is not going to matter I'm not going to affect the record sales are their concert attendance or anything like that yeah I mean it's I I think we were having this conversation but it sort of dawned on me now that I feel like what we need to define is what critic proof actually means like when the case of jay-z specifically like obviously if Mike C town gives jay-z a negative review like it's not like he lost a couple mil you know like out of the process of that happening but I don't feel like jay-z is bulletproof when it comes to the general consensus of the hip-hop community I mean you know most people after Magna Carta Holy Grail are kind of under the opinion that I mean jay-z's newer records aren't as good as you know his huge classics like blueprint of course you know and and I feel like that's sort of that's that's sort of an opinion that the community has slowly come to over the course of numerous jay-z records since the release of that album but the thing is that's also something that the hip-hop community while it may have that opinion something at least in my experience reviewing numerous genres the hip-hop community openly embraces the idea of just like open debate on what artists are better and what album is better and you know what records right now are actually worthwhile you know because there are a lot of indie pop records and you rock records and even Punk records that I think listeners would much rather just kind of take more individualist stance listen to the record if they enjoy it they enjoy it but you know at least in my experience with hip-hop records it's more about like the open community debate of that album and sort of you know what it means to the genre as a culture yeah but at the same time I I do understand what Daniels saying because it's one of those things where if you do review a jay-z album I do almost feel like he's critic group only because do you say that it's bad it doesn't really make a difference because you know even even the people that agree with you they'll say yeah it's not that good but it's still jay-z yeah it's still jay-z but it's but it's jay-z Anthony it's jay-z I mean I think that's the difference between of being a fan you know and just being like a critical music listener and I feel like there's a point at which some artists get so popular that they mask so many fans and in my opinion a fan is somebody who follows an artist do or die you know and as long as you're in that mindset you continue to be a fan you know some people fall in and out of fandom and that's fine but as long as you're a fan who's gonna follow that artist you know no matter where they go and I'm a fan of some artists you know no matter how much a particular artist may disappoint me and I don't like their new record I'm still looking forward to whatever their next thing is you know and like I said some artists are able to amass so many fans that there's insulated in a sense right they're gonna support them no matter what just out of hope or sort of anticipation that whatever they do next you know will make them happy or just sort of seeing them in the limelight and just knowing that they're there it's still creating you know it makes them happy as well so I mean you know in a sense like can-can critics change that you know the can they can they create change in the sense that they can give an artist less fans I mean I feel like we only have power to do that sort of in the introductory state you know like somebody may or may not check somebody out based upon you are my recommendation they're not going to stop liking them because you know like exactly you know what for example I mean the artist Milo that I you know just mentioned like I loved his first mixtape but I ended up not liking the EP that he followed that up with instantly so there were all these people who I had turned on to him and they turned around on me and really what do you mean you don't like it you know like I turned you on yes and your notes right now I'm just like I don't know if I like this now you know but what I think that also brings up another important point that I we're talking about which is like being honest interviews and having like the ability to to dish out a negative review when it is warranted and I kind of with my quote now I remember up down a quote from one my favorite music critics the critic is Simon Reynolds and he said what I find disconcerting is how many young writers are very reasonable and sane in their approach and overly fair-minded it's not what I want to read at all I'd much rather eat a very fierce denunciation of something even if it was attacking something musically dear to my heart that's a good question do you guys like to read bad reviews

sSkFQT4_oFs,we're live ok cool hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd doing a quick hang out here second full day over here at South by Southwest it's Wednesday Wednesday correct um lots of things going on already even though we're very early in the week to my right I want to introduce producer DJ you know him well I've given glowing a very glowing review to a piece of music and EP that you guys may remember from a few years ago the tonight EP that was on work records had some of the best banners of that year um how are we going to be talking about more recent stuff that has happened lately and you know and ask some questions of ludus as well over the course of this short hang out but thus far I want to talk to lunas just ask him and also go into this myself what have you done thus far what was your first day of South by life was your day been so far were your plans tonight in terms of performances or you've seen so far all that yeah dude I mean even straight up about landing because I just right today right and i just realized i was sent next to a good friend of mine um used to be part of a project called laser sword um low limit his artist and so I haven't seen him in like how many four years or so it was just the craziest feel and I was like looks real familiar I like Landon looking at my oh like what's up so we just caught up and everything else I just knew it's gonna be a good day and after that you know game the wristband and it's always that five when you start stopped by because I feel it's like the way to kick off festival season in a way cuz then a lot of people you've crossed during festivals last you see them again so you get to know them and you know you become friends friends and such so it's been like that kind of a stray on the get-go which is basically has been like the last other years as well and what are you looking forward to tonight in terms of are you seeing any performances are you performing yourself um yeah I want to see some performances definitely because usually i'm only in for maybe a day or or but today i'm going to be here in tomorrow so i'll definitely have timing between a checks and stuff out and besides that I mean performing I keep it moderate you know two shows today to shell tomorrow you want to tell them where you're going to be performing and on top of this Dylan will make sure to put information down in the description box after this is loaded onto my youtube channel where you guys can find the venues and times but tell them you know where you're going to be playing over the course of the week um yeah well tonight I'm playing at the garage for the warp look in the show showcase around 8 45 after that that pretty much i'm going to be chillin i'm going to be going around if I plague a plague 18 and I kind of odd um then tomorrow is going to be pitchfork by day and after pitch board complex yeah and that's pretty much it in between seeing other people show cuz I want to I want to take a time to be inspired by a lot of different acts yeah besides just people might in my journal I like to see performances you know I'm a very performing the kind of guy so I to catch them ideas in this far myself off a debt mm-hmm um you to go quickly into what my yesterday was like I usually catch you guys up on whatever I'm doing in these updates and tomorrow not tomorrow but yesterday I pretty much had a very busy day of walking around and doing various things including the interview that you saw with autumn on Taguchi and BADBADNOTGOOD but immediately after I went over to Mohawks over at ninth they had a huge metal bill like pretty much every awesome metal band that's playing this week was was playing or at least all the laws modes of my band we were playing that bill and I got to see San head I got to see power trip and iron Reagan I got to see kylesa among others but sort of the highlight of the whole night was seeing Indian I reviewed their new record earlier this year you know total frickin heavy ass destructive noise metal album and this the performance I had earplugs in and I was right up against the stage and it was like ear piercing I could barely handle it and then my girlfriend and I are we left part of the way into the set we are out of the venue we're across the street we're down the street and at the cross lock and then we decided to finally then pull out her earplugs and it was louder there than it was inside of the venue with our ear plugs out like it was ear piercing just to be down the road from the venue um it was just sounded like horrifying it's not like a horror movie was coming out of the building like just down the road it was just like freakishly loud very few things i have been in front of her that scary loud and that was one of them and i'll be able to catch you guys up on whatever i'm doing a tonight tomorrow when we do another one of these hangouts um to sort of turn it away from you know what we're doing directly here and just talk quickly about what you're doing music wise um you've recently separated I mean is this totally official and final you separated from HUD Mon you're not doing tonight anymore you know is that like totally final because that seems to be the consensus but a lot of people have come to ya due to the kind of like really weird tweet that went out and you know so it was like tonight over or is it just kind of on hiatus right now no I guess you can call it a hiatus um it's just more we found a night we found that it's a better structure to go back to our own solo work and come back and see what we've done you because that's basically how we started a project in the first place is that our approach in hearing his remix of was a coochie man yeah um and I was like one of the most simplistic pizzas ever made in the US bank so you know out of that idea we want to keep it that way you want to keep it to the core and then someone jumping together at exactly because that's the problem with a lot of people get together with projects I feel like um to stay as like with the other individual to eventually become duo is is a completely different thing much rather keep it as two individuals coming together to create an idea and present it to the people to share okay so I mean you know but coming off tonight though that's easily one of the most high project thats hype hype projects that you've been involved in so anything that you put out solo from here on out there's going to be more eyes on it so I mean is there any kind of a new sound or new level of ambition you're going into with this next solo project that you're going to be working on and yeah you give us a time frame this too when that may be dropping um yeah I mean time frame was ideally in the fall I'd say because in terms of momentum I like to create a good foundation behind the idea so when it's out there's there's there's you know there's i call it like um contents are ya lost my phone um so yeah and so that's what I'm trying to create right now and with that I do a lot of performance like my stage my stage presence is very you know is very particular compared to a traditional DJ Yun sense so with that because I used to do a lot of theater and such and I'm trying to use and expand with these ideas while bridging it towards the music that makes so rather than just making music I make music thinking of how it would look visually and physically you know how it looked like when I'm out there presenting it to the people so that's basically that kind of vibe I've been on to lately and it's been so far you know the album's coming together pretty well and it's really sounding like something you would want Seattle show mm-hmm um I mean I can I could definitely attest to his DJ sets being pretty hyped from what I saw last year what you did at the Ravens uh showcase Death Grips played that and Reggie keep was supposed to be there too and you were pretty nuts i'd say it's actually good portion of time they actually was not he was not even behind the board but just in front of it is yelling down at everyone like hey just like you know throwing his arms up in the air just going completely nuts in front of the DJ very yeah I like to do that yeah so uh outside of sort of focusing on your solo work now and kind of a honing whatever your sound is going to be on your next record are you doing any production for any rappers or any other producers out there collaborating with anyone yeah yeah definitely I mean always always in contact with rockie fresh on the regular and but I didn't speaking speaking to a few different rappers but I like to work in a way because some of our used to just getting beat packs right yeah I I'm not from that scene I've built my whole thing out and Europe and you cane so ourselves really club or into it and very very Beats or antic I've seen so uh what I want to do when I work with people is more of a sit down and talk and see where that person is that right now in their career where I'm not right now really why I feel I custom yeah where can we meet it makes something interesting about you know it's interesting and asks basically how like I would approach the project of tonight we didn't we didn't just make a bunch of these we just SAT we sat on it for a while because I first approached him we didn't do it to like the next two years yeah and then we finally did it because it just seemed right yeah so that's how I like to work with Raptors to come in the studio we sit tomorrow top drink and at some point and that deal will come through maybe a line usually that what will happen so like I like to work that way it's more dynamic and you get better ideas out of that mmm and and into the future with your own solo stuff with tonight too you know because you're sort of taking these breaks in between records to sort of work on your own stuff yeah um do you see the project evolving greatly because I feel like at the time when tonight / she originally came out um it sort of dropped in and to me was a really creative take on what was becoming popular these really electrified trap bangers you know and I mean if a new sound in hip-hop or electronic music sort of gains the popularity of you know these really heavy loud basie bangers you know but something else for places that do you see yourselves just moving in a totally different direction to kind of stay with what some you know popular do you see yourself continuing to put out these really aggressive heart heavy you know bc tracks um I've always liked I've always not been about one thing in the center it's not like I'm trying everything it's more I keep everything within my core element while inspiring myself of you know specific elements of different tolerance right so like say if I listen to do I just love the greatness of the hats with the kick and how it sort of plays together in the timing of it so I inspire myself off of that but I will be all about that you know I mean I just there's there's a lot of things I couldn't relate together as well that's what I like to do sort of connect the dots and then build an idea off and so for sure but I mean by the time I albums out you'll see how different you'll sound but it's you get you don't it's not in a sense like oh he's going this direction now it's more like I see how he is evolving smooth and I see how he's trying to slip it down now because of you know I see the evolution that's basically what it is so I'd rather just much evolve within my ideas rather than creating one idea and the idea being great and then just trying to redo it me do it that's when you just get in the loop end we just go crazy so you're shooting for you're hoping for a release of that I'm later this year duyen would have a label you've worked this out with or yeah yeah definitely hundred percent bunch of ten percent two hundred percent three hundred percent lucky me well which one would that be I mean is it warp because you know look I know to say sorry you'll be the first full-length on looking okay all right right which is crazy mad cuz I'm a freaking fan of looking me okay first of all and to do much first EP in a second EP yeah and now full length and knock first one but it's cool I'm all right I'm down to earth um chill all right I'm going to I'm gonna take just a few of the questions that yeah popping up over here letter people that people are sending my way um this one person is that asking pretty direct question who inspires you as an artist you know can you cite a few producers or artists that you know that you feel have the greatest influence on your stuff um when I in terms of influences I like to look back at older references in terms of like where they came from how their motivation behind of like like a certain piece and what and what not like the one I always I always go back to his mouths Davis and it's because of his idea of simplicity with him jazz he broke down jazz of how busy Gillespie would really play it real quick and miles would be like okay let me just play real cool and just go one note but I know needs something cuz you really thought it out yeah so that revolves everything in terms of what I what I try to execute now when you say cool do you mean that specific error of his career that cool era yeah a graffiti exactly the notes being more sparse and just more about being motive exactly yeah exactly a lot of that and that also influence influences in terms of my lifestyle turns the way I dress and way you know think and try to you know create in general I always try to make it and strip down the most simplest form even if it's something just to understand I try to understand it in the most impressive way as far as much as possible so he'll he's definitely one of the biggest um that I always go back to and uh like in terms of recent artists i inspired by inspire myself off of what they create at that moment not necessarily as the arts itself right yeah so I could like inspire myself offer like what Mike will made few years ago because that I get it it's like it's a raw ass moment it's wrong and so like it I need time i need like something to really build something where I can see it you know that kind of thing like even my david boat i like seeing his character on stage really made me think how much I could push it on stage mmm because I like it's like okay it's laid out like that now you can it's not the weirdest thing nowadays so I want to take advantage of that so I that's basically how inspiring myself and and there's got to be um a aside from just you know music that anybody watching this live stream or I could listen to being an established DJ and producer like yourself there's got to be moments where you're working with other artists and maybe there's a moment of inspiration and collaboration or just seeing what they're doing with a track that doesn't necessarily see the light of day that gives you an idea that you can take elsewhere or you know inspires you in some way you know is there's somebody behind the scenes that you may have seen work or have worked with the that you know you feel you take stuff away from UM in like yeah like recent not recently or you know or or as why me like when I started out um I would listen to everything I've one who would make right he just too because he was to me the UM the Moors he was the simplest way to try and understand a beat in the sense it was still really complicated to even movies what he would try will you will do but just like okay to tap to tap it's like okay at least it's a 12 I can sort of understand because that's when I was starting up to make beats and what i would do is try to recreate the beat but now for myself but more as but research so that's how I sort of started I just started doing a lot of different research and trying to reproduce certain beats and try to imagine how he might have approached it in blue print exactly and it learned within that and then used what I've learned into something new and out I built it up like that to the point where now it's just it's almost in the same way somebody comes on please account and yeah I mean you know you learn playing other people's stuff you know it's just that people don't usually think of beat production in the same way no you know but I mean you could technically old a class like that in the same way that you could a piano class you didn't give somebody exact drum sounds on samples and be like just remake this week that's what I like to do when I'm in the studio with different producers I don't like to go like this is how this is a style ideas don't try this I look at what they do now i'm at global stop there repeat that part for like you know do start on the second bar and just repeat that like four times and send it there and he does it and what you see you did that that's my kind of vibe you know you just did that right that's crazy keep that you know i'm not i like to share yeah kind of thing oh yeah alright um uh there is another question here this person's asking if there's going to be another tonight project anytime soon we did it we did talk about this as soon as he you know works on some solo stuff and puts out a record later this year and HUD mo works on some solo stuff as well i'm assuming they're gonna be reconvening who knows how long it's going to be it's going to be just when they feel like the moments right yeah um and uh you are this person wants to know if you can break dance floors is there a secret here that i don't know are you like are you like a holder for Allah are you a covert breakdancer is somewhat exposing something here is this just like a ridiculous request nah man I used to be deep wood for all that really yeah man I was like competing a but we do not have a cardboard box down the floor sort of spread out unfortunately um but there's like but there's video of this online somewhere right yeah oh yeah definitely actually is my Dylan's gonna put villains gonna fight video y'all might find a video of me where I go like I sit on my own  real like I hate battles cuz it's so stupid I don't know they like you weren't gonna hate me for this but it's so biased that was that guy I was like you know what about I go in the middle style these  zip down be like oh and it  slit into a six-step because nobody's seen I come after as my kind of chick you know like straight up in their faces yeah verify b-boy right next to me all right uh let's let's do another one right over here someone's asking what rappers you would most like to collaborate with dream collaboration um let's see let's see whoa you know what would be cool dream collaborations minute how the no man they might out let's let's open up they could be dead to remember if you could bring her back to yn they go man yeah he would bring big l back from the grave and then collaborate with him yeah well big al bro there's your answer right there um and let's do one more what type of music do you listen to in your spare time you know maybe now that you're not maybe not when you're sort of you know in this producer position or just kind of like looking for inspiration for what you're doing but just kind of you know leisurely yeah listening to listen to whatever you feel like yeah man i got like I'm by like I by classical compilations on iTunes Vangel are you know um actually I love to listen to when the planes landing it's like turbulence of I'll low to listen to skinless um what was that track cuz it starts like life sucks in dirt and die okay it's the though cuz it just  works and it's like like I'm sorry cuz this causal brain there's something is something were to go wrong there and they have been open that would be the last thing he'd here so you know it is really a positive outlook going good going into landing man into like um I need to stuff like ziltoid to men's old toys the crazy too um that beyond that I'll listen to you know usual soul motown stuff anything really catches my eye I hear whatever I here I don't know but anyways all right then we're a end it there and that's cool all right arm again down there in the description box video to see him break dancing and information where you can find or just information on the sets that lunes is going

right I'll see you guys later forever 
s6WkQrRC35c,Super's hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new me goes mixtape no label to me gose is an Atlanta rap outfit they've been active since the late 2000s however it wasn't really until last year that they really started to blow up catch some major attention it was really off of the back of a new single titled Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace a section for such a Versace easily one of the most gimmicky rap songs of 2013 and while I don't really mind dumbed down simplistic trap rap songs like this and Hannah Montana make me feel like there is a subset in hip-hop music right now that is currently in a race to the bottom to see who can write the most effortless lyrics and right now after that single has blown up me ghosts are trying to pull off a one-two punch by putting out this mixtape coming out with some of their most hard in-your-face hype material yet and hoping to actually capitalize and draw out the popularity that they received as of late essentially this mixtape is their attempt to let this new audience of theirs know what they are all about dealing dealing dealing and you know there are different storylines and song concepts occasionally on some of these songs and peppered throughout these tracks to our peaks at the rags to riches story that migos has coming up really from from nothing and then all of a sudden blowing up in hip-hop music being rich being famous although they say numerous times that they would rather be rich than famous and on top of these things there's also constant accusations toward all other rappers out there saying that hey we started new Atlanta we did this whole new southern sound thing first everybody else is copying us there are just a lot of really vague call-outs toward other rappers for stealing their constant triplet flows that get used to that flow if you listen to this mixtape and it is 25 songs long you're gonna hear it a lot and while they seem pretty passionate about this accusation and asserting that they've done this first and they're not getting the respect that they deserve they've collaborated with nearly every major hip hop artist out right now that could potentially be sitting in the middle of the crosshairs of this target that Mego seems to be waving everywhere they worked with Drake they've worked with ASAP ferg they've worked with Chief Keef it did something with Trinidad James as well as French Montana they're kind of whittling down the pool of rappers that they can successfully sneak diss and making all these accusations and all these call-outs of other rappers being unoriginal sound kind of silly whoever these accusations are pointed at they really get annoying since migos don't really put a name to any of it or go into that much detail into it it's just suspect along with the fact that they constantly debate their one-hit-wonder status on these tracks however it doesn't look good for you if you're constantly referencing your only major song that's blown up and you're trying to get people to stop thinking that you're a one-hit wonder I think migos is confused between the significance of starting something and popularizing something because if they've done either of those things it's clearly not the latter and to be completely honest four three guys who might be originators of the sound that we're hearing it doesn't sound all too different from a lot of the other hyped overly simplistic trap rap that you might have caught on to over the past few years still migos do bring some decent songs to the table and they do bring elements to their style that feel kind of unique this thing is easily one of the most energetic mixtapes that you're going to hear all year and on top of it I think migos ad-lib game is the top notch they're all these really odd cartoony jarring shouts in the background behind tons of verses either highlighting a word that was set in a line or actually contextualizing a word or giving the meaning of a word or a piece of slang that was said in the song it's like listening to a really loud rap genius annotation in the background of a song that you like and even though their style may be pretty simple and straightforward and just really blunt I do think there is an immense amount of chemistry between the three dudes in migos takeoff quavo and offset it's so much chemistry I can't really deny it I mean they just bring so much energy to the microphone and just pummel with these very fast triplet flows one dude after another it's really intense it's really high energy I know they're not rapping about the most deep of topics but there's something really visceral to the way that they deliver on their songs combined with the very nutty clickety clackety bass heavy trap beats some of which are produced by Brick Squad affiliates like Zaytoven and there are moments on here where I think that migos are really electrifying in their very direct / simplicity like on tracks such as ounces for example houses houses asses asses whole lot of Alice's or even contraband and among these 25 tracks there are songs where me goes actually managed to stick to a storyline like on the song hot boy where essentially we're getting a tale of a drug dealer who is being extorted by the police or freak No More which probably has one of the most hilarious courses on this entire LP don't try to run game on me I'm not a police station essentially a tract about the stripper who falls in love with one of the migos and essentially wants to give up her freaky life to go away and be whisked off into the sunset on the hood of a really expensive car or something but really no matter how a unintentionally genius some of these songs are there are a lot of spots where just yeah the level of girl peeks through and just gives me a headache sort of like we're making a motion picture Michelangelo I mean it doesn't get much more in bad taste than that and that's how this mixtape is to me it's it's just really extreme highs and extreme lows there are tracks on here that are just infectious in it's heavy just hard-hitting with their delivery and with their base and their songs on here as well that are really enjoyable but yet take a slightly moodier Direction like me go streams that has Meek Mill on it first 48 another song on here that I love theirs is it the song Fight Night it's a track where the beat actually feels like a hip-hop club be from the mid-2000s and then there's birds a song that lyrically I'm not really in love with but I love how just sort of somber the instrumental is on this track it shows that me ghosts can actually deliver with this hard-hitting trap style but round the bases with a number of different emotions and I love the fact they have these weird ad-libs in the back of that song of course the track is about flippin birds you know selling drugs selling coke but on top of it we have these you know you know really weird bird sound effects happening in the background it's just this insane level of ridiculousness that makes this mixtape very entertaining to listen to and it's for this reason that I'm just constantly conflicted because while there are 90 minutes of songs on here there are just like not really 90 minutes of ideas and no matter how much you like this thing it really makes it a near impossibility to sit through this thing in in one listen because to be completely honest migos do get kind of redundant after a while and you know I completely don't blame them for going that route I mean they are on a label right now this is a mixtape that's sort of the direction that things are moving in rappers will seem to sort of put out as much material as they possibly can just to keep people's attention on them but in the process of doing that it sounds like they're just too many tracks on this record that are inadequately fussed over you know that it just doesn't feel like there was a draft or a redraft or anything like that when assembling these songs because while there are many parts on here that I do like there are some horrifying auto-tune choruses or choruses that don't have a single good or interesting sound in them so instead me goes just opt for piling a bunch of really weird okay ad-libs on top of each other so it just sounds like this huge mess of people shouting like on young rich homies and M&Ms and add it up add it up and add it up and it up add it up and it up overall this mixtape is really something I'm sort of split on I think at its best it's high-energy it's catchy it's explosive it's something I want to come back to it's hilarious in its simplicity in its ridiculousness the flows are tight and very on point and at its worst the the songs on this mixtape essentially have me looking at my watch waiting for when their 15 minutes are going to be over there's probably a joke in there somewhere about having an expensive watch I'll let you guys make that I'm feeling a decent strong 5 on this thing transition if you've given this mixtape a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what why'd you hate it huh and what do you think I should review next huh Anthony Fantana me goes no label to forever

guys had out or have been working on starting with Anamanaguchi the set that I saw you guys playing last night I thought was really great you know to hear a lot of the tracks your older tracks like the singles you dropped a few years ago and some of those songs off of endless fantasy that I liked but there were some tracks toward the end of your set that I didn't recognize that had a really strong house influence to them and you know I just thought it was really cool to hear you guys in such other to be heading in such a blatantly you know electronic direction yeah it's funny when we played that track uh it's funny like the guy came up to Luke he was like right when we started he was like you have five minutes left it was like all right cool this is going to be the final impression and it's fun yeah we were just on tour with Dillon Francis and just like playing that track especially to like that crowd was really really really fun just watching them be like I kind of get this and then being like all right I get it it's right but basically I we just wanted to do some like blade blood wave stuff with someone in it's a total secret but we're gonna that was just like the perfect setting and the perfect crowd for that song - given all the deep sets and everything that we're there you know stirring a you know are you gonna be dropping sort of a studio version of that song soon or any new music in the near future yeah we actually uh in the first half that's that we also did a couple of new tracks and we're looking to get pretty much all those out as soon as you can yeah we're just trying to figure out the best way to do that before I mean up until up until now from what I understand you guys have been doing most of your music releasing independently were you planning on changing that for whatever you're doing next um not necessarily and uh in like weird one-off stuff yeah I mean we're definitely interested in in this is I'm really got it talking about um yeah like in this collab that we're doing that might go somewhere else but yeah we're still completely about the idea of putting music online for free stuff like that like the single stuff that we did in 2010 there's something that we're very interested in keeping going as for making new stuff yeah cause like with endless fantasy' that was like 22 songs that we'd written over the course of there's three years and I think that it's a lot more fun to not keep it pent up I think yeah yes all right um with bad bad not good you guys have been releasing some new songs recently as well freaking teasing the hell out of me specifically with this whole BB ng3 thing that's gonna be coming out soon when am I going to hear this goddamn record thanks it's actually all alive it's you know it's us and rush and we're doing this thing a sex is actually okay we're actually involved as everything else disregarding everything else to do this I was saying talking about the like free thing it's like I think that's just the way to do it sometimes because it's so much fun to just release music for free not have to worry about whether people are paying attention to the sales or what's going on and stuff so we're doing the exact opposite and releasing something on our first actual label release May 6 is this is this album gonna have even more original material on it than your previous one so 100 is 100% original except for all the music that we stole all right Thank You Pete yeah that your official sound I know I know where the sound effects are I'm just saying you know for that if you guys didn't know this is a bit of a Google hangout slash interview slash Google Plus tutorial that we're doing right here we're to be doing Thank You DVD tutorial on hangouts throughout the week before we go on to another thing I wanted to say this Saturday I'm actually doing a showcase with terrorize and the people over him pose magazine as well at the crackle noon to 7:00 at 1700 East 6th Street Austin Texas with Arab music the range people under the stairs Hellfire Club Y scene and cynic the pains me and pure at heart weekend Lala's Tony Malina bully Ari why you guys can also thanks to Dylan and find information for that down in the description when this video is finally loaded onto YouTube I'm gonna take a few questions from the audience because people are asking questions yeah thank you thank you hi I'm Pete was that stun you are you still in charge okay thank you thank you this question is for bad bad not good it's our top question right now at the moment someone wants to know what your what your favorite album of all time is ever of all albums of all music to ever be released throughout the history of music composition what do you think is the greatest album of all time probably that's impossible Bill Evans the Village Vanguard or something for me so it's it's so it's not it's not Dark Side of the Moon no let's let's know I'm sure people have this question for Anamanaguchi let's just sort of answer this question reverse and and just do it by show of hands show of hands for whose favorite album is okay computer by Radiohead just show of hands if that's your favorite album of all time raise your hand if not if just keep your hand out there's no okay we have one back there maybe sort of okay time is rocket to Russia by the Ramones if that's your favorite album of all time raise your hand if not then just don't raise your hand at all okay okay thank you all right moving on moving on to the next one favorite record of all time is autumn on taguchi's endless fantasy then raise your hand James loves it she's a huge fan I just can't move my arms right now awesome yeah he's gone straight bass you know alright let's let's ask this question to both bands since I know this is sort of something that has sort of a near and dear to both of your hearts in a sense at least in the internet age what artists or bands musical movements anything sort of inspire you guys in terms of the DIY approach that you've taken you know uh up to this point when it's come to interacting with your fans releasing your music you know making sure the cover art and just sort of the art and the aesthetic and your live show and just everything artistically that goes along with the music you create is is made I'd like to say little be everything about him is the ultimate DIY artist the ultimate internet user live said you know he's a he's an unreal yeah I'm guessing you cheese answers the same little beat I was just saying a little beat but if I had to say anyone else I would mention this guy bent love from Japan who I really love he um like last year or something he announced he was going to make 100 albums and put them all online for free and like you could just post our meeting fire links and like but he has like a thousand since or whatever and all the album's are completely completely different and they all sound really really great but he kind of like he kind of got into that whole like the vapor wave thing kind of was like we like this guy and for good reason he's just absolutely amazing yeah that look he's the man I've had with the other guys have done pretty hefty I'm not sure if they were a comp the band would agree with me but I would say Death Grips for a whole new unit is not a crazy reaction to everything about the industry right now they're gonna be only scary then and that's going about in the most insanely possible Death Grips is pretty much where it's at yeah you know or either of you guys planning on putting any of your genitals on your next album cover yeah let's go say it's tough because you have to decide which and Tiffany because we and vaginas so we have to kind of like oh yeah you guys you guys have I mean you guys I mean bad bad not good has three to choose from essentially and you guys have four which I mean you know makes the yeah I mean you know why not just everybody all together at once you know that's okay well then I mean too many coats you know yeah I got let me ask another question this person is asking not bad not good if you could see yourself doing an album length collaboration with a rapper you know who do you think it might be with or who would you prefer for it to be with and why they may just have to wait and see yeah maybe something's already happy okay alright then maybe something's already happening and nobody wants to and nobody wants to spoil the surprise alright ask you guys really quick before we close out dad that on am on a Gucci sorry that's sorry bad bad not good I'm not interested in what you think about this right now automatic Gucci's okay what are you planning on seeing any sets this week if so who are you looking forward to seeing or what are you what's gonna be yourself I highlight due this week the number one thing that I'm looking forward to you and I think the only thing AIA RSVP to cuz I always get overwhelmed I'm trying to go to the work share case to check out eg Kirk and okay yeah I just I just missed the highway I wanted to see Tony Hawk pro DJ that's before 2008 but he just got his Twitter disabled through SoundCloud disabled Tony Hawk is coming after him and she's 900 block I need to take him out yes nothing music wow I'm actually upset about that as well because the one of the promoters for the SPF 420 show approached me at the airport and asked me if I wanted to come down and see the show and then I ended up coming over here to do this and Tony Hawk pro DJ was actually something that name wise seemed like I couldn't I couldn't miss ya and and before I came over good and before I turn it over to bad bad not good one person's asking Anamanaguchi what anime series is the best I mean you know not not to overstep boundaries and assume that you guys are hugely into anime but I mean I think it's kind of safe at this point to take that to make that guess all I would say initial D yeah what are you into man I really like log horizon right now but just overall guess what Cowboy Bebop why not I know it has a great soundtrack series yoko kanno is like the best using this is also a are you rolling that's also a great show I'll stick with Cowboy Bebop let's do that okay all right is that a band answer is that band answer yeah no no okay no Fisher's official I'm gonna give my dancers a

HdRbrgxxBuU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new real estate LP atlas this is the third full-length LP from new jersey van real estate they started making waves back in 2009 with their debut album that came out on Woods's trekkers in LP that didn't make as big a splash as the beach fossils record that was put out in 2010 but was still a major route when it comes to a lot of that faint reverb heavy soft jangly inoffensive wallpaper pop rock that has been turning so many heads in the indie rock world for the past few years and outside of the beach fossils LP that came out last year there has been much in this new rock sound that has vibed with me plus I think the only reason I loved that record is because it did deviate from the usual very bland formula I feel many of these bands take this help he was a touch more aggressive the guitar tones were a bit meteor and tangible as well as the drums being punchy Beach fossils while they do have music that is pretty hazy and strung out their live performances are a lot more aggressive and I feel that that aggressive magic came through on this LP bands like real estate however are constantly in that chilled relaxed laid-back mind frame and I don't mind soft music but if all of the instrumentation is going to melt together into this blobby uniform colorless haze that emotes nothing then I just have hard time seeing boy I'm really sad that that's what passes right now for feel good and relaxing rock music essentially deprive the listeners of a lyric that sticks out that they can react to or be moved by deprive them of a vocal that might be the slightest bit emotive deprive them of a bold melody deprived them of an infectious groove literally give them nothing to react to give them no reason for any emotion whatsoever to be stirred up in any which way and then it'll have to be relaxing right if bliss is really bony guitars and drums thinned out with reverb delivered with Hale musical performances then give me hell there are a few moments on this LP to stick out to me like the cutesy synthesizer melody on April song a pretty decent instrumental on this thing and the guitar leads that open up the song primitive make for one of the sweetest spots on this entire LP there's not a bad chorus melody on the song - and the song how I might live is pretty droney but it's one of the few tracks on here where the vocals are a little pained a little emotional and the lyrics are actually very intelligible on the song and there's a bit of a folky chord progression to this track - it's an interesting falling in love song but what really holds this track back is the tempo and the execution the band plays this song so slow they play it so daintily that the overall sound of this track is more awkward than it is natural or moving it's like listening to a recital performance you know it's really left-field comparison but you know what exemplifies like a really relaxing sweet on the ears very feel-good pop or rock song to me dancing in the moonlight dancing in the moonlight the King harvest track dancing in the moonlight what a stellar song what an easygoing very nice to listen to intoxicating very chill piece of music and yet the bass line is grooving it's got a melody that's worth remembering it's got a chorus that I can't help but sing along with this does nemenyi that and you know there are some contemporaries that do come to mind when it comes to this particular sound that I do enjoy like I said Beach fossils I dig them and maybe the new Kurt Vile record as well but in terms of the psychedelic quality of that record the length of the songs some of the weird lyrical imagery - I find a lot of ambition on that record with Atlas none overall I didn't like the last two real estate records and I see no reason to like this one either I'm feeling of light too decent three on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why I imagine that many of you probably don't agree with me and if you don't voice your piece you know I'm interested in hearing what you think cool cool Anthony Fantana real estate atlas forever 
1WP-MMO45NY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new white suns record totem these guys are new york rock outfit and this is their third full-length LP i dug on their sophomore album sinew back in 2012 an album that was one of my favorites of that year an LP that I thought was really refreshing in its chaotic approach chaotic approach to noise rock yes noise rock bands from this genre that you may love or remember like Sonic Youth or flipper Boris big black or Jesus Lizard all bands that have far more composure than white Suns and while white Sun songs do have an element of composition to them there's a lot of very visceral guitars and drums that seem pretty planned out and pre-written on this thing lyrics that go from really wild twisted dark poetry to unadulterated anger and there are some pretty ambient interludes where the sounds the noises that run throughout them seem so specific and so treated and so I guess fuss over that they couldn't possibly have just been made up right there in the moment as the band was just playing or performing this record so there's really a mix of the sounds on this album being just so unpredictable in sporadic and very purposeful there's a very structural element to this LP and many of the songs on here have a variety of different parts however the tracks that white Suns pull together on this record are so psychotic and overwhelming that it makes it almost impossible sometimes to even concentrate or make note of these things or even think about things like technical ability or guitar tone well I think has consistently been so impressive with white Sons is how they mix noise and rock music typically a lot of the bands that I enjoy to sit in the genre just sound like rock music or punk rock music with a very strong noise element white Suns blend these two genres together so well that it never really sounds like I'm listening to you just won or just the other I think they're also great a bringing about the emotions I typically expect from and and feel with both honors as well I mean this album to me is it's visceral it's exciting it's aggressive like a great Punk LP and yet it's disorienting and grading like a very good noise album to totem to me is just a clash of raw adrenaline and the most bleak and tortured of human emotions the band is constantly shifting back and forth between these overwhelming noise rock pieces and these very subtle eerie more ambient tracks on the album that really seem to segue these heavier more hard-hitting spots and these softer moments make for some really eerie interludes and I sit there paranoid waiting for the band is going to come back at me swinging with a spiked bat of aah so there definitely is an element of surprise to this record that was there when I was first listening to it and this surprise element is something that I do find a lot of Noise music records rely on that wish to sporadically jar the listener by just introducing them to all these new and wild changes in pace and sounds over a very short period of time however I also felt that many of these songs were sticking with me they had elements that were worth remembering or had kind of a spotlight on them or were presented in a way where the band really wanted to make an emotional impact on the listener with this part of the song the listener has to really gravitate to this part meaning that while disorienting yes white Suns make sure to pack this album with highlights Plus on top of it I think the band's done a really great job of building on the sound set that they had on their last record I'm finding more layers on totem I'm finding more colors overall some really dissonant grading just ah torturous Electronics intense feedback this LP opens up with priests and laboratory killer opener for this thing later another heavy track on here clairvoyant which is one of the most pummeling spots on this entire LP the intro of the song eventually this heavy intro gives way to these noisy wall of sound that seemed so huge and so monstrous that it's actually difficult to think of them being created by the human hand much less regular rock instrumentation it's so noisy it's so layered it's so impenetrable and yet there's sort of an element of warmth to this as well that I feel slightly comforted by eventually this wall of sound dies down I love the over modulated bass rumbles that are kind of coming in and the strong out guitars and then the most amazing vocal on this entire LP pours through my gods face is made of bearers my gods faces like my father's this song to me is is easily one of the most twisted displays of human expression I've ever been an audience to especially as the song just goes into this insane downward spiral of noisy guitars and drums and just repeated shouting of pleading out played it out this album is no hawk in the park there's the Csonka thesis has a really spaced out rhythm sort of primal slow-moving groove this B is stacked with layers of dissonance that are kind of difficult to decipher the origin of and the manic vocals all over this thing are just so passionate to me they just reach down in the in the most fed-up of emotions and then amplify them a thousand times typically that that just raw impossible to ignore emotion is what I like so much about the very shouty generally screamy vocals on white Suns records even though there are more toned-down vocals on this LP just very stone-faced flat lines spoken word and even though if you take the vocals and just separate them out of what you're hearing musically on this record and just analyze them for themselves they don't sound like much I think the music does a great job of just setting the stage for what the vocals do and just complements them so well I mean the vocals sound like hell and the music sounds like hell and it's just hell on hell on hell now these heavier noisier more eventful tracks like I said earlier are segwayed with softer her songs which if you listen to them by themselves they don't really sound like much but they do provide some much-needed breathing room between these very tracks and that's not to say they should immediately go into the background in your mind as soon as they come on because the sounds on a lot of them seems like white Suns really really concentrated on creating some weird strange out-there textures for these interludes and then there's the world of lock 2 which is a track that features an incredibly soft moment paired with a louder more intense finish it actually goes over really well it makes me wish more tracks on here mixed these two worlds together though I do think that you know it works really well in the context of sort of looking at the entire album as a whole overall I got to say I think white Suns really did it again on this record they came through with an even more impressive combination of noise and rock music to the point where with their last album yeah there were moments that felt more noisy there were moments that felt more rocky but here it really feels like they've blurred those lines to the point where I mean it doesn't really sound like either I think the production on this thing is better there's more sounds it's heavier I think the lyrics the poetry the vocal delivery is a lot more stunning and emotionally impactful they really fine-tune their ability to bring together eye widening sonic weirdness with just explosive punk rock energy I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it Anthony Fantana white suns forever 
OJF5NhmcWc8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new rick ross album mastermind William Leonard Roberts ii aka Rick Ross is a Florida based rapper this is his sixth full-length LP the follow-up to his 2012 record God forgives I don't an album that if you remember I didn't really care for however I am still willing to give this latest record of his a try in hopes that his drug kingpin facade actually does something for me this time around common sense common sense I usually turn my ringer off when I do reviews like this but since I'm getting this call right now I might as well answer it let's see where this decision turns the plotline of this episode of the hello don't review the Ross album who are you it's not good you knew that going into it who are you just okay instrumentals - yeah I guess you got a point and the st. Vincent was at least an eighth okay but the Beck review was right on the money right of course see I told you guys I told you hello now I'm here I'm still here um listen I'm gonna go love you sorry force of habit bye hmm so yeah I guess I really shouldn't review this thing huh there's not really much to say at this point is there it's Rick Ross it's not like he's turned a new leaf or anything it's not like his flow doesn't any less sound like a really obese guy trying to jog a 5k his instrumental choices most of the time are pretty hit or miss there are a few decent features on this thing like Kanye has all areas verse Big Sean's verses alright Scarface's is pretty good a lot of the stories laced into these songs are obviously pretty far-fetched I can't stop laughing at this line right here I'm ready for my Skype session one two three four five Oh baby Oh baby truly the only thing that's impressive about Rick Ross is this bank account and if that's the kind of thing that impresses you I mean why don't you just subscribe to the Forbes 500 magazine you know you would certainly learn a lot more than you would listening to a Rick Ross album maybe learn how to actually make a couple million dollars yourself you know just saying I'm feeling a I can't even be bothered to care on this thing transition yeah what did you think of this Rick Ross album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and Skype oh my god the Wi-Fi oh my god one forever 
jjvcAHnwINM,greetings everyone santhu nee grant anno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for this month's y-you know review where I'm going to be talking about briefly the series of albums that I want to review this past month people wanted me to review this past month but I just didn't get a chance to get around to it let's do it this is the fourth LP from this particular indie rock indie pop band and again I'm just finding it as inoffensive and as uninteresting as their last full-length LP I do like some of the more post punky songs from their debut record but between the very uppity drum beats and the bland guitar tones and the very boyish vocals just perfectly linked in harmony and just all these very unmemorable songs there's nothing about this band there's nothing about this record that I want to return to and to be completely honest there's nothing that even broadcasts to me on their past two records that says hey Anthony you know you should check out this band's next album because maybe they're on the cusp of something here but that's that's just not there for me but you never know I did love the past Cage the Elephant record right this is the latest full-length LP from this singer this is the latest full-length LP from this particular singer-songwriter July and it's out now on sacred bones records and it's easily the most gripping album she has come out with since her 2011 self-titled record I know she's had a couple of releases since then however I'm still not finding this album that exciting everything from the vocals to the way that she writes melodies to the tone of the instrumentation in the way this record is recorded just feels way too faint to make any kind of major impact to me even though there are some songs that are a bit bolder toward the middle of this album much of the time when I'm listening to this record I sort of feel like is something else going to happen is something else going to come in on top of this like maybe a vocal that I can sort of make out the words with or is just a little bit stronger in its conviction or emotional delivery the new thou record is just one song after another a massive sludge doom epics which are actually a little bit more melodic than what I'm used to hearing from this band because they throw some really nice guitar leads on top of some of these songs however this record is also easily one of those most demanding so far standing at 1 hour and 15 minutes with some incredibly long tracks on this thing a lot of which I don't find to be all that diverse or gratifying when it comes to the long haul I do think that the band sounds heavy as hell everything about their tone their performances is just ferocious but I personally am finding the entire record to just be a little bit too uniform and sound to be enjoyable throughout the new Alden Penner record here ex unicorns member though I have heard that they may reunite and frontman for the band Clews comes through with a shocking disappointment of a solo record right here shocking songs that are uninteresting lyrically melodically really redundant as well like literally repeating things over and over that really don't need to be repeated or should in fact be built upon pretty bare-bones production wise and sometimes the recording of these songs isn't even that passable Aldens vocals still sound really good and seductive I mean he still got that passionate falsetto that won me over on his previous releases and he is able to come together with a strong mood on a lot of these tracks especially on the opener which instrumentally is incredibly eerie before I realize that the song itself is actually incredibly boring I just don't see how he could have released this and not fleshed out these songs a lot more considering how great the clues record that he worked on was this just feels so unfinished so improper I am actually slightly sorry I didn't get to this record I actually think Phantogram came through with an album that is better than their debut album I think the band's lead singer Sarah Barthel is actually growing as a vocalist I think our singing on this record is much better than on the band's last record and the instrumentals on this thing are great I think they are top-notch or pretty top-notch for what right now qualifies as modern indie tronic synthesizer pop the beats here are very colorful they're very groove heavy I'm not going to say that Phantogram sound is the most bold or unique on the block it's very far from that but if you're crazy over acts like churches for example I think this record could really please you in the heart area this new CEO record right here essentially brings a bit more indie Trinette magic to the table with some very significant Yeasayer an animal collective biting some of the beats on this LP some of the grooves take a bit of an international approach but overall I just found a lot of these songs to just be way too dense and colorful and fruity for a collection of tunes that are incredibly basic and uninteresting I think a lot of these songs are produced very well but once the vocal melody once the lead melody of these songs comes into play that's where this record really falters and exposes itself as being just kind of fluffy some of the softer songs on this album I do think do have a strong element of beauty to them but to me overall this record is just regular very simple pop music parading is something a little more complex or eccentric more dark spacious moody and semi ambient jazz music from these guys on this latest full-length LP piano nights and I could definitely see why people go nuts for this band they definitely do have a certain style a certain sound in jazz music cornered sort of in the same way a very slowly stalking serial killer corners his victim and I appreciate the vibraphone the saxophone the drums the piano just the slow pace of all the instrumentation all the space all the vastness just the pure appreciation for mood and texture on this record however I don't see this album sticking out that significantly in this band's discography and nor were there many parts compositionally that stuck with me or or interested me really it was just the overall vibe of these tracks that I ended up liking and gravitating toward but still I think this approach to jazz music may entertain some a lot more than it did me and I see no reason why this record couldn't possibly be entertaining to a newcomer to this band so if how I described what goes on this record sounds interesting try it out finally crosses comes through with a DB full-length LP if you're not familiar with this outfit chino moreno of Deftones is on this thing singing shaun lopez and scott chuck also take part in the writing and production of this music as well and crosses essentially made a splash in 2011 and 2012 not only because of the people attached to the project but also because the cover art had a lot of people thinking that this was some kind of weird witch house band no one had heard of yet oh yeah which house that was the thing and overall while I'm not really moved or amazed by this LP I think Chino and company came together with a nicely honed sound on this LP that pushes past the EPS that dropped earlier I mean you've got the really great vocal melodies and the vocal harmonies that come through on the team sleep music on late-era def tone records but there's also an element of industrial and electronically tinged rock music as well that I think huge fans of Nine Inch Nails would appreciate [Music] the new Prince PO and Ono collaboration a bit of grimy politically charged conscious hardcore hip-hop on this thing Ono pulls together some pretty solid instrumentals on this thing a few of which are a little eccentric and experimental Prince PO sounding pretty good for a guy who's been in the industry as long as he's been overall I think the record is a little one-dimensional in its tone but if you're looking for a hard-hitting hip-hop record that has a strong opinion on the way the world is functioning today do give this thing a listen and finally the new cynic record over here I think the band's trajectory over the years has been really interesting seeing them go from this death metal outfit with elements of alternative rock and progressive rock to a band that just wholly stuck to a lot of these progressive rock elements and on one of their last EPS that I reviewed sort of sounded a bit like Mars Volta but I do mean that in a complimentary way because I think a lot of the songs on that EP are fantastic but with this new album of theirs I think they falter for a few different reasons in one department the recording the vocals on this LP do not sound flattering they sound weirdly mixed and so do the guitars which are incredibly limp and just really weak throughout the entire album the bass and the drums stand so prominently throughout the entire LP which I don't really mind because the bass and the drums are really my favourite parts of this record they're played fantastically in a lot of the time the bass locks in with the drums syncopating against these really complex fills and rhythms and it's it's actually really fantastic to hear on many of these tracks and here cineq pen songs that melodically and structurally are so accessible in in some ways but still have this really strong element of complexity to the playing in the performance still with that being said I think another thing that sort of lets me down with the cynic record is that this album to me feel completely drained of those metal elements and even those edgier rock elements that they showed off on one of their previous EPS the band really sort of goes for more of a I don't want to say poppier but just a more sweet on the ears easygoing alternative rock style which is fused with these progressive rock sounds and complex performances and even though this album is by no means terrible because of these changes especially in the production department it is pretty underwhelming what did you think of any of these albums let me know down there in the comments if you feel the need to share your emotions and ideas and feelings transition I hope you have a nice day I hope this coming month is better for you then the last month was and I wish you were here I'd give you a hug I would Anthony Fantana records that I didn't review forever 
48jhH1BxEUA,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update where I talk about a series of records that have recently made their way into my record collection like I said before in previous vinyl videos I typically do these raw not a whole lot of editing or anything like that hand right here you can find a playlist of videos previous final collection videos so you could see other things that have made into my collection if you're kind of a record nerd and we sort of talk about the records here and the packaging and all that other stuff to start a record from our sponsor typically for these videos the eclectic music Society on their website you could buy records buy our vinyl related things and yes they pretty much have sponsored a great number of videos of ours recently these vinyl videos and they passed me a copy of the roots Things Fall Apart late nineties album from the roots fantastic record and this particular pressing of the album comes with these really in-depth liner notes that sort of go into describe not only internal elements of the song instrumentally but also sort of things that built up to the creation of the song or maybe things that inspired the song just events that were happening around the creation of the track really interesting excuse me just drank a fruit smoothie interesting information in regards to these tracks double LP really thick heavy pressing that this album has not a gatefold though I do love a gatefold but really beautiful just like shining shining man oh you see a reflection in that yeah this thing really is like a mirror [Music] you're a beautiful very reflective record again thanks to eclectic for passing me this vinyl for for this listen you know if you're into conscious hip-hop if you're into hip-hop that has a sort of a smoother smoother jazz rap sound then you're gonna dig on this I do dig the roots 90s out put quite a bit records like do you want more in this one you know because I have it now was yet to make it into my collection and after listening to it on the turntable I see why it continues to rank is one of the roots best next this this record I've had for a little bit but I actually forgot to put in the previous vinyl video y'all know what this is don't you do you know what this is actually I might do a little bit of a ohon that's let's let's slide it out and then you've any guess you know what it is yeah you know what it is yet yeah wear it it is what you think it is it's a no web deep web from Death Grips and you yeah it's it's it's it is large and in charge on this 12-inch which I mean I guess it takes up half of so whatever it's like it's like as big as my arm in person you're gonna do vinyl pressing is in great condition looks fantastic and actually have not put it on the record player yet I'm yet to do that I've got to do that soon I mean you know there's less pressure because I've heard it so many times already but I've got to hear the vinyl version make sure it sounds good now the lyrics here and everything love this love they're very simple straightforward shut the heck up approach to insert art there you go no love deep web in the flesh you know euphemism to use Fugazi the argument actually the first time I'm owning this record I've pretty much owned every major Fugazi studio album except for this one mostly because I didn't really care for the one that came out before this so I didn't see the pressure to kind of jump into this record but then you know later when I was getting into researching music on the internet and getting recommendations from people and talking to people about Fugazi and how much I loved much of their early stuff you know I was being told this album is in fact amazing and I was giving it a listen and it is a fantastic freaking record it actually makes me reconsider going back and listening to the LP they put out before this to see if I have changed my mind on it or anything like that but listening to this album I could really see how in makai transitioned into a band like the evens digging the insert on this thing sort of like a to panel insert that comes with this record and lyric sheet not a lyric sheet no it is a lyric sheet is a lyric sheet on the inside though I was looking at the liner notes over here on the other side earlier and yeah vinyl pressing looks good black vinyl no crazy colored vinyl in this in this episode unfortunately but still good records here is a record I'm yet to listen to but I will be listening to it this week I will be reviewing it this week or at least talking about it at some point this month the new white Suns record totem except what I have here is a press test pressing of the record I have not put it on to the record player yet but actually really excited to have something like this in my possession so yes the test pressing for the new white Suns album if you're unfamiliar with them I will put a link to their music down in the description noise rock band and you know that's it's plain as hell you know it's a test pressing but hopefully it sounds good and hopefully a you know I like it as much as their last full-length LP here's another album that came out or did come out this year came out a little earlier to sort of pass by me but the vinyl was passed to me by Derek over at impose magazine sort of out of the goodness of his heart the new Big Ups record whose title and sort of eight hours of static I'm sort of confused by the the lettering over here on the front of the record you know I'm like oh is the band's name or DAB ciao no it's not it's Big Ups but anyway giving a listen to this LP which is actually in really great condition I'm impressed more not that the vinyl sounds fantastically better but sort of giving this record a second listen has actually sort of made me reconsider reviewing this and I'm planning on doing it soon because I think the span has a really interesting approach to picking up some elements of like very early like rights of spring emo combined with post-punk and noise rock and some really clever sharp sometimes the Tirico lyrics there's a hilarious song on here where the singer is saying that people are always saying things are getting better but they're still bad things are still bad a really hilarious sentiment and hopefully a record that I continue to enjoy I listen to the first half and I'm hoping that the second half is just as good another classic right here [Music] sorry I I had to do it big black this is a great heavy noise rock record oh man is it good really weird a bit of text here me uh insert and you know it just uh kind of continues on me on the other side with the thank yous and everything like that but anyway um really great collection of tracks from Steve Albanian company heavy production I love the tracks that the instrumentation is more fluid and the riffs are heavier I love the tracks that have the drum machine in the background that's incredibly crushing and there's one of my favorite craft work covers on here they covered us motto on here but in sort of a noisier more insane style the the record is is is a decent condition it's just you know an average pressed record in terms of you notice the thickness and everything like that black but uh but still you know sounds great and I can't wait to get that more of a listen I recently reviewed this band because they came out with a new LP which I loved one of my favorites of the year fuck off get free we pour light on everything the debut LP from Silver Mount Zion orchestra which I mentioned in my review is sort of an era in the band's history where their music is a lot more instrumentally driven a lot more orchestral feeling not as heavy or as rock influenced and I'm lobbying the the the shimmer of this print over here I mean you know of course the project is Godspeed related so it has fantastic you know presentation like most God speed vinyls do you know just has fantastic presentation they really do put a lot into just making sure that the records and the packaging and everything looks fantastic has a really strong character a really strong aesthetic to it can't wait to get intimate with this record and moving on into something a little heavier something I am excited to be announcing my first my very first vinyl from this band a band who I have a few CDs from but this is my first vinyl of theirs BAM master of reality right there in your face so many classic Iommi riffs on this record sweet leaf and was the children of the grave it's such a heavy record for its time such a heavy record you know people ask me all the time hey Anthony you're in the metal you like metal if I want to like metal what do I do what you do is you listen to Black Sabbath listen to Black Sabbath not only are their albums fantastic and they are metal and I think do have a strong element of melody and songwriting and are not so harsh that they don't sort of lose their rock-and-roll edge that they don't lose their Blues influence occasionally especially on their first LP strong blues influence on a lot of those tracks but I think their songs are accessible enough to the point where you know any general rock listener can enjoy them you know and sort of use them as a bit of a gateway drug into later forms of metal and you know even if later forms of metal don't interest you if if you want to get into metal you know this era is great from here move on to something like Iron Maiden or whatever but you know you you could you could spend weeks and weeks and weeks diving into the Sabbath discography because there's so many good records even after Ozzy wasn't with the band anymore so Black Sabbath master of reality the record is in really good condition it's a heavy-ass record Warner Brothers logo right there on their big fat you know classic looking label on the vinyl itself and you know just a really nice heavy cardboard sleeve for this thing which I'm actually not going to fool around with right now because I have to move on and wrap up this video but I do want to mention that there is a nice little very vintage looking posted that came in this thing very nice very nice so many nice things in this video all right finally I haven't I have not put this on the record player yet I picked this up recently and I do know a handful of songs on it but I haven't put on the record player yet this is the one that I have not been it gotten a chance to put on yet Fleetwood Mac self-titled what else is there to say it is a repressing so you know it's not like there's anything totally spectacular or unique about what is going on here but I do like the you know sort of the cream slightly translucent sleeve leaf highs records logo there they've got the vintage label and you have a lyric sheet over here von duffel very straightforward very clean very white just like the record art itself again very nice presentation for this album Fleetwood Mac's stellar from most of the songs that I've heard self-titled record all right and rumours as well which I have heard is actually a record that I do recommend if you have not heard this one or if you want to give a listen to this and then move on from this I'm some really tight vocal harmonies on a lot of songs on this LP really great drumbeats landslide on here as well I mean you know we're talking like seventies pop rock and and you know and that's not necessarily a bad error for pop rock I'm just musing at this point musing thinking of pop rock from the 70s all right y'all I'm gonna head out I had a show that I have a show that I have to go to that I want to go to and I will see you later hater transition records records records vinyl records forever 
d3yC58L2ABQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dearest Anthony first off I would like to say I'm a huge fan of your reviews and you are my favorite youtuber I appreciate how you truly are the busiest and you really do a lot to cover so many bands I like you're welcome and thank you the reason I am writing you is because I am in a very dark place right now my most recent relationship has ended horribly in other words I was left by someone I was very very close to this has been something extremely hard for me to cope with but music is something that has always helped me through struggles in the past so Anthony do you think you could suggest a good album or two with post breakup emotional devastation I would greatly appreciate it heartbroken in Ohio okay dear okay first off I'm really sorry to hear about your relationship ending I hope you're able to get through it it's going to take time for these emotional wounds to heal and then afterwards it's going to take a reassessment of who you are as a person and what you're going to want out of relationships into the future for right now I would say just have faith in the process of self exploration and self to not only find out what you need out of a relationship into the future but also find the strength to carry on and love yourself and in the process of doing this music can be a really big help a lot of people after a breakup they decide to listen to what many categorize as break up albums a lot of which are tagged with that breakup tag because there's either some well documented or inside information that the artists creating the album was going through a breakup of some sort over the course of the writing of the album or the songs on the album or went through a breakup immediately after or during the release or something LP is like Beck's sea change and what I believe is the last Abbott album or even Fleetwood Mac's rumours or Bob Dylan's blood on the tracks even the Marvin Gaye LP here my dear and then again there are people who you know don't really care about whatever the backstory is behind the album they just want that subject matter that break up love loss subject matter to just be up in front and in their face so that they can sympathize they can empathize they can just feel with feel camaraderie with the story that's being told in the music and there are numerous records that do this some of my personal favorites as of late being like PJ Harvey's rid of me or the last Fiona Apple album any number of bright eyes LPS but especially lifted a lot of people prefer Elliott Smiths either or and I'm actually really really partial to mountain goats albums like get lonely as well as Tallahassee or even the of Montreal album a bedside drama which i think is a criminally overlooked breakup album it's sort of like a cute bittersweet vaudevillian concept album about the course of a relationship that sort of doomed from the start beginning and then finally ending but for me personally I don't necessarily need a story there that I relate to or I don't need to know that the artists on the record has been going through a breakup in order to actually have the music helped me through some kind of emotional trial I may be going through I mean I prefer just to listen to sad slow or somber music on this kind of occasion and I mean there are any number of instrumental rock or instrumental electronic instrumental whatever albums that fit this bill experiment with listening to artists like Godspeed or Tim Hecker or other artists that may have vocals but very powerful instrumentals as well like Seguros and why couldn't the sun album be the soundtrack to your post-relationship despair or Joy Division or depressive black metal or the sort of emotional jangling pop music of the Smiths I personally have more of a strong passionate emotional reaction to sounds melodies and chord progressions then I do simply lyrics and I think a lot of people are that same way too I mean how else could you explain the fact that so many misinterpret the song I will always love you as a love song when it is in fact when you read deeper into the lyrics a breakup song so sure the message the backstory can be really important but I think the sound is just as important if not more important for example I could be going through a breakup and you could put on some Taylor Swift who actually has a ton of songs about love on the rocks and breakups but that may not be the sound that I want to hear or will actually bring me comfort and then again there's tons of emo and screamo bands out there that you could listen to that perfectly depict the emotional state of despair but maybe a lot of people don't want some dude whining or screaming in their ear for 30 or 40 minutes at a time just remember that for the most part the sounds everything that you're listening to is very very very open to interpretation I mean there are any number of albums out there that I think could be that shoulder to cry on thank you for writing transition if you care to head down there in the comments on this video and post what you feel is is your favorite breakup album either to listen to now because you're fresh out of a breakup or an album that helped you through that same sort of ordeal in the past cool cool letters breakups breakup albums forever 
UkdU_8VovXY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd february is pretty much over now it's March and that means it's time for some great albums from the past month I'm just gonna go through quickly and talk about some of my favorite releases that I made videos about from the past 28 or so days let's see number one stepbrothers the new stepbrothers LP actually dropped in January but I was a little late to the party however still it's a very good collaborative hip hop album from West Coast rapper evidence and MC and producer The Alchemist they really come together on this album put together some really great instrumentals that are just huge bass heavy clunky too Strunk knocking beats very smooth laid-back sort of chill flows and deliveries it's not an overly aggressive album but there are some really good features on this thing too while some tracks do pale in comparison to others and it's not like the entire LP has a really huge over arching theme or anything like that I do think there are some creative songs on this record some interesting verses and just an overall very enjoyable vibe solid record with a consistently good set of songs next the new artificial brain record labyrinth constellation really trippy an alien and psychotic technical death metal record just shrill crazy guitar leads and chords all over this thing just not only that very busy weirdly grooved out riffs and rhythms and some very low guttural vocals as well this thing is pummeling but it's also very colorful for a technical death metal record as well Colin Marston of behold the arc de puss dysrhythmia as well as Krauss produce the thing and it's incredibly salad very enjoyable the new behemoth record the Satanist is easily one of the most badass crazy ambitious over-the-top rockin catchy black metal records I have heard in a wild do check out my review for that down in the description and big shout out to Matt Farley for writing a really amazing song about people not giving death-metal a fair shake when they should that I placed into this review for this record do watch it if you're interested in such a song and finally the new Sun Kil moon record I think what is for right now my favorite album of the year thus far folk rock Americana singer-songwriter record from guitarist songwriter actor Mark kozilek doing it bolder than he ever has before mark kozilek really goes into this record reflecting on the many years and life experiences he has behind him with his family and with sex and with his time in the industry and being a professional musician while a lot of the tracks here do ramble they are just stunningly personal and revealing I absolutely love to sell piece so many fantastic songs on this album and also before I finish this video I do want to give a shout out to the new st. vincent record I didn't love it but it is very enjoyable I do recommend it if you are looking for some noisy eccentric pop music and the new schoolboy q record as well I dug it more than I thought I was going to a lot of people around seem to be enjoying it while there are some sort of lackluster tracks on this thing and I did up with the track listing on this one and this really is sort of the album cover that I should have used I do think schoolboy q has grown on this record in terms of making songs that have a bigger pop appeal and making tracks that are a little more substantive to and then there's always the gangsta as hell tracks on this album that I enjoy as well before we close out here is a list of essentially my favorite songs and tracks that were released from the past month you can find a link to all if not all many of those tracks down there in the description box as well and that's cool that's cool we're done we are done here what were your favorite songs albums from this past month transition what records are you looking forward to this coming month and oh man South by Southwest coming up in March South by Southwest coming up that's gonna be fun that's gonna be fun okay yeah yeah I love you forever 
BrAgo1Qh4uk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new BEC LP morning phase beck singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer and musical eccentric who came up in the 90s with a pretty diverse sound on hit records such as mellow gold and odelay these albums essentially being mishmash 'as of alternative rock funk hip hop and low phi music as well and Beck's entire discography reflects that very same diversity as well from the really oddball musical experiments and the strange tape recordings on stereo Coleman or - the very freaky funk on the album midnight vultures and then there's the Freak Fulke record one foot in the grave personally my favorite of vex then there's the really odd poppy appeal of his biggest records and then there's the information and yet Oh albums that take the sound of Beck's nineties output but give it a slightly more electronic edge on a lot of the tracks and then there's the very funky singer/songwriter esque toned down and somber sounds that come through on albums like mutations and sea change and with all these shifts and sound and style and mood of course there are some personal low points and high points for me throughout Beck's discography I personally have always been more of a fan of Beck's poppier side of his more eccentric and freaky side not so much the syrupy slow-mo sad songs that make up a majority of a few of his records however this era and Beck's career is a favorite for a lot of people and I get it sometimes songs in that mood are just what you want to hear and on top of it I think Beck's voice is very deep voice lends itself to this kind of songwriting a lot of people do consider records like sea change to be one of his best and the record is definitely his biggest success when it comes to making music in that gloomy er full gear style and now with this newest record of his Beck is revisiting that sound with what I've been told is kind of the companion record to that record and going into this LP part of me is psyched because of course this could be an opportunity for this side of Beck's persona to finally click with me and unfortunately once again that was just not the case while sea change and mutations a lot of the time don't really move me emotionally I do see the appeal in those records and it just wouldn't feel right to me to call those albums bland or uninteresting however those descriptions somehow feel right when it comes to me talking about this morning phase is essentially the equivalent to waking up after a long nights sleep and quickly realizing that absolutely nothing cool is going to happen today that's pretty much the tone the album sets on its forty second introduction which has all these very turgid overinflated string sections kicking off the album that while they do feel really huge and lavish there's absolutely no emotion to be pulled from them at all they may sound pretty in theory but they're a little too reserved to convey much of anything and to me that is many of the songs on this record in a nutshell I think Beck and I think these tracks overall are just a little too concerned with their own sense of bliss to actually pull off anything worth remembering even on one of the lead singles from this LP blue moon which I think is one of the most underwhelming tracks on this LP Beck starts singing I'm so tired of beard and it just comes off so melodramatic just pulling for something that's that's not there this track and many others on here just emotionally gutless and and compositionally when it comes to the melodies as well as the chord progressions and the rhythms the songs on this record feel so incredibly basic and yeah for sure the aesthetic is intentional Beck is not trying to make any kind of sudden loud or shocking moves on this record because it would not be in line with the blissful and very soft and easygoing tone however with its softness with its blissful Ness I don't think this record is that so duck - it's not that intoxicating either so because Becca's trying to keep things simple a lot of the time he does not build on this very basic foundational instrumentation rarely does the instrumentation on this record feel tangible or or meaty because for the most part the inoffensive sounds of reverb and Moaning vocals are pretty much what's on the menu occasionally on these tracks there is a bit of a stylistic shift with some of these songs showing off a bit of a 60s psychedelic pop vibe like on the track blackbird chain and the song wave was one of the few tracks here that actually gripped me because it had this very huge minor tone orchestral string section hanging in the background it was easily one of the darker tracks on this entire record the strings on this track really make this thing a highlight on the entire LP and occasionally there is a drum beat or a guitar part that just feels a shade sharper than usual on the song sort of like on the track say goodbye but because a lot of the instrumentation tries to take such a simple approach what's being played feels kind of cliche because the chord progressions the very basic melodies not that I think they're directly ripping off any one track but because they're so simple in their approach they kind of sound like everything the song turn away which in comparison with the other tracks has just these driving finger pick guitars is actually a bit of a saving grace on this LP and actually gives one of these songs of pulse whereas most of the other songs on this thing are flatlining still I love the eerie lead guitar melodies on this thing the vocal melodies are great as well the tight vocal harmonies are nice to me this track reminds me of like a Fleetwood Mac song or something but with a much darker tone and there's a really detailed melodic progression that sits through two of the verses on this track in the first half it really is a song that I love and the only song that I loved on this entire record but the thing is a lot of Beck's fans and Beck as well obviously feel that there is something to playing songs this speed with this level of sparse and I've been seeing it get rave reviews as well and it's just I don't know either flying over me flying under me it's just not hitting me at all I'm feeling a strong three tool like four on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and where does this album sit in your ranking of your favorite BEC records let me know also are you a banana man I'm a banana man Beck morning phase forever 
XNt0D1xR-wI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dear Anthony recently my mother hid away my collection of vinyls and CDs consisting of explicit hip-hop the artists included my favorites the discographies of Quasimodo and people from Odd Future such as a real sweatshirt and Tyler the Creator being a teenager and living under my parents ceiling she claimed that listening to explicit music can turn me into a violent person and is detrimental to my growth as an adult she even went as far as to look up the artist and brought up how Earl was sent to boarding school and is no role model for me to look up to I am the opposite of violent and music especially odd future serves as a vent to channel anger I honestly don't expect her to understand Tyler's lyrics of rape or violence but I do want her to understand that there's more to hip-hop than meets the or better yet her I I'm not living precariously through the music I just want my collection back coming up on age 17 does explicit music put a ceiling on how many people can enjoy it and the ability that music has to carry its message sincerely Zach dear Zach I'm sincerely sorry to hear that your records have been torn away from you it's something that hasn't personally happened to me but having been a teenager at one time who really loved music I do know how important music can be to somebody at that age when you're 17 years old you're in this awkward phase between childhood and adulthood where you've got all these really strong emotions and maybe views on the world and yourself but the ways in which you can deal with that stress are kind of limited a lot of what you do throughout the day is still sort of controlled to a degree and you can't just go out and do anything you want at any given time and deal with the consequences like any other adult would given that whatever choices you make to deal with your stress do involve consequences so as a teenager for stress relief things like friends and expressing yourself and music become really important and even though there is music out there that teenagers listen to that has explicit language in it that doesn't mean that the music isn't backed with legit feelings sometimes when you're mad swears come out your mouth yeah it's it's okay anger is a normal human emotion and the best way to deal with it is to acknowledge it and look it straight in the face not ignore it or art that features it come on mom but to your question of whether or not explicit music is limiting or sort of puts a ceiling on the artist that we're talking about I mean maybe in a way but it sort of depends on what you feel like constitutes as a ceiling for example Eminem has come out with some of the most vulgar music on the planet and yet he is one of the world's widest selling artists while yeah he hasn't sold as many records as the Beatles or Elton John I think that has more to do with other things than it does simply swear words in his music but I think Eminem selling so many records across the world also disproves another thing that listening to music such as Eminem's or odd futures will turn you into a violent person and stunt your growth as an adult because if this were the case we'd have millions of uncontrollable bloodthirsty raving Psychopaths walking the streets right now if you want to prevent someone from becoming violent then give them healthy loving respectful relationships with friends and family members because without those people are going to have a hard time growing up and adjusting to the world whether they have violent music or not and I think one of the most important things about these relationships that someone can be in is that they're encouraging I think stepping on someone's expressions stepping on someone's tastes especially as a teenager can be really stifling instead I think people should be getting encouraged to say what's on their mind and I think that's it Zak I'm really sorry to hear about your record collection I hope you get it back soon if you really want to turn your mom on to some artists who are in hip-hop music and and are not as explicit or are not as vulgar or nasty there are records there are artists out there that you could show her that I think might turn her eyes around on the genre in general but still you should be allowed to listen to odd future you should be allowed to listen to quasimodo records if you feel like in my opinion and your just on the cusp of 18 and you'll be able to make those decisions for yourself very soon anyway transition have you ever had your music collection torn away from you because the words were too naughty if so how sad did it make you I can I can only imagine that that makes you sad but please tell me down in the comments your reasoning for why explicit music does not turn you into a violent or disturbed person and yeah you know again Zack I hope you get your music collection back really soon dude cool cool Anthony Fantana explicit music forever 
3L85iuDMfFk,bethenny Fantan oh here internets busiest music dirt I have to do this now or else I'm just never ever ever gonna do it or get it done um listen it's like the end of the day around here and I wanted to make this quick video letting you guys know that there is a new song up on the internet from a band named and T backs open pronounce it correctly much less spelling it correctly most of the time I predict that I will be misspelling this band's name many a time in between right now and when their new full-length record comes out on April 15 they came out with an EP a few years ago they're now fine they're now finally following it up with an album the name of this track is the bright white nothing at the end of the tunnel heaven afterlife reference I'm not exactly sure there with the title but this song instrumentally is insane really raw vocals I mean not too animalistic or ferocious I mean not the craziest vocals I've ever heard but I love the bright sort of guitar leads noodled all over this track it reminds me more like an 80s rock tune with the guitar tone there's all these really dissonant very sour weird organs the drums are so ferocious and the way all this instrumentation comes together it's just so pummeling it's really well recorded metal song and well again I do say it's black metal and it does primarily feel influenced by black metal it is definitely taking on sounds from other metal styles and obviously doesn't adhere to the traditional black metal blueprint too closely I mean these guys aren't really avant-garde or anything like that but it's just really muscular and intense and just really a raw insane I hope I'm not hyping it up too much or making it out to be something that it's not but they strung together a seven-minute track here that is multifaceted a lot of different parts to this song and it's just nuts I think it's nuts and I think this new record of theirs is going to be interesting the title sacred white noise is gonna come out on Dark Descent records and I'm really looking forward to talking about this record with you guys let me know down in the comments what you think of this song I will leave a link in the description box to where you can hear the track that I'm talking about and that's it cool cool that intere facts have forever 
qP2hHvB4d_Y,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Saint Vincent record self-titled st. vincent record this self-titled record is the 4th full-length LP from singer-songwriter and guitarist extraordinaire Annie Clark whose music deals heavily in art pop chamber pop indie pop with each new release getting a little more abrasive abstract experimental little noisy not too harsh not too experimental because on some of st. Vincent's best records like actor and strange mercy she maintained her pop appeal I think Annie sort of hit a creative peak on her last LP with a number of songs like cruel and Cheerleader and Northern Lights tracks that bring buzzing bulky and sometimes brittle guitars together with Annie's beautiful voice and some really heavenly effervescent strings and since so thus far I've never really had a reason not to be excited for a new st. vincent record especially with each new album getting a shade weirder and i've been head over heels for nearly every song that is dropped from this LP thus far songs like digital witness and birth and reverse tracks that are lyrically and conceptually clever and instrumentally glitchy textured and groove wise sort of perky jerky the song bertha reverse has all these really jagged punchy guitar riffs that remind me of something sort of like off of one of the first two debo records of but pushed past the edge of insanity and a lot like Devo the music here is most definitely rock but very electronically tinged there are drums on this record that sound live and sound intense but there are moments here where the beats feel sort of looped or stiff or even synthetic maybe a feel that sort of carried over from the recent collaboration saying Benson did with David Byrne there are really prominent synthesizers all over this record and the guitars wild I mean they sound like guitars for the most part they are just cooked down to the point where many of the guitar tones that you just feel like nothing but ultra grimy digital Distortion it's interesting that some of Annie's most animalistic lyrics and vocal deliveries land on such cold rigid instrumentation while there are some songs on here they have great grooves and are really catchy like digital witness I think for the most part st. Vincent tries to intentionally suck the viscera out of rock music and for the most part I think it's a really great success like with the opener here rattlesnake where the drums feel like they're being played through a sewer pipe there's some really rough distorted since sequences that are pretty funky playing throughout the track - and then on top of that there are all these sound effects littered across the song but even in all of this chaos we get a really catchy concise tune that does a great job of setting the tone for the record and to mention digital witness again maybe my favorite track on this entire LP really smart lyrical satire about the internet generations vanity this track has one of the grooviest bass lines and rhythms on the entire LP and it's easily one of the most colorful songs on this thing - even though there are a lot of sounds on here that feel so rough and just manipulated heavily the grimy guitars and scents it really nicely against the horns and Annie's beautiful vocal harmonies the harder and poppier tracks on this record for me impress again and again and again like with the song Huey Newton a song that I wasn't too in love with at first but eventually the the very beautiful unsuspecting intro grew on me and the way that it explodes into one of the heaviest riffs on the entire album in the second half is really gratifying and with the song regret the guitar riff being played throughout this track feels like a Led Zeppelin riffs sort of turned inside out retweet for a noise pop record which I guess it is I love the blissful hook on this track - I think it's a really beautiful contrast from the distorted heavier spots on this track even though I do think st. Vincent is putting out her most experimental record yet here I don't think she loses sight of making sure she balances these harsher moments out with at least some elements of beauty and I also love the song psycho one of my favorite tunes on this record and I love the really repetitive driving krautrock s beat on this thing too I think the only song on this record where Annie really goes overboard a little bit is on bring me your love's which essentially sounds like an alien race of st. Vincent's coming down and violently abducting everyone in a spaceship to take them off into a very faraway galaxy to love them until the end of time oh oh baby you're right that sounds kind of nice but the music itself feels so hellish with it's grimy bass lines and tractor beam synthesiser leads and he manipulates her vocals on this track pretty heavily with uh with a very dissonant chorus vocal hanging in the background and then the rhythm on this track is like a combination between a marching band and an amazonian drum circle and the lyrics on this track maybe some of the most eye widening or gripping on this entire LP in that they are very forceful and subtly kinky part of me feels like this track is just freakish fun other parts of me it sort of leaves a bad taste in my ears either way I think they're really apocalyptic ethereal synthesizers toward the back end of this track really sort of brings this cacophonous instrumentation together really nicely however the Zayn eNOS really takes over on the track every tear disappears which has one of the weirdest instrumentals on this entire LP and along the way in making this mess of a musical backdrop st. Vincent fails to bring a decent tune not only are the farty synthesizers and the really stiff drums not that interesting but hearing st. Vincent's sings so beautifully over this instrumental just feels kind of awkward I guess there are moments on this LP where really harsh rigid cold backdrops of music fit against the very human vocals and create an interesting mix there are other moments on here where I think that's the case for nearly every single ballad - on this LP unfortunately songs like Prince Johnny and I for your love I love the tunes on these tracks and I think st. Vincent does a great job of singing on them as well not to mention that prefer your love is probably one of the more lyrically gripping tracks on this LP too but when Annie is singing on these tracks in search of that theatrical spotlight that's typically there in her songs the instrumentation in the background is just way too stiff to embrace her and lift her up where she belongs the closest I think st. Vincent comes to doing a great ballad with this colder icier style is the closing track on here which despite its very stiff instrumentation is also sort of heavenly and pastel-colored it's very synth heavy like many other songs on here but there are some great vocal harmonies some huge ringing bells in the background and some wonderful plucked arpeggios too and all of these things fill in the gaps that are typically there on some of the more toned-down songs here it's also a song where I find myself sort of curious and wanting to dig into the backstory behind the lyrics on this track too overall I did like this LP I think this record has some of her best songs yet but also easily one of her worst and while I admire st. Vincent greatly for coming together with this really experimental pop and rock record not every experiment in my opinion goes over really well I do prefer actor to this I do really really prefer strange mercy to this which still continues to be my favorite Saint Vincent record but I don't really feel terribly let down by what happened on this LP I did get at least a few of what I think are some of the best songs of the year out of it I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh st. Vincent self-titled forever 
FPsrNDt81aM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new schoolboy q album oxymoron schoolboy q is a West Coast rapper member of the infamous black hippy signed to Top Dawg entertainment one of the bigger rap labels out there right now I hope at this point we don't really need to go into that deep of an introduction and Q really broke out with his last full-length LP Ananda velena habits & contradictions but habits I was sort of on the fence with I didn't find this record to have that much in terms of personality substance but since habits & contradictions I've heard Q progress with many impressive features on projects like control system and the heist watching movies with the sound off rare chandeliers level of ASAP trap Lord and of course how can any of us forget yeah yeah yeah yeah and even though I thought these features were attention-grabbing I wouldn't say it was because schoolboy q is a super technical flashy dude and as far as wordplay goes most of his verses can sort of be taken for face value sometimes he is unashamedly blunt on his song sort of like the really smooth catchy sort of sexy track studio on this LP with a very nice sensual hook from bj the chicago kid q drops a line in the midst of this track were you saying I'm going to be straight into the point with you I'm going to put this dick all up inside of you poetry and even though I think some people will listen to songs like studio and think that they really lack in terms of substance and grit there are songs on here where Q brings exactly that like Hoover Street a song where he's rapping about being young growing up in his grandmother's house we're also living is his drug-addicted thieving and violent uncle Q's lyrics all over this track are incredibly vivid I love the murky bass on this thing and some of the very weird grimy synthesizers on this track to just make the instrumental just the overall vibe of this track sound like L sounds like hell and Schoolboy Q enhances that with his really raspy voice on the hook here anything that really stands out it's that rasp on a lot of tracks here for whatever reason it could be his subject matters on this track it could be the way he's delivering over these songs but he was just sounding way bolder more confident on this LP he is just going in on some of these songs and sometimes when he's really pushing that aggressive envelope these tracks can feel like they're just on the verge of being obnoxious with this really over-the-top energy level but for me it never really pushes past that line there are songs on here that I love like gangsta which kicks this LP off with all these overdubbed yells and screams over very slow moody piano groove I love lows awesome one of the best tracks on here Pharrell produced the beat but the instrumental sounds like Swizz Beatz on meth the song is almost too dense and cacophonous to handle but I love the hand percussion and the beat on this thing the groove is just so infectious and j-rock sounds fantastic on the song too and then there's break the bank a really sweet track with another slow piano arpeggio playing throughout it snappy boom bap B Q just kills all over this track with gritty rhymes being in your face and and sort of exposing how potentially short his rap career could be by being really frank about it and he also brings what I think is one of the better hooks on this entire LP while yeah I think he can rub some people the wrong way with yeah did I do that it uh I think it works really well oddly enough I know that a lot of songs on this LP emphasize delivery over lyrics and substance a little bit and I know not everybody is going to like that but I don't think it was a bad move for him if a more extreme delivery is going to be what makes schoolboy q more memorable then do it because I think he's gone from sort of scatterbrained and forgettable on his last LP to versatile and gutsy on this LP even if he's not an incredibly substantive rapper the way that I see it he's never going to be as conceptual as Kendrick Lamar he's never going to be as heady as absol so just let him hone that thuggish side and if he's going to keep his songs in that gangsta rap genre the least that he could do is approach it with the uncompromising gritty authenticity that it deserves and he does that I really think schoolboy q is coming through the record where a lot of the tracks bring back that vivid vulgarity of 90s gangsta rap but with progressive production and just a more bizarre delivery at times case in point the title track of this thing now I love the harder tracks on this LP they are my favorites without a doubt but there are some songs on here that are a little middle-of-the-road songs like hell of a night and Man of the Year hell the night has an atmospheric trap instrumental which has a driving kick drum on the hook that feels a little Club friendly and while I don't mind cues versus all over this track the hook is pretty much just filler for me lyrically as well as Man of the Year - I actually think it gets kind of redundant by the end of the song when the song is over I feel like I've listened to more hook than verse on this thing I do think cue sounds comfortable on both of the tracks though and I think both of the instrumentals fit really well into the LP especially Man of the Year being the closing track of this entire album and feeling really final having a really blissful tone to it and I say this song is the last song and not  LA or any other track because I'm listening to just the normal 12 song version of this LP and the reason that is is because immediately after man of the year the song quality pretty much goes as far as the non deluxe version of this LP goes I have to say I was pretty happy with what songs actually made it onto the album versus the bonus tracks because the only track here that I think really derails the album a little bit is what they want I love the very nocturnal trap inspired instrumental on this track but the 2 Chainz verse here is just too awful for words but I do like how this track doesn't feel as middle-of-the-road as other songs on here because it is gritty ER and that gritty side the schoolboy q brings does have sort of a somber and and cold and quiet side - like on the song blind threats with Raekwon ray adds a lot toward the and of this track and I think Q does a good job of exploring the more emotional and conflicted side of his persona which he also does on the song prescription a heartbreaking track where he's sort of depicting himself unplugging from his family and from his work because of his addiction to prescription drugs sort of a narrative that we may be familiar with already but still I think it goes over well on this song with a very powerful instrumental also blind threats I have to mention does have a fantastic instrumental to with some really great strings that color the finish of the song very nicely I think it's great that schoolboy Q's delivery and personality is just sort of out there and high enough to the point where he can go toe-to-toe with legends like corrupt and and Raekwon sort of not be totally destroyed on every single track and q sounds great with Kendrick - on the song collard greens a single that I was not hot on initially when I just heard it by itself but in the context of this album I really liked it it's one of the more interesting rap beats I've heard over the past year definitely one of the more progressive sounding songs to ever come out of TDE with it's very pumping non-traditional groove when it comes to at least a hip hop song and I have to give it up to the song the purge to which Tyler the Creator does the hook on this track he does the instrumental on this track another very cold dark gritty moment on this LP that cue sounds fantastic and and really sort of manic on overall even though the sell p is not that conceptual it's not that deep or anything like that though there are some fantastic and very personal moments lay down a few of the tracks here I think the schoolboy q drew together a really solid set of song I'm feeling a strong seven I've been on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what should i review next and shout out to hot new hip-hop calm for featuring this review over on their page you can find a link to that page over in the description box of this video cool cool Anthony Fantana schoolboy q forever 
L8IsRJlOFzU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new / / Sun record terrestrials terrestrials is the new collaborative project from two huge names from the darker side of music drone metal and doom metal titans sun they've been coming out with some of the boldest heaviest and most uncompromising records in this genre since the early 2000s and considering they started out as an earth tribute band I think over time they've really come together with their own unique take on the style of music through records like black 1 monoliths and dimensions and alter and on this record Sun is coming together with over one of the most diverse bands that Norway has to offer whose lineup over the years is just as sporadic as their sound their discography is filled with songs that fit snugly into black metal dark ambient electronic music and trip-hop folk music chamber music dark jazz and after every stylistic turn over has taken over the years they've put out at least one or two records that seems to have been a big hit with the band's fanbase and the metal world at large but my personal favorites from the band's discography are their first three records all of which are black metal classics in my opinion and I guess in 2008 over linked up with Sun in Norway in over studio while son was in the country for a live gig and while getting together so spontaneously to just lay out some sort of improvised pieces sounds really awesome I was kind of apprehensive about this album when I went into it after reading the back story of it because on the one hand if this music was really some of Suns and overs best wouldn't the LP be longer it really only stands at 30 minutes and wouldn't there be more tracks wouldn't they have put this thing out earlier considering it was recorded in 2008 I was sort of afraid that this record wouldn't be anything more than just a fan favourite or collector's item versus a pinnacle in either band's discography but on the other hand the last major collaborative LP that Sun came out with altar with bore this is one of their best albums one of Boris's best albums - so there is reason to believe that putting son together with a group that's just as creative and interesting if not more will just create amazing results no matter how long the record is no matter how many tracks are on it and while I wasn't disappointed in this thing I did end up sort of on the fence with terrestrials on the whole I ended up wanting more length out of this thing I ended up wanting some of the tracks here to just be a little bit more climactic but still I think Sun and overcame together and made something that was sort of unique something that they wouldn't have done separately which is really one of the best things you can hope for when going into a collaboration between two really established artists so if you are even a casual fan of either band here I do think terrestrials is at least worth checking out just for the exploration 'el aspect there are moments on this LP where foundationally and conceptually it feels like a son song but over comes through and lightens up the drones a little bit making the sounds more ethereal harmonious and delicate like on the opener here let there be light this song is not really the massive overpowering wall of sound you typically expect from a son album but I still thought the track had its moments and and really eased me in to the record there are all these high-pitched tones swelling in and out of the mix as well as these tremolo tones and underneath this horns and strings are slowly introducing themselves into the mix and all of the instrumentation just slowly grows and fills in the gaps that they're creating until the song just becomes massive vast all of this sort of becomes a foundation for this wandering fluttering trumpet bring in the song kind of a jazzy flavor and that's fine it's it's not bad it doesn't ruin the track when I think the song really gets a little underwhelming is toward the finish line when drums are introduced and they're so blue body lists there are these heavy guitars playing against them too and you know while I appreciate the idea of coming together with an explosive finish payoff is is really hardly there on the flip side there are moments on this LP where it feels like I'm listening to an over song which son is bringing in some really meaty heavy elements like the closing track on here eternal return probably my favorite track on this entire LP I love the icy vibraphone on this track if that is vibraphone that I'm hearing I'm loving the strings the ethereal guitars this track is just so wide and expansive and panoramic it's like standing on top of the mountain just looking down and out on to everything that just stands before you and below you and the chords on this track just have a really really strong jazz influence to them and the pace that they're played at sort of reminds me of boron doc rah-rah and the transition this track makes from the first half to the second half is stellar string sections pop in and they're skipping very lightly against the tempo that the band is set for the track there's some heavy piano chords some cold synthesizers and Christopher rigs vocals come in sound so smooth yet a little unnerving after hearing this track and hearing this side of the Sun over spectrum eternal return is really the the place that I think this record could have explored further explored for more tracks or at least for more time there is the song western horn on this LP as well which is sort of a meaty middle ground between that over sound and that Sun sound it's not bad but it's not really a stunner either it's heavy but not that heavy it's got a lot of layers of instruments but I wouldn't call this track beautiful or anything like that this is really one of the darker more disturbing tracks on this entire LP the guitars are so grotesque they're all these mangled distorted tones calling out throughout the song - there's some really cold synthesizers there are some really cold keyboards as well and a really odd whistling sound that feels like a mix between the baby from Eraserhead screaming and a teakettle going off and this sound weaves in and out in a really weird way and is most apparent right at the finish of the song I like this LP I thought it was good I didn't think it was amazing it's got its moments I don't feel like it pushes the fringes too hard for either artist or the genres that these songs play in but I still do find terrestrials appealing for the sort of improvisational lightning in a bottle appeal that comes with Sun and over deciding to collaborate so suddenly the production is great it's well-balanced it's colorful the music is big it's Moody it's slow it's monolithic it does what it's got to do I'm feeling a strong six to a late seven on this thing transition if you given this new Sun over collaboration to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should I don't know review next hmm Anthony Fantana son and over terrestrials forever 
BxUup9eAILs,Oh 'banahna hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new temples album Sun structures this is the debut full-length LP from uk-based rock outfit temples I've had a lot of people suggesting this record to me usually tagging it with something like whoa hey dude if you like Tim and Paula then give this record a listen because they're both psychedelic pop and you're gonna like that but the thing is while I do like a lot of tame Impala's songs and I did love their last record there's always been something about their unapologetic in-your-face nostalgia that has always sort of rubbed me the wrong way on their second full-length LP I feel like the van really upped the quality of the songwriting and the melody writing and the production too and it was so good that the blatant 60 psych pop worship wasn't so distracting however in the case of temples at least for me it is incredibly distracting even if the Basie kick drums and the watery guitars and the lavish keys are all executed and mixed really well and just sound gorgeous my biggest issue with the instrumentation on this record lies in the vocals I feel like they give in too easily to the temptation to play the revolver card and they deliver very little in terms of personality as a result if this album were a play I would say that Wow it has incredible production value really top-notch set and costume design everyone and everything looks really good but many of the scenes and the personality traits of the characters and the and the lines that they're speaking seem painfully familiar to productions I've already seen from the zombies and The Flaming Lips and and the Beatles and The Beach Boys all of whom have put out records that are a lot more ambitious larger in scope more exciting and in some cases a lot more raw meanwhile temple's comes through with really huge booming drums and some ultra fuzzy guitars hoping to recreate the same kind of electricity and I don't think it happens especially since many of the tracts on this LP seemed so uniform and sound even if the band does offer a bit of variety on the introduction to these tracks or some of the guitar tones across the LP I feel like temples have sort of neglected to acknowledge a major characteristic of some of the best records in 60s psychedelic pop and rock and that is their spontaneity the band really leaves that characteristic out of the picture and instead plays it pretty straight and pretty bubblegum across the 12 tracks here still I think the band sonic emulation of this style of music is really good they have most of the characteristics down that you would expect from a record in this style and each tune here has a pretty sharp yet slightly derivative melody to it like the tight syncopated guitar riffs and drums on the title track here and there really schmaltzy organ leads and chords on the track the golden throne which really is one of the better Tunes on this entire LP they're really bright and sunny guitar soloing at the start of the song mesmerize is like pure ear candy and I'm pretty impressed with the instrumental the heavy instrumental layering on the track move the season there are a lot of very simple straightforward feel-good psychedelic pop tunes on this record that are very pleasant to the ear but as I listen to the album more and it draws on the more impatient I get waiting for a single novel idea to seep through the guitars the bass lines the drums the vocals and it just doesn't happen and the more I listen to this LP the more apparent it becomes that the group's approach to song structure is pretty unexcited as well I don't know if it's the lack of surprises in these songs or if it's just that the performances on this thing are just so lacks they're just so smooth and unexcited but there's just something about many of these Tunes that by the time I've hit the halfway point the song has lost its flavor a little bit because I kind of know what to expect overall to me this record is just simply put pop with a psychedelic veneer and that's it it has great sound it has great production it has a lot of attention to detail in terms of the aural experience of this record but I feel like temples puts all of their eggs in one basket on this thing and totally neglects the idea of adventure and expansion I think this record is just a little too limited in scope and ideas to be all that exciting or interesting to me I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it temples son structures forever 
be_HVMwiBAM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a lotto from dear and I love your interesting views and thoughts and your ways of articulating them in such a clear concise and entertaining way thank you which is why I'd love to hear your thoughts on this theory Oscar Wilde said everything popular is wrong this seems evident in today's music charts which are constantly taught by the likes of Justin Bieber Miley Cyrus One Direction one only has to browse through some of the cliche mundane and meaningless lyrics of these tracks to conclude that their stuff is really of the highest quality because in order to attract so many downloads it must appeal to the highest number of people touching the middle of the bell curve if you will and the middle of the bell curve means mediocrity or that which is average for example let's say that a person's appreciation for good music and their ability to recognize a track of high quality is determined by the person's intelligence so if the average IQ is 100 then the music that appeals to people of IQs of 130 and above would not statistically and logistically speaking be most popular so is this fair harsh is this the reason such talented musicians struggle to appeal to the majority should musicians dumb down their music in order to go mainstream does this apply to the Beatles Pink Floyd Queen and other respectful and highly popular mediocre average bands or am I not intelligent enough to realize oh boy I'd love to hear your thoughts John Partin Dear John I think you made some valid points in your letter there is definitely some music topping the charts these days that is boring bland and kind of thoughtless but I do think that your letter implies insinuates some things that are not really totally in agreement with first off that popular music is necessarily mediocre I don't think that's the case you do start to question yourself on this theory by citing bands like Queen and Pink Floyd and the Beatles and for me that's proof enough that music that's popular isn't necessarily mediocre or boring or uninteresting but you still seem to be struggle with this so let's go on to list the Flaming Lips The Strokes nas Kanye West Outkast The White Stripes Radiohead Black Sabbath David Bowie Miles Davis Bob Dylan The Clash Pixies Hendrix and The Doors new order the list goes on all of these artists are pretty popular and I don't think anyone would argue that their music is dumbed down I think people tend to look at the music that is coming out today and topping the charts and being like whoa this musics terrible and then they look at the popular music of the past but only in a vacuum because they completely ignore all the terrible stuff that came out back then that people have forgotten about since then I'll sugar sugar boo boo boo boo boo boo oh honey honey yummy yummy yummy I got love in my tummy a Nucky bond over new there are lots of great musical artists that were very popular in every decade that we can cite but also in every decade the charts have been topped with sappy love songs really simple pop songs novelty tunes this is nothing new in the early 1970s the German experimental rock band and kraut rock outfit Faust released their album the Faust tapes an album for the price of a single believe it or not this actually caused the band to sell tens of thousands of copies of this album that they wouldn't have otherwise because the Billboard charts don't tell you if an album is good or creative or artistic all it tells you is that a lot of people bought this and as we all know there's a lot of different ways to get people to buy things all of that being said that doesn't mean that when something is popular that it sucks I do agree though that a vast majority of the music on the charts does have a sort of simpleness to it a certain level of accessibility however that does not mean I agree with your second statement here that links intelligence to the type of music people enjoy I think it's a bit of an unfair assumption since listening to more obscure music doesn't mean you're smart in summation no I don't think that all popular music is mediocre or boring or dumb and just because there is some popular music that is doesn't mean that there should be a stigma against popular music there's plenty of unpopular music that is completely stupid as well transition do you think all popular music is mediocre and if you do why really why and that's it Anthony Fantana popular music forever 
JQbidnJumDs,hi everyone a nanny for to know a year the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new artificial brain record labyrinth constellation this is the debut full-length LP from New York metal outfit artificial brain it is a death metal record really you ill why would you say you when death metal is such a good genre okay it's neck chord in years away one it spool tool it's p3 it's point P you know I could argue with you but instead I'm going to change your mind with the power of music is that a big empty three player no it's the sound of opening your mind in one two four four people are terrible because they won't give death metal music a good fat shake they hear that music is death metal music and they don't even to listen to the music they assume they're gonna hate the death metal music before they have even listened to the death metal music come on people give the death metal music a nice fair shake be a good person to the death metal music you might like it so it's not a big empty three player I hate count your chesta so yeah death metal just like the song set doesn't always get a fair shake and with the genres really heavy use of distortion and really gruff guttural gruesome vocals blast beats I can sort of understand why most people shy away from it I personally am not really even a huge fan of every single sub-genre that this style of music has to offer I'm not huge on a lot of the more progressive and more technical stuff that comes out of death metal usually I'm not moved by those sounds I like my death metal a little more bloody and visceral but artificial brains new record here labyrinth constellation does sort of seem to sit further on that more technical side of the spectrum in case you didn't know this record actually features revocation guitarist Dan garrigue yellow but me personally I was most excited to hear that recording and production was handled on this record by Colin Marston multi-instrumentalist songwriter and member of bands like gore guts ball the arcticus dysrhythmia Crowell Asst and he typically doesn't record or write with a band unless they're doing something pretty forward-thinking and I do think artificial brain lives up to that expectation they do have a lot of the foundational qualities of death metal but they push many of them to an extreme or they experiment with them in some kind of significant way for one the really angular and difficult guitar riffs on this record tied together into a web from which there is no escape and these riffs lock in perfectly with some really intense and busy drum patterns artificial brain always seems to be looking for that next get changed they can make to the song and yet all the tracks here feel really fluid and cohesive it's not like they're so herky and jerky that you're hearing all these miscellaneous parts that don't really sound like they have anything to do with one another so I wouldn't say that this record is too jarring and yet it's not like all of these flashy technical guitars and drums sounds so uniform that everything here blends together into this formless flavorless soup of guitar and drum noise I think what really makes this record special is the really shrill and bright and strange guitar chords play throughout this thing they're really mutant melodies played on the leads they're weird but oddly catchy as well there are moments where the melodies on this LP feel pretty authentic like the title track on this LP and the closer moon funeral and sometimes these guitar leads build up to an explosion of melody that is sometimes eerie or even triumphant I like that artificial brain really appreciates contrast on this record they're always putting moments that are really chaotic and nasty and disgusting and just really difficult to pull apart up against spots that are a little bit more accessible and again melodic and often these more melodic guitars are layered on top of one another like a very noisy ear tickling pig pile in the same way that they would be multi tracked on like a Krauss record and even though I do see common ground between artificial brain and bands like Crowley's I think what happens on this LP is much more violent and sort of unpredictable and on top of being compositionally adventurous I think that some of the songs on this LP are sonically adventurous - there's a good handful of tracks on this LP that features some kind of sound experimentation and whether or not it's a big experiment or a small one it does add something significant to the song like the song absorbing black ignition which i think is my favorite track on here has a very eerie set of organ chords at the finish line or the track Frozen Planet which has all these strange icy tones hanging in the background backing up the guitars and the drums and the bass there's some chilling tones hanging in the background of the song hormones go as well which makes the song not only feel like a death metal track but like a sci-fi soundtrack feature as well and the song bastard planet right in the middle point of the song there is this giant explosion of drums and bass that's incredibly heavy really a highlight for me on the record this moment in the song is so dense and so saturated it's hard to tell one instrument from another with just out condensed it is throughout this whole LP the vocals consistently push the envelope of low guttural and kind of gross and overall the recording on this thing I'm really happy with it really impressed with it I like that it's so clear it's punchy the performances the execution on this thing is great the drums sound fantastic of the guitars sound fantastic it's also honed and together the music here reaches such a high level of virtuosity without shooting for a recording that sounds overproduced really quantized or digital the instrumentation on this record just feels so organic and in the moment and add it on top of all these really good sounds it's great recording these interesting and well written death metal tracks there is kind of a theme behind this album between the song titles and some of the more experimental sounds I mean there's a bit of a science fiction thing going on here with planets and moons and constellations in that regard there are elements of this LP that remind me a bit of vector if you're into a metal band with more of an intergalactic sound then check this LP out because I do think that like vector this record does have melodies that feel kind of from another world entirely as far as shortcomings at this LP has I do think that this thing is a little one-sided in terms of intensity and chaos a lot of the songs on here tend to just sort of bust in when they start I wish that the band showed a little bit more finesse in that regard and there are moments on here toward the first half of the album like worm harvester and frozen planets that blend together a little bit still I think the playing and the writing on this LP is great I think that this record is really creative take on the technical death metal style there's a lot of power and dexterity and Enter to the playing on this record and what's most exciting is some of the sonic experimentation that these guys bring to the table I would love to hear them keep up this technical edge into the future but maybe dive even deeper into some of these sound experiments I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next also shout out to Matthew loft for the death metal song you're the best anthony Fantana artificial brain forever 
ZTIJvNmsQgo,hi everyone agony sad tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for us to get together relax and partake in a review of the new Sun Kil moon record Benji Sun Kil moon is the long-running singer/songwriter project of guitarist actor and lyricist Marc cosmic too many fans of underground music and indie rock and slow Court he is most famously known for his part in the band red house painters Andy has a pretty sizable catalog of albums under his own name along with a few collaborative LPS as well the guys had a really steady output since he was originally signed to a record label in the early 90s a little fun fact that I know because he sings about it on this record among many other things Marcus had a very long career of writing songs some of which are very long detail-oriented and kind of wordy and this is a role he's grown more and more comfortable with as he's released more material under the Sun Kil moon name and now he's at a point where it seems like if he writes a song about two lovers fighting that he would spend at least a verse or two telling you what time of day it is what the weather is their cat's name he would list out at least three movies from their DVD collection he's put out songs recently as well that seemed to be just unashamedly meta and singing about his mindset when writing songs are sort of the songwriting process or the lifestyle it has put him in or he throws out these personal stories that seem almost completely unedited in terms of information there isn't anything that mark is afraid to put into these tracks in terms of wow this is too personal oh this might be embarrassing there are tracks on this guy's last LP like among the leaves such as track 8 which is actually not track 8 on the songs track list but it is still a song about his life as a singer-songwriter the business the process he touches down on some of these same themes as well on the track UK blues where he is singing about just not having a good time while touring internationally being heckled having difficult performances being homesick among the leaves was a really in interesting record for mark because of how deep it sort of let you into just about every thought in his mind but it was a less direct album when compared with other red house painter records and Sun Kil moon records as well also marks vocal style on this LP felt really tired Haggard kind of aged but this album also had a really uniquely intimate charm to it as well the songs on this LP meander and Mark's thoughts wander and I think that makes these songs lose a little bit of impact however with this new LP from Sun Kil moon Benjie this LP is like a more gratifying take on this incredibly long-winded songwriting style every song on this LP seems so off-the-cuff and yet all the tracks feel so purposefully fantastic it's almost as if this LP is the result of Mark writing hundreds upon hundreds of very wordy rambling songs just like these and then whittling all of them down to just the best ones I think Benji is so good that it could potentially become one of those gateway drug albums into the rest of Mark's discography in which there are a lot of great records but you know every great artist every once in a while will put out one record that sort of seems to stand tall as a pinnacle and sort of grabs them a whole new fan base I think Benji has tons of charm and tons of appeal even if on the surface it seems like mark is only doing half of the job of what we expect from a singer-songwriter and what we expect is for a singer-songwriter to go through a significant emotional experience and then report back with the most interesting bits and then condense them down into a metaphor that we can relate to comforting us as we move through this journey called life where we have no idea what we're doing instead of this Mark gives us an incredibly comprehensive account of something that may have happened to him or another event of some sort leaving in pieces that may not necessarily be all that interesting or purposeful and then asking the audience to draw some kind of message or metaphor or meaning from it like on the closing track here Ben's my friend where Mark seems to be singing about just having an average day eating out with his girlfriend ordering crab cakes he goes to see the Postal Service play live he's kind of in the midst of this middle-aged funk and I think the song dogs is worth mentioning off of this LP - which seems like a list of every significant sexual experience that Mark had growing up keep in mind much of the time mark is singing these songs with a vocal delivery that only seems a shade or two away from spoken word and all of Mark's words are backed up with very warm classical guitars that nice nylon string sound and very gentle folk rock instrumentation background vocals upright bass drums all feels really tender and sort of rickety and organic and I think overall this LP is really well put together instrumentally there are a lot of parts here musically that that hit me that move me like the dreary vocal harmonies on the track Carissa the Erie harmonized guitar leads at the end of the song Newtown the the booming drums that pop in on the second half of the song dogs the electric piano on the song Jim wise has a really nice slow patient pace to it that sets the tone for the song perfectly the sax on bends my friend stellar and the layers of fluttering guitars that create this beautiful interlude on the end of the song the song remains the same all this instrumentation is a fantastic foundation for the stories on this record which essentially are what captivated me the most they're all heartbreaking they're all thoughtful and and relatable - when given some contemplation like on the track Carissa where he is singing about the sudden death of his second cousin and even though he has very few and faint memories of her he still feels compelled to write a song for her and create some kind of tribute in memory of her and he's singing about her kids and how she died and how his family is grieving oddly enough she passed away in roughly the same way that marks uncle did as well an exploding aerosol can in the trash a story he tells a little deeper into this album on the track truck driver mark tributes his parents beautifully on this record as well with two separate tracks I can't live without my mother's love and I my dad the song about his mother saying he needs her love there he needs her friendship her companionship he defends her and he dreads the day that she's going to pass away and on the track about his father Mark's angle changes a little bit to something more nostalgic where he's singing about all of these life lessons and experiences he had with his dad it's more of a musical portrait of his father and mark's past with his father versus what he gets from his dad right now and all this reminiscing over the past seems really great but these tracks really seem to make sense with the theme of the album and what mark's mindset is when these songs are sort of backed up against tracks like ben's my friend and richard Vermeer's died today of natural causes songs that are mired in a slew of fleeting thoughts and personal musings but are really reflections on one's own mortality via aches and pains and fatigue and sudden death and the song bends my friend in a way is sort of about being in that funk created and caused by all of those things and pushing past it being competitive even the satellite stories on this LP that don't directly play into these themes are fantastic like the song Jim wise which is essentially about a friend of marks fathers who mercy killed his wife and now is sort of under house arrest and will most likely be in jail very soon due to the choice that he made and mark describes Jim wise from beard to ankle bracelet and the song Micah lean is a beautiful little track about three different people in Mark's life over the course of different ages who were only wanting to live like anyone else but for whatever reason they sort of incurred serious misfortune Micah lean herself being disabled mentally one of mark's friends dying suddenly a bit open mark's grandmother being diagnosed with cancer nothing not to make this entire LP just seem like this really depressing terrible awful melancholy thing i mean you know there's definitely sadness on this LP there's definitely moments on here where no matter how old you are you're going to be facing your mortality a little bit on this LP not everyone gets a fair chance in life or a fair shot some people's opportunities are sort of cut short unfortunately but there's something sort of comforting about mark tearing open this middle-aged man thoughts closet and just ripping out all the skeletons he's just getting a lot of things that people actually think and feel and experience out there in the open and again it all feels so relatable and it all feels so real despite mark being so specific with these stories that he's the only person a really experienced or you know saw heard any of it firsthand we're only sort of experiencing it through his lyrics but still oddly enough with a really low-key instrumentation and Mark's rambling very wordy lyrics on this record this LP is one of the easiest hours of music I've ever sat through not a moment did I feel like wow I really want this to be over there there are a few moments on this LP where I wish the vocals were a little bit more intelligible I do wish overall that the instrumentation was a bit more varied that the end of the closing track on here was a bit more final and I do think the song remains the same like the movie itself is just a tad long-winded but still I thought this was a fantastic record and will no doubt be one of my favorites of the year I'm feeling a decent a strong 9 on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Sun Kil moon forever 
36W_fuo6k4s,hi everyone Tran theny Durango here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new angel Olsen LP burn your fire for no witness this is the latest full of LP from Missouri bass singer-songwriter angel Olsen her big jag Jaguar records debut a label I'm sure that she is at home with considering Jag Jaguars long-standing appreciation and love of folk music folk rock all country and I'm not surprised that angel is at the level of attention that she's at currently considering her last full length LP halfway home and incredibly charming record there's some pretty unique and personal song topics on this record of course angels fantastic voice which I think has a lot of very beautiful twang to it when she's reaching up into her higher register she's got a lot of range I think her delivery is very emotive it's very tender it can be powerful and gripping as well some of the tracks on this LP like the waiting are incredibly catchy fantastic songs and I was hoping to be blown away by a record that was even more straightforward and hard-hitting with this latest LP of hers and it felt like I was going to get that when songs initially started to creep out from this thing like forgive and forgotten which has a bit of a driving garage rock vibe to it it's got a lot of momentum it's got a lot of volume tracks like this or some of Angel's loudest and most aggressive songs yet but I don't really think this track and some others on here have the same level of charm as some of angels earlier stuff what happens on this song to me sounds a little too aligned with the dozens and dozens of vocally suffocated garage pop songs that are sort of floating around the internet these days I think burn your fire packs more punch but occasionally drowns out what I think made angels and so interesting in the first place like on the song high end wild which has all this pretty loud but very lacks and loose rock instrumentation playing and angels vocals are great but they hardly feel like the focal point of the song and because of that I'm having a slightly hard time connecting with this track and others on here emotionally plus of all the louder tracks on this LP the song high-five is really the only one here that maintains that rootsy country-influenced sound that angel Olson Road to get to the point where she is now I'm not advocating the angels and needs to stay in the same stylistic Lane throughout her entire career or just come out with another country style the record just to please me but I don't feel what has been offered on this record instead is as interesting or more interesting for example the song stars whose guitars and drum beat feel more fitting for a grizzly bear tune I think or the song lights out which has kind of a classic rock vibe to the way the guitars and the pianos are played especially at the end where the guitars are soloing the playing is tight but I think the instrumentation itself is a little tired and kind of flavorless so the songs on this LP instrumentally are either overloaded and off the mark in terms of the style of music that they're playing or they're so skeletal and stripped back that they hardly make an impression on me like the opening track on here and the song white fire the longest track on this LP standing at 6 minutes and the only thing that really grips me about this song are the somewhat surreal lyrics and the ritualistic mind-numbing pace of angels guitar strumming and singing it would be a great slow burner if there were just more parts to it kind of like the song which is a song that has a great vocal melody really sweeps me off my feet at the beginning but then it doesn't build on what it started toward the finish musically and compositionally I think tracks like this are just a little too safe and uneventful ptoo because I don't think this album and strong for me the title burn your fire for no witness is a little misleading because I don't feel like this album is this intense lonesome unsuspecting exorcism of emotions instead I think quite a few tracks on this LP production-wise anyway kind of pander to some really uninteresting underground rock trends going on right now and when this record isn't doing that I think it's dousing what little fire has in ice water unfortunately on this LP I felt like there were a lot of songs that were painfully unmemorable and they were delivered with singing that feels nowhere near as passionate as what angel has done in the past which is unfortunate because her last LP had me feeling like her voice was her most unique and interesting characteristic I'm feeling a strong 5 to L a 6 on this LP transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana angel Olson forever 
nzO5rysgAQs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Shu album Angel guts red classroom it has not been a very long time so we've last heard from long-running art rock experimental rock indie pop in the experimental pop weirdness music outfit Shu Shu toward the end of last year they put out a full-length LP of Nina Simone covers titled Nina which I highly recommend for its raw instrumentation unorthodox approach and very eerie vibe the band just dropped their 9th full-length album right here angel guts red classroom and on this record they go back to their roots a little bit once again making very noisy somewhat tortured post-punk music doing a bit of a 180 on the glitchy and 8-bit sounds that have appeared on their past few albums but this new record from Shu Shu is more than just a rehash of the past it is easily one of the weirdest albums they've ever put out so far it's grotesque it's absurd and incredibly vulgar at times - the instrumentation is kind of stripped back and a little unsettling there are a lot of stiff throbbing drums on this record that for the most part are electronic dissonant synthesizers orser's the vocals here for the most part are really freakish sometimes they reach really highs generally I would say this album is pretty uncomfortable it's difficult to really snuggle in and get cozy with this LP even after multiple listens there are all these rhythms that remind me of of suicide and the vocals on this record as well just like with Shu shus last LP do remind me of Scott Walker a bit there's not a lot of layers to the instrumentation on this record but every piece of sound does serve a very bold and dark purpose like the very shrill synth freak-outs on a knife in the Sun or the pig squealing samples on the track adult friends or the very noisy and explosive vocal samples and manipulations on the track Lawrence lickers all the songs here have their own little thrill to seek and I wouldn't call them cheap thrills but they are sort of just thrills all the same there are some exceptions on here where a melody may stick out of a track or shoe shoe actually delivers a song like stupid in the dark which i think is legitimately one of their catchy it's the most well-written tracks they've ever put out but but a lot of the time what makes these tracks memorable are moments like the very fetishize lyrics in the track black dick or the shrieking vocals on the tracks Cynthia is a unisex or L NACO and the result with tracks like these are songs that I do like a lot and find very interesting and stimulating but there is a good handful of tracks on this record that I do think underwhelm a little but merely because they're not much of anything but freakish short and unstructured tracks that don't really leave a long lasting impression on me especially since they seem to cut out right when the song is at its most intense even some of the songs on here that I really like like adult friends I just wish were a little bit longer and there are some other songs on here that are less abrasive slower more ballad like but are pretty underwhelming as well because they don't have much in terms of structure or a climax or a progression new life immigration or the track bitter melon overall I think this new shoo-shoo record is just kind of a very weird group of vignettes some of which are very good but a lot of the song is here do significantly pale in comparison to others on here still I do think this record is a vast improvement over what Shu Shu has done on their past two original material studio albums I'm feeling a decent of strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why Anthony fan Tiano Shu Shu forever 
J_fZGm7NHbE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new glitch mob album love death immortality these guys are a West Coast electronic music collective who dropped their full-length debut drink the sea just a handful of years ago a bunch of tracks that were a collaborative collection of glitch hop and electronic music hybrids a lot of touches of glitzy sort of Club centric dubstep and dance music on this record the group built these tracks on a lot of very large epic sounds and song structures popular dance music was definitely an influence on many of the tracks here but I thought that much of what glitch mob did on this record was too detailed and complex to be just club music I thought some of the songs on this thing we're pretty headphone worthy as well glitch mob has just put out their second full-length LP love death immortality I've always been pretty neutral on the group until now because this latest full-length LP of theirs I did not like not even a little straight and simple I think this new record from glitch mob is Club fodder it's pretty much nothing but songs that feature melodies that get old before the song is even over and dubstep inspired rhythms that are pretty much dime a dozen there are things on this LP that remind me of other things that I like there are some very bright melodic synth leads that remind me of artists and producers like deadmau5 or rusty there's a lot of rumbling bass on this LP and sporadic drum breaks like on a Skrillex track and there are some very epic grand builds to these songs to that slightly remind me of Daft Punk record or a justice record if you're in all of those artists then you might want to check the selfie out you might come out liking it it does have all the loud visceral sounds that you would want and expect from music in this style pretty detailed drum breaks it does follow that modern electronic dance music blueprint to a tee but I think this record came up short because in the process of doing all those things Glitch Mob forgot to actually add some personality to this music or actually penned melodies that are worth remembering there are some pretty cliche vocal performances on this record as well that do nothing but add to the very generic electro dubstep vibe on this LP and when the group does go for something kind of interesting it only ends up like a watered down version of what could have been like the song can't kill us which has this buzzing bass and drum beats that feel more rock centric and these synth leads that feel almost as if they're kind of going for a guitar type sound I mean it's it's better than what Muse did trying to fuse dubstep and rock together but it only feels like it's interesting in theory this combination of dubstep and rock and the song becoming harmonious with vocals from metal mother was a pretty interesting track for me because about slow and brooding it was and I actually thought that with the very epic and sort of sad synthesizers behind this interesting vocal it was sort of like a combination of the knife and dubstep together tracks like this aren't amazing but they're definitely a welcome change of pace from more average dubstep electro house fusions like sky toucher I think the only track on this entire LP that I wholeheartedly liked was fly by night only which features a vocal guest who's singing reminds me of churches a bit and I wasn't really into this track for the loud and buzzing and bombastic production or anything like that I just thought it was a legitimately good tune that would have sounded catchy and sounded enjoyable no matter what kind of beats are synthesizers you put against it I dub the really tender vocals from sister crayon as well in the plucked harp strings on the closing track here too but the really tiring blasts of bass and drums have gotten old at this point and just prove that this record is not all that dynamic or interesting it just feels like a really taste north north north north mix of these really beautiful vocals and tender instrumentation and then all of a sudden this very loud in your face electro pops in and it's just a really silly transition back and forth and back and forth overall I I thought this new glitch mob LP was offensively uninspiring and uninteresting despite trying to be the exact opposite with how monumental some of these songs feel but pretty much every song on this LP is just too overblown for how unsubstantial the sound play and the songwriting is I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing try ambition if you given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony fan tanto Glitch Mob forever 
7Seeog9fMpU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dear Anthony thanks for all the great reviews I am really into music and have been my whole life my problem is my new boyfriend pretty much blocks any attempt I make it playing my favorite music around him Interpol Feist Cat Power he's a car radio Nazi - I can't even suggest we listen to something else without getting a lecture about his superior music taste it sort of done jokingly but it's really starting to suck I'm not even sure if he has ever listened to a song I've played for him all the way through without complaining or joking or teasing me I don't mind a lot of his music but as soon as I put something on he's expecting to hate it I can't take only ever listening to Deftones Nine Inch Nails and tool what should I do led dear Ellie first off I think one of the most annoying shallow things that a couple can do is base their relationship on musical tastes it's got to run deeper than that common interests are important yes but if you both love music I think that's enough common ground to work with both of you could go out into the world of music and seek out artists that you both like and discover them together for the first time for example me and Cal Church esta didn't really like a lot of the same bands until we both discovered they're naked ladies it's been yes ma'am it's been yes ma'am it's been yes Pam it's been yeah that's Pam and this could be an option for you as well but it sounds like you're dealing with something that is a bit of a different animal entirely and that is a bit of a lack of respect the dude won't even let you play a song that's pretty harsh you know I'm passionate about debating music and throw in my opinion out there to people who are willing participants people who are close friends family my significant other just because these people are close to you doesn't mean they signed up to hear your musical opinion at every waking moment of the day furthermore nobody to the same club that you did to here your five thousand word thesis on why you think Skrillex sucks strong and reasoned opinions are great but it ain't that serious for right now I say talk to your boyfriend try to talk with him about this music respect boundary try to explore new music together and see if you find some common artists but if this sort of oppressive music trip continues I would say break up with him I mean it's only a matter of time where this very regular instance of disrespect shows up in other aspects of the relationship is this guy going to dictate everything if he's going to cock-block your music pics on a regular basis it's not cool transition have you ever had a significant other who hated all of the music that you enjoyed and listened to if so how did you handle it what did you do is the relationship still going strong today and if it is what is the glue that holds it together Anthony Fantana relationship advice on this channel forever

oZsH0U3tZbA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new step brothers album Lorde stepping to old steppin tin is a West Coast hip hop duo which consists of seasoned MC and producer evidence aka the weatherman you may know this guy from the handful of solo LPS he's put out over the years as well as his work with groups like dilated peoples and the alchemists a West Coast producer DJ and MC who has a very long running and successful track record has worked with a ton of different artists over the years from huge guys like Eminem to smaller and newer dudes like down-low Genesis and he's actually worked with evidence already numerous times in the past providing instrumentals for his solo LPS as well as various dilated peoples tracks and with The Alchemist recently doing these album length projects with particular artists like damo Genesis and Ono as gangrene and Action Bronson as well as prodigy so it only makes sense that he would go back into his past and do something full-length style with evidence assistants and when I heard of who was gonna be on this project when I heard the name of the project I was and wasn't excited for for several different reasons for one I haven't really loved every project that Alchemist has put out as of late with a single artist in mind and evidence I can kind of take her leave sometimes I'm familiar with his earlier stuff and there are records in his past that I enjoy but man does his voice sound maybe just a little too monotone after a while he's just got a very very icy delivery however I do dig some rock Marciano tracks occasionally I did love that album that Cod just put out last year so maybe there's something to his delivery that will hit me this time around and I'm glad I ended up checking this thing out because the first single to drop off this album step masters awesome track there is a nasty instrumental on this thing really grimy bass rumbles chunky percussion horn samples some really nice DJ cuts everything is on point with this track and I feel like alchemists production just complements evidence so much it's really the fire that complements his so cold stairs the beat on step masters and other tracks here to just make them sound much more eerie and and sort of menacing I think evidences bars are really thoughtful a lot of the time they are occasionally braggadocious they references past and music however lyrically and and delivery wise as well alchemist is a lot less subtle he's more aggressive he's more in-your-face as he's delivering these bars that are loaded with cartoony violence and sort of exaggerated threats and much of the time this dynamic does work it's kind of like a bad cop badder cop thing each MC has their own distinct personality on this LP it's really clear when one takes the reins of a track and one doesn't but I do occasionally feel like alchemist should have done sort of a rewrite on some of these lines the flow brings me more dough than creamy krispies or change your shitty drawers cuz your pants got dumped in sometimes he's talking about the crosshairs on his scope site or saying he's gonna smack someone out of their hoodie sure I just think there are some rhymes on this LP that line up awkwardly and don't really fit with the gritty dramatic tone of the instrumentals or alchemist super serious delivery I mean when I pull lines out of some of his verses and just read them they sound like they would be more fitting for a really kooky trap beat in a riff raff song or something at least then the comedy would have felt intended and you know don't get me wrong sometimes it does like I'm a big boy don't give me no snacks animal head no plate fresh off the axe and there are numerous weird interstitial vocal snippets in between these tracks that bring songs together a little bit there's sort of a weird narrative going on at the end of one particular song where this composer person hears sleigh bells and is amazed by the sound and then begins to travel the world searching for different sleigh bell sounds even though a lot of these songs are tough talking there are plenty of moments on this LP to sort of remind the listener that what's going on here is just sort of for fun I mean album's title is Lord stepping 10 and to me that does sort of create another very small weak link on this record though there are some weak bars on here it's not that distracting but another thing that does underwhelmed me occasionally is the lack of ambition on some of these songs like on the song Byron g-good bars on this track all around very good features as well from hooligans and damo Genesis but this instrumental sounds like a slightly slower rehashed version of the Sylvester Lungren beat that Alchemist gave to Action Bronson for their collaborative project together and the song tomorrow - two good features from blue and raka but another instrumentally underwhelming track with all of these really dinky synthesizers playing throughout the song the track to me gets kind of redundant and as 1mc trades places with another it doesn't really feel like the beat is showcasing or complimenting any one of them whereas I think this track like others on here such as swim-team Rastas could have done a better job of throwing these verses up on a pedestal Plus this entire LP is bookended with two of the weaker tracks structurally weak I mean four won the opener more wins it has a really smooth tone I love the beat but it's not really that much of a barn burning or interesting start to the album it's pretty short of breath and so is the last track on here - just step which is such a footnote of a song I'm surprised it ends the album out I actually think Lorde stepping to deliver Zitz most unique hard-hitting and exciting tracks right in the middle of the LP like with the song legendary mesh which has this trunk knocking beat really murky kind of psychedelic bassline lots of guitar solo samples and a plethora of sound effects just dancing around in the mix playing throughout the instrumental and I think this song actually features one of evidences best verses on the entire LP and in his lyrics as well as the vocally sampled hook on this track they're tons of A Tribe Called Quest references and the beats get even bigger than this one like on swim-team Rastas a beat that actually undergoes two instrumental changes over the course of its runtime and the song really changes moods every single time the beat shifts and lyrically I think this one of the few moments on this LP where Alchemist is actually on the same level as evidence and is actually saying some stuff that is not as overly blunt its tracks like this that made me wish the step brothers were this ambitious on every single track here though there are some songs that do impress me because they have a lyrical concept sort of running throughout them like see the rich man play which has all these references to casinos and gambling as well as draw something this LP gets super aggressive on one of the next tracks here mums in the garage one of the most hard-hitting instrumentals on this entire LP and some of the most aggressive verses as well there is a feature from Action Bronson on this track too but what surprises me even more is the track banging sound which has one of the most off-kilter rap instrumentals that I am positively sure you will hear all year I mean it's mostly based off of this drum fill it seems that is just not in a very fluid groove but guys like evidence on this track just ride the beat without flinching even for a second I mean listening to this instrumental I just had the feeling that he's the sort of guy that you know a grenade could go off somewhere near him and he wouldn't even flinch and I love how noisy and layered the instrumentation is on this b2 with the chimes and the strings and all the vocal harmonies too and for the most part I love all the instrumentals and the the lyrics that come along with the more subtle tone down tracks - they have a really strong moody vibe this LP does offer quite a bit of instrumental variety I think even if evidence and alchemists start changing their flows or their lyrical styles up too much on this record though I don't really think they need to I mean they've got a solid flows they've got personality they've got their sort of distinct voices my only major complaint with this record is that there were just a few tracks at the beginning and at the end that I wasn't that crazy about I actually loved a great deal of the tracks on this thing and could see myself returning to this LP in the future I do think this record is still kind of an acquired taste it has very little in the way of pop appeal but the beats are spectacular I feel like they pair really well with the very relaxed flows and I feel like overall these guys couldn't have gotten a better set of features here - this thing is just a really great mixed bag of tracks I'm feeling a strong seven - a light eight transition if you've given this up he'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana stepbrothers murmur 
6_esHs6Crug,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan what's up Anthony my name is Barry Duncan and I've been watching your reviews for a minute I am a fan of real hip hop and I've watched every review of my favorite artists that you've done Jay Cole Drake Tyler the Creator childish gambino Hopson dizzy Wright even super underground dudes like Isaiah Rashad and Mac Miller you've pretty much reviewed every big rapper out and you haven't said you loved any of their new projects why is that do you hate hip-hop you're obviously not a hip-hop head so just quit reviewing hip-hop albums I heard that you hate Kanye West too is that true you should just stick to rock or something because you don't know what you're talking about signed Barry Duncan dear Barry I totally and completely understand that you're mad but try to see the bigger picture here hip-hop has been around for decades and you're saying that because I don't like a handful of albums that have come out in the past few years I hate the entire genre come on son there was a point in time in high school when I was super into punk music but I've never been one of those people that had a little pet genre where I loved every record in it and I felt the need to call out anybody who I felt was listening to it less than me it's kind of like this this over here is the best album ever I should know because it's the only album I listen to look flail it's logic but Berry is right in a sense you know I'm not a hip-hop head I'm not trying to be a hip-hop head I've never said I was a hip-hop head I don't want to be a head for any genre I'm just a passionate music fan that's why I do this all I'm trying to do is show you some records that I love and keep up on some other new stuff in the process I'm not going to love every album that crosses my path if all you do is watch my most popular and most negative reviews in one single genre and gloss over completely what I recommend instead that's on you it's really got nothing to do with whether or not I love or hate and am knowledgable in an entire genre but just to humor you here is a list of some pretty current hip-hop albums that I think are fantastic totally worth checking out and are linked down there in the description and here is a list of hip hop albums that are older more classic and are just is worth giving some ear time maybe because I listen to so many different styles of music and so many artists that I'm kind of picky and I don't have a soft spot for any one single artist or genre so there isn't really that pressure or that expectation for it to be amazing or blow my mind in my own head that means I can kind of come at each album for what it is and just kind of like it for however it appeals to me as opposed to whether or not a record is good according to the traditional standards of a genre so that's it Barry Thanks for writing in I hope you and some of the other people watching check out some of the album's I recommended and maybe we understand one another a little better than we did before transition I don't really have anything pertinent to say in this title card I mean we have a subscribe button down here and we have some videos to the side that are related might actually interest you if you liked this video as well and you know if you throw some questions in the comments and if they interest me or if you write me a letter an email or something like that and the question is worth sort of mulling over then you know they might appear in a video like this cool cool you're the best Anthony Fantana I don't hate any freaking genres forever 
5pfUULxVoSU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new behemoth album the Satanist kaljaa chesta you stop that right now this instant making silly growling noises and devil horns is patronizing to metal fans hey the more you know they really do prefer that you go to my knowledge behemoth is the most infamous metal band to come out of Poland they've been active since the early 90s back when their records had a pretty old-school slightly run-of-the-mill black metal sound the songs on these records were pretty low five filled with archaic melodies and even though there was a lot of punch to these albums in this part of behemoths career there was something kind of charming about how the compositions on these records felt centuries old now as the band's recording quality got better with every new LP they started bringing in elements of death metal the band went even further down this road coming together with a string of metal records in the early 2000s that to me were just straight death metal though personally I've never really been a big fan of these albums I do think that at this point in behemoths career the band was sounding really savage and loud but they didn't have much in the way of memorability or finesse but this latest LP the sameness comes five years after the release of behemoths previous album Evangelion which I believe is the largest time gap in between behemoth records which may have something to do with the fact that the band's frontman and guitarist primary songwriter Nergal was actually diagnosed with leukemia and has fought it and recovered since maybe that had something as well to do with the change of pace that behemoth takes on this LP musically the Satanist is easily one of the eiements most ambitious and dynamic records yet and their black metal influences come back in a big way really dark melodies shine through these massive walls of blast beats and tremolo guitars and there's some pretty epic arranged instrumentation added to the mix on this LP as well with horns being the most stunning and exciting a the vocals on this LP are still pretty gruff not a huge change from the band's earlier output if you've been listening to their death metal releases but I do think the singing on this LP is a lot more raw definitely a huge improvement over the more barbaric on records like here and beyond and there's some variety on these tracks to some left hooks here and there like on the track in the absence of light which has this polish spoken word interlude on it with a very distant sax solo hanging in the background there's missing noir we're right at the start of the track I can hear the vocals just cracking with intensity as they're being delivered right at the start of the song on pong then there is the closer which has these really harmonious background vocals just erupting in the background just bringing this song's emotional qualities to just a higher level of intensity it's so beautiful the production on this LP too is fantastic I can't really find a complaint about it the the drums are punchy the guitars are loud but they're not overpowering the vocals as well the guitar tone is is very bright it's burning the bass is a little obscure but when the band is playing riffs it really does seem to to shine out a little bit though bass has never really been a lead instrument in black metal music it's not really a huge loss the metal instrumentation on this record creates a huge wall of sound but there's just enough room left over for just a touch of reverb a little bit of atmosphere and all the additional instrumentation when and if the band decides to use it the brass the strings the organ the chorus vocals and whenever stuff like this pops in it doesn't really ruin the vibe of the song to me it always adds to the very grim and hellish quality of this album for a straight black metal record the songs on this LP are really grand I mean there's nothing on here that is quite as epic or symphonic as let's say an early Emperor record but I like that behemoth was able to find a really satisfying compromise between subtlety and force and the entire album itself actually plays with this dynamic with tracks like fer de vinius as well as ahmen which has one of the most freakish endings on this entire LP with these layered vocals and just such a loud wall of guitars but me personally I mostly prefer the songs on here that have a stronger melodic element like missing noir and there are tracks on this LP too that I think are catchy I mean behemoth really tried to write some strong choruses on a few of these tracks moments on here like the title track and or a pro nobis Lucifer that track has a really sort of unashamed rock guitar solo on here I do like that behemoth is so dark and is so intense on this record but I think bringing in elements of just you know straightforward rock and roll elements of more accessible shades of metal music does sort of show that behemoth does want a visceral response from their listeners as well and I have to mention that I do think there are some very sticky and memorable and enjoyable guitar leads that play throughout these two tracks too I think the Satanist finishes off pretty well too with three very dynamic tracks especially the closer which is one of the best on the entire LP and the longest song - I mean it just feels like such such a final moment on this LP it feels like such an accomplished finish for this record which is a relatively short LP I mean it's just about 45 minutes long it's not really going to overstay its welcome or anything like that my only major issues with this album overall is that the two shorter tracks on here while they are very good songs they do move at such a pace that they were a little bit of a blur on some of my initial listens to this album outside of that I really loved the selfie even lyrics which I think some people may have issues with seeing that they could easily sort of shove them into the corner for being a black metal cliche with all this satanic content however I don't think what behemoth did on this record was write a really tasteless spit in the face toward God and religion I'm not saying this record isn't sacrilegious it is I took the lyrics on this LP as being more allegory more of a narrative more of a character portrait of Satan himself in some instances another thing that I could see people potentially getting down on with this LP is how progressive it isn't this record is definitely not as experimental as some of the really weird black metal fusions that we've been seeing these days with rock and roll progressive rock post rock shoegaze industrial music but I think behemoth does a fantastic job of justifying their more straightforward approach on this blackened death metal record with some very good strong solid memorable writing great sound great vocals very good performances intensity some fantastic drum fills and just a really concise record with a good amount of variety that flows well from beginning to end I think that behemoth really lived up to their name on this record I'm feeling a light night on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana behemoth the Satanist forever 
RzWl53ifcms,you get hey you get over you'll see came to wait get you know yeah Anthony Fantan oír the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Isaiah Rashad mixtape EP project Sylvia demo this is the latest project from al nasir rapper Isaiah Rashad who has recently been elevated to a pretty high level of attention thanks to being courted by Top Dawg entertainment with artists like absol and schoolboy q and j-rock and Kendrick Lamar this is easily one of the most consistent rap labels or collectives out there but they are also one of the smallest - there's not really a lot of room for error here if TDE adds somebody it's got to be someone of substance or someone who's legitimately interesting or makes some kind of splash or has a hit or something or people are going to be a little more weary next time to decide to add an artist to the roster and TD & TD e is really trying to put a lot of promotion behind this project not allowing it to get swept under the rug in the same way Rashad's last one did it was only four months ago that we started seeing this stream of new songs and music videos featuring this dude with songs like I shot you down and soliloquy and our EP Kevin Miller and Ronnie Drake and it's all built up to the release of this thing and to be completely honest I hope that were shot is using the word demo on this project literally because I do hope that he comes out with something a little more exciting in the future on the 14 tracks here with Silvia demo Rashad does prove himself to be a really capable rapper there are moments on this tape where he's really impassioned and intense like modest and I shot you down and banana there are moments here where he's pretty smooth and maybe there's a bit of a melody or a tune to his voice like on Heavenly Father there are spots where he's really stone-faced really serious like on soliloquy and there are Hmong where he's really subtle and quiet and maybe his lyrics offer some really sobering truths of for example the song tranquility Rashad does offer a range of emotions on the 14 tracks here and even though his inflections occasionally remind me of Kendrick Lamar or schoolboy q or some of his older influences like Tupac or outcast or Tribe Called Quest or souls of mischief the influences are never so deafening that they distract away from the quality of the song I think Rashad is a principled and convincing rapper who sort of finds himself stuck between the reckless bliss of youth and sort of the the depression that comes with being conscious of the world's shortcomings and lyrically he paints this dichotomy really well on numerous tracks here and he also approaches subjects like race and culture and a really hard upbringing and substance abuse depression being young but also on the the cusp of fatherhood he's poetic on these topics he's interesting on these topics I get a sense that he sort of knows what he's talking about in a sense but I do think what ruins some of the impact of these songs is that Rashad is on so many non descript beats like with the Tramp webby flow with it's really smooth bass ii instrumentation and very light synthesizers the title track on here is is vaguely jazzy which is a term I would use to describe many instrumentals here and there are plenty of tracks here as well with very Airy keyboards and pianos bouncing against this incredibly steady beat the song modest or menthol or r.i.p Kevin Miller but I do like these tracks but only because of what were shot brings to the table lyrically and flow wise as well these are some of his most impassioned tracks I think these songs have some of the stickiest hooks on this entire project too but the hooks are a totally different story they tend to be just as hit or miss as the instrumentals hooks that are real honest-to-god snoozers that feature either were shot or another vocalist singing so inconspicuously that you might as well just tune out until the next verse comes around like on Webby whoa and menthol and to a lesser extent Ronnie Drake though I do like that trach scissors very fragile vocals on this song do sort of pull me in though I do feel that that may not be the case for everybody and the lyrics on this particular course as well aren't exactly all that either not as memorable or as distinct or as thought-provoking as a chorus on here like tranquility a course that sort of puts assassins and leaders up against one another as being in this sort of symbiotic relationship with God and Jesus and Brutus and Caesar and though I do like this track one of my favorites on here is one of the songs that just kind of cuts the fat just glosses over the choruses and brings a hard beat with very serious tone the song soliloquy this song is one of the few moments of excitement that I feel that this project brings there are a lot of songs on this thing that I do think brings sort of a stoned aesthetic and while sometimes that does lead to Rashaad kind of letting go of his inhibitions being really over-the-top and energetic but too often I think the other tracks on this thing are a little middle-of-the-road which keeps Rashad from digging deeply into a well thought-out concept or idea or theme in a song Rashad keeps hitting me with one surface-level expression after another I think that this project is not hyped enough for a party or feel-good atmosphere but yet it's not thoughtful enough to be dug into that deeply it's sort of hops back and forth between the two a little bit doing neither and incredibly well for that long I do think the music on here is agreeable which is gonna lead to a lot of people who stumble across this thing liking it but it's not that gripping for me I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition if you've given this project to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next Isaiah Rashad Sylvia demo forever 
JNlm0vLA_N8,hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a final update where essentially I bring to your attention a group of LPS just you know some vinyl or there's a 10-inch in here to group of LPS that have recently made it into the old record collection back here down in the description or actually right here you can find a playlist of pretty much all the vinyl videos that I've done so far so if you're really interested in everything that's in here it's there ooh ooh all right let's my girlfriend's cute um we do these raw we do these raw okay first starting off a 10 inch that I can't promise you that you'll ever get to own but maybe it'll just make you happy knowing that it exists in some shape or form clipping clipping the experimental west coast noise hip-hop outfit clipping they have a 10 inch out that they set my way I'm very gracious about it and it has two tracks on a chain and jump jump I know there are some live videos of out there chain I'm not so sure about but the studio versions of these tracks are amazing um in my opinion better than anything on mid-city unfortunately from what I understand these tracks will not be making it on clippings next full-length albums so I'm just sort of crossing my fingers hoping that this ten inch or at least mp3s of this 10 inch somehow you know are made available by the group but um but yeah just incredible lyrics and grooves on these and they really did a fantastic job of incorporating melody on these tracks too with the bass line on chain and sort of the choruses on jump and sort of the very eerie synthesizers hanging in the background while clipping is still as noisy as they've ever been it's not quite um all that they have to offer on these two tracks that again I think their best thus far um all right sorry it was excited to talk about that one and that's why I talked about it first but I must talk about this record because it comes from our sponsor over at eclectic the eclectic music Society a website where you can get art vinyl stuff and of course records as well they passed me this fresh reissued copy of peel slowly and C will not peel solely in C but The

the vinyl pressing of this record is great it's great vinyl pressing I just actually got a new stylus for the record player and this and you know it's been a while since I put a new stylus in there

I'll see you I'll see you I'll see you again have a nice life a natural world out now on the blend sir okay this one this one's an oldie and a goodie The Cramps debut record songs the Lord taught us rockabilly on this LP if you're into rockabilly music if you're into old school rock music but with a more modern Punk goth Flair then you're going to want to give this listen I don't want to say I love this LP not that I not that I can't it isn't a cramps album that I'm particularly familiar with honestly I do know a lot of the bigger tracks off of here like what is it rock on the moon and where is and they do obviously where the hell is that track no that must be off the next LP no garbage man yes I'm familiar with garbage man as well in the video for that song I'm more familiar with everything they've done after rocket and real and in Auckland New Zealand actually I know their sophomore album too it's just kind of weird it's just one of those things where you really get into abandoned their debut LP is what you end up getting into last you know it's just one of those situations but you know as far as the packaging looks nice looks great you know authentic to the original I'm imagining you know got some nice labeling there black sleeve my camera looks like it's about to die battery wise so if there ends up being an edit that's why next one of my favorite records of last year I believe my third favorite record from last year altar of plagues teeth glory and divine injury oh my no teeth glory and injury what am I thinking of like an earth record idiot unfortunately the band's last album final album from altar of plagues and such a good one too but I've heard that members of the band will be working on some projects in the future that may share some of the same dark and electronic qualities so I am kind of excited about that but this thing is a double LP as I just showed you gatefold and gray splatter vinyl profound Laura really did a great job making this an interesting package I mean you know it's it's so freakin color-coordinated it's wonderful you know I know gray is the most exciting color in the world but again it is sort of a total package of sorts all right moving on oh we got time a good time a good time so what spiderland just nabbed a copy of this just as they're about to reissue the album with a massive vinyl box that you can look up that which I mean you know I'm less incentivized to get now that I own this but still I'm happy that I own this and I do recommend that anybody who hasn't heard this album or maybe owns a digital copy do seek out the deluxe edition that they're going to be dropping soon love the plastic sleeve on here the record is absolutely beautiful shiny smell is wonderful and if you're looking for rock music that is incredibly slow dismal passionate poetic lyrics do look into this LP do please do great record that I've owned digitally for a long time but have never owned a physical copy of it and I actually have not listened to all the way through in a while as well so I will be treating myself to that very soon all right continuing on ah Frank Zappa overnight sensation wow this is going to go very nice with all my other Frank Zappa records I also had a digital copy of this for a while but I have not owned a physical copy I love the mural on the front of this LP such a fun crazy kooky little situation going on right here and I mean this is 70s Frank Zappa it's jazzy it's rocky it's funky the song topics and the lyrics are weird as hell and very comedic and strange what does make this record stick out to me not that it's the only album that he contributed to with Zappa but there are some great synth and keyboard solos from the great George Duke on this LP and there are a few tracks on here where Rickey Lancelot II lends his vocal stylings and he sounds like a psychotic white James Brown that that's that's all I could say and it does you know it does it does stick out again Frank Zappa overnight sensation if you're into jazz rock progressive rock don't just look into this album but look into Frank Zappa's entire discography not just jazz rock and jazz fusion and progressive rock and all that but also rock that is a sort of cheeky as a very strong sense of humor and finally for this vinyl update as we I think have like one minute or so left ah Jane Doe converge yes finally got a copy of this not that it was impossible but you know just sort of the price was right the package was right and it's a nice gatefold deal going on here and not only that but it's green it's green it is green and I love the labeling on this Oh oh and I love the labeling on this thing J a ne2 C&D sides and for whatever odd reason there is this incredibly large insert book on i mean it's essentially a lyric book of sorts where the lyrics are kind of like stacked in these really vivid vivid and dark and very uh gritty of images drawings from lead singer Jacob Bannon who I imagine is Jacob and I've seen his art before and this looks like his style and I know he did the cover art so and he really is a fantastic artist this actually looks interesting to me looking through it on the camera because sort of looking up close it's sort of you know the the words and everything and the textures they're so blinding but sort of seeing it smaller and farther away you really see the the bigger picture of all of it but um but any but for whatever reason uh and and this is the weird thing it's not weird that there's an insert here though this is really ambitious to put something like this together I have two of them there's there's two of them in here there's two they're the exact same I don't know why I had to uh but I have them it didn't even wasn't even anticipating that so I I have one I could use as a coffee table book but anyway not that I would those a joke but if you are looking for some hardcore with a strong metal edge lots of interesting grooves some experimentation lots of noise do check this record out this is just one of those records that it's been out for well over ten years yet its intensity and how hard-hitting it is really hasn't waned I mean it's it's sort of like Pig destroyers Prowler in the yard or like napalm deaths early records and that the intensity and the impact and the ferocity because there are a lot of heavy loud abrasive that as you listen to them 10 years 15 years later down the road you'll and that's not really that extreme anymore but but this is still at a very high point of extremity of even more than 10 years later again converge Jane Doe wonderful gatefold packaging on this thing double LP green vinyl and that is this month's vinyl update again shout out to our sponsor in this video

Itown-55MMo,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd here with an interview as you may know toward the end of this month february wild beasts the uk-based art pop and indie pop outfit has a new record coming out titled present-tense they dropped a record a few years ago titled smothered which you may remember that I dug and I was wondering considering how synth-heavy the latest single from this new LP of theirs is if they're going to be changing their sound in any significant way at this new record of theirs is going to be bringing the band's music into a different direction so I caught up via the internet with one of the band's singers and a multi-instrumentalist from the band Hayden Thorpe transition here we are on the internet with Hayden Thorpe of wild beasts thank you for coming online with O either you guys have coming out yeah absolutely after an album has dramatic and as theatrical as your last album smother what can you say to sort of mentally prepare me for what you guys are going to be doing on past tense present tense yeah oh man I could be future tense I suppose this is the big debate well I hope we took a while to actually come up with the title itself I think it's definitely more aggressive and clear-eyed then smother I think smother was kind of fragile and quite considered and I think maybe present tense is probably more sensual than intellectual you know I think we try to go with the body rather than the brain I think I think present tense is a bit more brawn to it and I mean that sort of emotional shift is that would eventually let you guys to decide on present tenses as being the title I think we were for present tense because it's just kind of you know sometimes just little the consciousness of the record is definitely I think made up by the kind of fragmented now I think we kind of even this as a kind of format to kind of talk to each other in is in us in is a kind of a head you know if you think about humans and what how our heads work the fact that it's what it's nine o'clock at night here and it's probably early afternoon where you are and those kind of leaps in time and consciousness that we just take for granted I am our theory that somewhere do leave a remnant of something you know I think we take for granted all these kind of all this exposure to information and this breadth of possibility it's like a question of where is the man within all this and are you guys sort of with this record I mean do you feel like you're embracing that you know that that that fragmented Ness and sort of just an auditory depiction absolutely you know I think it's not supposed to make complete sense it's not supposed to be very it's not supposed to be neat and tidy basically I think we were kind of accepting it so accepting of the mess and I think that's what it create a great person I think has to be acceptable nowadays is because especially as a musician you're every pub gig is captured on a camera phone your every move these kind of blogs and tagged and shared and liked and it's like as in as you have to kind of relinquish control and and accept the chaos of that and I think the record in his way does that yeah I mean there's there's less privacy and sort of leading a public life there's ever been before from what I've heard from the latest single from this album and what I've been reading about how you guys made the album leading up to this interview am I to understand that there's gonna be a little bit less live instrumentation on this record and this album is musically a little more electronically assembled yeah so yeah I think you know even just the confines of working from London and writing a record in London means you're inhabiting much smaller spaces you know London by nature is a very compressed and layered City and the kind of musicians find hovels within it you know and that's kind of suited us at the time we were happy to kind of sit around a laptop and and rather than bash it out in a room because you know I think we kind of write emotional songs and and the pallet of sounds that computers and synthesizers offered us was far broader than guitars and you know I think it's just like maybe we I personally fell out of love with it has a bit you know about it I'm not saying I mastered the instrument at all I didn't I've always used it quite crudely but it lost its mystery to me I could no longer pick it up and figure out and and and do something unpredictable and the beauty of electronics and synthesizers is I myself and us collectively we're not really too cleared up about what they're doing and how they work but within that is it is a mystery and if you're allowing accident and and unpredictability into your work then you're allowing a greater possibility of something kind of magical to happen I think yeah I mean especially if you're if you're newer to making music in that style you know the the it would seem that the chances of you stumbling upon something more wild and new and just completely different least to you would the transfer degrees greatly but you know and that sort of a you know more of a sound play and sound design sort of idea but in terms of this record being more aggressive was there a challenge in trying to make electronic sound more lively than your instruments because obviously playing guitar playing live drums you know if you want it to be louder if you want it to be harder there are very simple physical adjustments that you make without even having to really think about it to make those yeah to make those sounds happen you know what's the process of sort of trying to gain those sensations behind a laptop or behind a keyboard yeah well to be honest we struggled I mean I think we did use drum machines and prog beats for a while and we kind of worked out something a bit of a hole we we actually left the studio because we kind of we've got the heebie jeebies in there for different reasons and we went we've set up a different studio where Chris our drummer could kind of open out a bit because all of our songs really are built from the drums up you know I think we've always been of the opinion their rhythm speak of what you can never really intellectualize as it were you know you can you can say a thousand words but a beat will tell them far more quickly and more precisely you know because I think we try and make sense you will music and music of the body and and beats do that like nothing else and Chris really is our engine room and that's in so once we got his influence back in the room it all fell together much more easily it felt a lot much more awesome I mean I've used the term before but we were on several occasions a few hips to hank laps away from absolute disaster you know the difference between a kind of natural snare in the room and one time a sample on MPC is kind of vast you know to drift away from the beats and warren to the synthesizers with this latest single that you guys dropped there was an incredibly just really large wall of sins just finishing that song out are we to assume that there will be many moments like this on present-tense I think yeah that synthesizer that made that sound was probably the most used synth on the record it was a Dave Smith profit aid which is kind of almost standard issue now because he's one of the most affordable and diverse since you can kind of get right now and then yeah I mean and again I'm not suggesting that we went to great lengths to design that sound it was an honesty like many of the sounds we used a preset yeah I think with children of our generation in there we work with a sense of impatience and we want to be satiated quickly and you know whenever the sort to kind of get bogged down in the technicalities so I'd say though there are kind of lots of sounds like that yeah that what kind of breadth and what I think we tried to go more widescreen yeah well well that's that's exactly what I'm asking I mean not just in terms of the sounds that you guys use but but sort of producing the album with more electronics did it seem like there was more incentive to pile these sounds on top of one another you know just and stack the sounds higher yeah absolutely you know how we were know what the songs really started out from quite an epic place already come around from our standards so we were really at times bordering on the over epic but ironically when we have more time we tend to take away we tend to straight back and we had much much more time on this record that we kind of decided that ourselves and what we doing that that process is kind of stripped away the decoration and and try and boil it down to what is the essential component to make this a functional elegant piece of music that works on an emotion level and kind of moves you in some way and I think maybe the quicker you work the more you kind of covering up your past mistakes with other stuff you kind of plastering over them so you know with this record we went to great lengths to make sure every single component from the kick drum to the you know top layer synth was quite captured in detail as a policy could it could stand up in itself and so I say the records more minimal in many ways so there's not that layering because it is it is dangerous like you say they become it can become a bit foggy what I certainly want this record we will will want this record to be very clear right you know obviously we're talking about differences coming through on this record sonically and compositionally but I know at least for myself and I assume with other fans of your music as well people most instantaneously recognize a wild beast song from the vocals and I'm sort of wondering if if you and Tom are sort of approaching this record in a different angle vocally than you have pastel peas yeah definitely I mean I mean it is still the kind of comedy high voice comedy low voice yeah you know I think there's maybe a greater comfort in that and a sense of you know it's a good maybe we're working with a sense of familiarity like once people know your voice they kind of it loses its you make after a while and you know I think um I personally I have turned it down massively over the years because I've become a less angry person I think you know it started out almost as a tool of protest on the first record and this slowly become simply something to narrate the music as it were I think that the fact that our palette sonically in our songwriting ability I hope is got better means that is less need to kind of instill all the angst and energy and meaning into the voice it's it's already there in the music and the voice and the voice can just as I say in there right and and and give some sense of place well if you guys are getting more gratification from the musical or the compositional pursuits you're getting in these songs and there's less I guess vocal pressure I mean is that is there less lyrical pressure as well do you feel or read the lyrics never really been as great a place to have this stand of protest as as sort of just the singing style yeah again I think the lyrics probably in and speaking frankly on my own terms I think probably you know I wanted them to be very coded and very wrapped up in all sorts of kind of soliloquy and metaphor and you know tie myself in knots and ten times over but I think um there's now maybe a sense of just acceptance that um simple things can be the powerful things as well I think also it's kind of draw you know I mean Oh our first single was called brave bulging buoyant clairvoyance if we were kind of trying to outdo ourselves god knows what the you know the latest things are because you know you you would need a translator mm so yeah and I think I think we're trying to do what what I always have loved about my favorite musicians is that they always seem to distill the essentials of what they do without ever losing love but they seem to take them with them and I think it's about realizing what are the components of us that are worth keeping and what you have to be quite brutal what can we discard what's that non-essential and I certainly think the theatrics and overzealous singing of our first record could go I think I think we've proven ourselves as I hope it probably not to anyone but ourselves that we can write a kind of a riddle and this kind of a sense I'm not going to speak in riddles anymore cut out the middleman is aware this is what we mean this is what we're saying so so there's definitely going to be some more straightforward lyrical themes on this new album and yes you know and if that's the case I mean what what are you sort of throwing in our face I mean what are we gonna pick up right away in some of these songs oh you know I think I do think we have always written about the same things just in different ways so you know sex love the kind of the destruction of masculinity how kind of obsolete aspects of masculine is here how ridiculous we are you know and you know with a sense of fragility and also a sense of bravado in there as well you know alright I think we're gonna leave it there great work thank you for coming on my pleasure thank you new wild beast record present tense coming out at the end of February and check it out it's gonna be on Domino Records correct the show Domino all right hey Thor while beasts you have any Fantana forever boy you 
Sw7LWQx-qA4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the return of our you know one view we're essentially at the end of every month i'm going to try my damndest to consistently talk about records that are relevant to the world of music but more specifically relevant to me that i did not get a chance to talk about to touch down upon over the past month so I'll be giving you opinions on records that you may have been curious about what I've been thinking of them and on LPS that you might not have come across and maybe way more interesting to you than they are to me that's the beauty of music subject so let's start this thing album title Cal give a listen to this LP if you're looking for some magical mystical cloud wrap with some pretty good very choppy beats I mean these beats are really sort of chopped and screwed slow jams there's a huge voice delivering all the lyrics on this LP too and while a lot of the flows on this record are pretty decent there's not much about what the emcee on here is saying or sort of his very low position in the mix of this album that makes me want to tune in deeply to what exactly it is he's spitting the record does put forth a pretty strong nice Pleasant vibe though this LP is very sweet its sensual jangly guitar pop with a slight garage rock edge there's actually a pretty strong I think 80s rock sort of New Wave vibe on this LP too like I could definitely see Blondie's music being a big influence on this new Dum Dum Girls LP I think the songs on this record are dark they're moody but consistently with this LP like with their previous albums I'm usually very underwhelmed by the vocals and the course is that dum dum girls place into their songs I think sonically this record has much more clarity than some of the fuzzier stuff that they put out in the past and I like that but this album just does not have the the urgency that I look for in a rock record in a pop record it's just a little bit too breezy for me volume 3 of instrumentals to drop from this cloud rap production pioneer songs that have found placement in other projects like Grand Theft Auto 5 or the latest ASAP rocky record or the latest Mac Miller record the track II recently did with doom aka MF DOOM is on this LP as well and while a lot of the instrumentals that Clams Casino puts together aren't exactly amazing to listen to on their own there are some good beats on this thing even if the usual very hazy atmosphere that comes on to his tracks isn't as heavy isn't as powerful on the set of instrumentals and I think that's a conscious decision it definitely feels like he's trying to change his sound evolve it diversify it a little bit and that's a great thing because it does lead to some interesting beats on here although I wasn't all that crazy about some of the unreleased material on this collection of tracks to me this project is not quite as essential as the previous two clamps casino tapes but if you are into those collections then this is something you're going to want to listen to as well on this LP expect to hear some strange psychedelic instrumental jams just like The Last Guardian alien LP except the tracks on this thing are a lot more diversified there are five songs on here as opposed to just one really long one like on the Last Guardian Angel LP though two of them are just one minute long and the final track on here is 20 minutes long there's still some decent tracks on this thing some very mind-altering very sound bending moments but the two tracks that are one minute long are just a huge tease to me in that they put out some of the most interesting ideas on the entire LP but they're just cut so short and the two mid-sized tracks on here while I do think they are okay it's really the final closing track the title track the 20 minute long track they're really ends up wowing you with its instrumental intensity some of the experimental electronics that go into the track and just the manic vocals toward the end of the song of course drummer Greg Fox is playing is is fantastic throughout this LP - if you're into instrumental experimental music with a lot of interplay and something that really creates a cloud a cacophony of sound that you can really get lost in if you love sort of vast directionless jams then give this thing a listen these guys were New York Post hardcore and indie rock outfit whose debut LP here I was really excited for because they were putting it out on Death Wish Records and they had some really impressive singles leading up to the release of this LP but I just felt horrific aliy let down by what the band actually put forth on this record for one the recording on this thing is is not that hot I'm surprised this record is on Death Wish given how good the recordings of many of the bands on this label are I mean to me this record instrumentally sounds so hollow the guitars and the bass drown out the drums in a really unflattering way and and the overall recording itself doesn't even feel that loud it just feels so limp and pastel-colored and just just very boring to listen to and on top of it there are some laughably bad vocals just topped across every single track on this album in my opinion I mean they feel so forced so over the top so over acted I mean they're they're just really unpleasant overall this LP to me just sounds and feels like a really weak demo especially on the balladeer mistress appears at funeral I mean the vocals the singing there as well I mean there is a different singer on that track but it sounds just a silly and the weirdest thing the weirdest thing about this LP is that collectively with the track in the middle of the album and a track at the end of the album there is about 40 minutes of time spent with pretty much just an audio confessional or interview with Angelique Gautier former porn star and her anecdotes about her career and her time in the industry and all the time she spent with different celebrities is interesting unfortunately way more interesting than anything the band did on this record musically this guy's a West Coast rapper hip-hop veteran he's been pretty prolific lately with solo material putting out new stuff with his old clique hieroglyphics as well as Deltron 3030 and this latest release of his is one of his most eccentric releases in a while with really strange noisy hip-hop beats and the kind of in-your-face I'm going to say whatever I want to say this is my point of view kind of songwriting that drew me so much to his earlier stuff like his debut my only major issue with this album is that the beats do get a little redundant a little repetitive and the courses aren't that impressive either but I think what del comes forward and says on this record and sort of the the texture and the personality of these beats are interesting enough to maybe get someone who's not into this guy's music maybe digging there is discography the new Warpaint record another really sort of unaffected rock album unfortunately an LP whose recording is definitely way less hazy than the fool the band's previous release and that's nice it was nice to sort of hear the band in the raw a little bit more and some beautiful moments did come out as a result of that sonic change like the introductory track on hear and love is to die and I think my favorite song in this entire LP was the very Dancy and post-punk II disco very still at the end of the day I'm not really impressed with the sound of this band with the songs that they were I really end up being more impressed by what this record is trying to be rather than be impressed by what it actually is I mean there are moments on here where the songs remind me a little bit of Smashing Pumpkins or Portishead there are some trip hop style tracks on this thing or like massive attack but when I hear a very obvious influence all I'm really reminded of is I mean this would be great if the vocals were a little bit better if the melodies were a little bit stronger to me in where this album just feels so so drained I mean it's way too drain for me to be excited about it emotional about it sadly I just don't find this new Warpaint record to be that interesting or bold for me this record is a sort of bland rocking uppity kind of feel-good indie pop indie rock record whose lead vocalist I couldn't pick out of a lineup even if I was forced to it's just way too commercial and an unattractive like my least favorite Biffy Clyro and portugal the man records essentially I don't like this not even a little it's it's just it's not for me this new angel his record that I was kind of looking forward to considering how much respect I have for this girl as a singer as a rapper as a spitter she's a great rapper with a fast flow and I think her voice has personality and I think you know she has a future in hip-hop music but not with this record in my opinion I mean this record to me was was really heartbreaking in that I feel like her earlier tracks were so gritty and so just her clenched teeth aggressive I mean she was really coming out and sort of establishing herself as a strong emcee and now she's hopping on all of these radio-friendly commercial rap bubblegum pop beats that just sounds silly to me and sort of take away her bark and take away her bite - I can see angel haze sort of gaining some more accessibility by going down this road but the shine gained from this LP is going to be very short lasting I mean she's going to have to do something a little bit more definitive than this on future records in order to hold people's attention even the biggest names in pop rap right now aren't writing these kinds of sounds anymore and the ones that are still to a degree like Big Sean for example aren't even taken that seriously or seen as one of the big names in pop rap right now the new I'll say record shelter finally this French rock project that's always taken a very hazy and blissful approach to black metal takes the plunge and just makes a shoegaze record we've always known the shoegaze has been a primary influence on al-sayed music and I mean this record is purely that and while this record is very light on the ears of and it is very ethereal it is absolutely boring it's like listening to my Bloody Valentine or a slow dive record where those two bands were forced to only use reverb as a way to alter the sounds in their music and that's it they weren't allowed to use any other kinds of effects or any other kind of sonic adventuring just reverb the melodies and the songs on this thing aren't even that memorable the vocals are absolutely underwhelming in every way that they could possibly be they're not even pretty - listen - they're not even passionate this record is to me adult contemporary shoegaze I mean that's it to me this record is not pretty it's not sweet it's just bland it's just unmemorable you blew it record keep on doing what you're doing if you're huge into that Midwest emo sort of slightly more vintage like mid to early 2000s indie rock sound then do look this record up they capture that sound really well and they have some decent tunes on here - I wouldn't say that they come through with a bold or definitive style all their own which did kind of keep me back from loving this record but it is a decent listen if you are into that sound and that's pretty much all the album's that I wanted to touch down on in this why you know review cool cool transition if you've given these LPS a listen

Ofk_17ReuoM,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for me to now that it is the end of January in the beginning of February list out all the album's I loved from this past month so favorite records this past month January has actually been pretty fruitful 2014 has been a very interesting year so far interesting musical year and we're just getting started one the new Shu Shu LP Nina Nina Simone covers album great LP in my opinion very strange out there I know it dropped at the tail end of 2013 and it is not officially a 2014 album but it is a great LP like I said in my opinion and I do think it is worth mentioning in this video very strange Avant totally weirdo versions of some very interesting Nina Simone songs that she had either win or popularized via performance throughout her career next the new actress album ghetto Ville UK electronic music producer actress comes together with some very interesting productions on this LP that experiment with elements of house and techno and ambient music and there are so many tracks on this LP that to me sort of veer outside of genre a little bit into something that's very mechanic strange and very textured God is this LP textured to me this album like I said in the review is a lot like a very personal and intimate sketchpad of actresses while it isn't very refined and overall as an album it doesn't feel like a cohesive piece with an overarching theme it is a very interesting group of tracks that's a pretty adventurous and bold next the new have a nice life record the unnatural world this experimental noise rock post-punk shoegaze outfit comes through with a follow-up to the very celebrated 2008 album death consciousness this is an incredibly dissonant noisy heavy heavy album very just matte vast huge sounds on this record and very very dismal and depressing as well next the new Indian LP from all purity if you love your sludge metal noisy really noisy harsh abrasive with some nasty disgusting vocals on top of all of it do give this thing a listen this is really one of the most bleak sludge metal records I've heard in a while also the new self-titled murmur LP these guys mix elements of black metal with with progressive rock it just has this really raw live-in-the-moment sound it has some really long epic tracks toward the beginning which does make it feel a little front ended but I do think that the playing on this record is great a lot of the riffs are fantastic these guys have some great interplay and it's gonna be exciting to hear these guys maybe up the recording quality a little bit in the future and consistently write songs that are as epic as the first three on here for the length of an entire album and finally what is easily my favorite LP of this entire month the new silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra record off get three weep or light on everything these guys are a very well-known post rock experimental rock and now on this LP psychedelic rock outfit however this is not your typical psych music I mean there's tons of strings on these tracks the songs on here so heavy booming riffs very passionate vocals that deal a lot in the death of kids it's it's a really sad LP at a lot of points a really intense album as well and I think the zenith's so far of this more driving rock sound in silver mountains ions music those are my favorite records from this past month here is a list of my favorite songs you can find links to listen to those tracks down below in the description box a lot of fantastic songs in that list love those songs and that's pretty much it for this video transition what records did you like from this past month which songs which LPS did you absolutely love and go head over heels for tell me just tell me look into my eyes and tell me anthony Fantana music favorite records January forever 
QxDyXZpuTYQ,hi everyone amp tummy fan tango here the Internet's busiest music nerd and now it's time for a letter from a fan dear anthem my name is Tommy banglar and I've been watching your reviews for a very long time you're my favorite reviewer and sometimes me and my friends play bad review where we take turns giving new albums decent fives and then scream homophobic slurs at each other when we disagree there is so precious I know you just did classics week and it was great but you know the really big influential album you reviewed that week the one everyone likes well I don't like it at all I keep listening to it but I don't get it I've heard it 20 times and I just can't seem to enjoy it no matter how hard I try everyone at school makes fun of me my dad fails to acknowledge me as his son my mom wonders where she went wrong what do i do Anthony please help me like this album tommy banglar aka the & Co Oh hmm Tommy music is one of the most popular art forms there is and I think because of that the art form suffers from a lot of trendy BS that other art forms don't at least not to the same degree certain albums and certain artists might get all this acclaim and might get all this hype and and this can create some pressure to jump on the bandwagon and like whatever everybody else is liking but you're not going to like what's classic and what's popular all the time and that's because you're human this is okay this is not a big deal you should try to be as open as you possibly can to different genres especially the biggest ones out there but but but but but not enjoying specific albums in these genres is perfectly natural even if these albums do happen to be wildly popular just try to listen to the music understand why you don't like it understand why it might be popular and why it might appeal to other people so much and if it's a new LP that you're having a hard time enjoying then you know just don't try to force it let it hang just sort of wait until the album has a few years grown on to it and see if it becomes classic into the distant future and if that ends up being the case then try it at that point in time and maybe then it'll appeal to you there's always a chance that something might end up sounding better to you further much further down the road of life not like six months down the road of life not even like a year down the road of life and if other people can't understand that and still hate you for your musical preferences they're probably human garbage anyway transition listen to whatever you want to listen to like whatever you want to like don't feel like you have to like something if you don't enjoy something like I said just try to understand why you don't enjoy it and that's it liking music Anthony Fantan Oh Tommy banglar forever 
D5GI7_pGOJ0,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new young fathers LP dead before we get too deep into this album as I know a lot of you like to do you like to point out as soon as there's some kind of significant major change or alteration and anything that occurs in these videos on a regular basis and let's just get out of the way now yes couch' chesta is wearing a backwards baseball cap it's not a big deal who cares these guys are an eclectic hip-hop trio that hail from Scotland I first stumbled upon their sound in early 2012 just a few months after they dropped their debut mixtape EP album tape 1 that was released late 2011 on this tape African music reggae and lo-fi electronics all mixed together into this really soulful and gritty take on hip hop music they followed this release up with assigning to anti Cohn records they dropped the sequel to tape 1 tape 2 last year musically sonically it was really a continuation of a lot of what was going on with tape 1 except maybe the ballads on this tape or a little bit more beautiful soulful like the opener on this thing and there were more explosive tracks on here too like Queen is dead my only major issue with these tapes is that they were sort of brief I thought young fathers were we're writing really fantastically catchy songs but I also couldn't help but feel like they were sort of holding back in terms of the length of their overall projects holding back from something with just a bit more runtime and a lot more ambition I also suspected that coming out with music on anti Khan Records would mean that future releases would be a little bit more well recorded - and on this latest LP of there's young fathers pretty much show improvements on all of these fronts once the first looking from this LP dropped low I was incredibly excited to hear where young fathers would move next this song has got a beautiful intro really poetic lyrics great singing to meet young fathers is one of the best groups out there that makes hip hop music that also features this much good passionate soulful singing and once the beat to this track kicks in and old's it sounds more like a parade of drummers than it does any sort of traditional hip-hop beat that's produced on a laptop or a sampler and the vocal harmonies on this song and other songs on here too sound much more concise well put together really cleaned up nicely young fathers hit the nail on the head every time when it comes to this group singing or chanting that they do on their tracks there's loads of off-kilter and sort of quirky and noisy sense on this record too as well as weird colorful sound effects that hang in the background sort of a noisy ambience to either the drums or the vocals I feel like young fathers did a great job of advancing their sound improving it making it sound nicer while carrying over most of the characteristics from their previous tapes all of that being said why is it that I'm not in love with this album why is it not that I'm completely head over heels for it and because I'm not honestly for me it comes down to two things one the instrumentals on this LP are some of the most redundant and repetitive that young fathers have put together so far and some of the songs on this record I think are some of the most lackluster that they've put out to the instrumentals on this LP show very little change from the beginning to the end of the track the really quirky keyboards and primal drums that main tape one and tape two so great go really stale really quickly as they repeat the same phrases over and over and over and over across verses and choruses that don't really have that much contrast from one another this happens on numerous tracks paying I've arrived hangman just another bullet and even the song get up which is easily the catchiest track on this entire LP but even the really infectious chorus doesn't draw away from the fact that the rhythm section feels so redundant this is actually a difficult thing for me to come to terms with when listening to this record because this is the last thing that I thought I would feel while listening to the tracks on dead given that the recording quality on dead is better than that of the last two tapes I would only assume that it would be easier for young fathers to write more dynamic songs with very subtle lows of highs but it just doesn't happen there are plenty of tracks on this LP where the vocals feel particularly beautiful or intense like the screaming on the track paying or the really soulful singing on the song dip but instrumentally dead feels way too mid paced and too mild to be as exciting as anything young fathers have done so far I think the only visceral spot for me on this entire LP was the opening track no way with the hammering kick drums at the very end of the song and like I said before I do think there are some songs on here that are sort of lacking as well the song am I not your boy a beautiful tune really great ballad on here but a song that I think really could have done with a climax there's the song get up that I already mentioned that while it is the catchiest song on the entire LP maybe because the refrain is repeated so liberally but lyrically it's not really one of the more gripping songs that young fathers have have pulled together there's only one real track on here that I outright disliked and really let me down and that's mm-hmm a song that moves into really strange sonic territory with an abstract song structure and is really spacious and just does not end up engaging because of that you know majority of the songs on here aren't terrible but they just don't go that step further to really wow me there are some songs on here though where I really do love the lyrical imagery like on dip and no way and especially low did I see you planting seeds in the forest is it for the green or the dollars now don't go telling me it's for the needs of the poorest now I'm going to take a shit in your palace the imagery on the song war is really vivid as well and am I not your boy is a sort of interesting song that seems to be written with a mother in mind and it's sort of confessional in a way telling her that the boy that you once were is dead now many of the songs do have gripping nice characteristics and I think young fathers have maintained their personality over the course of making this album as well I mean there aren't any groups out there that I can really name that have a sound quite like young fathers but the biggest hindrance to this LP is that there's just not a lot of variation to these the better sound and the better singing on this LP do balance out what I don't like about it in a sense but really dead is a step down for me in terms of memorability and enjoyability I'm feeling a light to decent six on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why did you feel either and what should I review next young fathers dead forever 
7VTfz-V5JeA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new actress album ghetto ville this is the 4th full-length release from actress aka Darren Jai Cunningham a uk-based electronic music producer I enjoyed the really minimal stripped-down approach that he took to genres like house and techno on his earliest LPS but he sort of lost me a bit on his last full-length album r.i.p an LP that showed Darren's sound moving into some really abstract territory and stringing together a series of tracks that weren't exactly cohesive as an album to me and obviously having an album that was really uniform and style and sound was not the goal of this LP instead Darren seemed to focus a lot more on trying to explore as many sounds textures and moods as possible and there's nothing inherently wrong with a disjointed record but it's the track specifically that didn't end up grabbing me on this LP some of which I found to meander a little bit too much were maybe a little bit too skeletal just weren't putting out anything sonically that was gripping to me I think actresses scatterbrained approach ends up working out for him on this new record though it's sort of a strong change in feeling for me I mean after listening to this record I'm sort of seeing actress in more of the same light as artists like Autechre or Flying Lotus but to me they're only similar in the sense that they make electronic music that is rhythmically driven and is filled with relentless sonic experimentation and another thing that shocked me about this record is how instantaneous it was for me I know that there are a lot of weird ambient abstract challenging sounds on here but even after one listen to this thing I couldn't help but find it really dark moody and gratifying to me this record is simultaneously genre embracing and genre deform an album that shows its influences very obviously but takes that manipulates them twists them into something where it's difficult to tell where something is coming from where something is going away it's cool to see this dude take something as simple as the parameters of house music and break them down and build them back up with dusty drumbeats and textures that remind me of things like asphalt concrete moonlit nights cold hard steel some of the tracks hear loud they're hard-hitting they have strong grooves others are a little bit more ambient and style but still feature some really strange and vivid sounds that that have a really strong sense of place each one of the 16 tracks on this LP has their own unique personality that I could go into pretty deep detail describing it all together these songs spans 70 minutes the song bird cage has this insanely stiff loud and robotic hi-hat kick drum pattern there's a breathy vocal sample on this track some deep bass and I love the sharp sounds of the drums on this track and the track switches back and forth between these robotic drum beats and these drum fills that seem a little foreign with these cheery woodwinds synth leads dancing on top of them I love hearing these really lively pieces of percussion mixed with just this hard-nosed techno beat the opener on this LP also a song that I love incredibly slow a beat that really lurks it's heavy with bass and there's all these stretched out fizzling ride cymbals that play on top of it - there's some icy scents on this track some metallic chimes that just ring out eerily it's a great atmosphere to kick this record off with but it does require some patience because it is a long track it is a track that doesn't exactly come out and bite you I'm sure this song is going to scare away as many people as it pulls in there's another track on here that I love that also hits a super slow stride the song contagious the beat on this song it sounds like a train a coal engine train from Hell just pulling out of the station to bring its passengers to a lifetime of Tom ends and after a lifetime and the really muffled deep slow vocal cuts on this track lead me to believe that these rhythms might just be a part of some larger sample from somewhere else taking what could potentially be just sort of a sexy slow jam and playing at this slow is kind of vaporwave but to me actress takes it one step further by surrounding this track with some really ominous rhythms and synthesizers where actresses take on this sort of budding genre gets a little old as on the song rap where to me the song doesn't feel much more like just a sample of a song sort of played and looped and chopped and whatnot actress does a good job of catching that vaporwave vibe but the song is a little underwhelming on the detail side there's some tracks on this LP that have a gentler side of sorts like the track hour which with these really light light rhythms and these just sparkling thumb piano melodies I'm reminded a bit of people like Pantha new prints or bonobo or the song time which while it isn't really a heavy track it is an incredibly eerie song with a very sour drone hanging in the background with some very tense high hats playing in the foreground there's some odd synthesizer keys that play on this track too and longer this song goes the more frightening it is and some of the tracks on this LP display a somewhat goofier side of actress as well like the song corner which is a bit of slow paced synthesizer funk with these melodic leads that are played so awkwardly over this groove it's kind of hilarious and they're really just overbearing heavy bassline is really what makes this track and the song rims - with these sort of weird upward and downward sliding lead melodies on the track it sounds a little silly it's got these gurgling bass lines as well and I do like the track even if it is less impressive than a lot of the other songs on here my favorite tracks on this LP is where actors might approach just a really simple house 4/4 rhythm with a pretty experimental flare like the really murky track front line where it seems like he tries to strip back as much treble as possible with some pretty nice bass lines on this song - and then there's skyline which is incredibly minimal it's glitchy and there are some weird metallic drones hanging in the background of this track - and I love gays which is maybe the most accessible melodic and celebratory track on this entire album really great undeniable beat with some incredibly bright sense and there are also songs on here that of course contrast this brightness this upbeat attitude in a great way like the song Street Corp which is so robotic with its off-kilter rhythm that it feels like I'm listening to some kind of machine whose job it is to just crank away on some assembly line day-in and day-out the track seems so simple in concept but to me it it says a lot I love a majority of the tracks on this album even if overall the LP is a little scatterbrained and you know at the end of the day this is a record that perfectly reflects its cover art in that it feels sort of like a musical sketchbook something I think the album r.i.p was as well but that album was masquerading as something that was a little bit more refined and was a little bit too reserved because of that get oval nose it's a personal indulgence it does not hide that and it ends up bolder and more intimate because of that even if some of the bridges on this LP lead to nowhere even if there are some tracks on here that do feel a little redundant or inconsequential overall I ended up loving the experience I had with this pretty jarring set of tracks I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think as your review knows and that's it Anthony Fantana actress get oval forever

NRYIEL8sSdE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm going to review the new have a nice life record the unnatural world have a nice life is a Connecticut basic music duo featuring Dan Barrett and Timucua they have been active on and off since 2000 and their music has earned this incredibly passionate cult following that's slowly been growing since 2008 that's when the duo dropped their 85-minute powerhouse of a double album death consciousness it is not a record that made a huge splash initially but it is still a sonic Titan that thinks nothing of violently slashing apart drone noise post-punk industrial rock and shoegaze and then reassembling them into an uncompromising lead Ark set of songs with pretty tongue-in-cheek song titles a quick one before the eternal worm devours Connecticut waiting for black metal records to come in the mail to me track titles like this are a bit of an emotional defense mechanism of sorts after exercising songs that have so many legitimately tortured moments in them I imagine that the first thing you want to do is kind of shrug it off but even though Dan and Tim moved on past this record artistically through other collaborative projects and bands and solo efforts it is death consciousness that has continued to be their most popular record to date I can only imagine following this record up could be a really daunting task could be really intense but at least for me personally the pressure isn't so immense considering that I've been tuning into a lot of these other projects that the Dan and Tim have been involved in and to me a lot of these projects carry a lot of similarities to have a nice life the darkness the lo-fi recordings the dissonance and plus there's all the bands that Dan supports through his record label enemies list home recordings and even though he doesn't involve himself in any of these projects I believe artistically a lot of the bands that he puts out sort of seemed to be musical kindred spirits in a way abusing noise and reverb and genre boundaries and their releases as well and that joyous tradition continues on to this new have a nice life record as well an LP that is noticeably shorter than its predecessor about 40 minutes shorter which is a bit of a disappointment at first glance but I do think Dan and Tim have pulled together a sonically mature record with the unnatural world putting out some of their most vivid and dismal sounds yet the songs on this record have a loud booming depressive impact yet so many of the details are smudged obscured and purposefully hidden by loads of effects and really weird mixing practices think the microphones Mount Erie record but with a goth rock obsession and way less disregard for readability for me this is lo-fi indie rock that was written for the end of the world and has the oppressive volume of a doom metal record and this heaviness swallows the songs that have a nice life creates it's like they're trying to drown out their own self created musical apocalypse if there's anything that's sort of a positive of the unnatural world just being about 48 minutes it is that it makes have a nice life a little more digestible this time around and I feel like this record is more focused as well the songs here tend to range from really noisy post-punk barnburners to incredibly droney ballads and I think have a nice life has success on both sides of the spectrum one of my favorite hard-hitting tracks off of this LP defenestration song as this driving distorted bass line cavernous drums and just a really thick cocoon of tones and noises surrounding all of it the vocals are tucked away in this haze of sound but it makes the melodies that they're singing no less catchy and their passion still rings through as well as you're getting these really fiery screams and shouts coming out of the background I just love the growing sea of dissonance on this track as it progresses I really dig the track dan and Tim reunited by fate as well the song is cut from the same dismal post-punk cloth and has this bassline that doesn't feel like it would be out of place in some kind of 90s alternative rock tune the track starts off with a great groove but in Stanly the song is smothered in this really warped wall of tones that I just cannot describe is it synthesizers is it guitars I have really no idea all I know is that the explosion of this sound is so just sudden that it feels like being plunged into a frigid pool of water I love the dismal guitar interlude in the second half of this track and the song slowly just depletes in sound and just sort of gives up on itself by the end not in a disappointing way but in a way that sort of reflects the depression that is so palpable in most of these tracks then there's the track unholy life another more upbeat hard-hitting rhythmic song on this album but one of the most emotionally neutral tracks as well with this sort of strung out twangy guitar line that kicks the track off that sounds somewhat like a Beach fossil song I think the only thing keeping this track from being a Beach fossil song is how it grows so noisy and dissonant as it moves along a lot like the track defenestration song which to me is so Joy Division so Bauhaus but to me that track is long enough the melody is catchy enough for me to just okay this is a this is a unique atmosphere this is an interesting song unholy life however is just way too short of breath for me to be impressed with it as its own sort of composition it feels like a bit of a cliffhanger to me and unfortunately there are other songs on here that do give us somewhat similar vibe as well songs that build things to a really impressive crescendo or have a great sound but sort of fizzle out into a really unimpressive close for one the track burial Society which I love up until the mid point where we're getting all these falsetto which really take me out of the mood of the song unfortunately and after these vocals come and leave the songs coast downward is is pretty underwhelming and the track music will on tune the sky to some really beautiful droning guitars on this track with some soaring vocals over them and it's it's really a blissful moment on this album that is a bit of a breath of fresh air from all the darkness I love the guitar tone I love the ringing bells on this track but I wish it went more places compositionally there were tracks that I really did love on the drone e'er side of this record though like Guggenheim Wax Museum the intro of this album and the last song to Guggenheim is one of the most powerful crescendos on this entire album I love the blaring guitar solo toward the finish - and the song works really effectively as an introduction to this LP as well and glides into the next song very nicely and the closing track on here really one of the most dynamic songs on this entire album the longest song on this entire album - takes its time growing a mood growing the drone building the tension it really puts me into an emotional state before it floats away into the abyss assist and I've got to mention the song corpsey as well another track that does a great job of taking its time to set a mood starts things off with some really depressing vocal cuts of an interview with a child who was living at Pennhurst asylum and sort of talking about why he was being punished there and whether or not he liked it there and so on and so forth and I love the guitar riffs on this track and how they switch back and forth between this loud and louder sounds I just wish a natural world dabbled in dynamic tracks like this just a little bit more still despite that complaint I did end up loving a majority of the tracks on here but part of me does wish that there was a massive timespan to this record to match the massive sounds and massive emotions I do have some love for this LPM feeling a strong 7 to like 8 on this record transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next man for the love of for the love of God have a nice life the unnatural world forever 
jVQJa_aVypc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new an autumn for crippled children review try not to destroy everything you love this is the 4th full-length LP that hails from an experimental metal outfit that hails from the Netherlands they've been dropping a new album every year since 2010 this band started as a really depressive black metal outfit with a super noisy and claustrophobic recording and even though that recording style has stuck with them on each new release that hasn't really stopped them from experimenting with sound and additional instrumentation like strings and scents the strings played an especially big role on their last full-length LP and I think these guys have grown compositionally as well writing songs that are a lot less dismal this record is pretty rich with melody melodies that are triumphant occasionally or even pretty and sweet on the ear despite the recording in the end the vocals on top of this instrumentation being so harsh typically I don't really mind the grading harsh wretched black metal vocal style but I do wish the singing brought some more variety to the table on this record and I wish it wasn't so buried in the mix on numerous songs here too but still how claustrophobic the recording on this record is it brings a bit of a unique challenge it's interesting to see how Magnum of an opus the band can pack into such a tiny space with guitars and drums and vocals and strings and since all clashing against one another violently however it's not like the mix or the way this recording was assembled is messy the band makes room for essential sounds when they need to like the wispy string melodies that pop in on the song never complete as soon as those introduce themselves it seems that everything else is absolutely quiet so that you can hear the theme melody that they are introducing and even though the sound of this track is really low Phi it doesn't stop this musical moment from feeling so huge and cinematic it's like watching autumn leaves fall dramatically in slow motion as someone who you've loved so much for a good chunk of your life is walking away into the distance some tracks here features some really innocent chiming piano chords that kicks the song off and and really sets a fragile tone like on the song sepia mountains for her lament these pianos play through the introduction until basically a wall of guitars comes down and crushes them after which the band moves through all these slow fuzzy guitars and I think with how beautiful and delicate and grainy some of the sounds are on this record a lot of people are going to hear what's going on with this LP and compare instantly to the latest LPS from deafheaven or I'll say and I do think these albums have common ground I think they could share common fans but I also think that an autumn for crippled children finds a way to make themselves stick out in this lighter shade of black metal we've been seeing lately why a lot of tracks on this LP deliver some epic builds that that tug at the heartstrings not a single song on this album goes over the six-minute mark over all the songs on this release are pretty straightforward direct and to-the-point and these guys pack just about as much detail into their songs as the other two artists I just mentioned but they stick so passionately to that Lofa aesthetic and I think this band actually experiments a little bit more with genre then it would seem simply on the surface of these tracks - for example with a really strong icy sense in the driving bass and drum groove on the opening track here the only thing that is stopping the song from being a post-punk track are the vocals there are a lot of moments on this LP though that drink from that black gaze Punchbowl as well really thick walls of instrumentation swirling into itself really dreamy harsh but seductive and the band manages to build the tension really high with guitars strings keyboards and drums just playing more and more intensely as the track moves along songs like the woods are on fire and never complete and these tracks feature some really memorable melodies - however I do get let down a little bit by some of the songs here when I feel like the track maybe cycling through sort of a stereotypical post-rock build or chord progression with a lot of blobby syrupy instrumentation that feels a little formless it's a bit like a build that go to nowhere it's a bill that loses its flavor about halfway up the escalation issues like this create a bit of a dry spell in the middle of the LP for me but the album does pick up again with song closer the song that features these slowly ascending guitar leads that are tremolo picked going up and up against these thunderous drum beats eventually these harmonized whaling guitars sort of scream into the mix and create a really nice change of pace and even though I like tracks like this that are constantly moving upward and onward I do wish there were some more songs here that were just more direct and visceral and aggressive and immediate like the opening track on here I can't help but feel like on the whole this album is just one bill that leads to another bill that leads to another bill which isn't necessarily a bad thing especially if the instrumentation is played well I mean after all that deafheaven record that came out recently does sort of seem to thrive off of that formula as well but with the builds and the instrumentation being raised so high on this record right here and the low-fiber cording just crushing it to such a low it does dampen a little bit of the excitement of the potential excitement all too often I think the the haziness of the recordings on this LP leave some of these songs feeling just a little too Sammy Sammy even if the sound is very appealing to an extent even if a lot of the melodies on this thing are really catchy I dug this record a lot I do think these guys could be a band to watch as far as this musical style goes I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next the heat forever

qckTUjyzNPg,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Indian album from all purity Annie what's going on with your tip over there here it's not a big deal it's just hair well it's on your head too we're we're we're Indian is a metal outfit from Chicago this is their fifth full-length LP their second for relapse records I first heard of these guys back in 2011 through their previous full-length LP guiltless and album that showed a huge jump in recording quality from Indians old stuff and their newer stuff the band took their already booming and abrasive sound and made it heavier and more hard-hitting and this larger grander scope in fidelity also allowed them to experiment more with melody and noise too now anything in Indian songs that might be the least bit catchy or accessible is only ever a side dish too brittle harsh guitar distortion that's melted in with the bass guitar which is incredibly heavy and these two instruments are fused together to the point where the guitars just create this pummeling white noise wall of sound a lot of Indians tracks have some really primal drums wretched black metal influenced vocals that are very throaty and disgusting yeah and all of these things are played at a tick or two slower than they were on Indians previous LPS the band really sought out to create this harsh overbearing atmosphere that slowly scratches away at what little hope you have left for the world and it works the most notable change in pace on this record in terms of Indians sound is their use of noise a lot of tracks here make use of additional effects and just ear piercing sounds making the six tracks here incredibly unpleasant to listen to and I definitely would not call Indians previous records easy-listening and they are one of those bands that slowly fine Tunes their own record to record but if there is any one element that you can pull out of this album and say whoa this is where they're headed it is with just a noise torch held high even the track clarify on this record is this four minute and 30 second noise interlude with all of these harsh tones and pieces of distortion and just dissonance creating this putrid landscape while vocals are thrown on top it's very hellish and as vile and as disgusting and as unsettling as some of the tracks are on here they reach this level of nastiness that is kind of inspiring like on the track directional which behind the very huge monolithic riffs that play in the foreground there are walls of distortion and feedback screaming away in the background and as the track progresses some of this noise hanging back there gets kind of glitchy and keep in mind the riff that is playing in the foreground it does not change up in a significant way as the track progresses this is a very mind-numbing soul-crushing song there are slight changes of pace from track to track like on the song the impetus bleeds which is easily the most melodic song in this entire LP a bit of doom metal with some very sad mournful guitar leads it reminds me a little bit of that pallbearer album that dropped a few years back and even though the song is incredibly harsh I do think the very sad sad guitar playing and chord progressions on this track do make it a little more digestible and then there's the track rhetoric of no which is easily the most visceral exciting hard-hitting song in this entire LP you really picks up the pace in the tempo a little bit and deliver some riffs that really you can Bob your head to but with how aggressively this song starts it should be no surprise that the ending of this song is one of the most ear-splitting moments on this entire album and then there's the finale on here disambiguation a track that I wish lasted a little bit longer I wish didn't cut off so abruptly the album overall is 40 minutes long and with something that really kind of tries to draw your lifeforce away from you very slowly I do wish it was shit but she added ten minutes of soul-sucking misery either way this is one of the most extreme tracks on this entire LP with the song the riffs the noise getting louder and harsher and just ooh just every bar that passes by the song just incrementally gets more and more and more the riffs just get heavier and heavier there's some black metal style melodies that sort of introduced themselves in the second half of this song - I like that on this song and some others here too like the opener as well Indian does manage to take some of these very very harsh songs and just raise the heat on them so slowly that you don't even realize it's happening unless you compare the end of one song to the beginning of one song and while that doesn't sound all that pleasurable in theory and I'm not promising that everybody is going to like what Indian has to offer on this record it does create a certain emotional or auditory sensation that I find to be very powerful very disturbing in a way overall what Indian does on this record is take doom metal fuse it with Noise music for an incredibly hideous set of songs what I'm hearing on this record really reminds me of the music of bands like I hate God but push to a more dismal and grating extreme and while a lot of the sounds on this record do make me wince I simultaneously have a bit of a morbid infatuation with what goes on with this record as well I do think some people will have issues with this record seeing it as being redundant or kind of OneNote and that's fine there are no rays of sunshine that peaked through the clouds but personally I wish there was a bit more diversity on this thing a bit more experimentation maybe Indian could let go of some of their metal roots and sort of dive more wholeheartedly into Noise music or see what space could actually do you know sort of leaving moments of quiet in the midst of their very hard-hitting songs and see what that does for making for a very jarring auditory experience because they were seeking to do anything it was that something jarring I am feeling a light to decent 8 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Indian forever 
IUd5YFoXCl8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mogwai LP rave tapes these guys are a famed instrumental rock band this is their eighth studio full-length LP an album that I was anticipating even though I forgot to put it on my anticipated albums of 2014 list but I was anticipating this LP because I did enjoy the band's last full-length LP so much hardcore will never die but you will Mogwai his music for the most part has always been herded into the post rock genre a mostly instrumental brand very dramatic rock music they are also considered to be one of the originators of the genre however the band never really felt the need to stick to the confines the borders of this genre that were sort of set in stone after they put out such defining albums like young team and happy songs were happy people and come on die young the band's drive to experiment has always kept their next album interesting but I haven't always been in love with every release that Mogwai has put out and recently what seems to be the direction of Mogwai sound as they've been stepping away from some of the drawn-out builds and really heavy loud crescendos that they're most known for simplifying their tracks making them a lot more direct straightforward and to the point like on the 2008 LP the hawk is howling however I don't really think Mogwai succeeded in this direction until they came out with hardcore will never die however this particular LP also saw the band bringing another change into the fold as well and that is electronics and since things that are definitely not strangers and MOG wise music but the emphasis on these things felt so much larger on this LP especially with some of the tracks on here that felt almost crapped rock influenced and to me rave tapes is just another part of this ongoing transition and even though Mogwai is still definitely making rock music the synthesizers seem to be what really gives this album direction especially on the first few tracks here even though there are some very prominent since in the mix on a lot of these songs though I wouldn't really say that Mogwai is coming from a different place compositionally on this record they're still at this point in their career where they are writing these rock tunes that they are too loud to be ambient they're too allowed to just be background music however they move it's such a slow glacial pace I would never call them exciting or explosive the music here are slow it's it's repetitive and maybe that is going to cause some people to tune out understandably but I also think these tracks in a way are hypnotic they are seductive plus I do think these songs have a strong sense of emotion too I can really feel moods coming from these tracks that are beautiful epic uplifting or even bleak and dismal and depressing and even though I do feel these moods coming from these tracks they can be a little ambiguous to some of these songs feeling like a mix of all of these feelings all these emotions just brought together into these very very patient songs that to me are just like this very aggressive tranquility like the opening track on here heard about you last night a song that has these delayed chime synthesizers that ring out really beautifully in these gently wailing guitars soaring over some very slowly moving bass and drum grooves it's legitimately relaxing music however it's not terribly memorable and I think the obvious reaction to this song and a lot of songs on here is well why don't they play faster why isn't the play more lively why isn't it louder why isn't it just more and while I do feel that way to an extent I also don't want Mogwai to abandon their very clear relaxation mission because I do think they're on the cusp of making music that is very gentle on the ears is very soft but is also engaging and incredibly enjoyable even though every song on here isn't exactly Wow I do think that Mogwai does bring some variety to the table the song SIMON ferocious is one of the noisier tracks on here faintly psychedelic with its wailing wall of guitars and the song features these really rough saw tone bass sense as well that sort of buzz and gurgle their way through the track and the closing track on here which has vocoder vocals on it also something Mogwai has done before but this track does feel a little refreshing in that it is the most electronic song in this entire album some of the drums in the background feel like they're synthetically generated and the since really take the wheel on this track to songs like this ride the border between blissful and mundane so hard that it actually blurs the lines between the both of them a little bit and even though I really admire what songs like this are aiming for the tracks on here that are going for something completely different are the ones that I admire and remember the most like the song reamer dird which feels like something that could come out of a progressive synthesizer rock album soundtrack for some sort of sci-fi film from decades ago if you're into the music of goblin or zombie I could definitely see you enjoying this track and then there's the song MasterCard which has these really sharp shrill rhythm guitars that grab my attention right from the start it's got a great groove and for a song this slow there's a lot of force to it there's a lot of power to it it takes me back to Mogwai albums like mr. beast the only major letdown for me on this LP was the song repeal --is-- a very moody instrumental rock song with this vocal snippet of a guy talking about subliminal satanic messages in Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven which in concept sounds like a very epic idea but when this guy talks it feels like he's giving an oral report in front of his classmates at some Catholic school that he's enrolled in overall I think rave tapes is a decent release for Mogwai not quite as underwhelming as the hawk is howling but nowhere near one of my favorites of theirs I admire what they're doing with the sense and the electronics on this LP but I do think some of the songwriting is a little lackluster forgettable the fact that a lot of the songs on this LP are so reserved does sort of make it a mood album and it's not like mood albums don't already exist in mod wise discography however for an LP that is so driven by emotion I don't find it to be particularly moving and that's all I'm feeling a light a decent six on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Mogwai forever 
0ZA29cQNoQc,mmm hi everyone Anthony Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new against me LP trans gender dysphoria blues this is the latest full-length LP from Florida rock band against me a group who rocked me to my core when I was in college with records like reinventing Axl Rose and their acoustic EP and disco before the breakdown and crime a lot of these records featured a blend of folk music punk music a narco politics delivered with incredibly passionate vocals and poetic lyrics and even though against me had some really rough recordings in the early years once the year 2000 2001 2002 came around they hit this musical stride that was incredibly captivating to people who were still searching for a counterculture message in contemporary music the music here felt Punk it felt rebellious it felt like it was standing for something without sounding like just another 80s hardcore knockoff and of course it also helped that the songs on these records were really well written they were incredibly catchy lyrically they dealt with the world at large but they were also very personal as well talking about things like love or lack of confidence or personal anguish there were also a lot of songs that dealt with spinning in the face of longtime rock cliches against mieze music at this point in their career was really large in scope really ambitious but also sort of down-to-earth and relatable and the recordings even though they were raw the performances were very intense it was hard not to get just wrapped up in what the band was playing in the moment records like these made me feel like the world was going to hell in a handbasket really quickly but at least we were going to be singing a really fun loud chorus along the way then after reinventing Axl Rose I believed wholeheartedly that against me was going to go on to do something really bold and genre defying in the near future but I couldn't help but feel like I got the bait-and-switch routine on the band's next record as the eternal cowboy on this record against me moved on to the fad Records label and in the process they sort of took on the typically pop punky production sound that many bands on that label had against me sound was definitely a little cleaner it was louder it was punchier on this record but I couldn't help but feel like their raw sound and their folk influences were sort of being erased in the process now don't get me wrong the songs on this LP still have really clever politically charged lyrics and the tunes are really catchy and this is what made eternal cowboy enjoyable but against me made the path they were going to be moving into on their future albums really clear now on against meas next three studio LPS they continue to gain fans they actually moved on to a larger label with sire records however I personally was feeling that the sound of their instrumentation was just growing more and more tame that wild spark that was in many of the Bands early recordings was just vanishing completely and against me was sort of sounding just as overproduced as any kind of commercial radio friendly rock band just with more obvious Punk influences but there have been some significant changes going on in against me as music that has caused a lot of people to pay attention to the band once again for one the band's longtime drummer Warren Oakes decided to leave the group two against me has actually recently dropped a lot of demo and b-side albums based upon earlier releases of theirs and the founder of the band and once frontman Tom gable came out as a transsexual woman and admitted to having dealt with gender dysphoria since childhood and changed her name to Laura Jane grace now considering that Laura's songs have always been the foundation of against meas music and these songs tend to be so personal it's no surprise that publicly admitting something like being a transsexual woman would stir up interest and against meas next album without a doubt fans were expecting Laura to kind of give them a front row seat to whatever she was feeling during this transition or address all the social issues that come up during a gender identity crisis and even I was interested in hearing what would happen if Laura marched bravely into these subject matters especially once the title of this new against me LP came out trans gender dysphoria blues obviously this LP was not going to be tiptoeing around transgender topics but that is also now what every song on this record is about so trans gender dysphoria blues might not be the shocking tell-all album that a lot of people might have been expecting and even those songs on this thing like the title track are great she tunes I wouldn't say they bring much insight to the life that Laura may be leading now it's a pretty simple straightforward rock song about being judged by others on sight being spotted as a man despite dressing like and feeling you are a woman but the thing is most new against me songs don't really delve that deeply into the politics and the issues that they deal with anyway the language is typically pretty simple its poetic its personal it's not like there's any kind of solution hidden in the lyrics here I mean if you're a person who is sympathetic toward LGBT issues then what you're going to get on this record are a bunch of rowdy rock songs that affirm your already established feelings you can Bob your head to the music and nod your head to the message and this is not necessarily a bad thing I like to listen to songs that I agree with ideologically and tracks on here like the title track and my life 666 and true trans soul rebel are my favorites my issue with this record sits on against me not really making music that I find to be stimulating anymore the band's recordings their instrumentation and their melody seemed so tame in comparison to their early stuff and just about any other rock band I would rather listen to for example the song unconditional love it is obnoxiously sugary in the same way that a Green Day song is and the wordy lyrics barely barely hold the rhythm against this incredibly stiff set of drums and guitars I can barely stand this song and the same thing with the track dead friend - it seems like the subject matter of this track would be something that would affect Laura very deeply emotionally however the vocal delivery and the instrumentation the guitars the drums here just seems so inappropriate with the way the instrumentation sounds on this song it feels like I could swap the lyrics out for a story about a cute girl at a coffee shop and it wouldn't really be that unfitting and the song two coffins another track that I can't stand an acoustic ballad that should really see Laura letting loose but unfortunately it feels just as rigid as any of the louder rock songs on here the track just feels like from beginning to end Laura is trying to squeeze emotions out of this incredibly dry lifeless instrumentation even the loudest most hard-hitting song in this entire LP drinking with the jocks has its aggressive limitations the only tracks that actually overcome these production issues are the ones where the songs the tunes are so catchy and well written that they're impossible to deny like the tracks that I mentioned that we're my favorites and the closer on here black me out one of the most legitimately moving songs on this entire album even without diving too deeply into the lyrics Laura's vocal delivery on this track is just so impassioned it's a very beautiful change of pace trans gender dysphoria blues the recording is really clear some of the tunes on here are memorable the lyrics here have direction and they focus on valid topics and I think in a sense musically this record does have variety too it has ballads it has more aggressive tracks it even has moments on here like Obama bin Laden as the crucified Christ which instrumentally feels a lot like a 90s alternative rock radio tune all these things are not bad things and they are things that have also been qualities of against meas past several albums - what continues to be missing and against meas music and in a way is more missing than ever on this new record are legitimately overpowering emotions instrumentation guitars and drums that are actually hard-hitting and exciting and visceral I think this record lyrically makes a lot of good points but musically it's tame it's too tame for me to enjoy really I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given this hare listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should hare next and that's it Anthony Fantana against me hair forever 
I_UR-FF5h2I,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new silver mount zion record fuck off get free we pour light on everything these guys are a montreal rock outfit known for their connections to the seminal post rock band Godspeed you black Emperor their connections but there are also differences for one the abandoned bites singing and lyrics on to its records much to the disappointment of some hardcore godspeed fans who aren't really that into the singing of frontman ephraim menak whose voice is a bit of an acquired taste however i wouldn't say these changes are so great that it would keep a post rock fan from enjoying silver mountains ions first two records at least early on in the band's music they were sort of emphasizing the more orchestral side of their sound the more instrumental side of their sound but since then with each new release they have been evolving into more of a rock music style and even though guitars and drums have been more of a loud heavy driving force on silver mountains ions past few records this new one of theirs fuck off get free is definitely the most fully realized and developed so far in terms of this heavier more aggressive sound the band sound on this record is super heavy distorted guitars piled on top of one another to the point where the first track on here sort of develops this overwhelming fuzziness warmth it becomes kind of psychedelic too as these string sections are swimming through this sea of guitars and the instruments on this track the blare so loudly it's impossible for this song not to be loud even when you turn it down you could shut the door but it's still going to sound like bombs shells are dropping outside the last third of this track even introduces these slow booming guitar riffs that feel slightly akin to do metal and in this more chaotic stage in silver mountain Zion sound on this record ephram's vocals don't sound half-bad i'm not saying his singing has gotten way better but I think his vocals are a bit more digestible sitting on this bonfire of burning guitars and bowed strings now given that this band is godspeed related and some of the LPS that have come out previously from silver mound Zion you might listen to this track expecting something that is a bit more subtle or dynamic or refined but the band actually puts their all into just creating this Hulk of a track I can't wrap my ears around it I can't wrap my arms around it it just rolls so slowly bulldozes everything in its way passionately I love the group vocals on this track the eerie melodies the dramatic string sections that introduce themselves in the last three minutes and the finisher of this track too is pretty chilling I think the singing some of the group vocals are a little overbearing and somewhat goofy occasionally but this is a great start to this LP and to me the album just gets better from here austerity blues a song that tempo wise is really mid paced but one of the more aggressively performed on this album it really sounds like the band is jamming on these riffs that they've written instrumentally the band takes pretty much that same all heavy all powerful approach really direct really explosive but the band still manages to incorporate elements that make the song feel detailed cinematic really vivid and even when the track really picks up and gets loud as hell the band manages to make things even louder and more intense as they introduce some group vocals into the mixture like the eight-minute mark this really raises the energy level the refrain that they're singing is incredibly impassioned and like many explosive moments on godspeed and silver Mount Zion records sometimes the aftermath is just as moving with just everything simultaneously coasting down the guitars fading away the strings and the vocals kind of driving the track home here the strings and the drums are so sparse the vocals feel so weary the band continues down this really immediate path on the next track to take away these early grave blues and even though silver Mount Zion had tracks on their previous record that landed around in this six or seven minute mark this is easily one of the most volatile tracks that they've put out within that time frame again the guitars are blaring the bass grooves are so steady on this thing and sound like they came out of a bad acid trip and the lyrics here don't words either and are delivered with very unpleasant shouting take away these take away these take away these early grain blues as far as a lyrical structure the song does take a lot of influence from blues but I don't see a lot of connections being drawn to that genre outside of that and the title because a lot of the melodies the string melodies that pop up in between these verses feel almost middle-eastern in a sense and the song grows more dissonant and chaotic as it continues with all these malformed strings and sour notes floating within this wall of sound it's just a really rebellious and immense song the melodies on this LP take a more sad yet uplifting and tender direction on the track what we loved was not enough still a very heavy song but emotionally potent as well a track with what I assume is a 3/4 time signature it's it's kind of like the waltz to end all waltzes the song features all these really teary-eyed string sections vocals that just Yelp out these frightening Lee morbid lyrics that are sort of carried by the phrase the day has come where we no longer feel there will be war in our cities there will be riots at the mall blood on our doorsteps and panics at the ball all our city's going to burn all our bridges going to snap all our pennies going to rot lightning roll across the tracks all our children going to die it's a cataclysmic track that the more I listen to it the more it just grabs me and just shakes me emotionally obviously and the only slight letdown of this entire LP is the closing song which I do think is slightly underwhelming short of breath it feels more like an epilogue honestly if this song had just been erased the last track would have been a somewhat fitting closer but I do think that this song is added on to add on to the themes of this album that have to do with end times people dying in their younger years early graves premature death dying before you even reach the point of adulthood this may have to do with the fact that this song in the title says it's a tribute to Capital steez with all the refrains mentioning children dying on the previous track and the early great blues on this record this does seem to be a recurring theme on fuck off gift free and even though I think that a lot of the lyrics on this record are incredibly flowery there is something that is really moving about how blunt and direct Silver Mount Zion is with its messages I was hoping for a little bit more from the ending here but I guess in a way and I'm just sort of interpreting this on a personal level it does bring home the idea that when the ending comes it's not necessarily something that holds your hand it doesn't necessarily give you an explicit warning it arrives when it feels like it much to our surprise despite that we may be making our own beds hmm I'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this record transition if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana silver Mount Zion fuck off get free forever 
ABwB6CEJM-c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and in this video I'm asking can you overthink music as a lot of you know on this channel I'm kind of obsessed with music and it's sort of my job to talk about it and review it on a regular basis but because of that can I or can you as someone who watches this channel overthink music should we not take it so seriously is it just entertainment because there are tons of scientific studies out there that explore the impact that music has on the mind the link between neuroscience and music so because of things like this is it worth thinking more in depth about the things we put in our ears to talk about this I've invited Hannah m'kay and DDOT respect to youtubers who are just as musically obsessed we talk about music on their respective channels I have linked down there in the description box to them you can watch them subscribe to them and I've put some information down there that you might find interesting as well if you are stimulated by this topic transition okay so now we're here magic of the Internet webcams all that considering that the three of us all talk about music on YouTube on a regular basis I could only assume that music has impacted our lives in some kind of significant way and maybe because of that we tend to take it really serious and you know we get some kind of emotional or mental depth from it but you know the does that cause us to overthink it sometimes when it comes to overthinking music to be honest I only overthink when I'm reviewing music but then when it comes to how powerful it is in society or in the music world that's kind of something that flies over my head so I don't know how you guys feel about how powerful music is in society how what kind of effects it has on people you know I think is content creators what we tend to do is we sort of have to overanalyze of the music in order to find interesting perspectives on it and I think in the course of that what happens is maybe we um we accentuate and we magnify certain points too much and maybe the cultural impact that the music has on society isn't is great but I guess maybe in our minds we want to make it out to be that way sort of I think um I mean like you take for example uh just just the whole thug rapper just gangster the gangster movement uh if I review an artist like say achieve keep for something like that and I find something very uh analytical to say about his music most people just say well chief keeps music isn't meant to be this whole heady thing it's just meant to be enjoyed you know so that because I'm a content creator it's it's sort of an internet thing where I'm just thinking of music just as headphone music really instead of just uh really what it should be is just club music that shouldn't be that I shouldn't be overthinking you know there's music out there that obviously the three of us get a lot of emotional depth from we get a lot of mental depth from we feel like we can read into the production read into the lyrics and read into a lot of things about it and sort of interpret these various things in different ways and you know they sort of gain meaning for us you know even if it's just some kind of personal significance but obviously I'm sure the three of us also have definitions of music that we would think deeply about and we wouldn't think deeply about I'll tell you this um with regard to Kendrick Lamar where the over analyzation can can just can hurt us is a song for example swimming pools and when swimming pools came out and I just heard a bunch of people saying that this is a deep and introspective look at the downfalls of alcohol and orange and and I don't think that the song was intended to be anything close to that and I don't know if Kendrick himself is uh you know commented about it maybe there's a rap genius annotation out there that maybe I could look at you say you don't believe that swimming pools was about alcohol I personally believe it was but someone else would say so what would you say your explanations I don't say oh what go on no I know it's obviously about obviously about drinking but but I just mean that um I just mean in the sense that that people say like it's it's a deep and introspective yeah it's deep inner I mean obviously with the lyrics in what he's saying uh I mean that but I think that goes into the artist there and maybe we're making it out to be more than what it is because he's came to me because he's Kendrick Lamar yeah I get that way so would you say the interpretation of music or interpretation of the song has a lot to do with who the song is coming from um I think it definitely does because people per protects you know yeah arm is coming from is so heavily dependent on I mean it has has everything to do with the context we sort of agree that there is music that maybe you shouldn't analyze so deeply and you know it sort of meant just simply for entertainment but is you're a way that you could sort of reconcile these differences and sort of have artists of two different flavors like on your top ten list and say you know what this person isn't saying anything deep per se but I think album is fantastic anyway yeah I would say definitely I'm in my top was it 15 mixtapes I had ty dolla sign in one of my top 15 mixtapes video and to me my joy to people I've spoken to ty dolla sign it's not the kind of person who's taken very seriously and content and music wise but to me he just makes good music which is good to listen to so I think I can put I can put the really good and really deep mixtape with the kind of fun and party mixtape in my top 15 and I just couldn't over analyze his lyrics it was just a matter of you know audio like how good it sounds so I think I can reconcile the two put them in the same category you know you mentioned a 2013 albums and you know say for example what uh what Gambino did you know with doing the screenplay and he also did um you know clapping for the wrong reasons that little short that he did for that yeah yeah yeah and I think just recently he released them chicken and futility and uh but and I think what he's basically doing is he's trying to turn his album into more of an experience maybe to service combat people pirating his music or anybody else's music and I think that if technology keeps going in the direction that it's going artists have to keep challenging that wave and with that comes maybe another short story another screenplay and that will definitely cause us to over analyze the meaning of everything because I've Anthony I think you mentioned in your review of um because the internet you said you didn't really find uh the the real introspection in the character of the boy you just sort of felt like um like you he was just being very he was just depressive and you saw no value in his character but a lot of people would tend to disagree with that because there's so much interpretation that you can draw from what he did most of the time when we overthink music we're sort of doing it on by our own decision you know we're like there's something on this album that after listening to it multiple times it's causing gears to turn up here and I'm thinking you know about how everything on this record is coming together whereas with this Gambino album because of the script and because the movies and because of the videos and because of all the buzz that came out before before we even listened to the record we were expecting were already being invited by the artist to overthink the album but how much of an audience is there in the hip-hop society for authors like Gambino to have his music over thoughts and dissected because music jumping all the time how many people or what kind of audience can he really grab with that method I don't if you understand what I'm saying no I mean I hear you I mean idea you know artists like Gambino and Kendrick Lamar do you know definitely try to make music that invite the listener to think deeply about what's going on but um you know they also understand that there's kind of a double-edged sword to that you know you man yeah really passionate cult following behind your album button if you don't have a strong single on that and I feel like Kendrick trying that with um swimming pools I feel like he tried to do that with that track the recipe with dr. Dre you know even though that was like a bonus track but you know teasing up to the release of the album and I feel like him you know understood that as well by putting out 305 a thousand two thousand and five yeah album because he knew that he needed to have a sink you know whether the album was deep or not personally how much of an impact do you really believe music to have on society the issue here is if music it's what's going on outside of music and as long as it's going on just like you said it's music's just gonna continue to replicate and to mirror the images the that we see out there and it's not like the same that it used to be where um who made that that famous I don't know if it was ice cube or something that you know where the CN n of the ghetto um and somebody from NWA must have said yes um very easy said it I'm not sure but you know it's not it's not that anymore because it's the message is already out the numbers are out we know that yeah the the death rates in each city and it's it's really at this point just it's just a reminder really and uh it should we take it that seriously I don't think so because I think it's an old it's really an old and outmoded issue you know the whole relation that uh that negative music has on society and I'm sort of desensitized to it because I'm here in the city maybe and though that might not be the best answer but but it's the most truthful one I think I think just a vast amount of people are listening to music for entertainment they take it as entertainment they know that they don't and I think they're I think if there's any kind of major sea change that comes with artists like little B for example you know um people are invited to listen to his music think deeply about it but also simultaneously not feel the pressure to take themselves take him take everything so seriously yeah in and even though a lot of people find it annoying and I understand why ya know but it's also um sort of a breath of fresh air like hey listen like here's something that you can listen to we're not gonna force you to think it's good or it's bad absolutely was like you know just come on in just be in on the joke and just see em ever you know and thank him by the time you're done with it just thank you most important just thank him exactly by the time it's over thank him okay so we're gonna we're going to leave it at that Thank You basedgod also thank you Hannah for coming by and thank you for having me segment Thank You DDOT for mqi thank you for having us there I I disagree with that sign but I'm just thought what does that say don't listen to this guy Stella um I will put links down there in the description where you can check out each of their YouTube channels and over-thinking music the needle drop Hannah d dot forever [Music] [Music] 
MQDRPhGU9_k,hey everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new self-titled murmur album this is the sophomore LP from the chicago-based metal outfit murmur this new LP of theirs is being dropped right at the start of this year by a label which is a subdivision of Season Of Mist records a pretty heavy hitter in the metal underground as far as labels go if you weren't aware this band's 2010 debut LP slipped by me however when looking through their back catalogue after listening to this new album of theirs I was not surprised to find that they actually have a split out with another experimental metal outfit from the Midwest knock Miss diem and I'm not surprised because I feel like these two bands share a lot of common ground I do think they have a similar stylistic approach in that black metal is a really huge foundational influence for the music that both of these groups create in the case of murmur seems to inform their retched vocals their claustrophobic recording and they're sort of dismal chord progressions but both bands only really use black metal as a bit of a home base as they reach out and experiment with other genres incorporating them into this traditionally dark sound even though the first track on this LP is a pretty harsh wake-up call with some obvious black metal influences as this song and this entire album progresses elements of experimental rock jazz rock jazz fusion all reveal themselves the band might jam on like an off-kilter riff or an odd time signature or create some chaos with some really glitchy electronics or a flurry of percussion from drummer Charlie Werber whose playing is actually a huge highlight on nearly every track here the track recuerdo s-- is kind of a an acoustic guitar driven funky interlude that's pretty nice come down and there are moments on this LP as well where the band seems to embrace that noisy my numbing riff repetition of a van like swans which happens on the track king in yellow a song that isn't my favorite on here mostly because I do think that repetition makes the song overstay its welcome a little bit the vocals on this thing can be really aggressive and abrasive and in other spots here kind of melodic on the song when blood leaves have these sort of eerie deadpan vocal harmonies that have such a cultish vibe to them I love it on the opening track here there are some really heavenly chorus vocals hanging in the background and whether they're sampled or synthesized or not they add a really nice and sort of pretty sound to this very evil metal recording and to speak to the more freakish side of this record there is the song Zeta 2 part 2 where over these really oddly shaped riffs that are locked in really tightly with the drums we're getting what is sort of heavy metal scatting even the final song in this LP is a cover of King Crimson's larks tongues and aspect part to really more of a bonus track for those who are interested but that sort of shows you where this band is coming from they really love their progressive rock they really love their jazz rock and not that they should be ashamed either of what bands they're sort of taking ideas for them to make this record because this is they're blending all these influences so seamlessly that this self-titled record is a little refreshing in a sense for the most part the band understands tension and release and how it can use these two things to drag songs on for long periods of time and keep it interesting this talent is best displayed on the first three tracks here for one the song water for water which has this really dismal opening with acoustic guitars and it builds really slowly with some guitar leads that are wailing and electric piano keys that are scattered about the percussion is all over the place and suddenly the song just explodes into a wall of blast beats these very messy and chaotic tremolo Pickett ARS and like I said earlier these heavenly background vocals that sort of as they return raise the climaxes of the song higher and higher then there's the song bull of Crete which has all these really sharp shrill guitar chords and riffs playing over this drumming that the more I listened to it it just reminds me of animal from the Muppets I can't really explain it in any other way while I do know the stylistic influences that make Charlie Weber play the way that he does I just imagine him playing this track and just see his hands all over the place the song eventually just glides into this ascending chord progression that I absolutely love the track then moves through a series of riffs and dismal interludes before it comes back and returns to a lot of the same themes but with a lot more drama and power those are two words I would use to describe the next track on here as well almalik the longest song here with more than 11 minutes in length and a track that sticks out to me because of the greatest difference between one part and another part in another part in the song I mean there are so many hard-hitting riffs right at the beginning of this track but then it just boils down very quickly into this deep dark depressing bleak set of guitar passages and they're really murky bass riffs and the sort of sparse electric piano it reminds me of darker groups in progressive rock music like magma or Guapo the band essentially structures this album in a way where they hit you with these three monsters and then sort of go down a little bit into this funky interlude which is a very great track and then hit you with three more tracks that seem to be sort of linked into one another to me there are only two major weak points on this LP and they don't even really distract me that much from enjoying the album for one the vocals sometimes they're chilling and really aggressive sometimes they're melodic other times they're kind of straightforward and shouting and pretty intelligible the vocals definitely get the job done they don't bore me but they don't wow me on here as much as some of the guitar playing and especially the drumming however this might also be due to how buried the vocals feel in the overall recording which is sort of my second issue with this album what exactly murmur is doing on this record the detail of it feels slightly obscured by the kind of grimy sound that this record has to offer and while I'm sure on some level it's an aesthetic choice it did take me a few listens to kind of make heads or tails of the nuances to the playing on this thing so I thought this thing was really great I'd highly recommend it I mean there was a really visceral jagged progressive rock riffs on this thing fantastic diverse drumming with a lot of fluidity excitement these guys keep this sound gritty and they keep the playing strong and I think the album itself is pretty cohesive from front to back with a lot of songs on here complimenting one another segue into to another or explore different sounds or experiments to keep this record from getting too redundant I wish the sound on this thing was a little more hard-hitting and I wish the ending was a bit more climactic it's definitely one of the most dismal tracks on this entire record but still I am feeling the lightest and fluffiest of eights on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh murmur forever 
a6tuB0ksw18,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Nils from album spaces this is the latest full-length LP from German pianist and composer Nils Frahm hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly this may be the first time you're hearing of him but he is a seasoned musician with numerous releases under his belt so on this LP Nils essentially does what many musicians do they have a pretty sizable back catalogue he puts out a live album and because this is a live LP it's not like Nils is pushing outside of those minimalist and modern classical styles that fans are used to actually quite a bit material on this thing lands on previous LPS like the bells and felt but he goes into spaces with the mission and for me that seems to be that he wants to put the electrifying and pretty moving magic of his live performances to tape and in the process transform a lot of these songs the song said and done alone almost triples its length on this album and if songs on this thing aren't being stretched out they're being mashed into massive medleys that span past 10 11 15 minutes on the song hammers you can even hear what I assume is Nils manically moaning along to the lead melodies that he's playing which are really simple but also beautiful and powerful and sort of sit atop these speedily played piano arpeggios that sort of serve as the foundation of the song and even though the general tone and the vibe of the pianos here do give off a somewhat new-age esque vibe on this live album occasionally I do think that Nils is far too spontaneous and gritty to be lumped in such a category the entire album itself even begins with an intentional hiccup on the 1-minute track and aborted beginning now even though this LP sticks very wholly to solo piano compositions it does have enough variety on it to keep me engaged for most of this thing like the song says which is this really wonderful progressive synthesizer Odyssey I'd expect from someone like Vangelis but this track doesn't just sound like another artist it also sounds like the sensation of being weightless it sounds like the stars sounds like interplanetary travel following this track is the song said and done which at its foundation has the sustained piano notes just ringing very rhythmically over and over and over it's hypnotic and it's very simple foundations like this that are the basis for many songs on here and on top of these rhythmic patterns Mills will drop a very simple but pretty lead melody or some very grand or glorious piano chords and even though many of these tracks may seem very repetitive and cyclical within a given moment focus is never lost on where the song is moving next like at the 3-minute mark on this track we're all of a sudden this entirely different chord introduces itself ringing along with the singular piano notes for beautiful harmony and at the five-minute mark on this track the amount of piano notes ringing out with this sustain seems to have increased to the point where it sounds like I'm listening to dozens of bells ringing all at once the song is cluttered but it's wonderfully uplifting and there's a very somber piano piece finishing this track out as well that's beautiful but not every tone down moment on this LP moves me like the song went missing which I actually found to be kind of nondescript I prefer moments on this thing like familiar which has a much Moody or melody and one that I think is a lot more memorable and the track improvisation for coughs and the cellphone has a really dreary edge to Ross's harmonium is another one of the softer tracks on here the final track on this entire thing and even though the harmonium the tone of this song and the really beautiful chords make it stick out the abrupt fade that ends up finishing this song off makes it a pretty lackluster closer and makes me feel like this album is is more of a compilation of recordings live recordings as opposed to a wholly conceived project or album so there definitely are some underwhelming spots for me on this LP even if it doesn't seem like it's a big deal because these songs are consistently some of the shortest on the album but I'm sort of torn on this thing sometimes because there are tracks on here that are in credibly mountainous in their ambition and their beauty like the the medley on here for Peter toilet brushes and more the song has all bees shimmering synth chords at the start all of a sudden these murky bass notes make their way in eventually and then Nils sharpens these waves of Basie drones with some higher tones and all of a sudden these slow-moving waves of sense just thicken up they get bigger they get wider they're larger than life they're monolithic and the song comes to a climax on the song toilet brushes with all of these very nimbly played piano chords and notes cascading over one another with a little bit of delay sounds overlapping one another really beautifully its tracks like this that the playing is so intense it's so muscular it's so in the moment it's hard for me not to get wrapped up in the track get lost in it the execution is fast it's somewhat technical as well but the music that is being played is sort of simple immediate straightforward but not so much that it feels dumbed down every move that's made on this record feels very purposeful even on the songs that do sort of feel a little bit more like wallpaper to me overall spaces does have some really amazing moments on it to the point where I want to stay in tune with whatever this guy is putting out next I liked a majority of this album a lot but I didn't love every track here and I thought spaces in its entirety was a little too long-winded but personally my biggest issue is that I wish these performances and sort of Nils aesthetic in general was just a little more idiosyncratic I mean the compositions are fantastic the playing is great and tracks on here like toilet brushes and hammers do show a significant amount of eccentricity but there is a considerable amount of tracks on here that do go by without much in the way of a unique or interesting angle I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this album listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Fantana spaces playing forever 
ZKU98ZjIwOU,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lee Bannon album alternate endings Lee Bannon is a super versatile music producer known mostly for his hip hop production letting his beats the likes of pro era as well as super helpful but the guy's been dropping lesser-known solo albums and EPS for years now LPS like big toy box and fantastic plastic and Caligula theme music and a lot of these releases dabbling in instrumental hip hop and some cloud rap and trap rap as well and even though his releases have been getting darker and more atmospheric and chilled out and moody I didn't really foresee the move that he was gonna make with this record or really just the the surprise transition he made away from hip hop I wouldn't really say you did a 180 with his music he really did three backflips a spin kick and a front aerial off a two-story building landing somewhere in Jungle break beat drum and bass territory genres of electronic music I remember being wildly popular when I was a lot younger and I liked a lot of the bigger names coming out of them as well like the prodigy and The Chemical Brothers and Crystal Method had some songs I liked and then later I drove into artists who were much more aggressive and experimental with some of these breakbeat drum and bass drill and bass sounds Square pusher effects twin and because there was a time when these genres had crested in the in the popular consciousness it's hard not to see the direction that Lee Bannon takes on this record as nostalgic and alternate endings makes me wonder whether or not this genre could sort of see a second coming get popular once again especially given that Lee Bannon has recreated these styles with such a deep attention to detail the LP kicks off with the fantastic track resurrect a very speedy break beats on this thing glitchy vocal samples that are relentless locked into the beaten constantly jumping up and down in pitch sometimes chipmunks sometimes grimy beasts lines on this track great groove this song to me has everything a great song in this style should have but bannon's sort of distinguishes himself in this genre with an emphasis on atmosphere executing some of these songs with a massive amount of reverb that might remind you of a burial record and I know there are atmospheric drum and bass producers like Goldie who definitely have influenced bannon's music but he does take the reverb he does take the ethereal tones to an extreme degree sometimes especially on tracks like this opener where seems like Lee is trying to either find or create as much common ground as possible between incredibly aggressive jungle and breakbeat music and ambient interludes these sounds also come together really well on my favorite track here NW / WB which has all these vocal samples from the RZA peppered throughout the vocals are just screaming their attention-grabbing really reminds me of the prodigy then there's this incredibly infectious synth line and this lead is so strange it's warped it's twisted the song delivers a blazing opener but slowly grows more panoramic and ethereal as it continues on incorporating these sounds in the background that sound like haunted winds along with a lot of other indescribable noises and glitches and tones and little percussive flares that are spread throughout the track again there's a really great balance of hard in-your-face sounds and more ethereal sounds as well on these first two tracks but this atmosphere sometimes can be bannon's undoing tracks like prime / decent and shoot out the Stars and wind and then songs like this really set the stage but they fail to cast a leading role the LP really is break be wallpaper for a little while unfortunately and this doesn't really change until the track Phoebe Katz where while this song is atmospherically addicted as well the vocal samples and the overall melodies hanging in the atmosphere in the background are so pretty there so beautiful they're so serene and then there is tu-16 another favorite of mine on here which starts off with a very very eerie and murky piano part right at the beginning there are these wailing vocal samples popping up repeatedly throughout the track I love the cascading keyboard phrases over the bridge tracks like this on this record are fantastic ones that have a ton of detail multiple phases you really feel like you're traveling through different parts of the song from A to B even though there are tracks here that I think do sort of lack variety within the song itself I do think liebe Anand does bring a number of different vibes and feels on some of these songs even though he does stick very passionately to that drum and bass jungle break B vibe with some very subtle references to things like hip hop and dub and dubstep the song cold slash Mel is kind of a detour for me not really a highlight but still stands out as being very psychedelic and the closing track on here is similarly trippy as well and then there's value 10 as well which has one of the more standout vocal samples I love the funky bass line break toward the end of this track the very steady ride cymbal the changes of pace and sound are just enough for me but even if you are into this sound I do think to an extent Bannen does test patience especially with the length of this record and behemoths on here like the nine minute song ready slash available one of my least favorite songs on here not because of its length but because of its really tedious lead melody that you don't get any relief from until about the six-minute mark of the track when these song changes pace and starts ascending up a somewhat epic chord progression overall alternate endings is a decent album considering it's Lee bandhans first big commercial release after being recently signed in into tune records it's got some undeniably fantastic tracks but does it stay entertaining for the entire hour not for me Plus at this point with pursuing this style of music I think Lee Bannon is doing more emulating than he is carving a niche out for himself while it's good and encouraging to hear that Lee Bandhan can recreate this musical style to a tee it's gonna be exciting to hear if he can push it beyond this I'm feeling a decent too strong sex on this record transition but if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it love it hate it Why What you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Lee Bannon alternate endings forever 
XtenETXMWx8,hello hi hi how are we listen to what I'm about to say the new liar song super good the title of this track mess on a mission these guys are an experimental rock outfit you may already be familiar with them they've been putting out albums for years now their last LP wish you reviewed it when it came out showed the band moving in a much more electronic direction where synthesizers moodier beats stranger more deadpan vocals a really subdued record for them but still one of their darkest releases yet and this new song that they put out is also teasing toward what may be another electronic album for Liars the title of this thing mess it's coming out March 25th on mute records and this track that's just dropped from a mess on a mission oh so good reminds me of some of the more hard-hitting tracks from wishy like Bratz except much more eccentric and energetic and catchy as well as some really infectious refrains there's some noisy since on this track of beat that just makes me want to move and yeah just go down in the description give it a listen transition what do you think of this track do you love it feed it why do you expect a lot from this next liars album mess coming out on new records let me know liars mess on a mission forever 
ZxB8txjcYzM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Shu Shu album Nina any month you get to talk about Nina Simone twice on your music review vlog is a good one jazz singer pianist and songwriter Nina Simone has been getting a lot of attention over the past half a year so mostly because of a sample of one of her songs that landed in one of the bigger tracks of Kanye West's latest LP yeezus however my favorite tribute to her music from this past year comes in the form of this record from artpop experimental rock outfit Shu Shu with singer-songwriter and frontman Jamie Stewart masterminding the whole thing this project has been putting out LPS for about 10 years now and in my opinion Nina ranks as one of those projects most ambitious albums yet it features eleven revisions of songs that Nina had either written or just had a really great performances of in her discography and even though there are tribute albums out there already for Nina Simone's music and there are a lot of tribute albums out there in general I would like to think of this record as a big deal I would like to think of it as a big undertaking for Shu Shu I think the band has shown no lack of ambition with a ton of raw live instrumentation on this record backed with horns which brings a bit of a human element into the equation which has been sort of missing from some of the more glitchy and electronically driven albums they've been putting out recently however even with the effort being put into getting this live instrumentation putting the Arrangements together Shu Shu has come out with a covers album that is so stylistically and just sonically off the mark I'm not really sure I could responsibly recommend it to nina simone fans and it's it's not really because this record isn't jazzy enough if there's anything proven by the end of this LP it's that Jamie Stewart and the musicians he works with on this LP have a very firm grasp of jazz instrumentation what's probably going to be an issue is that even though this thing is a Nina Simone covers album it sounds a lot more like the last Scott Walker album a lot of the instrumental arrangements throughout these tracks are noisy they're dissonant they're cluttered and Jamie Stewart singing on these songs is more unorthodox than usual for a shoo-shoo album whisper quiet very breathy hanging mostly in the lower register and it also sounds like throughout these tracks that steward is in some kind of great amount of pain most likely emotional but I wouldn't rule out physical what disappointed me a little at first is that Jamie's vocals are a little quiet and a little whispery a little understated considering that he is trying to tribute one of the best voices in jazz he's trying to tribute a jazz great however what he does do singing in the fashion that he does on this record is captures the inherent eeriness and a lot of these Simone songs making them way more twisted and nightmarish especially on tracks like pirate Jenny where Jamie Stewart sort of takes some lyrical liberties in a story about a woman who is working on a ship and is planning to sneakily kill all the passengers when they least suspect it and Jamie delivers this song like an evil villain sort of unfolding his plan to a single listener in secret it's a great track it's one of my favorites it's a song where I actually think the odd vocal styling plays really well into the lyrics of this Nina Simone song however there are some tracks here that I think maybe are a little too spooky for their own good that spookiness that comes with the sparse instrumentation and Jamie's vocals over takes some of the melody or maybe what the storyline is a lot like on the opening track here don't smoke in bed the horns on this track do a fantastic job of very quaintly adapting the opening melody but I feel like the singing on this song with it being at its most whispery on this entire record possibly doesn't really do the tale here justice I mean what this song is lyrically is really a lot like a letter that you find in the kitchen one morning when you wake up to see that your significant other has completely disappeared and they're leaving you however with the vocals being so eccentric on this record and this track and and so theatrical it forces me to kind of imagine why they would be sung in this way and the only scenario where that I could come up with is that this person is trying to slink away and say their final goodbyes without waking their significant other up but really I can only guess why certain things happen and why certain things sound the way they do on this record outside of the moments where melodies and instrumentation very clearly mimics spots from these original Nina Simone tracks there isn't much on this record that makes clear obvious sense the song where can I go without you for example one of my favorites on here but still a song with these very sparse Celeste melodies and sort of funhouse sound effects creaking and just causing a riot in the background against Jamie Stewart it's just soft quivering voice this song sounds like something you would hear walking down the hallway of and saying asylum in the middle of the night and you sort of peek into a padded room and see some straitjacket sweaty guys singing this song to himself rocking in a corner a lot of the decisions made in adapting these tracks seem more personal than practical and sometimes Shu Shu pushes the envelope so far that some people may think that these tracks are just too overacted they're too freaky to be genuine or enjoyable and I think that would be the case if you were just simply holding this record to a rock or a pop music standard and even though those genres do inform many of Shu shus records I think this is one of the few LPS that they've put out where that just does not cross over here Nina scratches a whole series of different itches this is a record for people who like their music to be very eccentric dissonant challenging odd and chaotic if that's the case there's no reason that a track on here like while does the wind shouldn't appeal to you I love the tension in this track the rickety percussion just causing a riot in the background the duet horns and the guitar all sort of moving at the strange fluid pace just a cloud of instrumentation orbiting Jamie's dying breath vocals the south and what's incredibly haunting on this LP is the very steady pace of the track don't explain the music sounds like the soundtrack to someone slow painful murder with Jamie Stewart sounding like he has tears rolling down his face as he's singing the song there are some moments on this LP though that are very visceral like the song sea lion woman which has some very hard-hitting percussion in the background wild horns with some wailing screaming free jazz embellishments and Jamie Stewart's vocals are just hot intense they're loud reaching into his upper register I wish we saw this side of his voice more and even though this track is in a way a highlight because of how loud it is it does not really make it into my favorites on here because it's a little short of breath on the length still the song for women is another very loud and intense track and is a bit longer pays off with a really awesome chord progression at the finish with the horns resolving in a really beautiful way and the song you'd be so nice as well I feel like pushes that free jazz experimentation even further with the horns going absolutely nuts and behind all of it there's this really strong jazz walking bass line it feels like some sort of freaky perversion of a track from the Twin Peaks soundtrack so there are aggressive moments on this LP there are just freaky eccentric moments on this LP they're sad spots here they're creepy spots here but there are moments here that I do think are hauntingly beautiful are sort of soulful as well like the opening horn melodies on the track just say I love him which also features some very beautiful accompaniment throughout from guitar and a bit of melodica as well as they bounce back and forth with the vocals just as this LP is great at churning out sounds that are hugely disturbing it's just as good as putting out sounds that are moving even after 40 minutes the acoustic guitar backed song the other woman sounds kind of rude Sein and friendly in comparison with the other tracks here even though this song as well is fronted by Jamie Stuart's very strange vocal stylings I will say the only downside to this track is while I do like the thought of what they tried to do with tender side of this song in this record I do think Jamie Stewart's singing style here does sound much better with heavier accompaniment overall I have to say this LP is really unique in my opinion it's entertaining it's strangely fun and bizarre and with how eccentric this record is especially in the vocal Department I do realize that this album is gonna garner some really strong opinions people who are just far into hating it and people who are far into loving it and those opinions might even swing further into the hating it direction simply because this thing is a Nina Simone covers album and these covers aren't exactly complimentary in a really obvious way but to me after numerous listens to this album it's very apparent that Shu Shu deeply appreciates and understands the emotions and the stories that are laced into every Nina Simone song at least the ones that they covered here as well as the instrumental quality - and the way that the band goes about covering these songs is so incredibly interesting as well just taking single ideas instrumentally just sounds or chord progressions or tones and just exaggerating them or magnifying them to the point where it feels like an entirely different song and once you've magnified this one single piece and just brought it out and just made it bolder and weirded it up a little bit then the entire song around this is sort of free for you to recreate Shu Shu takes a ton of liberties with these nina simone songs there's no denying that but despite that I do think that there is a ton of power and and beauty to this record I'm feeling a light eight on this album transition if you've given this album a listen and what do you think I should review next let me know yep any Fantana Shu Shu Nina Simone forever 
xX3QABQcrNM,hi everyone plantain Evesham Bango here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list of a group of albums that I really add dissipating this new year 2014 oh 26 I have 26 albums new albums artists who I think will be dropping at least something this year and no real organized order let's just start the new Silver Mountain Zion record off get free we pour light on everything these guys are a Canadian psychedelic rock noise rock post rock outfit fronted by one of the masterminds of Godspeed you black Emperor stylistically sonically especially since they record in the same studios Godspeed they do have a lot in common and what I've been hearing of this new LP so far which is dropping this month January it is sounding pretty fantastic and strangely enough there is a tribute to the late Capital steez on the back end of this LP also the new woods LP with light and with love even though I have sort of had a hit-or-miss past with this New York folk rock axe discography I am looking forward to this next album considering that I did think there their previous one bed beyond was very good next the forthcoming LP on anti Cohn records from the experimental Scottish hip-hop outfit young fathers dead and another LP from another experimental hip hop act this one from West Coast California clipping they have a new full-length album coming out this year on Sub Pop Records and this year I am also anticipating the new Guardian alien album spiritual emergency these guys are a psychedelic rock outfit featuring one of the greatest most underrated drummers in the underground right now they had a full-length album come out already on Thrill Jockey records i believe they're dropping on the same label again and i'm sort of hoping that this new album of theirs has a bit more diversity because for sure on their last full-length LP the playing the intensity the sound all that production the good production of Mizzou's all their I'm also looking forward to the new wild beasts album present-tense this art pop outfit new album the way this year I thought their last LP was really good and from what I heard on this latest single of theirs on this new album which you can hear down there in the description box I am thinking that this one's going to be I'm also expecting a significant improvement on the next st. Vincent album self-titled coming out in February I believe and the two songs that have dropped from this LP so far have just been noisy fun catchy and killer I'm being told Beck has a new full-length LP coming out this year too called mourning phase and the noisy hellish disgusting gruesome sludge and do metal outfit thou has an LP coming out this year as well called heathen the Canadian oddball and singer/songwriter project timber tambour has a full-length LP coming out this April called hot dreams and I am also looking forward to the new shoo-shoo album angel guts red classrooms some kind of noisy post punkish songs coming out from this full-length LP thus far with the songs that have been teasing up to it and I'm sort of hoping that the band goes back to its roots a little bit drifts away from some of the glitchy er sounds on some of their more recent albums than if you actually are interested they came out with a Nina Simone's cover LP just the tail and of last year that I highly recommend I'm most definitely looking forward to the new Sun Kil moon album Benji and super psyched for the next have a nice if you like noise and drone and shoegaze and again post-punk and you're also a fan of the duo's 2008 album death consciousness then you should be looking forward to this new album of theirs the two tracks that have dropped thus far very good also looking forward to the latest LP from noise rock outfit white Suns totem the new Black Lips album underneath the rainbow if you're looking for some really scuzzy gross sort of low fight garage rock and the new men album tomorrow's hits unite in really like the country direction they took their last album in at all what you can expect from the men is to not to know what to expect from the men every single LP of theirs is completely different filled with different influences different songwriting styles different attitudes and emotions and I'm just sort of looking to see where they surprise me next also will there be something new from Outkast this year they're back together they're performing they're headlining a day at Coachella but will they be dropping new music soon will they be working on new music ever I hope so Toole is supposed to have a new LP this year from what I've heard La Dispute as well who I think has been dropping sort of some teaser videos teasing toward what could be some new music this year as well if you're unfamiliar with them they're a post-hardcore screamo emo outfit from the Midwest they had a fantastic full-length LP come out a few years ago called wild life amazing album there's been a lot of buzz surrounding the probability of a new Frank Ocean album this year which I hope is the case and I hope he's able to mature past what he did on channel orange - and these very same probability rumors are surrounding Flying Lotus as well wolves in the throne room has been said to have finished penning songs for an album that's gonna be dropped this year as well and there is a release date for a forthcoming collaborative album from Sun and / - and finally I will say I am anticipating if it is in fact going to drop this year the new Joey badass album badass and for some other stuff in addition to these lists I would love to see if joanna newsom does anything this year or if ASAP mob essentially comes through with another solo member doing a commercial release or a mixtape that surprises me because as many of you know I wasn't really anticipating much of anything from them after they came out with the Lord's never worry mixtape which I thought was terrible and then ASAP ferg dropped his first album which I thought was pretty good and if there is that kind of potential in any other members of ASAP mob I would love to hear it and chance the rapper - I mean I know I wasn't really as huge on his mixtape acid rap as many of you were this past year but I do think there were some fan stick songs on that tape I do think that in some ways he is a very progressive emcee and I'm looking to see if he ends up maturing past that because the amount of progression between 10-day and acid rap to me in my opinion is great and if he can create as wide a gap between acid rap and whatever he does after that I think he'll have an even more amazing project and that's pretty much it those are all the releases I'm anticipating at least for this first quarter or first third of this new year what are you looking forward to this year anything in rock pop electronic music experimental music metal let me know mm-hmm-hmm transition are you looking forward to any of the album's on this list if not why information release dates what I have of the release dates album titles are down in the description box and have a nice day 2014 albums forever 
n6xdDoeRlI4,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album forceps these guys are a French rock quartet and even though this is their debut LP the band members do have ties to more established groups in France's hardcore and post hardcore scene like pigeon and as we draw and birds in row the last of which actually had a pretty decent album come out last year however I wasn't that crazy about the LP there wasn't much on it melodically or riff wise this stuck out to me considering how many bands there are out there right now combining the ferocity and the speed of punk music with sludgy metal production there's a lot of bands on Southern Lord doing this sound some recent additions to Death Wish incorporated like Code Orange kids or Oathbreaker nails trap them this routine is hell Kurt Beaulieu of converge actually produces quite a few of the group's going for this sound and I think even a moderate fan of extreme music will pick up the converge influence and calve Ayers music right away along with some sounds coming from the world's a crust Punk and D bead and black metal and grindcore there are some very complicated grooves that feel almost math rock inspired on this LP too but I wouldn't really say that clear inspiration hurts the enjoyability of this album in any major way it definitely doesn't lessen the impact of the unrelenting tooth clenched anger disdain on every song now from what I've read about this LP the band tracked it live and it definitely sounds like that a whirlwind of rock instrumentation all turned up to 11 with gunshot drums and hellish vocals heavy heavy guitars and the aggressive parts that are here are detailed and interesting enough to dive into not just sort of let them pummel you to death the opener on here starts off with some incredibly fast and tense and off-kilter guitar riffs that are syncopated very tightly with the drums and all of this rhythm all of these riffs they just move so fast it's it's difficult to describe them as anything else but kind of a blur guitars pretty much dominate the entire track with the exception of a few moments around the 1-minute mark where some really gruesome group vocals sort of overtake them but only for a little bit and this track segues right into the next song like they're both the same song it's just such a fast transition and on this track pummeling riffs are accented with really shrill guitar chords the band starts chugging through a groove slows down the tempo progressively gets slower and slower and slower until they hit this sludgy depressive stride that kind of sounds like the harsh come down after the anger Laden crack they doled out on the first song the band starts to show off their instrumental dynamics on the next track where Asajj it's a 4-minute song one of the longer tracks on this LP which for the most part is filled with songs that barely reach the two-minute mark there's a very bleak build of guitar leads and primal drums on this part of the track and then the song eventually breaks through into a series of brick to your face riffs and blast beats so many of these tracks shift and change so quickly what they're doing but what it's changing from is one incredibly intense moment to another incredibly intense moment but on the end of this particular track there is a very beautiful and dreary set of slower guitar chords that are played through where the vocals are actually in the background trying to add some element of harmony so sometimes the changes that these songs undergo are significant but still I do wish that the vocals stuck out a little bit more and did bring maybe a bit of a gentle or vibe at this point in the song I guess in a sense it just kind of feels a little OneNote I can also hear the vocals pushing outside of that screaming role on the song caret L and this track has some really slow melodic guitar passages that make for one of the more emotionally powerful moments on this album but still on this track I'm sort of left wishing that the vocals brought more of a sea-change the instrumental dynamics on this LP continue on tracks like Oh porks the longest track on this entire LP is six minutes it kicks off with some marching snare drums and some very dismal guitar chords this moment in the song is very thin it's very trebly but then eventually the bass kicks in the song gets really thunderous and unrelenting and the longer it goes the more the track feels like being tossed down a bottomless pit and you're surrounding the slowly grow darker darker and darker and even though the slower spots on here the more melodic spots to me are the ones that truly stick out there are riffs on this album that though for the very short amount of time that they play do feel very catchy they feel visceral they really whip me into a friends you've just wanted to bob my head and wave and fly up my arms of violently there are some guitar tone changes here and there as well but for the most part you're gonna be hearing the thunderous riffs that you catch right at the beginning of the album and again to go back to the one major issue that this LP has a lot of this LP just kind of coasts by in a bit of a frenzy not that this album is forgettable because you will most definitely not forget the impact and the aggression that this band brings to the table but the details of it do end up being fuzzy even after multiple listens and it's not really for lack of tight playing or fantastic production or great ideas this LP has that I actually think there are some better writing ideas on this thing than there are on some albums that are similarly frenzied metallic hardcore fusions the songs on this record aren't really organized in a very cohesive way and if one of the goals here is to be as disorienting as possible mission accomplished the music is slightly nihilistic in this way but it is strangely satisfying despite it all of this nihilism kind of comes to a head on the last track where every single instrument in the mix is trying to make as much noise as possible as fast as possible just before the audio of the song just cuts out into pure silence which in a nutshell is kind of this album however for the short period of time that this LP does last the noise that it's making is incredibly intense loud well recorded just there's an impressive level of energy and stamina and rhythmic complexity to a lot of these songs that just keeps me coming back despite the fact that some things just aren't sticking I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listened what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh god forever 
od6nfOOtyK4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled Beyonce album beyonce is a famed aren't he and pop singer who through her solo LPS and her year she put in with Destiny's Child is one of the most widely known singers ever and her biggest records played a large role in shaping the sound of mainstream commercial radio friendly R&B throughout the late 90s and 2000's and unless you've been living under a rock I'm sure you know how a lot of these records sound instrumentally very clean punchy immediate the most important elephant being of course Beyonce's incredibly bold and powerful voice especially on some of her biggest singles like crazy and love and single ladies run the world you're replaceable there's a lot of them honestly I'm not really here to hold your hand through a bunch of stuff that you already know and music that you may or may not have grown up with all I can really say is that outside of the singles I've been pretty neutral on Beyonce for a majority of her career however I was pleasantly surprised by a lot of songs on her last full-length LP for an LP where I actually thought she eased up a bit on the surface level immediate commercial appeal of her music and started favoring instrumentals that were a lot more dynamic and I basically went into this new LP of hers hoping that she would venture further outside of that radio-friendly comfort zone and sort of throw off the pressure to essentially make an album full of radio songs and that's kind of been a recurring theme with a lot of popular albums from this past year and this whole I'm not making songs for the radio mantra has been kind of a recurring theme with a lot of artists over the past year Kanye jay-z Drake these artists and artists like these dropping more experimental records ethereal records and specifically in the case of jay-z relying more on YouTube advertisements and the buzz surrounding a deal he did with Samsung to buy so many copies of his album and then distribute it to their users and Beyonce in a similar fashion as well didn't really do any teasing with the music toward the release of this new album of her she just pooted out toward the tail end of last year and allowed everybody to hear for the first time all together at once and obviously putting her album out this way subtracts radio promotion from the equation when it comes to building to your new full-length album but I think people are a little quick to jump the gun and just outright praise her simply for that on this LP it's not like Beyonce didn't have successful singles in 2013 it's not like she didn't have a stunning Super Bowl performance last year plus her album was plastered all over the front of iTunes the day that it dropped which caused the internet to spread the word like wildfire considering Beyonce's young listening audience which is most likely very deeply linked into the internet I don't really know if you need much more promotion these days however right now it has been a handful of weeks since this LP originally dropped a lot of the hype surrounding it has already dissipated a little bit and it seems that beyonce and her label aren't really looking to get into any huge advertising campaign to ram the album down people's throats in the coming weeks and this slightly unorthodox approach for beyonce is also reflected in the direction she takes the music into she has over an hour of songs on this album and they're brought to us by her and a gauntlet of co songwriters and producers who you might actually be familiar with if you've been reading a lot of the liner notes of mainstream contemporary R&B and hip hop albums over the past several years Timbaland Timberlake Mike Dean boots Noah forty Drake's producer Miguel the dream hit boy Pharrell surprisingly enough Caroline pull a check of chairlift and a lot more I haven't even mentioned however what is most interesting on this thing is of course the music which has received a pretty warm reception from critics across the board with a lot of people praising Beyonce for putting out her most surprising and ambitious album yet and I guess you can tag it as that if you want but I think there are some R&B records that have come out over the past few years that are a little more ambitious Janelle monáe's past few LPS Frank ocean's channel orange you could even throw the weekend's trilogy on there if you want to even though I do agree that this record is bold for Beyonce I also find it being kind of parallel to some other LPS that have come out recently like nothing was the same especially on the Drake featuring track mine I think Beyonce's new LP here is similarly atmospheric and vast but it also me Anders a little bit too and has some kind of dull instrumentals their tracks on this LP that bring some really heavy bass and some trap style high hats too and throw some really inane self-serious swag on top that sort of reminds me of tracks from Miley Cyrus's last album or like some Rihanna singles that have come out recently especially on tracks like partition which has all this sexual imagery in the lyrics that is so vivid it's tantalizing like born and I don't really think this tracker tracks on this LP like it are horrible but I do think they lose their flavor kind of quick there are high points on this record that are great in some moments seem to be really personal and confessional whether it comes to Beyonce talking about her life as a famous singer or as a mother or as jay-z's wife and like I just said with the sexual imagery there are a lot of songs on this thing where beyonce is not afraid to just get really raunchy and i do think some of the songs on this LP do bring a heavier dose of that diva attitude and female empowerment message that a lot of people expect from beyonce the opening track on here pretty hurts is one of my favorites on this LP and is a bit of a triumphant ballad about society's obsession with attaining unattainable perfection and I think the power of this song comes down to the line it's the soul that needs the surgery it's a bit of a sappy sentiment but there is a hard truth to it that I like and it does have a really explosive chorus and Beyonce follows this really fantastic song this shot at perfection up with what I think is is just like an apathetic shrug on the next track haunted the first half of this song is just this really underwhelming airy instrumental and a bit of spoken word Beyonce says these record labels are boring and and maybe they are and she also says out loud that I'm not gonna make any money off this oh well but when you're making as much money as Beyonce and jay-z maybe that's sort of a worry you can shrug off and then there's this repeated line about people who are working 9:00 to 5:00 just to stay alive and I realize that this is kind of a wake up call or maybe a push to get people to do what they love and follow their dreams instead of just working a dead-end job but there are a lot of people in this position because of some kind of monetary responsibility that they have I just kind of see this message as being a bit of a faint whisper and an insane traffic jam of noise that's been pushing the human race into this rank-and-file high of mine that's been going on for generations which also coincidentally makes mainstream music as popular as it is and there's a second half to this track too that's filled with sexual imagery but it's only slightly less underwhelming in comparison with the first half of the track the sexy attitude that Beyonce brings to the table is a lot more hard-hitting on the song drunk in love and there's some stellar chords on this thing and I don't mean the progression I mean more the sounds I mean the sound of the chords on this song it feels like the string section just bouncing really energetically but a string section from a dream there's a really awesome vocal sample on this track too but as soon as the track beat of this song kicks and I get a little sick to my stomach for one the bass hits on here barely compliment Beyonce's voice and the chord progression of the song they don't even really sound that fitting until jay-z's verse comes in Jay and Bey sound pretty charismatic on the track and seem really blunt about sex with each other Beyonce totally sounding like a sloppy white drum girl from Southern California telling you about some kind of one-night stand that she had after a night at the bar graining on that wood graining graining on that wood Beyonce he's even more sexually explicit on the song below where she's asking on the chorus for this person she's singing to to taste her skittles it's the sweetest in the middle pink is the flavor solve the riddle nobody's really racking their brains over this one you know I'm always happy when a song comes out about my favorite pastime but the instrumental and the melody here just seemed so effortless and listless it's like listening to Rick James before his morning snort of coke I could understand Beyonce wanting to do something different with this track and not have to conform to doing a radio song here but I don't really think this song is bold enough raunchy enough out there enough to really stick same thing with the track no angel Beyonce again trying out something different here with a lot of breathy falsettos on the chorus and there's some great vocal improvisation 'he's from Beyonce on this track too but because of how redundant the instrumental feels it the the track just sounds more like a motif or a meditation than a fleshed-out song that's stunning or moving or catchy I sort of feel the same way about the track superpower too with Frank Ocean unfortunately just a little too redundant I dig tracks on here like jealous way more a track that lyrically is about a bit of an unfair double standard in a relationship where it seems like the guy gets to go out and have fun and do whatever he wants where Beyonce stuck home the instrumentals heavy its lavish it's very pretty a lot like the song pretty hurts and I dig the song xo2 probably one of the most triumphant instrumentals on this entire LP with huge chorus vocals a beautiful vocal melody I just like the more fleshed out ballads on this album way more I think the only banger on here that's actually memorable or interesting is flawless it has a really nutty track beat where on the mic Beyonce is just so unafraid so uncompromising ly confident that it's pretty contagious I woke up like this Dallas and I really do like the track even though it is one of the most disjointed on this entire LP with its intro its outro then there's this really strange cacophonous tension building first half of the track a bit of a lecture vocal snippet from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in the middle talking about women being conformed to certain roles it's a little long-winded but I do agree with the message and then there's the second half on here which is incredibly catchy even though the cell P is really hit or miss for me I do think it ends kind of strong with the last two tracks on here starting with Heaven sort of a slow-moving piano ballad that's a little vague on lyrical details but it does seem to be a song about suffering some kind of great loss and then there's the closer on here Blue Ivy which is a really obvious tribute to her daughter and the melody and the instrumentation on this track is really beautiful it's gentle it's it's loving like a lullaby but still I'm pretty neutral on this self-titled LP I really enjoyed several songs from it I disliked a few and I was just shrugging my shoulders of most of them that's mostly because of how unfocused a lot of this album feels melodically structurally instrumentally Beyonce's lyrics or messages her personality rings through really clear and really bold on this record and that's that's that's really one of the best things about it what this LP suffers from is what I think albums like these suffer from and that is that we have mainstream artists here essentially flipping the bird to making songs geared for the radio and while yeah that's great they're still not doing anything legitimately adventurous or risky or strange to make the move worth it overall I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Beyonce self-titled forever

KqD6lw0yKHI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and classics week is over with this week closing I figure it's a good thing to sort of think about reflect on sort of discuss what exactly a classic in music is what's the criteria what makes for a classic album to discuss this pertinent issue I brought in Joel over at the daily guru another music related YouTube channel and Mike c-town who you might know as one of the reviewers who participates in the biggest YouTube hip hop or viewing channel dead end hip hop transition and here we are magic of the internet webcams the three of us don't really favor the idea of there being rules in music but really should there via criteria for what makes for a classic I don't think you can I mean you know what are you gonna say that um even even within an artist specific catalogue a lot of people like let's just take the Rolling Stones for example a lot of people will say that Exile on Main Street is their classic album well what about me I happen to think that let it bleed is the best Rolling Stones album that there is could you have technically more than one classic album in your discography daddy definitely most definitely I mean you know of course those time zones that you just brought up are fantastic and I think at least in my personal definition of a classic you know they both make that cut you know um they're artists out there with numerous classics there's there's no reason to sort of you know just give them give one single album in their entire discography to a give give just one album that label I mean to me and we could talk about the timeframe but at least to me a classic over us over a certain time for a maintains at least a certain level of influence or relevance look I want to kind of comment on what Joel said a minute ago I don't necessarily think that in order for an album to be classic it needs to be your favorite album like there are lots of albums that I don't even personally care but I would never say that they're not classic albums like um I'll go on record as saying I'm not the biggest fan of death I'm not the biggest fan of their album human but that album is clearly a classic album because it assured in a certain sound to the genre right no definitely that's also a record and that's also a band that you could take that record and then name dozens of other records that have sounds that are very much alike to it so no I mean you personally don't have to like an album for it to be a classic I mean I think I think the definition of a classic is just uh I mean slightly more objective than that but what I think is something that we could talk about now is how long exactly does something need to maintain that kind of popularity I mean I think if you're talking about a classic it has to be something that's going to stick for the long term I don't think it can kind of show up for a little bit be classic and then kind of just disappear I do think it's kind of a life long label that an album has to earn its its relevancy may change but you know I mean like you look at something like the first you know the first three stooges albums and how important they were to punk rock you know a lot of people don't go back that far anymore they now they stop it you know the pistols and the Ramones and they don't dig back to you know early Velvet Underground and stuff like that but there's still classic records even though they may not be people may not realize it as much of it when there comes a day that we're not hearing albums that sound directly influenced by development underground you know we still won't be able to deny that album of any of their albums as classics because it's ripple effect had been had and obviously you know we wouldn't be where we are if those albums hadn't come out so I mean you know at least for me personally there has to be a certain and I don't know what the number is but there has to be a certain age of an album right - yeah at least for me I think like a generation is a good standard if an album has been able to maintain relevance over the course of a generation and had a significant ripple effect and you can sort of see a hierarchy or maybe a family tree of different that album is influenced over time then yeah sure you know name it a classic yeah I mean I think I think we're seeing that now where you know at least for the three of us you know our guessing our general age Ridge right now where we see things like blue tanks 36 chambers or you know the early Nirvana or Pearl Jam starting to be referenced with that term you know like like classic and groundbreaking and stuff like that so it's what most those records are about 20 years old now and again it's it's that generation I don't really know if this is something that transcends hip-hop but it seems like hip-hop is one of the only genres that's quick to label something that just came out yesterday a classic you know like um I don't hear that happen really in Punk I don't hear it happen in indie rock I don't hear happen to metal but like for instance a good kid maad city sure you know people already calling that a classic and it just came out you know everybody else classic me that it impacted as onra it redefined the genre and like you said Anthony asked to age a little bit with hip hop it's just like oh we really liked it so therefore into classic I mean you know maybe that's because of a few different factors I mean I feel like especially in hip hop the influence of a new sound or a new trend is just heard instantaneously like you know it's the explosion the spread of ideas in my opinion and hip hop is so much more explosive you know violently explosive and you know in a really interesting way uh you know the the influence of what Kanye did on my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was heard the very next year for some reason within punk and hardcore you don't see that term used very often aside from you know never mind the bollocks the first Ramones record and you know a hateful here and there but you know the first Minor Threat record is the really the birth of hardcore music in the United States and you know even now you wouldn't hear anyone say that and that was that record was what about 33 years ago um so you know with the stuff we're seeing today you know whether it's Kendrick Lamar or even even the orange album I mean they may be forgotten by people who weren't there then but you know that's where kind of the historians come in and say well this is actually where that began mm-hmm yeah and you know and maybe that's why that discussion isn't so heavily debated and maybe words like classic are thrown around as much any Punk because you know sort of the godfathers and so on and so forth are so clearly established I definitely think that there's certain certain people and certain albums um that are almost so obvious that you don't name them classic until somebody brings it up like an album like a Minor Threat or the first couple Sex Pistols records or in my opinion I mean I think I may have grown up in a different era or a different side of hardcore than maybe you guys did but for like for me it was like the the judge record or the first bold record or can't close my eyes you to today or the firestorm EP like those were all classic records to me but someone that didn't grow up in that side of hardcore might not even see them yeah I mean I think there's going to be some level of subjectivity that's going to weigh in for everyone because every again it is that you know unique upbringing really like you know for me maybe just grabbing it out of them out of the thin air you know Tory a Moses boys for Pele record had such a significant impact with me in my youth that that was a classic moment from my life you know that that to me gets up there with those other records but if you look kind of at the lineage of history nobody's going to see that as a classic help I feel like influence and relevance can be to tricky things and I don't know if you need to have both to have a classic or if you can have just one or just have the other because they're definitely right I don't think that they have to have a you know huge sales numbers I mean I don't think I don't think I can settle offers but I mean you're obviously gluon singh other artists because they're jacking your sound well yeah if you look at a quiet layman especially just because it's easy to keep going back to kind of that whole late 70s New York City scene whether you're looking at the first few Talking Heads records that took a while to catch on whether you're looking at something like televisions Markie Moon that is a phenomenal record to those who know it and have massive impact or again looking at that first Ramones record that did not sell anything until you're well into the 80 and you know even even in his later years you know you could see interviews with Joey Ramone you know the Ramones never really cut big they just didn't and yet you know again that first Ramones record is such a groundbreaking moment an album that instantly comes to mind when I think about that is look at an album like Luke The Drifter right um that album to me is a classic and it may not be something that translates time and obviously it sounds extremely dated but if you look at what was done on that album the the the story of of being a drifter the narrative of that album at influenced generations all the way until now and that album came out in the 50s you know I don't think that an album has to be timeless or like you said has to sell a lot of units made a lot of numbers it just has to influence the genre and not just for five minutes for a long period of time and I don't even hear very many people talk about that that's one of my favorite Hank Williams records and it sounds like shit it's not a complete song shit but it's still a fantastic album yeah well you know I think we just saw that kind of coming full circle with what is it Billy Joe Armstrong and Norah Jones doing that for Everly record where you know I mean they cover track for track what was what it was a songs our daddy taught us came out in like 58 or something and the fact that not only did those two come together you'd be hard-pressed to find two people you know further ends of a musical spectrum but they're gonna you know that they both found that common ground in this record that honestly not a lot of people knew up until a year ago you know just uh you know I think then you can say okay well is that is that a classic record then because it it had such an interesting influence I think we can leave it at that you know obviously the classic a little more objective than a favorite and you know it's it's it's got a hold some water over time it's got to prove itself to have shelf life you know it can't just be really quick in and out you know in terms of its popularity and especially in terms of its in I mean you know you could have short-term or no popularity like we were just talking about with lack of album sales but influence in my opinion is really in long-term influence is really what's key to having a classic record well and I think you also need to find something that's a little more Anna versal you know it has to have reached a large number of people it is it really the record itself that needs to reach a large amount of people you know I think the bad dia or the snap the sound the sound alright yeah I agree I agree with that totally alright then thanks for coming on again Joel lately guru Mike over at N in hip-hop talking about what makes for a goddamn classic classic classic classics all right let's get guys later I'm sure we'll talk again private forever you 
xM2MIevm9Kk,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for our final video of classics week Nina Simone pastel Blues Nina Simone songwriter accomplished pianist and one of the most unique voices in jazz music her deep bellowing vocals earned her hits right from the start of her career and recorded music and even though her pop appeal did keep her album sales going a lot of her songs and albums did have kind of a darker side to them a mournful side or even a politically charged message like the track Mississippi goddamn or her infamous cover of Billie Holiday's strange fruit which lands on this LP Nina was also early to cover songs like screamin Jay Hawkins I put a spell on you as well as House of the Rising Sun she's put out a lot of songs throughout her career that relate to her heritage or love on the rocks she never really shied away from tracks whose subject matter was really cynical or biting toward popular culture like marriages for old folks but she was also not really a stranger to jazz standards and traditional songs and and love songs which is true of this LP right here as well pastel blues an LP who from its title you might guess is a blues album blues does seem to be a basis for a lot of the chord progressions on this LP and what I also like about this album is that Nina sticks very closely to her quartet of guest musicians that accompany her sort of sidestepping a lot of the heavily orchestrated vocal pop that she had done before on her previous records that was sort of popular during this time period and the first track on here is especially stripped back be my husband a song that was allegedly written by Nina's husband and features nothing but her voice clapping and a hi-hat and the melody she's singing on this track and the way that she delivers it vocally it just feels like an old spiritual in this track because of a stripped back it is instrumentally it's just a really great display of how fantastic her vocals are she howls she moans she croons her way through this song in a really emotive way jumping up and down her vocal range and the moments when she reaches her highest these ad-libs sound amazing and have her sounding more like trumpet than a human being she had such a unique vocal and it's interesting that they would take a song that is that is this skeletal and put it first right at the beginning of the album this song gives away to a Bessie Smith track nobody knows you when you're down and out which was originally recorded in the 1930s the song has a very bluesy instrumental that plays it very straight which happens with a few other tracks on here trouble in mind chill wind don't blow and ain't no use these tracks even though they are solid songs the instrumentation is a little lacking and surprises especially considering how great of a pianist Nina was though her playing in her improvisation on the last of those three tracks is great still this is pretty forgivable especially on this Bessie Smith track because it tells a story that is as old as time in such a heartfelt way everyone's there for the party as long as your foot in the bill but as soon as you're broke everyone's vanished and not only is it a good tune not only are the lyrics really vivid and telling but Nina's vocals are especially powerful on the turnaround on the back end of this song the song trouble in mind is another catchy tune attract that lyrically visits a very familiar blues theme that you know bad times today but maybe things will be better tomorrow very good track and you know not to give more credit to the dreary er songs on this LP but they really are where Nina feels her boldest on this record her vocal performance on the track end of the line is absolutely chilling hearing her singing with such a heavy vibrato while pushing herself into the deepest lows of her range of her vocal range plus the very nimble piano chords and arpeggios dipping in and out in the background adds a lot of drama to the tune and again that vibrato it's no wonder she's been such a heavy influence on people like Jamie Stewart of shoo-shoo an indie band that recently put out a covers album of songs that she had written or recorded and performed throughout her career another slower track on here that I love tell me more and more and then some the song is a bit of harmonica back blues has a pace that is as as molasses and it is a sultry back alley track moonlit night light breeze leaves falling temperatures in the low 50s it's like that the bass and the drums on this track are shadowy just hanging in the background like a stalker the harmonica chiming in and disappearing just as fast as it came like a car driving by in the distance and I love the way that Nina fills in the spaces and the silence with her voice and and the piano chord she just swipes at the silence so aggressively and she really sort of picks her shots sparingly and my favorite tracks on this thing are easily the two that this LP ends off with first her infamous cover of the song strange fruit the second Billie Holiday track to make it onto this LP a song that is really one of the most vivid and stomach-churning depictions of lynching in the southern United States and Nina Simone does it unspeakable justice and instrumentally she really values space again on this song a lot like the other Billie Holiday track here and it just makes the incredibly mournful lyrics on this song even more empowered and the way Nina is singing on this song the way she's a moding on this track it just makes the topic feel so much more sinister and and unspeakable the closing track on here sinner man which strange fruit sort of glides into pretty seamlessly is easily the longest track here ten minutes long and does not really feel boring or long-winded not for a single beat Nina and her band pulled together a really powerful rendition of this traditional song and they moved through multiple phases of this track too with Nina and her band just gaining more momentum and intensity with their playing as the track progresses it's really easy to get wrapped up and how they're playing off of one another in this song especially as the background vocals are boiling up and as the song moves along the starts and stops the drum fills the drum improvisation 'z Nina been propping a little on her piano with clapping happening in the background though the tune is good it's just really hearing these people play together so passionately that makes this song great and hearing Symone push her vocal range to the outer limits on the very very end of the track it just makes for such a powerful and moving finish overall pastel blues is a really solid set of songs for Nina Simone a great starting point if you haven't really listened to a full-length album of hers yet and a great display of her vocal abilities if you're really looking to get up close and personal with this really amazing voice and that's about it boy Cal we sure had fun this past classics week didn't we so long needle drops come on Cal say goodbye where are we going the review is over we're just gonna go see

voklugoW7e0,
EuokTnCkrKg,huh would you look at the time it's time for another review in classics week in this video right here I'm going to be making the case for why Fugazi's debut full-length LP repeater is well just a really freaking record Fugazi a Washington dc-based quartet who was one of the landmark acts of underground rock in the 90s and early 2000s and considering who was in the group it's not really that difficult to believe that they went on to do great things really right from the start with this album right here first off you have en Makai in the group guitarist lyricist singer songwriter most well known for fronting the hardcore punk band Minor Threat and after they had disbanded he was already working on actually taking the sounds of hardcore punk music down a darker more introspective more emotional path with bands like embrace a very short-lived band who had one album that is a bit of a forgotten stepping stone on the way to Fugazi but a group that a lot of punk fans do remember in this pre Fugazi era is the band led by co singer-songwriter in Fugazi guy Picciotto writes off spring a band that a lot of people credit is sort of being forefathers of emo emotional hardcore and the band's drummer Brendon can t actually transitioned over into Fugazi the old river zone 8 but he played in other groups as well that appeared on Dischord records the record label that Ian MacKaye has been spearheading for years up until the point where Fugazi formed and then there is Joe Lally who is actually a bit of a record label head himself the bass player of the band closes up the lineup and whose bass lines actually are really pivotal to the groove bass sound that Fugazi brought to the table there are a lot of things that I like about these bands and projects that were formed leading up to the formation of Fugazi but here in this band I feel is where all of it really clicked they were able to successfully take the ferocity the aggression of hardcore punk but apply it to more dynamic song structures flashier guitar playing more adventurous song structures as well and there were already a number of groups in the 80s that were experimenting with the sound of punk rock and hardcore punkin and weirding them up a little bit like the Minutemen who were incredibly eccentric or a big black or flipper who brought a lot of noise into the fold and there were bands like Husker Du as well who while they were very influenced by hardcore punk they appreciated pop music and lots of melody as well that's why a lot of these groups taking hardcore punk music infusing it with other genres are usually labeled post hardcore but Fugazi has never really been one for labels anyways so Fugazi came after all these bands but what makes them stick out to me is that they had a little bit of the best of all of these worlds intensely catchy songs with big shout along choruses and burning unforgettable guitar leads great riffs that just had a lot of punch to him but they weren't really heavy in fact they were very lean and had a lot of mid-range to them but but just a very sharp tone and occasionally the way that these guitars were layered was very noisy chaotic abrasive and even though I wouldn't call a melodies on this or any of Fugazi's records sweet for sure that did play a very pivotal role in the band's music and the band was also bringing these bass and drum grooves that were more complex than anything that these guys have worked with before in the punk bands they had been in previously and these bass lines and drum beats especially when the guitars are stripped back and you're simply listening to the bass and drums what they're playing the vibe the tone sounds like sort of a precursor to a lot of the alternative rock and grunge that would hit the mainstream just a few years later later in their discography the band would experiment more with sound play and song structure and weirder guitar sounds an instrumentation like on LP such as red medicine which was my favorite food Ozzy album for a while but repeater is just such a fantastic start for the band and anybody who's really looking to get into their music because of the busy rock instrumentation and interplay the grooves the stellar songwriting as well as the raw sound of the production - now this thing has 11 tracks it's about 35 minutes a little on the short side but it does not lessen the album's impact at all it starts off with this really slow drum and bass groove lots of space in this groove and on top of the guitars just pig pile and start blazing blaring the tone of the guitars on this track or just like indescribable it's so fiery it is searing pakodas lyrics on this track are a little difficult to decipher but the more I listen to them the more I feel like this track is sort of about choosing ignorant in the face of a problem that someone might need to fix passing the problems on shelving the problems using turning over and sleeping instead as a metaphor and I just love how snugly every piece of instrumentation fits into this track and other tracks on here too the base has a perfect space the drums have a perfect space the guitars have perfect space sort of chiseled out for them as well as Paseo does lyrics as well when he just delivers his words on this track he just sounds so incredibly gripping and passionate and he just shows so much conviction on this song to have a lot of the slower tracks on this thing are written by him as well and some of them have this pretty nice ballad like quality to them like blueprint I will admit that the lyrics on this track are a little puzzling to me they're really some of the most esoteric I've heard him sing in a track but I do hear a lot of themes of consumerism and humdrum choices and sort of in the box thinking what ultimately grabs me on this track or just the slow anthemic guitar chords and the several refrains that this song has to that just immediately stick in my head this is easily one of the Bands most immediate songs if you've never heard them before this would be a great track to start with however my favorite slow burner on this entire LP is is the closing track shut the door a Makai track and the groove on this track is written by a guitar lead that is difficult to describe other than just being uniquely Fugazi esque with just how smoothly and mechanically it sort of slinks up and down in pitch and I suspect that the lyrics on this track are about an overdose or the paradox of using drugs to alter your mind but also hurt your body to attain some kind of freedom but to go back to the lyrics you really can't read into what is being said on every track and sort of grasp onto a deeper meaning the song sit fisted find I think is also about some kind of drug addiction and the other themes on this LP revolver violence and death and other various things that the ban just sort of seems to be completely fed up with in a way even though it doesn't really seem that way on the surface it is a pretty morbid LP it's fascinated with all the issues that the Ale Society but it's also very concerned about all of them too it's sort of focused on connecting with the listener on this level and maybe warning the listener in a way but doesn't come off too preachy or annoying less difficult to pull apart lyrically as the song greed which over some blaring guitars we pretty much only hear the lyrics you wanted everything you needed everything that's pretty blunt and it does this for about one minute and 48 seconds that's a bit of a detour on this LP as is the song Brendon one which is just an instrumental track but with its really righteous anthemic guitars and catchy bass and drum groove the song is so energetic that the fact that it has no vocals no lyrics doesn't even really become a concern Plus this track also shows just how much Fugazi sound is based off of jamming as opposed to just simple one songwriter by himself songwriting and then sort of bringing the song to the rest of the band and this Jam and riff heavy vibe is really the meat of a lot of tracks on this album and that not only makes a lot of these songs pretty memorable because they feature killer riffs but it makes these tracks incredibly visceral and of course the punk acts that a lot of these guys played in prior to Fugazi were visceral as well but I like that these guys are able to slow things down a bit add more dynamics add more detail add more space but have this be just as visceral and just as exciting an experience there's the song repeat or the title track on this thing which is one of my favourite songs here because of its strangely claustrophobic mix and just how every sound the grainy distorted vocals the noisy brittle guitars and the rattling bass and drum grooves are just all conflicting with one another chaotically there's the track merchandise which features one of the most explosive choruses on this entire LP we are you know which is a bit of a shot of consumerism sort of telling the listener that they're not necessarily what they own or what they purchase what they buy into even though people are so much more than that what's funny is that often that started how people define themselves there's the track two beats off which has one of my favorite riffs on here and during the very dismal choruses they're sort of this jangle you set of guitar chords that remind me a lot of something specifically the Tom Morello did on rage against the machines third LP and then there's the track styrofoam which has the strangely sputtering guitar riff that I dig a lot some really propulsive drums behind this riff as well I mean track for track for track this is just a solid ass LP with this album from guys who's just really kicking ass right out of the gate with focus song topics and explosive energy but yet they're all so composed and just up here enough just cerebral enough to pull together instrumentation that sounds really composed and detailed this is definitely a record and definitely a band for people who love their punk music to have some inner workings some body and for just over a decade that's pretty much what made Fugazi such a significant act in underground rock music and yeah it's pretty much why this is one of my favorite bands ever I have so much of their albums transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it is this one of your favorite rock bands ever is this one of your favorite rock albums ever if not why why and in and if it's not that's cool that's cool Anthony Fantana repeater forever 
IommIsihl6c,hahahaha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the Johnny Cash album at Folsom Prison Johnny Cash is one of the biggest names in classic country and rockabilly music an American musical legend if you're looking for an artist whose sound represents the good ol USA few artists hit the nail harder on the head than mr. cash and when I say that I don't mean in the sense of I don't mean like that even though Johnny Cash did deliver some patriotic songs over the course of his career I mean more in the sense that Johnny Cash's tunes and his sound were heavily indebted to American roots music and gospel plus American folklore played a really huge role in a lot of the stories he told through his songs to not only that but he exemplified the typically conflicted American mindset so well in his personal life and his music to Johnny and his songs were god-fearing compassionate and loving but there was a seedy and violent side to him in his music too he had his struggles with drug abuse as well throughout his life and it's not like he was the only country or folk artist to capture the American spirit or maintain an outlaw image but what makes Johnny special to me is that he did it so well for so long maintaining a very large audience much of the time he did this right up to his final days of dropping records on Rick Rubin's American label and it was great that Johnny Cash left us on such a high note however the record I'm talking about in this review is Johnny Cash at what is possibly his highest note it also happens to be the most badass live album ever laid to tape and this LP continues to rank as Johnny Cash's best album because of its great performances great songs but also because it's a really revealing album too because Johnny Cash's his passion and his personality are on full display in the banter between the tracks the way that he interacts with the crowd of inmates watching his performance one of the most hilarious moments between songs being when he's telling everyone that what's happening is being recorded for an album and that you can't say l or or anything like that and Johnny Carrey it's a great selection of songs for this live show too that shows that he really thought hard and deep about how these songs would be received by a group of people who are locked up in a horrible place for an extended period of time he delivers tried and true hits which made him popular with inmates in the first place like I got stripes and the iconic opening track on this thing Folsom Prison Blues one of the most memorable moments in music being when Johnny Cash initially introduces himself and the crowd just goes insane and if you're already a fan of Johnny Cash you've probably heard just the studio version of this track off of Sun Records it was one of his biggest singles however hearing the live energy of Adhir and hearing the inmates just cheer and howl when he says that he shot a man in Reno just to watch him die it just adds an entirely new energy to the track and this crowd that he's playing to consistently yell and laugh and cheer at the most despicable parts of every song on this album sometimes causing Johnny to laugh and sort of break face mid-song even during somber moments like long black veil their tracks on this LP that also speak to themes of travel and freedom and escapism that would most likely lend somebody who's locked in a penitentiary some kind of relief or fantasy of a faraway place like orange blossoms special as well as Jackson where June Carter is singing along with Johnny Cash and the way that the drums are playing on orange blossoms special so tightly so mechanically it really feels like to me that a train is playing the rhythm section it just adds to the travel fantasy of the track and their tracks on this LP too that openly glorify drug abuse violence and getting jailed like it's a badge of honor like the song cocaine blues where essentially Johnny Cash guns his woman down for being unfaithful while he's on a coke binge he goes to bed almost immediately he tries to run away the next day the cops nab him down in Juarez and even though at the end of the story he says that he's gotten in trouble and let that cocaine and let that whiskey be the song's intended comedy and viciousness is kind of hard to ignore especially given that the crowd is going absolutely wild by the end of the track and tracks like this which are some of the best on here deliver a very frank and straightforward tale of being in jail was just a twist of dark humor like 25 minutes to go where lyrically Johnny Cash is literally counting down the minutes before he's hung by his neck in the gallows and he's singing about his last meal and the preachers trying to save his soul and they're testing the trap and the trap works just fine which causes him to to laugh there's some very humorous and novelty tracks that sort of uplift the spirit in a way like dirty old egg-sucking dog as well as I think the funniest track that Johnny Cash has ever done flushed from the bathroom of your heart which to me has some of the most clever wordplay in a country song and there are songs here too that that sort of deliver hope via spirituality like gray stone chapel and even though the crowd that Johnny is playing to seems really wild and unruly there are some songs on this album that do manage to sort of chill the whole crowd like send a picture of mother where essentially it's one inmate talking to another who was just about to leave get out of jail but it's sort of apologizing about how he tried to escape and now he's never gonna get out of here because the sentence was extended don't tell the family he's gonna be stuck in here for the rest of his life just write back tell him how things are going and send a picture of mother and there's also the song give my love to Rose where Johnny Cash is talking about just being privy to the last dying wishes of a man who's essentially leaving his family behind and there's the wall to which does have a bit of an interruption from the crowd but it's still one of the sadder songs on this LP a track about a man contemplating escaping but essentially just ends up killing himself due to the misery of being stuck in this prison and even though there is some similarities and melody and and drum beat and guitar phrasing across these tracks this album still feels very very far from one and maybe that's because of the variety of stories on these tracks as well as this thing just being an emotional rollercoaster it's not often that you hear a performer connect with a crowd so personally much less a crowd of inmates with these songs Johnny Cash sympathizes with these people he lasts with them he cries with them he mourns with them it's not surprising to find that at one point in his career he really focused on prison reform activism and even testified in front of the US Senate on the topic during a parole bill hearing in the 1970s plus Johnny played numerous unpaid concerts at prisons across America over the course of his career so it's not like the idea for at Folsom Prison was just some kind of crazy out of the blue experiment what's even funnier is that Johnny was not some kind of hardened criminal however he's sang about the surliest stuff so off-the-cuff that everybody assumed that he had done some kind of hard time at some point in his life in popular music today the image of a criminal is typically reserved for something like gangsta rap hip-hop is definitely the the home right now for the modern musical outlaw however with at Folsom Prison and the subsequent at San Quentin Johnny Cash proves himself to be an original modern music outlaw if that's the kind of storytelling you're into then at Folsom Prison is probably one of the best go-to albums now as far as the production on this thing if you're already familiar with the country twang sound of Sun Records and Columbia Records in the 1950s and 1960s then what at Folsom Prison sounds like will probably not be that big of a surprise to you I actually think another reason this album is so great because of the very raw and live performance that was coming together musically on this album that was a bit of a breath of fresh air from the increasingly commercial and pristine sounding recordings of country music throughout the 1960s and 70s the musical performance here especially with the guitars and with the drums is tight its fiery there's just a lot of momentum there's a lot of energy these songs really pulsate they flow they fly they speed by the ballads are tender they're slow they're moving they're really human vocally Johnny isn't as OnPoint as he is in the studio but his person his humor his conviction more than makes up for it and yeah the instrumentals the vocals as well as the inmates cheering all these sounds throughout this record are really just bleeding into one another sometimes drowning one another out however it's it's this kind of wild spine and eighty that I love to hear in a live album it just adds to that sense of place quality that transports the listener directly to Folsom Prison when listening to this album in a nutshell that is at Folsom Prison a country record that is so great that it'll probably make you pity people that say that they don't like country music transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why and why did you feel either of those two things be specific this is gonna be on the final exam cool cool Anthony Fantana Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison forever 
zaumyfPx3Ao,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for our first review of 2013 to 2014 classics week oh did you say can't lassic s-- oh my god it's kouchuu chest uh it knee if you're going to be reviewing a super cool band like the vet none around you're gonna need email a super cool sunglasses I couldn't possibly accept your cool guy sunglasses but you are right now but by kaljaa chesta thanks for the glasses I'll always wear them during this review The Velvet Underground is a beloved New York band featuring the singing and songwriting talents of the recently deceased Lou Reed and I don't just want to focus on Lou though because throughout the best parts of the Bands career they also featured songwriting credits as well as the instrumental talents of multi-instrumentalists Sterling Morrison John Cale and Maureen Tucker there wasn't really a strong pecking order to the band's lineup which did change over the course of the group's career to the point where the Velvet Underground's final album featured no original members on it whatsoever squeeze an LP that I don't recommend you listen to however I think it is incredibly interesting that in such a short period of time from 1967 to 1970 with such turbulence going on in the band's lineup in their style and their sound The Velvet Underground still managed to put out four full-length LPS that make up one of the most influential discographies in rock music ever it's not often you see a band that puts out a record that is as experimental and is noisy and it's freewheeling as white light/white Heat and then just two years later they're dropping the very commercially sculpted as well as very enjoyable loaded aside from their music what made the Velvet Underground so great was their spine a'ti their ability to successfully accept and reject every convention music had to offer during their time with songs that were very poppy and lovely and gentle beautiful on the ears as well as tracks that were just vivid gritty disgusting displays of sex violence and drugs that would make most squeamish and most importantly what I think The Velvet Underground and this record represents is that great music doesn't need to be commercially successful as well as critically acclaimed upon initial release because clearly this is an instance where we all got it later however let's not just analyze the band in a vacuum for one would we be praising albums like this today if it weren't for the commercial success of albums like loaded or the commercial success Lou Reed saw in his solo career would we be loving The Velvet Underground and seeing them as seminal and influential if Andy Warhol hadn't taken them under his wing are there other factors here I could be taking into account probably all I'm saying is that while great music is great music fame and acclaim are a bit of a perfect storm sometimes plus it's not like development underground was the only band experimenting to such an extreme degree within this time period of music yet Frank Zappa and the mothers of invention Captain Beefheart the Sonics bringing the darker side of garage rock the noisier side of garage rock to the table avant-garde music was in full swing psychedelic rock was in full swing there's also a very general appreciation for the world of rock and roll on this LP - plus there were some other experimental rock and folk acts in New York in this time period as well like the gods as well as the fogs and the holy modal rounders regardless of what influences though The Velvet Underground & Nico is an incredibly bold record for its time and for today and is also very deserving of its definitive and iconic status in rock music it's filled with experimental artful songs that range from being infectious to utterly strange and twisted and the best tracks on here managed to do both at the same time even though the cell P is the star of The Velvet Underground studio recording career another thing does make this album special it features a group of contributions from German actress model and singer Nico obviously she's build on the album's title and even though she was pretty just on this record because Andy Warhol wanted her to be on this record she did have a number of very reputable solo albums after working with The Velvet Underground and I recommend listening to them especially if you enjoy the several tracks she sings on here like femme fatale which is a very gentle ballad that's got a faint tambourine led backing beat mixed far into the left channel there's all these very soft guitar arpeggios that feel sort of muddy floating around in the mix there are these somewhat goofy backing vocals and bad yeah and the way that the instrumentation on this track comes together is a little loose it's not as apparent here as it is on other tracks from this LP but know that when the Velvet Underground gets fast it's loud they also get kind of chaotic but the spotlight on this track is really on Nico's voice it's womanly she has a very unique cadence to the way that she sings her words most likely due to her accent it's not a waifish voice while it is very soft on the ears it's very sturdy as well her singing on this song and the other tracks here is very pretty but it's also offbeat in a sense as well even though she was sort of tagged on to the band by Warhol for this record it is a really great pairing Nico impresses is well on the very long droney and sort of OneNote All Tomorrow's Parties a track that has this very fast repetitive prepared piano phrase hammering away in the left channel and Nico's very ghostly verses on this track trade places with these guitar leads that sort of jump up and down this key that the song is being played and the playing of this guitar sort of unrefined it's kind of messy it adds to the overall looseness of this track too and the very heavy stomping bass tambourine beat of the drum which is very simple it's very basic it also adds to a certain characteristic of the track that makes it feel centuries-old The Velvet Underground's instrumental performance on this track is is anything but composed and I feel like the results of that intended messiness on this particular track is that the music feels like a bit of a clamour on this song I feel like with this track I'm in the middle of some kind of festive gathering people are dancing and talking and hanging around and enjoying one another's company and the third track on here that Nikko sings on I'll be your mirror is a track that is another very simple short ballot not too unlike femme fatale a song that's a little more stripped-down a little prettier more accessible and of subject matter that I think is a lot more lovely gentle friendly I do love these songs but I feel like The Velvet Underground's iconic sound really came through on a lot of the other tracks on here like the opener Sunday morning with it's very sticky celeste melody that opens up the song a melody that is not only gorgeous but is also gorgeous and the dreamy instrumentation behind it complements it perfectly it's just an amazing song every single time this track out I'm just like astonished at how pretty it is pretty and soft and gentle because of Lou Reed's very breathy vocals on this song the reverb on his vocals to that it doesn't seem like there's that much at the beginning of the track but as the song progresses into certain parts it increases there's a very faint viola drone on this track too that just softens everything and just makes it feel very mm then and then you've got some piano chords and some guitar leads that come in later on the track and give it a little bite the song really kind of sounds like just the Morning Sun coming through the window and kissing your face the leaves are green the birds are chirping there's a little bit of a breeze outside the temperature is perfect it's really what morning must be like for morning people however these very soft and gentle drones take a very sinister dark horrifying turn on my favorite track here venus and furs a song that lyrically is about a dominatrix type character and a song that sonically is a lot like All Tomorrow's Parties in that it feels like this foreign archaic gathering but so much more sultry and sexy and subversive with these wailing viola lead melodies and these very brittle dissonant guitars and on top of all of it Lou Reed delivering his lyrics as if he's some kind of desperate submissive just begging to be whipped as he sort of acts and role of a character from a novella of the same title which this song is based off of again this song is droney but it's also dicey like another favorite for many on this LP heroine not my favorite track on this LP but in a weird way I think maybe the most beautiful song on this record because of how frank and honest' it is as well as how interesting the free-flowing background instrumentation is behind Lou Reed's story and vocals the song and a lot of moments is floating in this very slow very just formless cloud of viola drones some very light drumming some slow guitar strumming and lyrically Lou Reed rambles and meanders and wanders through this heroin fueled haze of his but sort of unpredictably the song just all of a sudden gains momentum picks up speed mo Tucker is playing this drum beat that just gets more and more tension and Lou Reed's verses on here range from blissful toward the beginning of the track where he is feeling like he's jesus's son and there are some moments here in the verses where things get kind of dark and disturbing where he is voluntarily and consciously nullifying his life he's closing in on death and he doesn't really care about much of anything I feel like this song specifically in the Velvet Underground's discography speaks toward the power of music and poetry and how they can put someone into a situation I think this also happens on the song I'm waiting for the man a very nasty messy noisy rock and roll song with a relentless rickety drum beat and the song is essentially about a Lou Reed is waiting for his drug dealer and in this song he paints this guy is this weird shadowy elusive character but it's also the situation surrounding this character that makes this song just so vivid you can smell you can taste you can feel this song with the $26 in his hand Lou Reed is going to a part of town where white people usually aren't and he's being questioned as a white guy like what are you doing around here and the very interestingly noisy rock tunes don't just stop there there are others on here like the song there she goes which is a track essentially about a prostitute or prostitution and a lot of people sort of stop their description there but what I think is most interesting about the track is the point of view of the narrator of the song Lou Reed essentially singing about this prostitute from the standpoint of someone who seems like they're really angry or pissed off or they really care about everything that she's doing like they're somehow involved in her personal life maybe in a romantic sense and there's also the song run run run which to me is kind of like an electric Bob Dylan nightmare and Dylan's influence in my opinion doesn't really just stop there on this record it also bleeds into the Black Angels death song - it's one of the many tracks that Velvet Underground when playing this song live would sort of stretch it out - very challenging lengths and then there is the final song on here European Sun which is a track that is dedicated to a professor that we read had at Syracuse University not that it really has any bearings on what the song is or it's about it has a few short lines of lyrics toward the front end of the song and then from there it progresses into an incredibly noisy dissonant and challenging instrumental not really my favorite of the Velvet Underground's more abrasive moments but still it does fit in with the general not fitting in vibe of this album and in a nutshell that is the Velvet Underground's debut full-length LP definitely one of a kind rock record but still an album whose relevance and importance is heavily dependent upon everything that happened with development underground and Lou Reed after it which is not necessarily a bad thing because when tracking the seedy underbelly of rock-and-roll this is an important part of that evolution a lot like the very first moment when the multicellular organisms living in the ocean first sprouted legs and crawled out of the water to walk on land there is part of me that prefers just a little bit more the very freewheeling sound of this band sophomore LP and the very gentle and slightly more composed feel of their self-titled LP their third LP but still when you're talking about The Velvet Underground's entire discography you're just comparing one great LP - another great LP I just would hate for a lot of you to listen to this album like it and not listen to their other work as well again I would hate it 50 years later and we're still peeling slowly and seeing transition if you given this Velvet Underground LP listen what did you think about it love it hate it and why did you feel either of those two things cool cool forever 
yYEZK6_MlDw,hi everyone and common down bringing the energy lower this is a video in the midst of 2013's last week where I'm listing out all my favorite things musically from this past year and this is the cherry on top of list week my favorite albums of 2013 50 of them that's 10 30 40 I'm hyped cals hyped yeah you're hyped I hope because there are 50 albums on this list and that's a lot of albums I'm gonna sort of plow through the first 25 of them and then sort of get in a little more detail as we get closer to the number one spot let's go to number 50 and LP I enjoyed earlier this year didn't make it on my love list but still managed to pop onto this list Vampire Weekend's modern vampires of the city number 49 comadre self-titled album unfortunately the band is now broken up it will be their last album due to that and number 48 kink rules 6 feet beneath the moon 47 Fox again we are the 21st century ambassadors of peace and magic and after that at 46 the self-titled run the jewels LP at number 45 Keller talked with me and at 43 to Shea Amore's is survived by at number 43 The Dillinger Escape plan's one of us is the killer at 42 the drones with icy seaweed and at 41 the My Bloody Valentine record that dropped this year MBV at number 40 a very eerie ambient release from the haxon cloak on excavation and at 39 the beach fossils LP clashed the truth 38 KKK's the kill as the eulogy and 37 the sludge noise outfits stone tighten with the LP scratch-and-sniff at number 36 young fathers with tape 2 and number 35 Black Milk no poison no paradise at 34 Bill Callahan with Dream River at 33 Smith westerns with soft will and at number 32 Daft Punk hops on a time machine of wonder and goes back several deck it's in the album random access memories 31 Kurt Vile with waken on a pretty days and a 30 dark side with psychic at 29 the Flatbush zombies mixtape better off dead and a 28 Buick and GaSe with the experimental industrial rock folk pop everything album general dome at 27 Cage the Elephant with melophobia and at 26 of Montreal with lousy with sylveon Brier one of the Georgia Bands best albums in years halfway through the last [Music] and number 25 in my opinion the most consistent member of the wu-tang clan comes out with yet another very enjoyable LP the collaborative concept album with Adrian young Ghostface Killah is 12 reasons to die and at number 24 a pretty ambitious combination of black metal screamo post rock really melodic really passionate lots of climaxes some interesting interludes throughout the LP to the deafheaven album sunbather and at number 23 a pretty straightforward solid but very well produced techno release from Daniel Avery with the album drone logic and at number 22 some beautiful ballads from Julia halter on the album loud city song this is my favorite album of hers yet especially given that the instrumentation on this thing is so much more ambitious than it's been on her previous releases at number 21 another LP that is pretty ambitious the new YC the cynic album G&K a lot of very heady tracks on this album dealing with things like power race religion the dude has a lot of personality drops a lot of jewels Frank Drake does some good very good production on this thing the selfie has me excited to see where YC the cynic is gonna go next with his music and another artist who excited me with their new LP John Hopkins with immunity a very interesting techno and house release where pianos and acoustic instrumentation and some very beautiful moving melodies come together with some hypnotic driving beats and in my opinion John's solo work has been getting better and better and better with each release and it just makes me wonder where he can take it next at number 19 one of the most blissful smile inducing in-your-face pop albums of the year relentless with its sugar-coated cuteness the new Kyary Kyary Pamyu Pamyu album Nunda collection and a number 18 another female singer but this record actually hits you relentlessly with its darkness the new Chelsea wolf record pain is beauty life is so bleak at number 17 a very bold rap collaboration featuring one of my favorite MCS as of late Billy woods and elusive come together as Armand Hammer for the album race music and at number 16 easily the most grimy filthy disgusting tough-as-nails hiphop mixtape I've heard this year demacia sixes six Commandments at number 15 a very mid-paced heavy and lyrically dense cutting and sharp punk album produced by curb Balu of converge as well as some great production on this thing this routine is hell's howl and a very snarky clever smart catchy post hardcore a little bit of indie rock in this release to the new future of the left album how to stop your brain in an accident at number 13 a very thunderous powerful emotional lyrically cutting as well post-punk release I've been on the Gothic side from savages with the new LP silence yourself some of my favorite rock tracks of the year on this album I love the production on this thing I love the vocals I love the burning blazing guitars on this thing too and at number 12 a comeback record from one of the heaviest densest and most reliable names in death metal the new gore guts album coloured sands and at number 11 a very electronic textured twisted and demanding adventure through of how-to hours of sounds the new Autechre album ex and that places us in our top ten let's do a lot of people ask me hey have there been in albums this year that you hated before but then you sort of grew to like him to love him a lot of maybe you disliked him a little but now you just totally love them well the music they're really good I mean the rosiness can you and this album really is an example of that and it climbed so high up onto my list too for the most part the LPS that I loved I continued to love throughout the year and the ones that I didn't I continued to not love them but sitting at number 10 a really strange goth out low fine noise rock release with some sour notes odd ghoulish vocals and some of the most wacked-out songs that I've heard this year the new Grave baby's album crusher face face at number 9 a very chilling eerie whisper quiet wrap release a very unorthodox album for the genre but I thought filled with captivating wordplay bars and some instrumentals that really set the tone for the style of rapping that this MC does perfectly the new Cobham the Knights gambit at number 8 this album doesn't sound that much different from the previous release to come from this band but I felt as I listened to this LP more and more and more throughout the year that this was the sound of this band really perfecting their sound just making better songs making more dynamic songs and even though I'm not expecting a radical change on their next LP I am looking forward to what they do next the new Ice Age album you're nothing if you're looking for some fast blistering loose and chaotic post-punk Punk and noise rock do look this album up and at number 7 it's a combination of harsh noise and hip hop on the new clipping album mid-city a collection of tracks whose appeal is really difficult to explain given that the beats are so abrasive but I do find so many of the courses on this thing to be incredibly catchy and even though dovey digs does lyrically dive into a lot of standard club oriented gangsta lines throughout the tracks on this thing the more that I listen to and I hope that you listen to it if you do end up liking this thing or you do give it a chance or more chances than you already have the approach to portraying the sort of gangsta image on a few of the tracks here is pretty self-aware in its juxtaposition against these incredibly noisy beats as well as deeper lines in tracks as well as some courses that acknowledge that what is being rapped about is dark or sick or just not that the lyrics or the beats or this album are being made to be bad on purpose but what I think is happening here is that some of the imagery that davido is rapping about is finally being given the gritty grimy portrayal it deserves not the glorified one at number six some really great songs fantastic vocals and just man a strange I don't want to say dark but maybe sort of spiritual aura surrounding the music on this album it's a vibe that really moves me and captivates me I love the drumming on this record I think the guitar playing is really solid as well the new Marian the believer album blood donation I have to say that I am a little sad that this album is yet to come out in North America I'm hoping that some people can sort of hit YouTube hit the Internet give this album a little bit more at number five one of the most electrifying I'll use that word again like I did in my previous video electrifying releases from this Japanese noise rock outfit long-standing career here discography spanning back to the 90s the new note banana record fetch and a number four I think this band's best record in a while and one of the best rock and roll records of this year the new Queens of the Stone Age album of a like clockwork even though this record is little sadder toned down and dismal in comparison to some of their more hard-hitting stuff like rated R that came out back in the 90s I do think this album is is fantastic for being a little more dynamic and has some really catchy songs has some passion of Google's coming from Josh ha me and some really great and memorable guitar leads and choruses and at number three one of the most twisted ambitious and varied black metal records I've heard in a while it is a damn shame that this band had to break up after the release of this album especially given how bold and adventurous this record is infusing black metal with elements of electronic music and industrial putting together some riffs and odd time signatures to some vocals that not only just are very raw and wretched but also deliver some blood-curdling screams as well as some very clean ah there are moments where this album is just oh so grim it chills me and spots here where it's so beautiful and inspiring too of course I'm talking about the new altar of plagues album teeth glory and injury and at number two one of the most freakish musical adventures I had gone on all year with tracks that bring together acoustic drum Tambor's and electronic drum Tambor's into a psychotic frenzy of rhythm as well as some experimental and ambient tracks that that live up to the word strange it's an album that while on the surface sonically it is disjointed but when you look at the the formation of all of these tracks and what sounds and what vibes and what levels of intensity all the songs shoot for it's it's so clear as to how all of these songs just connect and not only are the vocals either incredibly moving or passionate or unnerving but this is just one of those records that is is just in short a journey the new knife album shaking the habitual and on the needle drops number one album of the year spot this is a Canadian artist I think one of the best records that this guy's put out one of the best records in this genre what I like so much is how this guy approaches sound and approaches texture bringing together all of these colors that that are so soft and easygoing and yet just build them up into something heavy and epic I like that it feels like I'm listening to instrumentation however it's so heavily treated and layered and sampled that it couldn't be anything but some kind of a and saying electronic manipulation I just can't put into words the amount of emotional power that I find in a lot of the the compositions on this record I feel like this album is a bit of an apocalyptic opus I think Tim brought it to the next level not only writing tracks that were very engaging but doing so much with so little just the simplest shift in melody feels like I'm just close to tears this record is just so unspeakably cinematic and beautiful and dark as well it just makes me feel like the end of the world is around the corner I absolutely love it and that's about it transition that is my albums list and that is pretty much the end of list week hmm-what albums on this list did you love Anthony whoa great list man that list was fantastic whoa my favorite albums were like this this and

SyQz4cAF4iE,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and as you may already know if you've been watching all of my videos this week it is last week where I'm basically talking about all of my favorite things musically to occur over the past year 2013 in case you talking honorable mentions music videos EPS and now singles and some promotional tracks there but mostly singles I'm gonna be listing out my 50 favorite singles from this past year I'm gonna give you info down in the description box to where you can hear most if not all of these singles and because I have 50 songs on this list I'm going to plow through the first half of this thing just mentioning names and song titles and then we'll talk a little bit more about you know the ones that are left over as we get closer to the number one spot so my favorite 50 singles of 2013 are as follows number 50 Machinedrum eyes don't lie 49 to che amore just exists and 48 Denzel Curry with threats 47 yeah yeah yes with sacrilege and 46 daft punk's get lucky and number 45 Kanye West comes in with bound 2 and then at 44 it's Lady Gaga with applause at 43 it's Eminem's berserk at 42 the non-album single from

Elephant with come a little closer 38 John Hopkins with open eyes signal 37 MGMT with alien days and 36 James Blake's retrograde 35 compeller talk with brain Bren one of the more melodic tracks off of their new heavy metal your ass off LP at 34 Janelle Monae with the very beautiful ballad prime time featuring miguel off of her new LP and coming in after that it is the foxes in track no destruction at 33 32 Church with recover in 31 the Smith westerns single varsity at number 30 it is the Rolling Stones sampling underachiever single the proclamation at 29 the very dark and gritty Earl Sweatshirt single hive and at 28 one of the most explosive and viral singles of this year lords Royals at 2020 noisy punked out in sludgy Saturday from the new dope body 7-inch and after that at 26 the soap and skin single for the track sugar bread and here we are halfway through the list already number 25 the Mafia six single go hard a very grimy dark dirty southern hip-hop single that is twisted I love the really epic chord progressions going on in the background and yellow wolf does a pretty nice feature on this thing too great track one of the most hard-hitting hip-hop tracks of the year I think at number 24 one of the most infectious dance songs off of the new disclosure LP settle F for you at number 23 the very personal and closely linked tracks Sunday's best Monday's worst from the new single for those tracks from Black Milk Detroit producer and rapper and 22 a pretty stone feast strange noisy and dark dance track from factory floor on the song fall back at number 21 one of this year's most popular and absurd hip hop singles the very reverb heavy and catchy Shabba from ASAP Ferg might rapping how I praise the Jesus in duck dynasty whoa at number 20 a really hard-hitting and gritty and industrially tinged techno track from Gustav wash died on the song pursuit I must say his name every time like that yes at number 19 the very soulful boyish and deep-voiced came cruel with one of the best songs off of his new LP easy easy and at number 18 a track that is incredibly funky hitting punky and infused with various sounds and influences from around the musical world the mail yourself down track fix my life at number 17 this song is like being transported straight into one of the greatest Super Nintendo games of all time the new Anamanaguchi single meow and at number 16 one of the biggest bangers off of the new mi a LP bring the noise and number 15 a full croc track that is incredibly dreamy seductive pretty one of my favorites from his new full-length LP Kurt vials wakin on a pretty day and at number fourteen one of the catchiest hip-hop tracks from this guy's new LP infectious chorus very dark lyrics I love this guy's spacious shouted delivery Billy woods with Tinseltown and some great production from blockhead to boot on this track 213 the very distorted gothic strange and twisted over an underground from the new Grave babies LP crusher and at number 12 well I think is banner of the year material Bauer and just boys getting together on the track higher with a vocal cut from Jay Z on the song 2 and number 11 one of the most beautiful ballads from this band's new LP a reference to a souls of mischief song lyrically the Vampire Weekend song step when a tool yeah always step to my peril at number 10 one of the most insane zany colorful and over-the-top tracks as well as catchy and fun fun fun fun fun tracks from an LP featuring one of the most electrifying pop singers to come out of Japan Kyary Pamyu Pamyu x' invader invader at number nine one of my favorite pop singles of this year it was a shame that I didn't really love the rest of this bands LP quite as much as this song but still really good tune in my opinion Hyams the wire and at number eight danceable post-punk beats blaring noisy guitars somewhat just drain dismal vocals come through on the new Ice Age single ecstasy and number seven is this Canadian bands disco Opus Arcade Fire's reflector at number six the Miriam the believer track invisible giving one of the most soulful ambitious with how long it is and beautifully dark songs I've heard this year period and at number five the very loud heavy and catchy as well Queens of the Stone Age track my god is the Sun at number four well I think is quite possibly the most electrifying rock song of this year savages shut up and at number three an unexpected single that came from an unexpected collaboration but is one of the catchiest most enjoyable songs that I think this particular artist has had his hand in aerial pink and harm with hang on to life and at number two my favorite hip-hop single of this year a song that I have played to myself over and over and over for a pretty countless amount of times really one of the most creative hip-hop songs to come out of the mainstream this year Pusha T's numbers on the boards I might sell a brick on my birthday 36 years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day gal and at number one what I think is an amazing opening track for this band's new full-length LP not only in how danceable the track is but how it fuses electronics with if-if acoustic drum Tambor's in such a way where many tracks in this new full-length LP sound like some kind of insane drum circle which features some of the strangest vocals yet to come out of this bands full-length LPS some funky synth bass on this track too I'm talking of course about the knife song a tooth for and RR and there you go numero uno your transition so what is your favorite saying of the list that was this year and if you're saying that you'll love wasn't an Anthony's list what was your favorite from the sangs NAT with the list so 23 the list music good sayings forever 
96bcfJLNe2Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is another day of last week where I talk about some of my favorite releases of this past year and in this particular video we are talking favorite EPS of 2013 II got you Jesta oh yay and I'm basically going to be shouting out 15 of my favorite EPS of this year this list should be pretty interesting considering that I did not review a lot of these EPS and I'm sort of just talking about them having heard them and having liked them but didn't really you know make a formal video on them some of which I regret not doing that for because of how good they are but either way check these out I'm gonna try to give the best short description of these that I can so if you are into this kind of music maybe you'll check this out number 15 the new active child EP v rapport EP lots of grooving electronics on this thing falsetto somewhat angelic vocals some interesting vocal guests and a solid set of tracks no songs on here I felt that were as urgent as many tracks from his previous full-length LP but a very pretty listen in deed but maybe ever so slightly prettier the number 14 spot the open EP Couture say Keane said a handful of tracks that are very droney spacious ballads sung with very very very shy tender vocals it's a set of tracks that I wouldn't say are incredibly eventful but still very sound rich textured pretty and moving at number 13 something that is a little low Phi as well also with a bit of a shy singer-songwriter type of vibe but a much darker much noisier much more tortured the new Giles Corey EP hint her cough howl all in turkic just three tracks on this thing I was looking for more from it there were some tracks where I wasn't crazy how the guitars were mixed on this thing but still a very eerie EP and this isn't the same sort of creep vain as many tracks from his previous full-length LP that a lot of you may remember I dug quite a bit at lean number 12 spot the new ghost EP Swedish rock and metal outfit ghost I wasn't crazy about their latest full-length album all the way through though I did think there were some great tracks on it and basically what they do on this new EP has come together with Dave Grohl who does some production and some instrumentation on this thing and the band does some pretty decent covers of artists like Depeche Mode Roky Erickson they do an Abba deep cut on this thing too and overall it's just a solid effort some very fun eerie occult revisions on this thing next at number 11 the new title fight EEP spring songs some indie rock and post hardcore on this EP several tracks and while I don't really think these guys are the most distinct band on the Block in terms of style and sound I do think they know how to write a catchy song or two which they do at least a few times on this EP at number 10 the new parquet courts EP tally all the things that you have broken I hate your face for breaking all these things tally all the things that you broke another indie rock EP I've done this one a little bit more I do think parquet courts wrote some of their catchiest and some of their weirdest material on here as well with that final track running almost eight minutes with a weird drum machine in the background if you're looking for some in Iraq with a bit of a tongue-in-cheek attitude and a lot of energy a lot of gusto then do check this thing out next at number nine the new piece Swanson EP Punk authority a very abrasive combination of just pure noise what I perceive to be an influence from the power electronics route and techno on this thing with some very propulsive beats this thing is pretty rhythmic and looping and cyclical with its hypnotic repetitions but it has this harsh abrasive noise element that really just numbs the mind turns it to mush over the the very short period of time that the CPU lasts next the new soup cans EP at number 8 parasite brain some of the most abrasive in-your-face balls-to-the-wall garage punk and noise rock this year these guys are filthy disgusting nasty all over this EP at number seven the new Lord EP love club even though I wasn't in love with her full-length LP from beginning to end because of just how stripped back some of the instrumentals were her very simple kind of skeletal sound works really well on on these five tracks and this EP does have some of her best songs from this year so it works out I think she has a very good voice I think she has style I think she has direction however I mean she is young and that does show in her vocal abilities that does show in her songwriting abilities that does show in her lyrical abilities but I think considering how mature she is right now at this point in her career she's someone who is worth watching at number six the Milo EP things that happen at night essentially Milo being a very eccentric somewhat nerdy rapper with a very pronounced personality in his raps but a very sort of slow spacious flow and he is writing a lot of very cloudy trap rap beats on this thing that are just very ethereal he put out two EPS this year and this was my least favorite of the two but I still liked it quite a bit next at number five the new Flaming Lips EP piece sword you should know the Flaming Lips at this point experimental rock outfit art rock outfit psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop outfit I wasn't too insane over the last full length they put out this year I didn't like it but I thought it was a little overbearing and sort of one-dimensional with its constant bleakness and lack of musical variation however I did think there were some pretty bright joyous and texturally interesting songs on this new EP of theirs I thought it was pretty interesting that they wrote at least some of this music for the Ender's Game soundtrack and only one song actually made it into the movie with the rest of the EP from what I have been told allegedly being rejected by the producers of the movie regardless of what these songs are written for I do think it is a solid EP and and in my opinion at least a more enjoyable listen than the album that they just dropped next at number four some industrial techno coming from the electronic music duo collaborative trade with the Shi works double zero five EP four tracks on this thing of techno tracks that are somewhat midsize around four five six minutes each and the beats are hard-hitting the textures are just really rough and kind of gritty grimy noisy it just has the straightforward simplicity to it but I just love how thick and heavy the beats and grooves are I just like how visceral and undeniable these grooves are I've got a move to this thing yeah there is something so cold and strange about the noises that fill many of these tracks up just some really interestingly produced techno tracks with some great grooves at number three the new Shlomo EP laid out this electronic music producer is a bit of a stylistic chameleon and I feel like he really did something interesting on this EP by taking this currently popular trap music sound and doing something really dark and spacious and moody with it though a lot of people out there are familiar with electro fusions with trap and and cloud wraps influence coming from trap music this to me stuck out especially with some of the vocal samples as being a little more soulful melodic very well put together though I do think this thing was sort of one-dimensional to a degree it did have some of my favorite songs of this year on it at number two the new bolt sir EP Ora these guys are a somewhat new Swedish death metal outfit they're a duo and this new EP of theirs is a part of their very short discography it's got three tracks on it three monsters really that rare II from like six to ten minutes and I liked what this band was doing with a death metal on this EP al I thought they were writing with some pretty progressive structures writing multifaceted songs as well as tracks that had a lot of dynamics with ladder spots quieter spots variations in the vocals and throughout these tracks especially on the first two songs here the guitar melodies are absolutely sinister and they're very bright too they really stick out in the mix it's a solid EP check it out and finally for my number one spot my favorite EP of the year Milo's things that happen at day if you couldn't have already guessed with Riley lake on production for every track here this Wisconsin rapper puts together a series of songs that not only have interesting structures some very progressive weird funny and very personal at times lyrics but some of the tracks on here especially like almond milk paradise I thought I had some of the catchiest courses in hip hop this year and I do think that this EP features Milo's best material yet and I think that's all I can say about it I just really enjoy it and that's about it cool cool transition every single EP I talked about in this video there's information in the description box of this video to where you can find out about these EPS or maybe even hear them what did you think of this list did you love it hate it why what were some of your favorite EPS of this year what EPS did I forget which EPS are you pissed off that I didn't like which ep's did your mom turn you on to and you're like whoa mom I didn't know you were into such cool music but I mean I have been showing you some cool music and like you've liked cool music like forever so that's the best family love one another it's the holidays everybody EPS 2013 music forever 
odPbMnGaiA8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's list week or we're listing out a bunch of different things highlights of 2013 and yeah this is essentially my favorite music videos of the year my top 25 actually let's plow through the start of this thing and then talk a little bit more about the ones at the top number 25 the new eight-track music video for the song jumbo lots of interesting basketball themed effects throughout this track with many repeats of this guy throughout this basketball court sort of throwing the basketballs to himself over and over and over number 24 the chance the rapper music video for everybody something I love the layers and effects and sort of the one picture on top of another picture in the shapes of the silhouette of chance rapping throughout this video it's really nicely done number 23 the new Macklemore and Ryan Lewis music video for can't hold us Macklemore was responsible for a few of my favorite music videos over the past few years and this one has maybe his biggest budget yet there's a pirate ship animals tons of people it's insane and the number 22 spot is held by cloud controls dojo rising an interesting story about a girl whose party is ruined by a clown and she seeks revenge and at number 21 Death Grips takes a really interesting approach at producing a music video with Zach Hill and sea ride as well as flatland are all having on head cameras and sort of viewing this concert that they did it South by Southwest from the first person point of view and editing all this footage together with some really psychedelic effects I'm in it for a split second which is kind of weird but the reason I really do like this thing is because I thought it was a novel idea and approach to doing a music video novel but also very old-school is our number 20 spot foxes in the music video - the title track from their latest full-length LP which is shot in a graveyard and is loaded with tons of trippy strange effects and repeated visuals and strange colors I love how vintage it looks and yet how sort of modernized all of these strange psychedelic visual effects are and at number 19 the Earl Sweatshirt video for the song I've definitely one of the darkest eeriest rap videos you're gonna see this year and number 18 gizelle Stein's pursuit so really interesting pullback shots throughout this video and some strange but I think coded with meaning visuals as well some of which may be socio-political but it's still very well lit well put together interesting color palette on this thing to number 17 the unglued 'add organs music video a bit of a stop-motion PSA about donating your organs the overall aesthetic of the music video was a little ratty but I do think that that it adds to the character of the video and I do think it's it's a cute sentiment that not just the song but the visuals here carry number 16 one of the most twisted videos you're gonna catch this year one that came out on Halloween the curtain music video from the band portal Australian experimental metal act in this music video inspired by Edgar Allen Poe's the worm is definitely one sick puppy at number fifteen a sad story adultery a small town and gender double standards are played throughout on the new yeah yeahs video for the song sacrilege and at number fourteen I do think this video is really well put together in terms of effects and edits and lots of entertaining imagery and just lots of fun and personality the music video for eminem berzerk the video a lot like the single is very loud it's punchy it's in your face but what I thought was even more fun and sort of a twisted hilarious kind of way was the number 13 spot unknown Mortal orchestras swim and sleep like a shark a story about a puppet who's a bit of a peeping tom and likes to pleasure himself while watching others in their private moments there's a very hilarious strange and clever ending on this thing too but what is strange threw out is the video on our number 12 spot the beach house video for wishes which I believe was directed by Eric Wareheim of Tom goes to the mayor Tim and Eric awesome show great job and it definitely shows with ray wise aka Leland Palmer playing one of the lead roles in this music video lip-syncing along with pretty much everything Victoria Legrand sings and he's essentially kicking off what is possibly the weirdest opening ceremony to a sporting event I've ever seen in my entire life but very well shot another interesting music video concept on our number 11 spot the Mac DeMarco music video my kind of woman an interesting and sort of tongue-in-cheek video as well with Mac DeMarco cross-dressing and and looking pretty homely in the process as he travels with a very close shot on himself through these backgrounds I find it thoroughly entertaining at number 10 a music video that I also find thoroughly entertaining but also sort of sad at the same time and interesting in its concept the hot sugar video for the song Erica where essentially hot sugar is in love with one of these plastic dating girlfriend dolls and he just seems to have a hard time connecting with her emotionally which leads to a lot of turmoil in the relationship and we sort of watched this play out over the entirety of the music video with him sort of being surrounded by all of these doll parts in the end and it just kind of comes full circle and makes me feel really sick and like it's a little dark and a video that I think addresses some of these same issues of failing and relationships and not being able to be with someone but does it in a funnier way is the new Darwin Dee's video for you can't be my girl where Darwin is hilariously superimposed in the background of all these various situations with women who may be by themselves and he's just sort of gazing at them lovingly as he lip syncs along with the song that he's written or they're with other guys in the situations that he's sort of happening upon or just sort of staring at or taking place and in some way shape or form become more outlandish as the video progresses to the point where he's like getting torched with a flamethrower by the end of the video though I'm not really the biggest fan of the guys music I think it's one of the more well executed and in funny video concepts I've seen all year at number eight a music video that I love for its color and it's just funny tongue-in-cheek imagery and sort of the shot of nostalgia that it brought back into my life remembering all the time that I used to spend as a kid and arcades playing skee-ball and playing video games the new Anamanaguchi video for the song Yahoo even though these guys did have another interesting video this year where they actually sent a slice of pizza in the space this is what my favorite video from Anamanaguchi was this year and to me not only was this video well shot and the costumes were interesting and the the sets and just sort of the whole arcade looked amazing but it was just very fun to watch just fun shot for shot for shot at our number seven spot another video that does not let up but is dark instead it's dark it is just dark shop for shop for shot the new Queens of the Stone Age music video for the song the vampire of time and memory as many of you know I dig this band's latest full-length LP quite a bit and I think this video was much more complimentary toward the music on this record as opposed to some of the animations that promoted some of the songs on here I understand if a lot of people dug those visuals but this I just found to be much more interesting with Josh Homme II and many shots of the band playing just in full suit getup very dark very red lots of blacks reds whites a strange vampire woman who has a very angular face that reminded me of a Eartha Kitt a little bit and lots of taxidermied animals hanging around this video as well and a piano that is leopard printed with some very gnarly teeth I thought there were a lot of great shots in the video maybe a few too many fades from one shot to another but this video just has a very very strong sort of tortured vibe to it that I like another video with a strong vibe and one that is completely ridiculous and colourful cartoony the new Kyary Kyary Pamyu music video for the song boy ty night land this music video has everything dancing ghosts little pink strawberry poops and anime segment where she punches out this evil ghost guy bikini ghosts as well definitely not the craziest music video I've ever seen her be a part of but I think my favorite of hers for this year number five getting into the top 5 now this next one is a bit of animation which I have seen a lot this year in terms of music videos I mean I've seen a lot of animation and on this particular instance the the animation is just so eerily realistic that it just you know gave me the chills not only that but I haven't seen a music video like this put together since watching MTV like back in the nineties or at least like a segue from like one show or one segment to another I'm talking of course about the new atoms for peace music video before before your very eyes I do realize that the digital age has brought us one of the greatest things ever known to mankind and that is Thom Yorke dancing for extended periods of time which you may have seen in the other atoms for peace music video that came out this year but even though that seems to be a favorite for a lot of people this is the video that really struck me just sort of seeing Thom Yorke's face recreated in this Brown stone like liquid was just really creepy well I know the video didn't mean to scare it was horrifying in a sense just with how realistic all this looked and you know it's not just the accuracy of the animation on this but just sort of seeing these interesting visuals of these heads sort of in this water in these mountains separated from the bodies I mean this is a very pretty video to look at I think next on our number 4 spot a music video for an older video and interactive video actually sort of a these interactive videos have been popping up a lot lately and to be completely honest very few of them actually appeal to me this is one of the first of them to really grab my attention hold it and want to share it with people and just really kind of get excited about it and it's so silly because the concept of it is so ridiculously obvious and simple I'm talking about the music video for the Bob Dylan song like a rolling stone we're set you're placed on this page where you're watching television and there are a variety of different stations a cooking station a news station a home fix it yourself sort of station with the property brothers on there and Danny Brown is on the music station and no matter what channel you're looking at or whoever it's featuring everybody is lip-syncing to the Bob Dylan song like a rolling stone and it's a hilarious concept and it's funny to see people like Danny Brown just like you know lip-syncing along to this song but sort of gesturing and moving as if he's kind of doing his own music video again interesting music video idea I think one of the brightest of this year and definitely my favorite interactive music video that I have seen so far next a music video for a remix I thought this video when I first caught the original was good it's for one of my favorite singles of the year spoiler and you know I like the darkness of it I like just how straight-ahead and in-your-face it was I'm talking about the push a-team music video for numbers on the boards however again it's not the original video that wowed me it was a video for the bloodsport remix of the song with visuals done by ruff mercy and ref mercy has had his hands in a lot of different music videos for the past year or so the new Danny Brown video for the song ODB he did an re the rugged man music video he did a blue Daisy music video as well and essentially you're getting these really dark straight-ahead visuals but he's painting and coloring and sort of drawing all over separate frames from the video and creating visuals on top of the visuals coloring someone's teeth sort of drawing lyrics from the song on to the screen or putting like chains around the person or whatever they may be rapping about and sort of adding numbers or just faces or pictures to what the person is rapping about and this particular remix for the Pusha T song numbers on the boards I thought was his best version of this yet I mean like I said I've seen him do a lot of music videos over the past year or so and this was my favorite out of all of them though they are all great at my number two spot the music video for MGMT's your life is a lie I laughed because this is one of the funniest videos I've seen this year I thought it was one of the most creative videos I've seen this year even though it is pretty simple in its approach of constantly hitting you with different imagery like oh here's a crazy thing here's a crazy thing here's a crazy thing it's very disjointed it's very all over the place however I found to have a very absurdist Monty Python esque approach to how it was filmed and how it kind of shocked you with all of these hilarious things this video has guest appearances in it from people like Henry Winkler and I just thought it was just from beginning to end entertaining the watch I could watch this thing again and again and again and always kind of find something new about it that I think is funny or a little detail that was kind of hidden in just how fast everything is flashed at you and finally in my opinion the most epic music video of this year the music video for Arcade Fire's reflector the title track from their latest full-length LP I just love all the shots in this video of regime as well as Willem the truck and they're driving and singing and the outfits and the weird just gigantic paper mache heads and the playing and the dancing going on in the truck and the disco ball and the weird mirror guy and the really creepy walking and crawling throughout the field and the water and even though I wouldn't say this video has a very clear direct storyline it does have progress to it and it does just hit you with one interesting beautiful black-and-white image after another I thought this video was very well shot I thought it was strange and as well as moving without being too obvious or melodramatic or anything like that I mean it certainly beats seing Lana Del Ray getting dry humped on a pinball machine alright those are my favorite music videos of the year or your favorite music videos of the year transition what did you think of this list did you love it hate it why which favorite music videos of yours didn't make it onto this list and why does that make you mad cool cool Anthony Fantana music videos 2013 forever 
crTam4W0CpU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for last week where we list things basically throughout this week I'm going to be talking about my favorite things of 2013 albums EPS music videos singles so on and so forth but before we completely just plow through that I want to give some honorable mentions stuff that while I did not love this year either held my attention or had some fantastic tracks or was like you know just this close to coming on my list but I still thought was great and I didn't want the Year to completely blow by without mentioning these records at the end of the year and while I know that that doing this sort of in a separate video may be a bit of a spoiler I think these albums must be mentioned on this channel once more okay so let's do it the new Danny Brown LP old Danny Brown Detroit rapper didn't love this LP however many great tracks on this thing another interesting you know new old good side bad side light side dark side dichotomy on this record just like with his last full-length LP however on this record much more defined but I didn't really care for the incessant gauntlet of club tracks on the second half of this thing still Danny Brown has an incredible amount of flow style lyrical ability and there are some really just heavy progressive beats on this LP too that I thought were pretty great the new James Blake album overgrown didn't enjoy this LP as much as his last LP which you may know was sort of a grower for me Leora was dropped I just ended up preferring me more unorthodox direction his production took over here as opposed to over here I do think there are some fantastic songs on this record and I thought it was interesting that James took a lot of tracks here in a more accessible direction and I think it gained him some more fans in the process still a very good album and a bit of a crossroads for James I think because we're kind of seeing that more singer/songwriter side of himself come into this electronic music producer side of himself and they're forming this hybrid next to the new Keo dot record Hobart oh if you are looking for some progressive metal death metal black metal progressive rock and look like to hear the style sort of crashed into one another violently then this record may be for you especially with its ambitious 100 minute runtime and just a variety of sounds and styles throughout the whole LP and a storyline that runs from beginning to end in every single track I did think that some of the musical and especially the vocal performances could have been better could have been more on point but this album does have a lot going for it another record that I think needed to be mentioned another heavy record as well as the new nails album oh god what a sonic beating this LP is grindcore power violence hardcore just crushing guitar riffs play to such blistering paces I'd to think that the band going a bit louder and a bit faster on this thing did lose some of the catchiness of their previous release did lose some of the dynamics of their previous release however the band still has a pretty signature sound and their music is still very punishing I also want to mention an album that for me was just very dumb fun very very dumb fun the most dumb fun I've had all year to be completely honest the new ASAP ferg album trap now Peyman yeah ASAP ferg is not the most stellar lyricist in the world but well I read in his delivery in his flow and I don't care what you've seen in interviews I don't care what he said to you on the street what I read in his flow and in his delivery is just a bit of ridiculousness so many of the hooks here and the rhymes are just so outlandish I find them a little hilarious and I really like the production on this thing too and finally the new Death Grips album government plates I know when I reviewed this thing a lot of people were like but to be completely honest I've moved on I'm not really thinking about this record anymore I think while there were tracks on this thing that I didn't like at all I think some of the songs on here especially the first three or four some of Death Grips best tracks yet so I don't really have any reason not to go into their next LP with just as much there's what I went into this LP with it's not like I'm just kind of sitting here thinking ooh how good you Death Grips still has a sound a style and a direction I just didn't care for this LP as much as their previous releases those are my honorable mentions of the year transition if you want head down there into the comments and let me know what records are artists this year you like quite a bit but maybe they didn't quite make your favorites list of this year what artists what albums just you liked but you didn't love them you know that's it that's it oh and then in the new underachievers mixtape indigo is and that was pretty good it's actually really good yeah all right all right Anthony Fantana honorable mentions forever 
djD3ed7JwiY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the brand-new burial EP rival dealer burial is the pseudonym of a famed uk-based electronic music producer very well known in the circles of dubstep 2-step future garage and his very atmospheric detailed and moody approach to these genres has earned him quite a bit of praise with electronic music fans and critics but ever since his last full-length LP untrue which he dropped in the late 2000s he's been releasing EP after EP with a handful of tracks on each one and a part of me has actually enjoyed a little bit more what he's been doing on these EPS as opposed to his LPS because I think as he's he's been releasing more music his sound has been getting more progressive longer more expansive tracks more detail more sound play so considering I pretty much like everything that burial is put out as of late I was looking forward to what he was doing on this newest EP rival dealer however I can't say I like this thing it's just one of those moments where an artist who has impressed you on numerous occasions with release after release totally changes directions and changes sound in a pretty big way and the end result is a little disappointing I think diehards will be into a burial is doing on this EP even if it is for kind of a one-off but a lot of this EP did not sit well with me however there were high points on here most notably the title track a song that is not in burials typical style but still very well produced and chock-full of these break beats with just whiffs of drum and bass influence and throughout a great deal of this pretty long track ten plus minutes you're getting these speedy cacophonous drum rhythms repeated over and over and it's being coloured with all these ethereal sound effects and noises a really epic synth line and this really filthy grimy bass line that I like a lot just got a lot of and there are all of these low five vocal cuts that are sort of playing in the background I would say the mix is a little muddy with all these sounds bleeding into one another and the vocals are maybe the most obscured part of the whole mix it sounds like there's a touch of auto-tune on them but with just how bountiful the entire song is with just how many sounds it throws at you it doesn't really overtake the track too much it doesn't really become a standout characteristic it's just a subtle addition to an interesting track and sort of plays its role as a bit of a distortion effect on the vocal which is already pretty obscured by just the muddiness there are these abstract interludes that sort of interrupt throughout the track and then in the halfway point of the song the beat changes up and we get this driving 4/4 rhythm there's an ambient outro some interesting spoken word as well overall this song is really heavy it's enveloping however the other two tracks on this thing I can't say I really care for them at all and for pretty much the same reasons between these two tracks for one the shortest song on this EP hiders seems like a great idea at first with burial introducing these very slow-moving glistening piano chords that are very tender very pretty very evocative I was sort of being moved by this song as it was just plotting on with this very pretty set of chords very grand very uplifting but then this auto-tune lead vocal comes in to sing over it and it just sounds awful I could understand the vocal working on the title track from this thing because of how buried it was and all the muck and just how heavy and visceral the song was but to me this vocal on hiders is really an emotional focus of the track that doesn't really convey or work in terms of an emotional tool it doesn't really make me want to do anything but just the song goes even further downhill as soon as these twittering high hats and just a very simple bass drum snare pattern come into play and typically burial is so well known for how great his beats are and how interestingly they move and progress over the course of a track but this rhythm just grows so stale so fast it's really just like a synth pop song at this point point point point with way too much reverb and some cheesy going on in the background it's kind of like a combination of a very lackluster and boringly written New Wave single and like an endless song coming together and like Power Rangers and what's even worse is the song come down to us not only because it features a lot of the same characteristics but it's longer it just does not know when to quit and the singing is even worse than it is on the song hiders the singing is so off that the auto-tune can barely even cover it mom you are a star with this very repetitive synth line and drum pattern sort of playing out in the first half of this song I feel like burials really again moving away from what he's pretty well known for and instead trying to churn out some auto-tuned pop ballads for sure his very cavernous production style is is still in play however I wouldn't say that that's a saving grace of any of these tracks either and I guess another thing that has remained unchanged is that he still has the ambition to write longer tracks he is still kind of taking a handful of different ideas and stringing them out for 10 for 13 minutes however I would not say that this song gets any better in the second half a lot like on the first track here there's an ambient outro with some spoken word a transgender person is talking about coming to a point in life where this person accepted that that they were worthy of love of being loved that they could be loved still this does not make anything that happens in the second half of this song any more digestible for me especially when the drum beat gets a lot more hyper and the song essentially to me goes like Free Willy soundtrack all the way I find the tracks here that burial has delivered even though they are long and expansive from a melodic standpoint from a rhythmic standpoint to be really under written under developed I don't really care for this sound when other people do it and I especially don't care for it when burials doing it if some of the vocal cuts on this thing weren't so cringe-worthy then maybe the EP would have been more enjoyable for me but the vocal performance is used on these tracks are nowhere near as good as what is landed on burials previous EEPs and pretty much everything that was on untrue so not only am i surprised that burial has totally switched directions in a big way on this EP but i'm also sort of surprised at the lack of quality control on the singing on these tracks unfortunately i'm feeling a strong for to a light five on this thing transition if you've given the CP a listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think i should review next and that's it anthony Fantana burial rival dealer forever 
bU3b6BrMN_Y,hi everyone you know who it is what's up hope you're doing well basically before we get into list week where I'm talking about my favorite of the whole year we have one more great albums segment to cover for November and we'll do a little bit of a December too over the past 30 days or so some of the LPS that really stuck out to me one the new Daniel Avery album drone logic if you're looking for a very straightforward but well-crafted very well-put-together techno tech house album then do look this album up some really good grooves and melodies on this thing it's hypnotic its introspective it's moving at points next the new Black Milk album no poison no paradise black milk Detroit based hip hop producer and this is easily one of his most personal efforts yet with a lot of tracks reflecting upon his life in hip hop his past his childhood the low points and the high points of growing up in Detroit religion and some good beats and features overall as well while I think Black Milk is not the best emcee on the planet he certainly was convincing on this album I didn't love this one I still think it's really worth checking out the new de bocce's album big machines and peculiar beings if you're looking for some indie rock and some post-punk with a lot of quirk just a lot of personality just some oddball playing that times is very stiff but can be very fun and catchy and some a light-hearted there is something kind of awkward and absurd about the band's delivery and performance on this record that I just think is fun if any of those things interest to you do give this thing a listen then there is the new mi a album which I did end up kind of liking more than I originally expected when I first went into this LP giving it a listen but mi is vocals are not quite as enthusiastic as they used to be on her first two records and there was kind of a redundancy going on with the song Exodus and sex it is but there were a lot of catchy tracks on here a lot of straight-up bangers mi a comes through with a lot of charisma and for the most part I thought it was really enjoyable finally the new future of the left album how to stop your brain in an accident some post-hardcore post-punk indie rock on this LP very wordy very cheeky very clever rock songs on here with a lot of personality and I think that's about it thank you for watching it's been quite a year that we've spent together mwah mwah mwah and I'll see you soon Anthony Fantan oh great albums forever 
mNkCTEyLGrU,"oh no hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update or I talk about some records that have recently made their way into my collection and I don't edit it because I do it raw and I know I just did one recently but there are a handful of records here that I wanted to talk about for the holidays especially considering that one of them was given to me by our usual sponsor for the vinyl update segments eclectic the official records store the eclectic music Society if you're looking to get somebody some vinyl or some kind of music related gift and you're sort of in a rush before the holidays and you want to get some quick shipping or whatever on that that's definitely a place to go to do so in this record I'm about to show you over the this record I'm about to show you is over there and many more the Marvin Gaye album what's goin on that's really not how the melody goes on the song there but anyway if you guys caught my classics week stint last year I believe last year I believe I talked about this record and many others but this was a classic according to me during that week it still is and yeah you know this is a vinyl reissue of course it's like brand spankin new but uh still I mean the record sounds really clean it sounds fantastic it's a nice pressing as well as not as well as but I like how we have via the labeling here on the LP as well as in the record too and it's just all very vintage looking you know they've stayed true to uh to the original look of the album and I like that I think it's great it's just really fantastic too uh you know I've had this record digitally and it's just great to kind of admire it in its physical form and listen to just the warmth of this old school analog recording on a record and and yeah I mean just a beautiful cover art beautiful again show you the gatefold it is it is quite a nice gatefold got all the lyrics there picture collage Marvin Gaye what's going on great addition all right this next one actually quite quite a few records in this one or new records that I've actually reviewed recently so here's a one that I bought over at a record local record store psychic by Darkseid the new Nicholas jar dave harrington duo project very simple packaging on this thing but we do have a double LP and these twelve inches are to be played at 45 RPM a lot like that Queens of the Stone Age record I showed you in the in the last update see that see those sleeves see those sleeves and we have a the sleeves over here on the other side listing the tracks of the record and the records are very pristine sounding and in great condition I mean they're brand new and they look wonderful get a nice reflection off of that into the other room and yeah I mean there's not much I can say the packaging isn't like blowing me away or nothing but I mean it's it's good the one thing that's sort of odd about the packaging is the dogs squeaking a dog toy the binder title is actually not on the opposite side of the opening in the in the cover the opening is actually on top so the mouth is on top of this record so uh so yeah I mean it's the only real odd thing about the packaging but it's still a great electronic music record in my opinion an interesting combination of just electronic sounds some really dark synthesizers spacious beats and Dave Harrington's guitar playing a very interesting record it's interesting to see sort of psychedelic and and rock sounds come together with electronic music in such a cohesive way alright next another album I review this year another double LP that needs to be played at 45 the new Miriam the believer album blood donation such a stunning little front cover here not only is the picture beautiful and I love this that picture of her with her hand coming out of her head anyway Hey I just love the glossy photo that they threw on the front of this thing you have like this matte finish on the background and this very just a seamless adhesion of this very beautiful looking glossy photo - very nice sleeves here not a not a gatefold or anything you know you had the lyrics over here liner notes over here flip them around you get some colorful psychedelic imagery over here oh and guess what color the vinyl is no not black no it's not green no it is not red like blood even though the album is called blood donation that would have been nice it's white it's a beautiful sparkling white so uh so yeah I mean uh this you know to have this record is fantastic because this record is not out in the u.s. from what I understand this this came from Europe and if you're looking for a vinyl copy of this thing that's where you're gonna have to get it from what I understand right now anyway really really nice SG she's got there very beautiful white SG in that picture anyway right now this is on pious cooperative as well as repeat until death moshi-moshi records I believe my copy came from the the people at moshi moshi if you're looking for a vinyl copy of this and you don't mind paying a little bit extra because you're getting it imported from somewhere else huh that's a it's a song on here and I like the song on here so anyway if you don't mind paying a little extra to get this thing from another country sent out to you then pick it up and you know if you have some connections with a label or you're a label person you're watching this I heard this record do check this out this is Miriam velentin of wild birds and peace drums I know wild birds and peace drums are not the hottest thing out right now but I mean this is a really good record that I think deserves a North American release I mean you know that her voice is fantastic the guitar playing is great the songwriting is memorable her I already said her voice is fantastic but her singing is just like my favorite thing about that record definitely one of my favorite records of the year but lists week is coming up don't want to give too much away another one of my favorite records of this year decided to pick it up because it's my favorite album of theirs in a while the new melt banana album fetch I was at the record store in my area and red squirrel records and I was DJing and I picked this record up when I was there and there was this kid who picked up a CD copy of this record and was talking to his mother like a few feet away from me and it was like nobody else was paying attention to this I was like the only audience to this and it was the most hilarious thing in the world he was looking at this record cover and he was like oh my god look at his eye look at how big his eyes and he was like pointing out all the monsters eyes on this thing and then he's like pointing at the guy he's like oh my god are they gonna eat the cat it was it was hilariously cute and I loved it here's the back interesting little plastic sleeve going on with this record one of those deals and one thing that is kind of an essential if you're you're listening to Mel banana only because of how they're entertaining in themselves the lyrics yes the lyrics sheet to to this or any melt banana record like I said is is really entertainment in and of itself you don't even really need the record just by the by the lyric sheet if if you possibly can let me see I don't want to see double-faced craps I don't want to hear fuzzy tamed noise I don't want to are fickle lame brats I'm sick of chasing for my tail here's my fury late stingy lay whale whale which one to sell on net question mark I'm still here I'm still lost in this fucking deer planet gonna need to dive more into these we're not expecting to completely understand much of anything because I know Mel punana does embrace the tenets of absurdity when it comes to their lyrics but um you know I am expecting to read through these and just get a bunch of imagery and just strange ideas thrown abhi that that may make me giggle or sort of scratch my head for a moment there and let's see another oldie another two oldies but definitely goodies in my opinion of things that records that I have admired for a while but have not picked up on vinyl and I saw that they were reissued here with some pretty interesting packaging with posters and digital downloads and all that these two new repressing z' of these crafts records penis envy and feeding of the 5,000 penis envy being my favorite of the two and quite possibly my favorite crafts record the crass is a punk punk rock band through and through hailing from the UK probably one of the most unadulterated punk bands ever really sort of sidestepping all of the poppier elements that many punk bands in that time period embraced to make really gray and catchy and memorable music crass really favored instead brittle production instead of really catchy catchy ultra catchy or sweet or melodic hooks noisy just harsh guitars shouted vocals that were memorable but not because they were really repetitive or had anything infectious about them in terms of just like a traditional chorus they were more memorable for how grim and unrelenting and uncompromising a lot of the politically charged imagery on these records were and I'm really a huge fan of female fronted post-punk bands and art punk bands and you know that that definitely makes penis envy a favorite of mine and Crassus discography because I believe it's the only record of theirs that uh features lead vocals from Eve libertine let me see on pretty much every track I'm looking at the the liner notes over here but if not just from her I believe it's the only crass record that features uh female vocals this prominently and you know not not that just that they're female I mean Eve libertine as it is an incredibly eccentric vocalist with just some really strong bite to to her political commentary on this record whether it be about religion or love or war I believe one of my favorite tracks on here in terms of just like topic is where we're next Columbus talking about how you have all these leaders leading people into these uh leading society really into all these terrible situations I mean you know the the music is noisy and very visceral and very in-your-face and ball z and reading into the lyrics is just a totally you know just a completely different trip in itself simply because of just how many you know points I guess the band makes I wouldn't say you necessarily need to agree with anything that they think but you know their their criticism certainly is sharp so I just wanted to show you guys this is the feeding of the 5,000 cover art and it essentially got kind of like a paper poster here collage lots of lyrics strewn throughout and what this unfolds into is pretty freakin killer this gruesome picture of a hand on like barbed wire it says your country needs you hmm not exactly not exactly mincing words which is which is why I love bands like crass which is why I love bands like Dead Kennedys maybe Dead Kennedys even more because they managed in my opinion to sort of not mince words at all but also make songs that are really catchy and really memorable but still you know that's that's no sleight too crass crass certainly had personality in a lot of ways crass set precedent for music that is this socially I don't want to say socially aware I want to say socially nasty uh-huh because there's certainly a lot of socially aware music out there but has a you know has maybe a sort of a smiley attitude because of how enlightened the music might feel or the music might still feel light-hearted or something like that whereas crass is you know that they're singing about some really rough stuff and the music the aura of their sound certainly gives off that aesthetic to really apocalyptic dismal stuff in here I mean you know so many gender issues address on this album alone and you know the title is penis envy you've got a blow-up doll on the front you know just like so many layers of social commentary happening in every direction with some really grimy crusty punk music to match it so feeding of the 5,000 and penis and the two favorite punk records of mine cool cool that's basically everything right now that I recently picked up that's it for this vinyl update again thank you to electic for throwing that Marvin Gaye record my way check out their site if you're in the market for any vinyl right now mmm holiday season and that's it cool cool already said that transition if you've given any of these dishin if you've given any of these records listen what did you think of them also I'm sure somewhere in this screen right now you can find a link to go watch other vinyl video updates of mine and I know there is a link in the description down there where you can find a playlist of all of my vinyl updates actually a whole list of videos of my entire record collection from A to Z as well just the 12-inch LP is though yeah cool all right you have any fan tanto vinyl forever "
OLWOPLSto9s,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Hellfire Club compilation Dorner vs. toki first before we get into this thing I want to address something people have been asking me about a lot of people have been asking me where couch chest is at why isn't he appearing any of the new videos and it's mostly because right now he's work Hellfire Club is a fast-growing rap label and collective that's been making quite a bit of noise in this new age of the very internet savvy hip-hop underground you may already be familiar with some of the names on their roster like open my Eagle and Milo and of course bus driver and over the past year so the label has been growing quite a bit thanks to rapper and label founder no-can-do and he has invited these guys as well as kale I believe that's how you pronounce his name verbs as well as rhetoric Ramirez and the cleaners on to this new compilation and it's a pretty long compilation too standing at 17 tracks there are moments where songs are handled by one single rapper sometimes Hellfire Club gets together as a group and just totally posses a whole track some of the songs on this thing are brand new were made specifically for this compilation it seems others were recently released it's all just kind of being layered on top of one another on this thing just to sort of showcase Hellfire clubs talents their abilities their personality right now in hip hop rap cliques are kind of back in fashion with Odd Future and pro era as well as good music MMG black hippy too even though they haven't dropped a tape together and I wish they would and even though they're they're very loose collective of artists on the surface might not like they have a whole ton to offer outside of just a nerdy point of view over a rap beat coming together on this compilation I think shows the Hellfire Club has a lot to bring to the table because on this thing you have a lot of progressive instrumentals as well as trap rap inspired beats but also have some odd samples or grooves or characteristics to them and you're getting all these smartypants rhymes on top of them which usually are not paired with just straight-up bangers but it's not like you know you're getting raps about e equals MC squared or anything like that and there is definitely variety among the personalities on this Hellfire Club compilation you've got guys like bus driver and open mike eagle who are usually pretty wordy clever very referential toward highfalutin things as well as hilarious as well and then you've got no-can-do and rhetoric Ramirez definitely on the grimy ER and just more blunt end of the spectrum on this thing their tracks on this thing that while they're loud and they bang they have a lot of personality too Fabian Cortez the Nightstalker elephant in the pressroom as well as give a DVT 2 and Pet alligators a song with bus driver and no-can-do which I believe is actually linked to a previous effort and the production is just so heavy and there's some killer samples in the midst of these tracks to the song elephant in the pressroom with these really whimsical guitars and sour piano chords DBT has these really fiendish melodies over its course that sort of remind me of like a old timey villain film and the song Pet alligators take some of that trap influences the heaviness some of the hi-hats and fuses it with some samples of what sounds kind of like synth funkin and wonky and there's a really smooth bass line on this track too that I love and there's some really catchy choruses on this thing - like DBT where essentially all of these horrible occurrences that have happened recently are being mentioned while you've kind of got this repeated light of too soon like it's too soon to mention it as well as moments like 10,000 haters we though a vis songs like this topically and lyrically are a little all over the place and we because I feel like Hellfire Club is just trying to come forward and just make the most hard-core hitting sound and song that they possibly can but there are tracks on here that are a little more toned down a little bit more focused like Degrassi picture day which is an open mic Eagle song in a hilarious one at that amazing concept which sort of brings together all the members of Hellfire and open mike eagle is essentially using picture day as a metaphor for this talking about all of these various things like having money for the pictures and coming home with an envelope from life touch open mike eagle is just consistently clever and interesting there's a moment on here where he gets pretty personal like on the song apologies all of these moments where he's saying sorry for mistreating his friends and citing these specific occurrences where he's done something to wrong them at least in his eyes and the song qualifiers to another open mike eagle track an interesting one too but I can't Sam that into the singing on this one it's a great instrumental but again just could he use a different vocal take on the singing but singing is consistently not really the strongest point that this mixtape has to offer because it's not like open mike eagle is the only guy singing there is bus driver on this record singing on numerous occasions as well which I've said it before I'll say it again I did not like bus driver singing on his solo records I don't really care for bus drivers singing on his featured spots when he lands on someone else's track and I don't feel like it works well on this compilation either I mean really sometimes it feels like the singing here has nearly a complete disregard for pitch accuracy bus driver singing on this thing ruins some tracks and when it doesn't ruin them it makes me like them a little bit less but thankfully bus driver is doing more rapping than he is singing on this comp I actually think in terms of rapping he is the most featured emcee on this entire mixtape and whenever he hops on the mic to spit his rhymes are always fast flowing intense and eccentric like on the Tara mellows remix here that he does with Milo who hops on this tape a few times and I think my favorite track with bus driver on is actually barbs over breakfast like I said earlier there are some cuts off of this thing like a moment from Milo's latest mixtape I actually would have loved to have heard him hop on this thing with a few more verses the few moments that I did hear him on this thing he was using a flow that opened mike eagle actually used on one of the tracks here and there was another flow he used that actually reminded me of Kimya Dawson in an interesting way even though I might have been looking for a little bit more from the artist that I was already familiar with for the most part I was pleasantly surprised by the people I was less familiar with like the rhetoric Ramirez song on here the night stalker I think is one of the catchiest and Moe's a knee tracks on this entire thing and the cleaner song big business toward the back end of this thing I thought was really good too a very eerie story being told on this one I think the only track that I didn't end up digging from a person I wasn't familiar with was the kale track we on a song that I guess I wasn't crazy about because of the instrumental I thought the bass line was maybe a little too noisy a little too sloppy and I thought the hook on this track was a little redundant kind of clunky too still despite that with how many people were coming together onto this mixtape there was a lot of opportunity for things to just completely get out of hand and not really line up and not sound consistent and and not be complimentary but this thing actually ended up sounding pretty solid I think this is a really good compilation it has me excited and looking forward to whatever hell-fire is doing next I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition if you've given this compilation to listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Hellfire Club forever "
