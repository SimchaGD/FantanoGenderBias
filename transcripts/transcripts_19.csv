pd8EVQgm_DQ,good having it cut up it but if anybody but no but no but no but nuba dooba dooba dooba hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Shabazz Palaces record majesty this is the sophomore full-length LP of the seattle-based hip hop duo Shabazz Palaces basically consisting of pal seer Lazaro aka Ishmael Butler of diggable planets in Shabazz Palaces he raps he produces as well Tendai mover - he produces as well and brings various instruments to the table he actually dropped his solo LP under the name chi Marengo renaissance and frequently Shabazz Palaces collaborates with another hip hop duo from the same area by the name of the satisfaction they came out with a record a little while ago reviewed it loved it now building up to this point Shabazz Palaces has two really solid EPS of studio material and a full-length LP titled black up it dropped in 2011 it was hip hop but incredibly psychedelic for hip hop music trippy heady otherworldly mind-bending it was intergalactic and had a really strong sense of sound play - they were warped flipped reversed samples all over this thing vocal cuts that are stretched beyond the breaking point I love the spaced out beats and grooves the trippy synthesizers and perplexing lyrics - which are typically delivered in a very subdued laid-back flow very smooth it turns out Ishmael Butler is still cool like that I cried with Mucha poppies awake snuck an extra slice of cake the pics came around and make the case I look them dead up in they face I never heard of none of that soon as I win so run it back I run on feelings fuck your facts deception is the truest act there are a lot of lyrics on this record that I think are great just using a lot of turn of phrase metaphor and symbolism to talk about some very interesting personal moments as well as deliver some philosophical ideas dealing in the world at large race so given this album there was really no reason whatsoever not to highly anticipate what ever Shabazz Palaces was going to follow black up with even as Shabazz Palaces started dropping some tracks to tease toward the release of this record like the song cake and 4runner for Ray not anything wildly different for Shabazz Palaces to be completely honest I was kind of expecting a sequel that maybe sounded a little bit too much like black up but still sounded good and was entertaining however it was very clear that that was not what I was going to get just at first glance of the tracklist on this thing for starters the album is ten minutes longer and has almost double the tracks of the last LP and many of the tracks on this record are much shorter than the material presented on black up to a lot of them numbering under one minute or two minutes and it's not that there weren't really weird short beat change ups and detours on black up there were it's just that when they occurred it wasn't really its own separate track they were worked into a pre-existing song creatively and with a mind toward the flow of the song they weren't these sort of weird satellite standalone tracks and because they are that hear this record feels really cluttered and unorganized and packed with filler there are 40 second tracks on this record with with not that much in the way of an interesting idea of being presented or if there is one it sort of seems to go off a cliff as the song ends abruptly these very short tracks are essentially left to fend for themselves and don't really do much to prove their legitimacy on their own some tracks on this record fade into others like there's a bit of a segue or a link between two songs so it's not like the record is entirely jumbled however it doesn't make this record feel holistic or like a uniform experience or anything like that overall I think this record kind of sounds like a very dusty old box of unkempt and weekly groomed odds and ends like the song solemn swears where we're kind of getting these ethereal synths and this sort of redundant B and Pallas ear Lazzaro saying over it things like I set the tone like Al Capone I'm coming up like Donald Duck I make him dance just at a glance I scream and yell like Samuel L if there's any kind of amazing deep and profound meaning to these lyrics I am completely blind to it due to just the very basic and effortless sound of the lyrics on the surface I actually don't really think the lyrics on this record stun as much as black up just take the opener to this LP for example Shabazz Palaces is the project is no stranger to tons of psychedelic effects but they are lay down so heavy on this particular track and some others on here too that the vocals are essentially swallowed into this ethereal very trippy synthetic atmosphere which I guess is a change in stylistic direction that you might be interested in this record to me in comparison with black up sounds way more glitchy soundscape ish but for me that's not really a selling point of the album the background is not where I want to hear Shabazz Palaces music slip for me but that's where it goes on tracks like the ballot of lieutenant major winnings which has this unbearably goofy instrumental with this really awkward groove on it they're just so many songs on this LP that just feel so inconsequential to me either that or unenjoyable like the song ishmael we're on this song butler does bust one of the few steady flows on the entire record but he starts the song off with these kind of serene melodic psychedelic synthesizers and he's singing over them kind of lethargically as much as I don't like a lot of the material on this record I do give it to Shabazz Palaces for trying some new things for the project with the singing with the eerie synthesizers and guitar leads on the song colluding oligarchs or their really jagged vocal sample loops on the song they come and go to the driving beat on the mine glitch keytar and tmd theme cm if there is one trend on black up that continues here the song titles are still insane yes now there are some tracks on this LP that feel more fleshed out don't just feel like a motif or a detour in the track listening actually could be switched out for a track on black up and they would have sounded good there they wouldn't have stuck out like a sore thumb songs like cake forerunner for a new black wave they come in gold and motion sickness but these tracks only make up a fraction of the album the rest of it is just so breezy and forgettable it's like a funhouse of disappointing attractions and tricks I do appreciate that Shabazz Palaces is experimenting with this record but with not many of the tracks here building toward anything grander or more interesting than what's initially presented at the beginning of each track the whole thing here just feels so disjointed and unexcited I'm feeling a strong 5 on this thing to a light 6 transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Shabazz Palaces forever 
GMddfZCiiQ4,ooh hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Morrissey Record world peace is none of your business Morrissey singer-songwriter infamous frontman of the Smiths and solo artist I think it's pretty safe to say that without Morrissey and without the Smiths alternative rock n' and jangle pop wouldn't quite be the same with records like the queen is dead Mia's murder Strangeways Viva Hate if you haven't heard any of these records I would say take this review as an opportunity or an invitation to go take a moment and check those records out because to me this new record from Morrissey is is not really up to snuff but quality wise in the line enough with his most recent releases to the point where anybody who's been following Morrissey up until this point will not be just devastatingly disappointed by what happens on this record personally I don't really have that intimate of a relationship with Morrissey's solo discography outside of some of this bigger earlier releases and because of records like world peace is none of your business it's probably going to stay that way the instrumentals on this record track for track four track are way too stiff too flabby too winded to do anything that's legitimately exciting or display any real kind of finesse especially as some of the guitars and drums are clumsily reenacting music of a Spanish origin but the end result just feels watered-down to the highest degree the whole record thinks it's way more moving and convincing than it actually is and again those are just the instruments vocally I think this album lacks as well these days at this stage in his career listening to more so he's like listening to Frank Sinatra with no charm no swagger I think over time Morrissey has just slowly become a crooner with no charisma there are few songs on here namely staircase at the University where Morrissey really shows off his pop sensibilities and these songs go over well not only do we get good chord progressions good melodies but the instrumentation feels a little more upbeat and peppy too but outside of these more accessible songs this record is just kind of an opportunity for Morrissey to throw himself on top of a philosophical pedestal and look down his nose at the unwashed masses who he has supremely exceeded in terms of mental capabilities seems all the filthy dirty people down there just can't figure out why there's all this war and poverty and injustice around but thank God we have Morrissey here to tell us world peace is none of your business I'm completely 100% wholeheartedly all four-alarm when it comes to a justified and positive cause Morrissey for the most part has always been pretty upfront with his ideals in his songs what he thinks about the world at large and ideologically there are some things I agree with him on namely animal rights and religion I'm sure but in my opinion I think a lot of the time Morrissey presents his ideas in a way that is kind of obnoxious and insulting to listeners even listeners who may agree with what he's saying even as somebody who doesn't enjoy bullfighting I had a hard time enjoying the song bullfighter dies namely because even if you agree with the ideology of a track if it is created in bitterness it tastes bitter to everyone there are tracks on here like not a man where it seems like Morrissey isn't even really concerned with whatever melody he's singing he just wants to get these lyrics out that seem to just be tearing him up inside he just has these proclamations that he that he is dying to make I would never destroy this planet on the title track he sort of repeats this mantra over and over and over that voting just supports the process of all this injustice all this oppression and you know I completely believe in your right to believe that and defend your argument if you actually have some interesting and thought-provoking points but to just kind of put something so blatantly arguable out there just kind of seems to me like lazy lyric-writing I don't know I mean there are countries all across the world first world countries where especially in America where the are blow in these days some of them in some states especially local elections they are historically low and I can't really say that we're more free because of it when it comes to government oppression and government corruption there's a lot more to its existence than people voting then there's the song earth is the loneliest planet where Morrissey essentially comes off completely disillusioned with the human race the future of the human race the future of the world and I completely sympathize I mean I think anybody who Ponder's or is an introspective person has these kinds of thoughts however there's not really anything in this song in this record as a whole that leads me to believe that Morrissey comes to this conclusion from a place of enlightenment to me Morrissey presents a lot of his political philosophy across this tract with just unbridled pretension with not even a note of humor or a poignant idea or anything even close to a solution maybe if you're a hardcore fan you're living and dying by Morrissey you have a Morrissey face tattoo I can see you enjoying what this record has to offer because what you care about is Morrissey and for sure he lays a lot of his ideas and a lot of his emotions on the line with this record he puts it out there it's straightforward it's for all to see or rather hear but coming from the standpoint of someone who doesn't have that kind of personal or emotional connection to Morrissey just because he's Morrissey I find that the songs on here that do have strong pop sensibilities those are good but outside of that I'm getting a lot of instrumental fodder which is completely underwhelming and thrown on top of it are these really stale bitter political and philosophical musings that to me are kind of self-serving as somebody who might agree with some of morsi's points I don't really get anything out of hearing him state them and what he brings to the table on this record as far as his lyrics don't really strike me as something that would turn around somebody who might disagree with him I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana more sieve on Morrissey man forever 
dbP8F2bnfIc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Weird Al album Weird Al Yankovic mandatory fun Weird Al more like nay what hey you know you know you just you just don't get the joke stop or I will kill you and your sleep Weird Al is an accordion assaultin of satire he is the Pope the Pope of musical parody I remember loads of this guy songs from when I was a kid like a surgeon eat it fat but then in the mid and late 90s that's when I started buying cassettes and that's when I grabbed a copy of bad hair day I listened to this tape so many times it was warped to crap by the time it was broken and just completely unlistenable forever I listened to this tape so much I gave up on all my other tapes and then when I decided to start listening to music like seriously again it was hard for me to listen to music that didn't have a joke in it so we are now almost ruined my musical tastes through my tween and early teen years I continued to have a soft spot for the work of mr. Yankovic I enjoyed the older stuff I could dig up I enjoyed his follow-up record running with scissors some of his best songs being on this LP namely the saga begins the Star Wars tribute on this record however after running with scissors I sort of found myself falling out of favor with Weird Al I wasn't really following his career as closely as I used to from 2001 to 2011 Weird Al did come out with tracks that I thought were good namely angry white boy polka and white and nerdy also very funny song but I and many other people who grew up with Weird Al and a new generation that could potentially be listening to Weird Al weren't really tuning into his albums like they used to and I think there are a lot of external factors going on here for one the internet is coming into full swing when it comes to turning people on to new music and because of that the hype cycle of new songs of pop singles is moving even faster it seems like more disposable songs than ever are being incredibly hyped aren't being remembered just a handful of months down the road by the time weird al' might do a parody of a song it's completely out the door and nobody's thinking of it and on the internet he is seeing more competition from a new generation of parody artists that are mostly YouTube based and on top of all that I think his last full length LP apocalypse was one of his weakest in years not only in terms of parody song choice he parodied a ti song I never really liked Bruno Mars and b.o.b track that I don't think anybody can remember and then there's the song performed this way which is maybe one of his least interesting parodies of all time where he's just merely making fun of the eccentricity of the performances and outfits of Lady gaga but the tides of kind of term with this new record of owls I think the stars have really aligned in that we've had a healthy string of legit memorable pop sensations arise over the past few years McLemore Lord Daft Punk Robin Thicke Iggy Azalea Gangnam style Pharrell the songs that Al picks are incredibly timely which is a hard thing to do in the Internet age come out with a timely mix of parody songs of new pop singles in an era where the pop single landscape is constantly shifting and Al has been building his stock on the internet too by doing collaborations with the YouTube channels like five second films Nerdist and he's come out with a series of really good viral music videos to back up these new songs and not only are these songs funny not only are these parodies hilarious to a degree in my opinion but al kind of takes songs like fancy and actually makes them about something with his very light-hearted brand of humor there's a fart here and there it's absurd it's silly and we see Weird Al if you are weird fan if you are familiar with his back catalogue we see him tackling a lot of the same lyrical topics food which we see with foil and there's a bit of a conspiracy theorist edge on the latter half of the track too we see the cartoonish portrayal of a person or profession with handi on the song tacky weird al' portrays an incredibly unlikable person something he has done in song time and time again and word crimes just a total grammar nerd tune we have eating with the song inactive which is about being just really thoughtful or the song lame claim to fame which has a lot of lyrics that do make me giggle it's literally about having a lame claim to fame like knowing a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows Kevin Bacon or even having the first comment on a YouTube video then there's the song sports song very funny tune marching band instrumentation with a series of lyrics that very verbose ly and articulately highlights the inferiority of the opposing team song firstworldproblems is just about firstworldproblems and features a kind of Pixies esque instrumental and vocal delivery from al it's a very funny song and then there is my own eyes where essentially with the Foo Fighters esque instrumental Weird Al kind of talks about these situations or happenings that he sees with his own eyes he wishes he hadn't and he kind of uses this opportunity to create mental images such as a preacher stealing a zebra in order to teach that zebra to give him a massage and then my favorite track on the entire LP is always a highlight for me on a Weird Al album always I don't know about you my favorite track on a Weird Al album is always the polka medley and with Carly Rae Jepsen and a really great Miley Cyrus rendition right at the start of this polka they really harmonized the vocals very well on the chorus some songs to me though on this record I do think are either not that funny or instra mentally are incredibly obnoxious like inactive we're essentially Alice parodying the imagine dragons song radioactive and that is just such a heavy epic rock song with a bit of a dubstep wub wub going on in the background and Weird Al is just so off the mark with this track production-wise to the point where it really kind of I guess takes me out of the parody you know part of the hilarity of a song like Amish paradise is that right at the start of the song you're not quite sure which track you're going to be hearing despite all that the album does finish off pretty strong with the song Jackson Park Express this is one of those moments where Weird Al finishes an LP off with a very long song this one being nine minutes and consisting entirely of the internal monologue of a man riding a bus who falls totally and madly in love with a woman who comes onto the bus like she comes in and looks at him and - al this mere lock of the eyes for a split second means I love you I want to be with you forever so on and so forth Weird Al is singing all of these really weird romantic acts that she or he will be engaging like taking her skin off and wearing it over his own skin but as he says not in a creepy way overall I like this LP I think it's one of Al's best in years I think it's sort of choppy it's hit or miss but the songs on here that are good and are funny are so good this entire record is worth checking out I do feel a strong 6 - a light 7 on this thing not the best score in the world but I think a lot of these songs proved that Weird Al is still incredibly funny still incredibly sharp and can do his job really well if he is timely with the release of parody songs and he brings good choices to the table going into the future I think that Weird Al might be better suited for putting out an EP or maybe even sticking solely to the internet and dropping parody songs through music videos as they kind of come along and then maybe down the road doing a compilation sort of painting an entire album of parodies based on songs that might not even be popular when Weird Al ends up dropping the album the parodies are on I think down the road could hurt his relevancy I'm not trying to run Al's career but as a fan of Weird Al I want to see him stick around I want to see him make parodies until he's dead I think the world I think the music industry needs a Weird Al Yankovic and I think playing his marketing by the ear of the internet from now on we're essentially his his target demographic his new potential fan base resides would do his relevancy justice into the future because comedy especially musical parody if you're going to be parroting pop songs you've got to act quickly whatever that's just my thoughts on it transition if you've given this record listen what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Weird Al mandatory fun forever 
bCMpVo0LLKQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantan Oh here internets busiest music nerd drinkin some melon aid want the recipe it's down there in the description alright in this video really quickly I'm going to go into the album's that I am anticipating for the rest of this year the year of our Lord 2014 the release states for the next few months have pretty much been solidified there hasn't been a lot in the way of like November release dates coming out or like early December release dates coming out of course there are albums coming out for the rest of July like the new Shabazz Palaces record but uh I'm not really going to talk about those albums and so I do have promos for a lot of them there are streams for a lot of them out on the internet already many of them are just Allen available to hear there's not really much to anticipate but for the duration of August september-october there are a lot of good decent interesting LPS dropping and I just want to talk about some of the releases albums EP that I am looking forward to burn i am putting i'm just going to list artists list album titles i'm going to put record labels and release dates down there in the description box so you get a nice tight little list down there cool cool cool all right let's go new perfume genius record too bright you guys know that I loved his last fling LP put your back into it of course I'm looking forward to this new album of his especially since the first track to dropped from it was pretty instrumentally lush not quite as stripped back and very simple and just a totally oriented around vocal and piano as his previous stuff waka flocka flame could be dropping Flockaveli 2 this year maybe maybe it's going to drop at the start of 2015 I'm not sure my brightest diamond this is my hand really looking forward to that record i reviewed her new EP talked about in a really quick iphone review and and of course I'm anticipating that album given the material I heard there there is the new death from above record death from above 1979 the physical world these guys are back if you guys don't know listen to their album you're a woman I'm a machine great rock record just basing drums on that thing some sits on there too and vocals of course it's great songs it a good sound when they first came out son and Scott Walker miraculously are going to be kind rating this year this is going to be one mess-up collaboration this is going to be messed up this is like scott walker's last full-length LP was a mind-bending an incredibly disturbing experience and i can only imagine with son backing him up and and collaborating with him it's only going to get more insane the name of that record is going to be I believe soused there's also the new interpol record el pintor that's going to drop on Matador Records very soon I wasn't crazy about their last record i reviewed it you can look that up but this new album of theirs I don't know the first single from it felt like a pretty strong solid rock song so that's sort of been a sound or a feeling I thought was really missing from their last full-length LP so maybe they're gonna turn it around on this new record who knows then there's also the new kayo dot record if you're looking for some progressive avant-garde really adventurous metal music look out for their new record on the way via the Lancer there is the new Joey badass record before the money when is that going to come out I don't have a clue right now Flying Lotus he just freaking announced this new album of his going to drop early October warp records i believe the title is you're dead as a really odd website up for right now he's got some live dates up there and this animation this gift may be playing right at the beginning of the website you got kind of scroll down to see more information but this huge image that's animated with all these uh seems to be corpses floating into this spiral if not expire of in you're dead Flying Lotus let's see spoon they want my soul that's dropping soon fka twigs lp1 i did like a lot of her singles leading up to the LP but but to go back spoon rock band if you don't know them you should know them by now but look up spoon they're gonna have a new record coming out soon fka twigs art pop singer she sing some really out there stuff her vocals are out there her instrumentals are out there it's what I liked so much about her when she was coming up to release the EP she put out last year i believe late last year early this year sort of slipping my memory but i mean part of the reason that is is that i didn't really care for the EP i didn't really think the songs came together into anything more than just a sampler you know i heard many of the tracks prior to the release of the EP but together as a release there wasn't really anything that they brought to the table you know in one piece than they did separately but I'm hoping this new upcoming album of hers a little more holistic and for sure there's a strong single from it thus far with the song two weeks I think this is the catchiest song she's dropped thus far though I did think she had kind of an eclectic edge to the songs that she was putting out I was sort of waiting for the moment where she was going to come through with like some really strong pop sensibility and on this new single I think she has and I'm kind of hoping that that trend continues on to this new LP LP 1 and we get a series of songs that are not only adventurous and really creative and kind of mind-bending but really sweet on the ears too and memorable accessible there's also the new Kimber record the golden echo I'm anticipating it because I liked your last LP but i'm slightly dreading it because i'm not really caring for the singles that are coming out from this thing thus far there's also the new shellac record dude incredible if you love steve albini if you love noise rock if you love stuff that's gonna just beat your ears up then be on the lookout for that record the new caribou album our love dropping via merge records if you like Caribous previous records like swim if you like electronic music if you liked his output under the name Daphne then be on the lookout for this album dropping toward the beginning of October there's also alt-j anticipating that record i thought the singles leading up to this new LP have been decent their rock band or a pop band but they have a strong weird edge to them though I do think their latest singles have been a little more conventional even though there was that slow quiet one that's sampled Miley Cyrus but there was kind of a straightforward psych pop rock tune that didn't sound too too bad a lot of people were kind of up in arms over that track because uh allegedly I guess I guess during an interview a member of the band had said they kind of made that song to please their label because it is a catchy it is a straightforward song although I didn't really see an issue with it I mean it was definitely a different change it was definitely a different pace for them it was a change but I thought it still came out as a good tune I think if there's any band out there right now in the indie pop world or the indie folk world that can do a more accessible song but do it with personality and do it with some character I I have faith in all J so I'm going to be looking forward to that new LP of theirs again this is all yours then there is the new rusty album green language I like this guy's last full-length LP glass swords really etc colorful electronic music album that's going to be dropping soon at the end of august and then there is the new hudson mohawke EP the dude just dropped a single for this new EP titled chimes is going to be coming out via warp record and that's pretty much it Hudson Mohawke if you don't know in one half of tonight tonight came out with one of the better electronic music eps of the past few years there's total colorful just blow your brains out trap bangers all over that thing and just looking forward to seeing where he sort of pushes the banger next on this new solo release all right and those are essentially the records the EP is the albums that I am looking forward to for the rest of the year of course you know what we're all kind of sitting around wondering is jrock from top dawg entertainment going to drop a record is dr. Dre gonna put a detox is jay electronica going to cry with his record is good music / Kanye going to do anything this year we're all wondering but no release dates for that or anything up right now I'm only sorry or we can only sort of speculate at the moment so let me know down in the comments what albums are you anticipating what eps are you anticipating for the duration of this year do you think anything is going to be dropped in november or december are you anticipating some release date announcements let me know i'm curious cool cool again that whole list down there in the description box and have a nice day anthony Fantana release states anticipation 2014 forever 
LvI4plyRcrs,hi everyone in theny santana mere the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the view of the new slow-mo and jeremiah p no more this new EP is a collaboration between Shlomo and Jeremih Shalom Oh being an up-and-coming electronic music producer from California I enjoyed his bad vibes album that dropped in 2011 this LP was full of whisper quiet bedroom produced glitch hop that was really groovy pretty serene seductive but then on his next two EPS there was a pretty sudden change of pace especially on his last one laid out which I love an EP that essentially delivered a series of very moody atmospheric trap bangers there was even an R&B flavored track with how to dress well on the cut that was a very nice song a heartbreaker of a song and now almost seems to be moving further in that direction with Jeremiah a chicago-based singer-songwriter R&B artist it's not a surprise to me that Shlomo would reach out to a guy like this to work with him because he's a bit of a musical chameleon he's always hopping onto the next trend and now hedonistic nocturnal R&B with a single tear streaming down its face is where Shlomo wants to stake claim next aesthetically this project isn't too unlike the weakens music his last song was the perfect soundtrack to cold emotionless sex with perfect strangers on top of a beer soaked rug with some cocaine residue on it now this new EP is kind of similar in experience in narrative and sound though I will say that the characteristics are slightly different for one I love the instrumentals off of this thing I think the instrumentals are maybe the most appealing thing about the project on the title track to this thing I love the harsh distorted gurgling lead melody set against some really tight trap music grooves twittering high hats on this thing and a really ear tingling ting of a sound it's like this beat has a bit of an industrial - it really grabs my attention then there's the remix of the Jeremiah song fuck you all the time which has this slow most sensual lush chorus it's intoxicating as hell and there's a bass line on this thing that moves as slow as molasses I mean molasses but the song has felt that the instrumentation builds doesn't do too much for me outside the female lead vocals on this thing the male vocals Jeremias vocals don't really move me and the pitched down wrapping on this thing is pretty horrific though I could see why she Loma would take on this song and Jeremiah's version on his record it's so stripped back and simple it's kind of tempting to put your own spin on it the rising wall of synthesizers on the hook from the song Bo Peep is really nice for the most part I'm very enamored with every instrumental on this record it's really Jeremih and his incredibly depraved lyrics where I don't really get anything out of this project like on the song doper essentially he's talking about engaging in drugs and sex to kill the monotony when in fact all he's really doing here is creating a monotonous song how many songs are there out there about similar topics with a similar theme with a similar story there's some cringe-worthy lyrics on this thing truthfully honestly no joke the last track on this thing the end you just want to get a G all in your g-spot not to mention the completely needless chance the rapper feature on this track where chances just sort of shouting filling up space killing time then the song sort of fizzles out ends abruptly to me Jeremiah isn't a terrible singer he has quite a good falsetto and I think he's got command over his voice I just think what he's singing about and the way that he sings is just so awfully trendy that it's kind of hard to see him for the artist that he is or the the distinct artist that he could be a lot of the time on top of these tracks I just feel like he is a placeholder who's just merely fulfilling a sound that's kind of hot right now a sound that Shlomo really wanted to pursue and Jeremiah was just the fastest way to get there there some tracks on the CP that I like such as no more or let it go but there's not much I find appealing about these tracks outside of the instrumental honestly I'm sort of feeling a strong five on this thing I like the beats I like the aesthetic it's just the other half the storytelling the singing that I don't really care for transition if you've given the CP a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana subscribe to rich forever 
Wc1nLKO2daI,bran theny Newton oh here the Internet's bit busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new LaRue album trouble in paradise LaRue is an electro-pop and a synth pop project hailing from the UK and is fronted by spearheaded by masterminded by songwriter singer keyboardist Ellie Jackson her debut album as LaRue dropped in 2009 and off of this album some of the best pop singles of the aughts came like quicksand and bulletproof a song that every once in a while I still hear on the radio to this day which is a lot of mileage for a modern pop song with in an age where everything just seems so in and out and disposable I did find myself being more enamored with the singles of this record that I was with the record itself that I was the deeper cuts but I was looking forward to whatever LaRue was doing in the future because there was a lot of talent on this record I thought Jackson's voice was great I like the aesthetic of the project it had a vintage 80s synth-pop flair to a totally new wave yet there was something really modern and punchy about the electro style production now my anticipation of this new record has been heightened by a few things one the fact that we've essentially had to wait about five years to hear this record - we have the loss of Ben Lang made as an official member of La Rue which was essentially a duo up until this point and then some really great singles I think builds up to the release of this album let me down gently an uptight downtown keep in mind I haven't heard anything single wise on this album that I think is going to have the staying power and the virality of bulletproof but I still think La Rue brings our really great no-frills pop album with nine songs to the table the rhythms the instrumentation the melodies the lead vocals it's all sharp and the songs here essentially tell a series of tales of the highs and the lows of love the song paradise is you is essentially about being obsessed and infatuated with that one special person and seeing literally paradise in being with that person or there's cruel sexuality which seems to be depicting a relationship where sex is a bit of a bargaining chip or a weapon or something that one can use control against the other person in the relationship there's a very telling refrain at the end of this track where Jackson is singing you make me happy in my everyday life but why do you keep me in this prison at night and then there's the song sex attack where Jackson is singing about this guy who seems to be pursuing sex with strangers or even insinuating sex with prostitutes over having sex with his significant other Jackson is definitely in the same mental state when it comes to the world of love and heartbreak betrayal and if you want to hear a song on this record that sort of works outside of that storyline you're kind of out of luck outside of the song uptight downtown in this infatuation with love makes total sense for this album I think because the title is trouble in paradise a phrase that people typically use to depict a bit of choppy water or some difficulties in a relationship and there's sort of the outsider and then I don't know they see a couple fighting their thing a little trouble in paradise I'm a total jerk and LaRue depicts many flavors of trouble across these songs in the Paradise angle that comes through in the title is displayed in the instrumentals I feel which have a very blissful nostalgic feel to them Jackson is sounding more inspired by 80s style synth pop than ever there are beats on this record that remind me of Simple Minds or Depeche Mode or maybe a little bit of human League or blondie maybe a little bit of Prince to the very punchy sort of aggressive electro vibe in the instrumentals seems to have kind of melted away which unfortunately might hurt LaRue as this international radio pop phenom but it has added up into a very great listenable record I think the songs and the instrumentals on this record are pretty diverse though they all stay in line with that vintage synth pop vibe and it feels old enough to be a little nostalgic but the focus is never lost on just making a good tune because the truth is a lot of the songs on this record could be dressed in numerous styles of production and it would still be catchy uptight downtown I love the shimmering echoey bouncy guitars on this thing the beat the bassline when I hear this instrumental I see in my head a Michael Jackson style choreography routine with maybe some zombies or something like that the song kiss and not tell very cute happy melody on this track then their silent partner one of the most urgent instrumentals on this entire record and a very interesting instrumental galloping instrumental interlude on the back end of this track it's the longest song on the record at 7 minutes and Lowry really explores just doing a bit of instrumental flares opposed to just simply delivering a verse chorus and a version of chorus some songs I just like more than others some songs have just very my new issues with them that I don't totally care for like maybe a bassline that's a little lazier a little offbeat or even the verse vocals on the song tropical chancer not the most thrilling melody on the record usually the verses on this record are pretty sharp just as catchy as the choruses but in this particular track not really the only song on this record that I flat-out do not like I mean literally this album from track 1 track 8 is stellar the only track I don't like is the closer the feeling totally and utterly disappointed with this song not only as a finisher but as a song as well completely lackluster ballad the melody just jumps around really awkwardly sort of like it's it's just not sure of what it wants to be and on top of that you have Jackson singing in falsetto not the prettiest side of her range and trying to sort of harmonize with herself with a background vocal it does not sound all that great the bass drum is barely audible the bass line is barely audible the snare drum in the beat is just way louder than I would expect it to be it's just like this album is taking a chance on inviting a complete stranger to your parties and there are fantastic amazing guests life of the party and just as they're about to leave they just go face-first into the door but everything leading up to that point is really good yeah I don't think Jackson has the most original or distinct voice of all time this is a pop record bunch of songs about love it's not really reinventing the wheel it's not going to push the envelope but if you're looking for a new synth pop record with a vintage Flair and quality songs nearly front to back then I say listen to this I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing Tran ition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana La Rue trouble in paradise Bob you trap the cool dancer but it turns out that he was a dancer the traffic old dancer but it turns out that he was at the 
NDq4wuxZdh0,low fight a no album whoo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's clumsiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new orwell's record disgrace land these guys are an Illinois rock outfit this is their latest full-length LP haven't heard of them before but check out this record based upon a few tracks on it being hot like let it burn and who needs you and these songs are all right they're good Singles they're catching they're straightforward let it burn has maybe one of the best courses on the entire LP I can see why these songs are popular but they're singles you know you expect them to be kind of straightforward and it's a little easier on the ears maybe a bit more just covering covering more bases sounding like more artists just to kind of you know rope in a lot of different people but going deeper into the record I was just genuinely disappointed by nearly everything this album had to offer because it's just such bland generic safe garage rock it's just so dime a dozen man and it just does not have just does not have a real sense of great to it in my opinion they've definitely got a lot of the production styles down there playing those garage those modern garage rock revival riffs but there's everything on this album except a real sense of rebellion yeah there's a there's a track out here that's sort of a you know Sam and there are tracks on here that sort of allude to some bad behavior but the way the music sounds on this record for I was listening to the album and I caught myself thinking like has anybody in this band ever stayed up past 8 o'clock like or Cena rated-r movie let and I'm sure they have but I feel like I can give this album to like a child and not worry about it potentially corrupting them or anything you know especially you know with like these grade school level lyrics that are on this LP here we go I have them in front of me over here I have some of them in front of me this the lyrics to the song the righteous one smoke in the air I don't have a care double double double double double double double dare falling down the stairs oh but it's not fair don't touch your hair it's not nice to stare but it's not fair to let down your hair oh I don't know where where where where where I don't know where where where where where to go yeah and then there's um let's see these really are lyrics the song dirty sheets from the east coast to the west we ain't the worst we ain't the best drink all night I'm such a mess there's something missing in my chest show me the hill show me the view I swear I'm coming back for you I lost my mind I lost my shoe I found myself when I found you open it shut that way who listen I also have another list up here this is a list of garage rock bands that are way more interesting in my opinion better if you only listen to the Orwells and you don't listen to these bands in my opinion you are doing yourself a disservice we live in America you can listen to whatever garage rock band you want but you should be listening to these artists either as well or instead the Black Lips who the Orwells actually borrow quite a bit from there's actually a song on this record that sounds like they took the riff from oak Katrina chopped it in half and then started playing it over some Pixies type production I don't know what the point there was but there you go so the Black Lips listen to good bad not evil fantastic record listen to the Oblivion's listen to the late and great Jay retard listen to his uh-oh 607 singles collection blood visions oh eight singles collection dead moon is great King Khan and barbeque show or King Khan and the shrines though they do have more of like a soul influence there let's see the mummies the mummies are great hot snakes though they do have a little bit more of a post hardcore vibe but do check out ha snakes VOCs I don't even like VOCs that much aside from their first few records but I would very much recommend them over this there are actually quite a few garage rock bands I do not care for that I think I would recommend over this like the dirt bombs they're okay but the dirt bombs more interesting to me as well as Fiddler's not really crazy about Fiddler's but check out Fiddler's check out natural child check out Brian Jonestown Massacre lots of interesting really gritty like don't fucking show your mom this record this sort of garage rock and you know unless your mom is like a huge garage rock fan and then share the album with your mom but you know not this is some badass stuff whereas this Orwell's record to me is just so it's just so PG it's it's just barely pg-13 so yeah there you go that's my thoughts and you can totally disagree you can hate me and you don't have to listen any of these bands either I'm just recommending and that's it have a nice day you have to make Fantana your Wells forever 
WciHRKHwBuA,hey everyone tight I sleep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review we got to talk about some music makes me excited the new panopticon's record roads to the north these guys are a Kentucky metal band and do not ask me why I'm reviewing so much metal I'm reviewing it because it's good and I'm specifically reviewing this project because I think it's one of the most interesting long-running best-kept secrets in the Kentucky music scene the band is actually sole member Austin lund who is an incredible multi-instrumentalist not only bringing the foundation of metal to the table with guitars and drums and vocals but also bringing woodwinds and strings and a plethora of other instrumentation a pretty ambitious undertaking however when I listened to the project's last full-length LP Kentucky what I understand to be a bit of a concept album about Kentucky's coal mining history I reacted to it a little negatively because I I think I heard the second track off of this thing and right at the start that was a terribly incorporated either tin whistle or recorder at the very start of the song that sounded awful imagine that soaring over these blast beats and harsh guitars it was not a pretty sight however I still walked away from this record being kind of enamored with the aesthetic of the band bringing black metal together with folk music not anything entirely new but it is something that some of my favorite black metal bands do like over and Agalloch however in Austin Lunz neck of the woods folk music is something totally different than it is to over folk music is American folk music it is bluegrass so occasionally on these tracks you have fiddle solos you have banjo and it's actually pretty nice the folk instrumentation the acoustic instrumentation on this record at times make it pretty easy listen even for people who aren't really fans of metal music but throughout a lot of the black metal moments on this record there's a really strong element of melody the harshness on these songs doesn't really come without an element sweetness their tracks on this record that are pure bluegrass like the first song in this three song series called the long road it's nothing but plucked guitars and banjos in every direction of fiery fiddle solo it's really speedy dynamic edge-of-your-seat kind of track even though it's entirely acoustic the ending of the song isn't the best in the world because it seems the transition right into one of the harshest most pummeling intros on the entire record and even though I do like these two styles these two genres that are being represented here and I think they're being represented well there is a serious shift in tone from the end of this track to the beginning of the next track and then there's the song Norwegian Nights which is kind of a very downtrodden sad despair filled singer-songwriter track with just fiddles and guitars that are overcome with misery and are playing very slow and the vocals are maybe my least favorite thing about the track they're just so cold they're just so lifeless I'm sure it was intentional to an extent but even though these vocals rubbed me the wrong way a little bit I still see this as a very essential track in the tracklisting it's a really nice change of pace a nice piece of counterpoint from the harder and heavier songs on this record which are essentially the crux of the album these epic twisted adventurous black metal tracks that reach up to 9 12 minutes have tons of extra instrumentation woven into them the first track kicks off of the flurry of drums and guitars and all these bleeding fiddles like bleeding like a sheep I actually find that the fiddles bring another piece of chaotic beauty to the the chaotic beauty I typically find in black metal that I think is great there's also a really nice chunky heavy thematic riff that breaks up these more melodic fiddleback parts and there's some fiery guitar solos on the song too and throughout the entire record as well it's really fast sweet picking really great sense of melody and all this stuff this incredibly riveting stuff happens only the first four minutes of the song there's five more minutes every single track on this LP no matter how long it is is incredibly multifaceted dynamic always progressing always changing like the track the long road part two which toward the end of the song it progresses into this really chill laid-back subtle progressive rock passage with this great chord progression the rhythm of this part just feel so off kilter and yet it's just so relaxed and as the song continues it gets a bit of a post rock vibe with these ethereal soaring guitars and during the picture and this post-rock feel continues on to the intro of the next track it's just so nice to have this long span of beautiful rock instrumentation to sort of complement the harsher parts on this record because even though they are great and I do like them they are so unrelenting partially because the production is so rough not so rough that it's like darkthrone Transylvanian hunger level but the drums the guitars the strings it can all feel a little claustrophobic and a lot of the time the vocals are kind of buried however the recording limitations on this record don't really stop paying opticon from incorporating to some really grim or beautiful subtleties into these songs like at the end of the long road three where we get this black metal style vocal and death metal style vocal double up the second track off of this LP starts with a really beautiful gorgeous acoustic interlude which progresses into this anthemic marching black metal hymnal that i think is actually really invigorating and kind of uplifting the song gives off this immense vibe of glory and power and then there is the last track on the LP which is maybe the most cinematic and climactic on the entire record I mean some illustrious instrumentation on this thing strings bells it's like some Lord of the Rings level this moment in the song really could have legitimately been placed into a really huge and expensive soundtrack and would have sounded great but this is just one smidge in the song I mean the rest of the track is good as well but this is just serious highlight I love black metal that can bring a sense of magnificence to the table and this album definitely does that this album feels more victorious than the bloodiest and most righteous battle ever fought there's so much going for it that harkens back to the black metal tradition but the fact that this album is so influenced by American folk music and bluegrass just gives it a different melodic sense plus you have so much variety on this record and it all comes together so well for the most part it is a little long-winded and there are a couple tracks that I felt like paled in comparison to others like in silence which i think is maybe the most disjointed song on the entire LP but I was still pretty wowed and amazed by the material that was put in front of me on this LP I'm feeling a strongly to like 9 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana panoptic on forever 
qy-tfRCoGGc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new deadmau5 record while one is less than two this is the latest LP from famed Ontario electronic music producer and DJ deadmau5 one of the biggest names in the EDM today ton of respect for the sky he's got quite a few singles that I like however I was not really looking forward to listening to this new deadmau5 record because in my opinion mainstream modern EDM music is not really an album genre and not that it couldn't be I just don't see a lot of artists taking that route to me a lot of the records that are coming out of modern EDM and especially deadmau5 is past records field was just more like compilations even though he's put out things that are legitimately compilations his main albums just feel like a collection of tracks that he made from this point in time to this point in time that may not necessarily sound that fantastic together everybody keeps saying that album is dead and yet the album continues to be like this that so many artists continue to play into and release despite the fact that some of these artists are playing music within genres where it's really singles that reign supreme and that's the case for deadmau5 that's the case for modern IDI yum-yum-yum-yum it's the live set and it's the single that really continues to advance his popularity and that's fine I know how fun a live DJ set can be deadmau5 actually tries to work to sort of recreate that experience on this record by giving people tracks that essentially mix and link all the songs on this double album together into an unbroken chain an interesting idea I think but still there were reasons I was dreading giving this record to listen for one it's over two hours long that's a lot of material coming from an artist that I don't really care for when it comes to the album experience the single and live experience is another story and I suppose the other thing I've dreaded is in the past I've also heard deadmau5 bring on some pretty terrible plastic and commercial sounding guest singers that I think completely ruin his tracks however this new record was not really the one-dimensional and arduous listen that I thought it was going to be Joel actually did his best to create a series of songs that are really free of awful guest singers the only real guest singer on this entire LP is Colleen D'Agostino of the band the material but even Joel's usual house style bangers are a little darker and noisier and glitchy er and industrial on this record a lot of these tracks typically feature some kind of very light airy melodic beautiful interlude - Joel is writing more dynamic material on this LP in a way it kind of reminds me of that John Hopkins album that dropped last year immunity a record that brought very tense creative hard-hitting house tracks and incorporated very organic live instrumentation like pianos and some strings as well I definitely feel an influence from this John Hopkins record but even more so I think there's quite a bit of Nine Inch Nails on this LP - there are some tracks on this record that are just Trent Reznor all the way from the downward spiral - Trent's more recent sound track work the song somewhere up here totally feels like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental and then there's the very eerie drone and piano on the song Kola can - and Joel isn't even afraid of making this influenced incredibly obvious by featuring two remixes that stick out like sore thumbs in the tracklist not in a good way of a Nine Inch Nails song and how to destroy angels song however I do find a lot of the other tracks on this LP to be very appealing and I think a lot of them actually divert away from the more commercial side of Joel's output like the song ride his lament which is a beautiful little electronic music composition it's a very pretty track in a song that has me thinking that deadmau5 really has his ear to some orchestral music on this record some film scores and maybe even a little I care because you do era effects twin-like on the song creep or a moment to myself my only major disappointment with this song is that it fades out so suddenly and the songs on the second disc of this record do this side of the double album tends to be a bit more melodic and gentle not really setting a continuous groove or anything like that for a DJ set these two discs actually feel like two totally different albums while the first disc is fairly straightforward the second disc to me feel sort of like a soundtrack that doesn't really have a movie to string it together even the most hard-hitting driving beat on this entire record from the song Mercedes feels like it could be set to visuals it feels very cinematic I believe there's even some audio of like a train station or a subway station being sampled into this track there is a very righteous chord progression on this track too that makes the song feel pretty epic some of what's on the second disc is pretty gripping but some of it I don't know kind of isn't there are a lot of guitar and piano interludes on the side of the disc that run a little bland maybe with the exception of the song Monday which takes a very familiar chord progression sets an incredibly sad melody to it and there's some singing robot vocals on the back end of the track it's sort of like a weepy cut that didn't make the new Daft Punk record or something it's nice to hear deadmau5 pushing into some more subtle territory but is the end result amazing not really however there are some very good bangers on the first disc of this album I think the opener to this disc is incredibly primal really dark rhythms on this track loved it the second track on here brings a really beautiful interlude that I think is great as I said I don't really care for the how to destroy angels remix but pretty much more than two thirds of the first disc on this record are just really great creative colorful house bangers for Joel a little darker a little more melodic a little more textured than usual for him some of these tracks are structurally surprising I think that Joel brings some great grooves and I love what he does when he usually brings an interlude into the fold with some of these songs - now some of them can run a little long like eight or nine minutes for me maybe Joel doesn't bring quite enough progression to the table to keep me on the edge of my seat with these songs from beginning to end but I still think he's coming through with some of his best material yet on this new record I'm feeling a seven on the first disc feeling a five on the second disc cool cool transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana deadmau5 [Music] 
PiL_FfqyVfk,ladies and gentlemen now the greatest review made about a turkey with a new CL a thousand forms of fear - kidney Sentinel thank you thank you thank you oh yeah thank you oh yeah SIA is a UK via Australia singer-songwriter who has been at it for over a decade now she has the albums to show for it and for years she's made it as a singer-songwriter as a pop and soul vocalist putting her vocal talents over electronics as well as live instrumentation she has come out with some pretty alternative and eccentric music in the past but she has seen mainstream success as well with some of her work charting as well as collaborating in Co songwriting with some big names over the years SIA has had a pretty versatile run but building up to the release of this album I started hearing this backstory about this record that she was sort of planning on retiring from the limelight just to sort of settle down as a songwriter the lead single off this LP chandelier was allegedly passed on by Rihanna a track I'm actually surprised she passed on it's a great song but I'm not really surprised that SIA would write for a singer like Rihanna because I find a lot of similarities in their low-end in the mid-range or their vocal ranges sometimes it's her inflection sometimes it's just the the tone of her voice SIA seems very in tune with Rihanna's singing style but hitting it big a few years ago on a huge single with David Guetta along with maybe not selling enough of her songs I don't know all of this compounded into boo another record here as a solo artist however SIA has chosen not to appear in any pictures or videos in promotion of this new record of hers not really a commercial move however this is CEA's most commercial sounding record yet a thousand forms of fear really feels like a series of radio ready electro pop and R&B singles that might have been written with the intention of passing them off to people like Rio and for SIA this is an interesting change of pace her past record which she's worked on with Greg Kurstin not nearly as conventional vocally to me she is not coming off as eccentric as she has in the past and there are some instrumentals on this LP that are disappointingly formulaic turns out SIA is relying mostly on her songwriting chops on this record which she has a lot of she could pen a catchy chorus she has a stellar voice her singing is unbelievably powerful a motive on point yet there are some very human imperfections too when she's reaching in her upper register which she's yelling or straining that just brings a lot of beauty to the table brings a lot of great conviction heart especially as the intensity in her singing escalates on the bridge of songs like chandelier not only that but in the lyrics of these songs there's a lot of pain and personal turmoil going on the song chandelier I believe addresses alcoholism I think I also see a bit of reference toward abusing pills or meds on the song cellophane though that song also does reference being uplifted or saved I think by someone's love there's also a song on here about being a hostage to someone's love fair game where we see SIA having the upper hand in the game of love big girls cry broken heart on the song straight for the knife the chemistry between two people seems to turn really dark and the love isn't really reciprocated and on fire meets gasoline the chemistry is instead explosive there's a lot of relationship stuff on this record truthfully the the subject matter of these songs don't really change up all that much and with the lack of seriously interesting instrumentals it can lead to some of these tracks feeling kind of redundant or unnecessary sort of like elastic heart not necessarily a track I think is terrible by itself but in the running with all of these songs where essentially you've got the same themes recurring over and over and over and it's not as if they're telling a story or there's a arc to all of it still see it does dish out some great pop tunes like chandelier that I mentioned earlier amazing chorus on this track fire meets gasoline too as well as Freedy animal and even though the emotions run high on these tracks and the instrumentals boom when the hooks come through there is maybe a little too much melodic similarity between a lot of these more hard-hitting radio-friendly tracks however see it in Greg Kurstin make sure to work in some weird quirky characteristics that break these songs up sort of like the very manic noisy piano solo on fire meets gasoline or the very Skippy glitchy Vogel edits that I love on the song free the animal however there are spots where see it does break away from this sound a little bit like on hostage which instrumentally feels like a really quirky piece of pop rock or the song fair game which is a tone down little piano ballad that reminds me quite a bit of regina spektor if there's anything that consistently pleases me on these tracks though it is it is CEA's voice like on the song eye of the needle where she brings forth some of the most powerful vocalizations on the entire record and straight for the knife another moment on this record that is more subtle CEA's vocal delivery on this track is just really heartbreaking really a majority of the shine on this LP comes from CEA's voice her vocal harmonies and her songwriting which aside from some repetitive love themes are usually very top-notch I really do like this record I think a lot of the material on here is is catchy uplifting really compelling but sometimes I don't know if I like it for what it is or for what it's not doing because for an electro-pop album for contemporary R&B album that has more of a radio appeal it certainly has a more unique personality it doesn't really get trashy to me it's just a very good mixed bag of tracks can't really say much more about it than that I'm feeling as strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana see ya forever 
ODQlbNb4xyY,low fight a no letter from a fan hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hydrate it's hot out and it's time for a letter from a good little paragraph right here dear Anthony recently I've been to a few concerts Neutral Milk Hotel and The Flaming Lips to be precise and while they were both terrific concerts I feel like that some of the crowd behavior really bummed me out and ruined the whole experience in particular people who are constantly on their phones recording for the entire set even when Neutral Milk Hotel specifically asked them not to people shouting song suggestions people pushing their way to the front and so on does using phones ruin the intimacy of live performances between the fans and the artists and kill the mosh pit should all artists be able to ban people using their phones at concerts where would you like to draw the line have you noticed a considerable difference in concert behavior as you've grown up as smartphones have all become much more popular thank you for watching and reading rather Isaac Baxendale Isaac good question son listen um yeah when I used to go to concerts as a kid even in high school and just early on in college when smartphones weren't really you know people had cell phones but you know texting and internet on your phone weren't really a big deal uh yeah there weren't smart phones out people weren't shooting the show I mean maybe there was like a girl or a guy up front with a camera and they were sort of doing some amateur photography or something like that but they probably weren't interrupting the the show or anything like that but the thing about phones today people whipping their phones out it shows going on Twitter they're texting they're taking pictures of themselves and their friends taking selfies at the show or trying to take your video of the artists on the stage whether they've asked them to not do so whether they've asked them to refrain or not these people to me are just kind of inconsiderate you know and the thing is is that inconsiderate people it's it's not like they were invented along with the iPhone you know they've always existed it's just that these inconsiderate actions or these inconsiderate people showed how inconsiderate they were in different ways like I don't know I saw mono play a long time ago and this you know this this was pre cellphones being a big deal in people's lives and there were moments where the band was playing very softly before they you know grew into a crescendo where everybody was talking so loudly and drinking and yelling and screaming and just conversing with one another and this is a packed house like you have to assume a lot of people came to see this band they were the headliner and they were just talking so loudly that you couldn't even hear the band play I mean there have been a few concerts that I've been to pre cell phone era where people just don't know how to shut the hell up and just listen to the band you know people go out to be seen in the scene people go out to socialize they just happen to have a band there and the reason that they go out to a show is because they know that cool people who are in the underground music will also be at the show and they just want to hook up with people who are sort of into that scene or whatever you know so it's it's it's not like people I think are more inconsiderate now than they were it's just that they're being inconsiderate in different ways because there's really convenient technology sitting in their pockets at all times and I totally understand that phones smartphones add a little computer in your pocket it's totally just a part of our lives now you know it's it's it's not going to go anywhere if anything it's going to become even more in tune with our everyday actions with all these apps and probably phones and these computers getting even smaller going on our wrists going on our glasses being injected into our brains and we're children all of these things will most likely occur and I'm not I'm not saying you're going to have a computer chip in your brain of mandatory but you know if you want that sort of thing if you're interested in that sort of thing I'm sure the option will be available to you in the next 50 20 years or so who knows but I don't know at least now people are just staring down at their phones instead of talking and being freaking annoying though I'm sure there are still people who are talking it shows and I would just say my advice personally to you Isaac who wrote the letter and anybody who feels like Isaac just try to get there early try to get down in front so that you see as few phones as possible between you and the stage and even if you are in that situation just ignore people around you just try to focus as much as possible obviously it's not really the phone that's bugging you but people are just being inconsiderate and whatever you know I mean inconsiderate people in a large group they're going to be there you just got to do your best to just focus on what you're there for and that's the artist now directed to the people who bring their phones out it shows what do you do in what are you doing why are you you paid money good money to see this artists perform in front of you and you're spending the whole time taking really crappy pictures and video of this person the whole time I mean what are you going to do you're just going to watch the video later and things you're not even like watching them you're watching them through the phone like there's listen listen to this there's an even better higher quality than the HD camera in your phone that you're shooting right now with it's called real life called the real life it's better than HD it's not even like pixels it's just like real it's it's like freaking 3d and serious um you know and did you also not notice that there are a hundred other people in the crowd also taking pictures and shooting video most of which will probably end up on Instagram or YouTube and you can go look at it there and all these other people they're actually closer to the stage than you so there's really no reason for you to take your crappy pictures and video with horrible visual quality and audio and then just take it yourself and put it up on the Internet let other people do that you know and then there's also this other thing that allows you to see things that you experienced in the past it's called memories it's called memories back in the day before computers when things happen to us and we didn't take a picture or we didn't have a VHS video camera to to shoot it with what we did was we sat down and we remembered it whoa hey remember that thing that happened Wow that was certainly a thing I remember it now you know you don't necessarily need to uh shoot a video or take a picture or anything like that I just saw Swans and the truth be told the image of michael gira bending down and wiggling his butt in the face of somebody in the front row and reaching down past between his legs as he's bending over to wiggle his fingers at the person that's forever burned into my retinas whenever I close my eyes I see it I see it when I'm sleeping I wake up in a cold sweat just because that image is forever burned into my retina didn't need to take a picture didn't need to take a video it's stuck in there I pray for the day when it disappears oh listen you don't need to whip your phone out at the show there's really no reason just you know you you paid see here's the thing all day if you want to interact with the artist or the music that you really like you've got to go on the internet and watch a video and listen to an mp3 or listen to a CD or listen to a record you just paid to have a real life experience and interaction with this band or this artist that you like so much and all you're doing is spending it living in the digital world that you're in all the time you're supposed to be taking a break from that that's why you paid money just put the phone down and be done with it and have it you know have real life happening in front of you that's all I'm saying so I'm saying again Isaac thank you for the letter you're the best forever 
vekiCfWRstU,hi everyone antwuan fan Tuan here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new wolves in the throne room record celestite these guys are in Olympia Washington black metal outfit and to me they are a band who's partially responsible for helping to this current trend in popularity toward American black metal with great records like two hunters helping to spark interest a vast huge beautiful black metal record that brings together elements of black metal post rock very atmospheric wonderful record even though these guys are not pioneers in black metal they are not the first American black metal band I wouldn't even say that their sound is the most original in black metal music period they are still a very strong memorable beautiful face in the brave new world of American black metal that I respect incredibly but they're very distinct sound that that I love to me has almost been the death of wolves in the throne room either they are not really living up to it with records like black cascade which are disappointingly dry in the production department or take their last record celestial lineage which to me was just so say me say me and unsurprising it sounded so much like their first two major studio releases it was just kind of hard to see the excitement however still I love this band's music I look forward to what they're gonna do next I was hoping for their next record here it was going to be a major change of pace and they brought a huge change to the table on this record lo and behold no drums on this record no vocals on this record completely different genre on this record this record is ambient it's synthetic it's electronic its soundtrack worthy these tracks shimmer they sparkle occasionally they feature some very grand epic horns and woodwinds which bring some very beautiful melodies and harmonies to the table it's such a drastic change of pace some wolves in the throne room fans might find it kind of unnecessary or may be fed by shallow intentions like let's do this just to do it however I wouldn't really say this is like the most radical change any black metal band has ever made to their sound I mean there is over for example they made some of my favorite early black metal releases ever they made an electronic 180 in the middle of their career there's also Burzum whose sudden change in sound and style was more dictated by going to jail than some kind of artistic desires though he did go back to the sense recently so there have been other bands out there in black metal that started in that genre but then later down the road made an artistic decision and just changed and that being said for an album that is an ambient album a progressive synth album a soundtrack inspired album this record is pretty great it's interesting this album fits into the wheelhouse of Vangelis jean michel jarre Brian Eno and tangerine dream all artists that are completely of my alley so listening to this record was like throwing a duck in the water now there are some added layers of noise to these synthesizers and horns and woodwinds some bass some guitars a lot of which are mounted on top of one another and distorted into this Sun style wall of low-end sound and heaviness they really add a lot of texture and grit to the sound scapes and between these very heavy subterranean bass rumbles and ethereal high-pitched synthesizer sequences wolves in the throne room pulled together a pretty diverse set of sounds for this record the opener on this LP brings a series of very fuzzy and ethereal waves of sound very warm very synthetic and they're punctuated by these droplets of synthesizers suddenly the song erupts into a gargantuan wall of guitars and bright weeping synthesizer leads some epic horns and bass all this instrumentation coming together actually reminds me quite a bit of the some live album Don Kirk where they brought horns and the fold with their heavy guitars eventually this track calms down into some throbbing electronics that are very hypnotic and and turn very dark and ominous as the song continues at the very the track is beautiful it's lush it's vivid the sounds are just tangible I'm gonna grab them and this sonic Odyssey continues onto the track intuition and new de Gaulle which has one of the most chilling and eerie synthesizer intros on the entire LP eventually this gives way to some really twisted dissonant layers of distorted guitars thrown on top of one another so dense so impenetrable there's a bright crescendo of synthesizers that occur right after these guitars just kind of are quieted and and thrown to the wayside and this change is so stunning and beautiful in the last three tracks on this LP because there's just five songs on this thing and they they run about 47 minutes in total the last three songs on this LP segue into one another very nicely there's bridge of leaves which aesthetically is one of the softer tracks on the LP a lot of synthesizers but compositionally it is one of the most epic tracks on the record there's a lot of building on this song which gives away very nicely to celestite mirror which is the longest track on the album a monster of a song with one of the heaviest guitar drones on the entire record toward the back end wolves in the throne room really flexing their compositional muscles on this track and then there is the finishing song which is one of the most blissful moments on the entire record really sort of the birds chirping and leaves sprouting and sun shining after this really intense storm overall there's not really too much in the way of negativity I could say about this record I mean it's not the greatest I've heard in this genre but I think it's a really great effort from wolves in the throne room especially the the surprise moving into this style of music so suddenly I think it's very obvious they went into this style of music doing their homework they didn't feel unprepared it certainly seemed like they knew how to go about making this music and doing it justice and let's not also forget to mention that this album brings together essentially drone metal with 80s style soundtracks synth music which doesn't happen every day there are some moments I wish were longer like the second track on here or maybe even shorter like the back end of the first track which does tend to run a little long and maybe the finishing track could have been just a touch more climactic but I really enjoyed this record a lot now I do understand there are going to be so fans out there who we're just not looking for this record from wolves in the throne room and maybe aren't looking for this kind of record at all maybe this is just not your style of music but if you are into progressive synth and progressive electronic music and drone metal and ambient music and soundtrack music then do give this thing a listen because I think it's got a lot to offer I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this record transition if you've given this up he'll listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana wolves in the throne room forever hey you killed your Chester save me I'm in a very dark place yeah depressed and depressed I'm said it 
SRC5BGunQ7s,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new laser wolf record the Beast of left and right these guys are a mostly instrumental rock and metal trio they have a few records under their belt at this point this is their latest release and I've been seriously anticipating this record ever since I heard a few tracks off of it namely the song beast reality centerpiece and the songs I was hearing off to sell p were a tight head-spinning combination of thrash metal progressive rock and math rock meaning rock music with a lot of time signatures breakneck changes in tempo or groove tracks like beast reality showed off a lot of technical chops but didn't feel too flashy for just the average rock or metal listener to enjoy the solos on this record for the most part are very sharp the musical passages and the riffs are very colorful they're playful they're not overly dark or serious in terms of emotion even on the moodier parts of this record this is an explosive and pretty fun rock record but there are certain aspects of it I'm not that into namely the vocals a lot of them are very distant they're thrown into the background they're mixed low they're slathered and reverb on any other band's record these vocals the vocals that sound like this that had this tone would be background vocals but Laser wolf treats them like they are foreground vocals even making way for them in the compositions of the drums and the guitars but simultaneously aside from a few screams here and there they are so quiet in comparison to the guitars to me this just sounds like they can't commit to vocals they want to do vocals but they don't want to quite make a bold upfront in-your-face vocal but instrumentally these guys have incredible explosive energy they are a fierce well-oiled machine but like the vocals there is an instrumental aspect to this album too that doesn't go quite far enough and that's with composition that's with writing I feel like some of these songs are kind of unsurprising these guys aren't quite like behold the arc to posts or anything like that instrumental metal trio that takes their instrumental license to write tracks that are twisted winding mind-bending unfortunately lazer wolf doesn't really take that many risks on this record especially on the longer tracks here which I think are in the most need of risks like the opener on here where for over eight minutes lazer wolf is dressing and redressing and fussing over pretty much the same melodic themes and chord progressions from nearly the entire track I feel the same sense of disappointment from the song who were the mound builders to a song that given its intro I was hoping would have more of an acoustic and clinician as soon as these acoustic guitars which are very nice open the track up they are overtaken very quickly as some electric guitar is thrown into the mix and it pretty much just bodies whatever accompaniment or counterpoint the acoustic guitar is bringing there are some longer tracks on this LP though that do have more experimental ideas some bolder variations like choose again left-hand path I love the syncopated high pitched guitar leads on that they just fit so tightly with the drums again beast reality is great but some of the weirdest sounds and ideas out of this entire LP come from the shorter tracks like Lagarto or the triple trap which has these fast sharp jarring guitar tapping that makes this one of the most standout tracks on the entire record generally this record is a fun listen but for an instrumental band they don't seem to be pushing things much further than other metal and rock outfits out there that aren't instrumental but from some of the stranger parts on this record I gathered they could go down that road if they wanted and they could do something that features stronger vocals as well if the vocals in general were placed in a better spot in the mix I think this would be a better record as is but even without that change it is a good listen I'm feeling a decent 7 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana lazer wolf forever 
iPquW4HcwV0,hi everyone albatross flamingo year the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new wreck and reference record want these guys are an experimental music duo who put out a record a few years ago that quat that caught my ear pretty strongly no youth a record that pulled together elements of noise rock black metal doom metal spoken word and screamed word and I was actually able to catch these guys live at one point and they do all of this with nothing more than drums and a sampler now there were some tracks on this record that I thought maybe were just a touch too indulgent or songs that I thought could have been fleshed out a bit more songs that were kind of bridges to nowhere or just ended a little too abruptly but still the really refreshing blend of influences on this record and the execution the way these guys went about making their music had me excited to listen to what they were gonna do in the future and this band's new record want is definitely very cohesive and consistent in terms of mood this is easily one of the moodiest most depressing most unforgiving ly abrasive records I have heard this year lots of intense drum beats on this thing glitchy noise escapes and vocals they're warm with aggression with some spoken word and some very weary singing woven into the more subtle parts of this LP - now we didn't though this record is incredibly dark there are some moments on this thing that are a sweetly melodic like with the piano and horn samples on the track of Paulo beneath the whip I imagine these are samples whatever they are they're gorgeous it is a great track but I wish instrumentally it built up a little higher in terms of intensity and there are I see beautiful synthesizer chords on tracks like bankrupt and convalescence - but these songs as well could use a bit more intensity at the finish or a bit more variation across the length of the song some of the instrumentals on the sell P feel like nothing more than just really redundant foundations for some of the most hellish vocals I've heard on a record this year now as we move away from the more melodic side of this LP there are some very abrasive unnerving songs in this tracklist like the song a tax which has an incredibly eerie drone in the background songs like this deliver some incredibly dark emotions in a really short span of time like three minutes or less like the song a glass cage for an animal which resembles being tied up and dragged very slowly into an open grave in which you will be buried alive between the noise and the piano samples and the horn samples and the string samples that land throughout this record there is quite a bit of sonic diversity but I just don't really think record reference are at the top of the game they could possibly be in when it comes to songwriting writing songs that are dynamic have contrasting defined memorable parts aside from the initial blast of emotion or whatever the opening theme of whatever song on this record you're listening to is there isn't much to hear but there are some lyrics a lot of which while they are good our sword is buried and thrown in the background and aren't nearly as upfront as I thought they were on the band's last full-length LP but again the lyrics some hair-raising stuff on this record if you thought the sounds and the performance of the vocals on this thing we're twisted reading into what is being said on this album is even more disturbing overall I did like this record but I still kind of felt like I got more of the same in terms of what the band did with their last LP maybe this album isn't as visceral there were more tones on no youth that felt kind of guitar like this album isn't nearly as bright or as shrill it's much more toned down and kind of dreary which is fine I welcome the change in sound and the change in mood I just wish these guys would write more well-structured songs I guess I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana reckon reference subscribe forever 
k7x2jymh2RY,no fight a no album review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd Wow and it's time for a review of this new little EP this not it sighing really that new at this point this EP this mixtape from Brazilian hip hop trio Pearl's Negros this mixtape they had out it's absolutely freakin bangin I've been listening to it for months it's high-energy it's fantastic it's colorful I've just been sort of waiting around not really knowing completely what to say because I don't really know what the hell they are say in because I don't speak Portuguese assuming that they're speaking Portuguese you know I'm sort of hoping that maybe the EP would get a little bit more popular maybe some of the lyrics and so on and so forth would surface but there's really not anything on this project I fully understand lyrically however hasn't really impeded upon my enjoyment of the thing the beats are absolutely heavy I mean they are freakin bangers and they're colorful and there's a bit of a you know foreign flavor to them just keeps them interesting keep some zesty and you know as as far as their their flows and at least the attitude that they deliver when they come through on these songs there's just a lot of personality to this thing and of course there are some parts where either a hook or a refrain or something like that is in English biggie biggie biggie biggie biggie Apple or make that moment last make that moment last which feels like kind of like a really weird oddball piece of post-punk II pop music it is a sweet little EP and I'm hoping that the maybe these girls tour in America sometime and drop some more music in the near future like I said this thing has been out a little while but if it is somehow slipped past your radar do give it a listen it's it's a really fun little release and it's definitely going to be one of my favourite EPS of this year definitely one of my favorite EPS of this year okay so pearl pearls Negros the Apple give this thing a listen thank you have a nice day forever 
M0EU9vXGHgk,sweaty sweaty no ear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sunny day in Glasgow record sea when absent you know these days there's a lot of boring shoegaze and dream pop out there underground bands that are carelessly churning out needlessly boring songs that do nothing but hide behind the most lazily generated wall of distortion or reverb these walls of sound are not really living up to the mastery of groups like My Bloody Valentine and slow dive and Cocteau twins Galaxie 500 there are some newer groups who I happen to love as well like beach house and the radio department but these other new groups that I don't really care for I feel like they're not really smearing their songs and beautiful mind-expanding studio trickery like a lot of these greats do instead they're just trying to obscure a lack of interesting song ideas a sunny day in Glasgow though I've never considered them to be one of these groups but I have been a little on the fence with them over the years the band's name itself seems to kind of stand in the shadow of the heritage of the music they pull from so strongly noise pop and twee pop and shoegaze and their first couple of records even though they are rife with sonic experiments they're a little too disjointed and hairbrained to really catch on beyond a few singles or tracks that were hot on the blogosphere in the early days of the music blogosphere and like the late 2000s however in 2010 the band dropped a record that totally went through my radar and it just so happened to be maybe their most concise and accessible record yet and this newer record of theirs to me kind of goes back to the raw experimentation of their debut of their sophomore record but also incorporates these more straightforward pop appeals this record is catchy this record is sweet and yet it is also wildly psychedelic adventurous and kind of dense there are some tracks on this LP that do come off pretty straightforward though songs like crushing a lazy little love ballad of a song with booming drums and watery guitars and synthesizers the simultaneously heavy but light airy and fluffy and the song the body bends has some of the most intelligible vocals on the entire record really raw upfront strong bold confident delivery in the singing I love it and the blissful explosion of guitars on the chorus of this track makes for one of the most beautiful moments on this album and a sunny day in Glasgow still manages to sound sweet as they deliver some of the weirdest sonic experiments I've heard on a pop record this year like the very warm but suffocating distortion on the song bye-bye big ocean which features all these off-kilter drum beats and bouncy echo a lead vocals swimming through this sea of distortion or the really weird shouting on the refrain of the song in love with useless which every time this voice shouts there's the screaming pitch echoing from behind it but as soon as the voice stops the noise stops it's like the voice is coming from Pandora's box and in order to hear every word you need to open and close the box each time simultaneously letting out the lead vocal and screams from hell and there is a killer pop song underneath all of the psychedelic mess of this song I also have the blissful buzzing guitar solos on the back end of this track this song just melts beautifully all the sounds together this record in general is really just a beautiful melt of sounds there's oh I'm a record which has some of the weirdest vocal edits on the entire album or golden wave which sounds like something panda bear would have co-produced with Grimes but they didn't really get along that well so they were frustrated the whole time and they were trying to get through real fast I sort of mean that in an interesting way but the really weird attention-grabbing chipmunk vocals hanging in the background of this track are kind of obnoxious and that's the thing with some of these tracks and some of these experiments they do sort of tend to overstay their welcome here and there mostly if there's not really that great of a song hanging in the background like the things they do to me or the song never nothing which is an incredibly drab to and are really uneventful instrumental to back it up but a lot of these songs feeling long isn't necessarily a bad thing I feel like a sunny day in Glasgow really goes the mile with some of these tracks these could have simply been one two or three minute songs but a lot of the time these guys are stretching these tracks out to four or five minutes which in the grand scheme of popular music isn't that long but there's just something about these tracks that just makes them feel longer than they actually are it's like yeah they're poppy they're catchy but they also feel like a bit of a drone a soundscape but I'm listening to some of these tracks some of the best tracks on this LP time kind of stops or slows down a little bit which i think is a pretty intriguing effect for any album to have really for the most part I do like this album I think it's a really great noise pop shoegaze record I think it's one of the most creative in terms of sonic experimentation in a while barring the new My Bloody Valentine record with some of these songs being as long and as multifaceted as they are not all of the various parts of these tracks mesh together really well especially on some of the songs that have intended sloppiness in the instrumentation that kind of leaves a sour taste in my ears but on the whole I think the band pulled together a really creative interesting sweet fun colorful tracks that I can really dive into the sound play of I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's what sunny day in Glasgow forever 
PNzF0QzOWGo,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and this is essentially a to the point raw obligatory video talking about the breakup of our beloved experimental hip-hop trio yeah graps um I think I'm only making this video because a lot of people were just saying yeah the Death Grips broke up what do you think of Death Grips are you okay are you depressed are you sad um no I'm not really depressed I'm not really sad Death Grips died as they lived they did what they wanted when they wanted how they wanted to do it and if they want to break up I have to totally respect that just like if they decide to get back together somewhere down the road if that happens um am i sad that I'm never possibly going to hear a new Death Grips album ever again um not necessarily I mean I think they have a pretty solid discography so far I think in the very short time that they were making music they made some of the most bold genre pushing envelope pushing hip hop of all time you know what else could you ask for other than foreign artists to come out with music you love and come out with music that advances the art form of music and you know essentially creates music that is um in a lot of ways entirely unique so no you know I'm not really sad that they're they're gone you know I think Death Grips came and and did what they did and you know I I thank them for doing what they did in the way that they did it you know there were points when I felt slightly disappointed there were points when you know I thought that they were embarking on some really ridiculous antics but you know the fact that they were such a live wire musically and actually you know in the real world in the music industry as part of what made people so attracted to them in the first place you know this is just one more surprise that they just sort of thrown in our laps you know it's it's it's funny um I remember seeing a tweet yesterday from Trent Reznor talking about how he's sorry that you know he oh man I really thought these guys could keep it together for this to arrive I've invited them on with Soundgarden and um you know while it's it's it sucks for anybody who bought tickets it sucks for Trent it sucks for Soundgarden to have essentially gotten that promise you know and then and now Death Grips is is not going to be playing any of those shows because upon breaking up they cancel all the live dates that they had scheduled however they will still be coming out with the second half of their powers-that-be record from what I read on this note that they posted up on their Facebook all that being said uh I don't know if Trent can really be in a position to be like oh I didn't feel this comin I mean had since Death Grips started had there even been a full year of time within within this year time had there even been a year in their existence where they didn't cancel a bunch of live dates um I may be wrong about that but if my memory serves me correctly they cancelled live dates like every year um or just didn't show up to shows or something like that so I mean as much as I love their music and I love them as a project um I don't know if I would ever book them for a show just I'm just saying I'm just saying you know that there's a difference between enjoying their art and trusting them to sort of go in on like a business thing with and um you know it's it's it's that unpredictability that I'm sure made people like Trent here about Death Grips I mean yeah of course they make great music and I'm sure he wasn't you know totally just going gaga over the fact that they're so unpredictable but you know what what artist what person out there doesn't actually want to be affiliated with the band that really truly does not give a shit and really truly does everything by its own rules and by its own logic I feel like there are a lot of people out there in the industry that act like they're doing that but they're not really you know and and and that's and I feel like the the reason that I feel that way is because there's so much predictability you know and how everybody's acting and you know in in terms of artists in the industry and of course there are artists out there who do want to play by the rules and through that philosophy they are doing what they want to do but um but Death Grips clearly came into music wanting to do what they wanted when they wanted and that's how they finished off and that's how they finished off so no you know I'm not really upset I'm not really depressed I got the records you know I saw them live um at a great performance uh so I even ended up in one of their music videos for a split second at that performance because they were like shooting video that performance um you know I met them for a brief tiny second you know I'm I'm good I'm good you know I mean maybe I'd be a little more disappointed or upset if I didn't ever get to see them live or something like that you know a lot of that then then it's just like a missed opportunity you know butBut I feel like I've interacted with Death Grips art to the extent that I would like to you know not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed seeing them go on uh but you know I don't feel like this ending is bittersweet or anything like that you know all of their moves have just been sudden and breakneck and quick in we're doing it and this is just in true Death Grips fashion and I funnily enough if they decide to come back and say huh we were screwing with you guys that would kind of be in true Death Grips fashion as well because there are no strangers to totally messing with their fans so uh the only thing out of this that I think I could say would totally disappoint me is that if we never heard another piece of music from either flatlander or Ryder Zach Hill ever again I know Zach Hill is gonna drop something in the future he's just so prolific he's always creating he's always evolving he's always doing something different collaborating with somebody I know I'll hear something from Zach um as far as writing a flatlander you know I would love to hear music from them as well and who knows maybe they'll get back together with a different name or some stuff like that you know if that's that's possible as well you know maybe there will just be a hill and right project maybe real just be a ride in flatland or a flatlander Zach project or something with the three of them and five other members or something which is the two of them and two other new different members who the hell knows you know there are tons of possibilities in the future um so you know now not really disappointed I'm just happy that they did what they did in the time that they did it and that's it you know bands break up artists stop making music it's the circle of life but you know the music lives on and that's you know and if you really like the music then you don't really need anything else other than that cool cool love you sweaty Death Grips break it up forever 
3MnBA__QrfY,hahahahaha hi everyone free thinnies Fantana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new u.s.a out of vietnam record crashing diseases and incurable airplanes this is USA out of Viet Nam's our long debut album lengthy record but it caught my ear on first listen with this really gargantuan sound this thing is five songs long most of them are moving past the 10-minute mark pretty easily but the varied influences this band puts on display keep the songs pretty interesting the strongest of all these influences being post rock that epic slow building experimental rock sub-genre popularized by bands like cigarettes Godspeed You black emperor swans Mogwai explosions in the sky mono Tok Tok and silver Mount Zion a group who I think USA out of Vietnam has a lot in common with in its incorporation of vocals into these post-rock like song structures that was pretty nerdy obviously USA out of Vietnam is a little too late to be a part of the roots of this genre like many of the bands that I just named but these guys clearly pay attention to the roots incorporating elements of drone and shoegaze and noise rock there's even a song on here that has this long stretch of tape with this guy talking about some really esoteric existentialist mumbo-jumbo these guys even bring a little bit of sludge metal into the fold do not take USA out of Vietnam ISM third rate third generation post rock band which is just essentially domed the genre down to shimmering guitar baby food they are much more than that but still even though I do think they are better than bands that that fit that bill there are some things about this record that rubbed me the wrong way right from the word go one of them being the production the recording of the instrumentation and maybe even the mix of this record leaves some of these songs feeling a little muddy a little dull but especially the vocals feel incredibly distant a lot of the time the lead vocals on this record kind of week a little nondescript outside of that I think these guys did a really good job of composing some really expansive rock songs with bright horns heavy guitars blaring bass strings as well piano some soaring chorus vocals like with the song you are a comet you are on fire the shortest song on this entire record at 7 minutes has that long expansive monologue that I talked with you about earlier in the review which gives way to a really epic blast of guitars and drums I mean really heavy immense stuff it's like two planets filled with garbage trucks which are filled with light bulbs colliding the first track on here is even more epic with these huge huge chorus vocals which are absolutely beautiful you know even though they're not really is up front as I would like vocals like this to be they do add a lot of beautiful color to the track and these two songs in general really bring some crushing blows on this record but as soon as the halfway point of the cell P rolls in songs like as Final 1322 an especially leg of lamb USA out of Vietnam essentially leans a little too hard on the vocals to kind of carry the song and the vocals just don't have the personality or the presence to lead these songs in the way that I feel like the band is pushing them to either they're too heavily warped in effects to even really be memorable or when they're raw and really dry they just feel too lightweight to really leave an impact I think the only vocal on here that works against that is the one that opens up the final track on this record which feels pretty weary and sort of menacing in a way sort of dark thankfully a lot of the time there is more of an emphasis on the instrumentation on this record or the vocals and instrumentation are in a bit of a balance and the instrumental compositions on these three final tracks are impressive and heavy and reliable and colorful and really expansive like the two songs that kick this entire LP off there's a lot to like about us a Vietnam and this record I mean overall my opinion of this LP is good I just focus on these few things that I think take this record down a bit because I think this is really a band away and I think they have an incredible amount of potential I just feel like the vocals could be cleaned up turned up maybe delivered with a bit more passion or emotion and the production could be a bit clearer as well overall I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's in Anthony Fantan Oh USA had a Vietnam forever 
1sD2itQySVg,low fight a no presents letter from a fan hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd hmm get a deep breath in get psyched cuz we got a good segment right here a letter a letter from the fan which I've just conveniently found on the floor hi everyone well hello Anthony Fantan oh my name is Tommy Carver and I'm a big fan of the of the show I'm a 15 year old kid from Wisconsin and I have a problem many of my friends listen to rap just like me but the only listen to rap that's on the radio like Drake 2 Chainz and kid ink I mostly listen to more lyrical and experimental hip-hop like Death Grips Danny Brown and Grande vert more since I listen to artists like them many of my friends refuse to let me play my music around them because they are too boring and unpopular I was wondering if you could help convince them that these rappers are worth listening to Thank You Tommy Tarver sent from my iphone Tommy listen you gotta listen to me Tommy it's not that big a deal it's not that big a deal for a few different reasons one are these people really your friends you're 15 now you're in high school you're going to find out when you're in college when you're out of college well you've got a career or you're homeless how many people who you were friends with in high school you were only really friends with because you saw them like five times a day you know ain't that serious but I was turned on to underground experimental music in high school if there is a point in life to be turned on to that type of music I feel like this is the this is the age range you know however some people are just never going to be into obscure abrasive shit possibly because they have that mentality that thinking like oh well if it's not popular then how can it be good and you know honestly just make a list of things that are or were really popular that are obviously really shitty and hand that to them and just be like see that mentality sucks but still you know some people have a certain kind of taste and they want to hear a certain kind of thing they want to hear feel good blissful happy upbeat music that signifies a good time um Death Grips does not do that you know Death Grips is not fucking party music Death Korea as much as I love Death Grips you're not going to find many people who loves Death Grips more than I um it's it's not something I would I would hang out with like ten of my friends be like hey guys you're the new Death Grips BAM um no you know um we're party and we're hanging out where we're trying to chill we're trying to relax I'm not trying to you know get them into I've always known I've always known ozone I've always look fuck me fuck me you know I'm not I'm not trying to do that you need to realize how far apart on the ideological on the sonic spectrum you guys truly are they're listening to kid ink on the radio and they really love the new kid ink record even though it's a generic pop rap garbage they really love the new kid ink record and you're listening to Death Grips yeah you guys are both listening to hip hop in theory but beyond that uh there's not much common ground you know imagine it's 1984 and last year Quiet Riot dropped up there really huge hit single their cover of Slade's come out feel the Noize blastin all over the radio people love it they think it's awesome your friends drive up in the car you know they're all sitting there like and their sing-along come on Wow and you you know you're walking up because you're gonna go hit the bowling alley with your friends and chill or whatever the fuck they do in the 80s cocaine and you're like yo guys hey I just got the new Black Flag tape my war and your friends are like oh you know I never heard of no Black Flag what's that you know pop it in my don't want out them and your friends are like oh hey dude hey son hey my friend pop that tape out sort throw it away it's you don't even have it anymore it's in the garbage um yeah and you're just like there look guys I thought you liked rock music can we listen to the Black Flag too and you know it's just it's not like that it's not like that at all you know it's very far on different ends of the spectrum now Danny Brown and Kendrick Lamar you know I couldn't see you potentially turning them on to those artists show them some of Danny Browns more trap a file echt road tracks that are all that MDMA his last LP those songs are really catchy those songs a lot of people seem to like and Kendrick Lamar I mean you know they don't like backseat freestyle they don't like swimming pools you know those are pretty popular singles and have a really strong pop rap flare to them so I mean I don't I don't see why they couldn't possibly dig those tracks if you were to put them on like a do you guys even make mix CDs anymore maybe if you just set your friends some mp3s in an email or just you know something whatever say you try this you know set some a youtube link whatever you know to try to turn them on to something I my experience it's never really been like like when everybody's partying and in the social situation and hanging out to me that's never really been like an ideal time to be like oh hey guys check out this new band you've never heard of before you you know unless you're like in a group of people who they're all all into weird shit they're all into experimental shit or something like that to me a social situation everybody's you know really more concentrating on having a good time talking to other people socializing I'm not really thinking about trying to expand their minds musically to me that's something that is much best done when below when just chilling when relaxing and if you're going to turn your friends on to these artists it's it's maybe best to do it either in a one-on-one session or just to you know pass them some kind of album some kind of record some kind of song whether the medium be physical or digital and just have them listen to it at their leisure or whatever you know the thing is you can bring a horse to water but a feeding drink in they ain't drinking you can't really do anything else than that you know you you've done as much that you possibly can you know if you show it to them and they at least give it a shot if they don't like it they don't like it you know I mean I know it kind of sucks now maybe you're 15 and you're really passionate about music and you're really passionate about underground shit and you love Death Grips but none of your friends love Death Grips you don't got nobody to talk to you about no Death Grips that you know um you're still young you're in high school I'm sure you're gonna get a car one day you're gonna graduate high school you're gonna become an adult in several years illegal adults and you'll have the ability to go out and do what you want when you want and you can meet and fraternize with the kind of people that you want to meet and fraternize with and you can hang out with others who share more you know like-minded musical tastes and whatnot but you know until then just you know be really chill be really cool don't try to force your music taste on anybody and you know you'll meet those people who you see more eye-to-eye with in the future when you gain more control over your life as an adult cool cool all right Anthony Fantana turning friends onto underground music forever 
k9h3tHmovJU,antwuan fanny pack here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the monthly many album I did not get around to reviewing segments but I sort of talked about in brief right now segment videos segment why no review the new fucked up record oh my god fucked up Canadian punk rock band fucked up um have never really been crazy about fucked up honestly I do enjoy punk rock immensely punk music one of my favorite genres honestly genre that if I had never heard it I probably would be an accountant right now but I can't say fucked up is really that interesting of a punk band to me and it's mostly because I find a lot of their songs to be overly long not that visceral maybe a tad overproduced incorporating a bit too much modern indie sweetness to be that urgent or exciting case in point the song Sunglass off of this new LP the way the synths or guitars or vocals just glisten in the background of the song just kind of turns my stomach a little bit honestly I do dig some of the Bands more straightforward brick to face style singles and I do appreciate that they want to experiment and they don't want to be like every other punk band out there but the ways in which they do experiment completely turns me off especially on our last few records but on this newer one they do seem to be writing songs that are more straightforward to the point I do appreciate that but I'm still not digging a lot of the tracks on here a few I care for a lot I don't fucked up is just not my punk rock band of choice the new fire orchestra another band whose genre and a lot of whose a personnel I mean Miriam the believer is a part of this group provides a lot of vocals for this record you guys know that I love her record blood donation fantastic album you should listen to it these guys are an experimental big band outfit experimental rock progressive rock outfit and there's some long lengthy really drawn-out tracks on this record that features some grooves and some really ambitious song structures all of it on paper all of it in blueprint it seems like I should dig it but in execution I just don't find this record that intriguing or really that experimental I mean yeah for sure it's it's not a straightforward pop or rock record but I don't really find this record to be that adventurous I find it to be kind of underwhelming it really overstays its welcome with its lack of interesting ideas considering how much time fire orchestra takes to make this record I would have thought they would have delivered some more bold moves along the way more bold moves than I think they actually did next scene ooh cormorant record if you're in a black metal if you're into atmospheric black metal progressive rock as well I would look into this band I love their last full-length LP a great great great record this one however was really looking forward to it looking forward to hearing the band deliver another ambitious set of tracks that have a really strong element of storytelling but I really think it's the production where the band ends up kind of shooting itself in the leg these songs don't feel anywhere near as heavy or as lush and even though I do think a lot of time the writing is there it's just not there for me sonically and it really does make this album feel slightly like a bore but if that's the sort of thing that doesn't necessarily grab your attention or keep you from loving an album then look into this record the new Venetian Snares record a lot of people were asking me if I was going to review this I did give it a listen I did find on paper what was going on with this record to be intriguing the combination of Venetian Snares typical speed of light break beat cutting and delivery I mean it's it's really a disorienting record in that regard like many Venetian Snares records are I mean if you're looking for electronic music that is intense and mind-bending with its speed and with its disorienting rhythms then look into this guys back catalogue but these beats which are typical again of Venetian Snares are being combined with some string some classical music elements really dreary like goth rock type vocals and a lot of which aren't really sung that well and again while it's interesting on paper in execution I don't really think it's the best of those things if you just take them separately like how are these great big beats are these great classical music elements that the new antlers record of what can I say about handlers I have not enjoyed a single project from this band not hospice not their next record not this record either they're a band whose sad sad tunes just reek of pure melodrama to me there's nothing all that moving about what they're trying to do in an emotional regard and compositionally their songs don't really grip me either I mean the their music just under whelmed me it just feels more ethereal feels more atmospherical than it feels actual they just make such forgettable music this was my opinion but that's what I think the new first aid kit album I passed on this mostly because I just found it to be way too similar to the duo's last record to be completely honest I feel like if they're going to come through with an album that Wow's me in the future they're really going to have to change up their kind of humdrum production style I think the way that they record their records tends to suck the intimacy away from how great I know they are at performing live now of course there are some great tunes on this thing you know but the guitar tones the way their vocals are mixed the drums just all the instrumentation it just sounds so incredibly generic and it doesn't really complement the fact that as singers as songwriters as vocalist first aid kit is a unique project the new 50 cent record completely goona SHhhh depraved boring hip hop no idea why 50 cent even came back but I guess it's because people still think 50 cent is interesting I guess 50 cent never really has had anything to contribute to hip hop lyrically in my opinion with his major commercial releases y'all can totally defend his older mixtapes and so on and so forth and all that other stuff but even if you go that far there's no way that this even touches what little quality was actually on those projects this is easily some of 50-cents worst material ever and I didn't really like his older material this is just like offensively awful don't subject yourself to this yeah so I'm gonna say the new Keaton Henson record if you're into some very short to the point sad dreary tearjerker instrumentals then give this thing a listen it's not bad it's not bad it's sort of like a soundtrack for a movie a really sad movie a sad short movie that doesn't exist and um I wouldn't really call it incredibly cohesive I wouldn't really call it a world stopping or mind blowing but it is a little tiny sad detour on the road of life if you're looking for that sort of thing I'm giving this thing a listen and down there in the description box I also have a few links to some other reviews of Records that I put up recently and that's it and that's it relatively painless y-you know review this time around eh

X9vvagX8ndk,hi everyone funfetti egg taco here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list of my favorite records of 2014 thus far yeah basically I'm gonna tell you what my favorite records of this year have been up until the halfway point of this year in no particular order I will be linking down there in the description box to links to reviews of these albums and maybe to a song as well so you can try it you're welcome number one swans to be kind huh-huh-huh-huh fantastic layered noisy heavy immense to our experimental rock album with just loads of detailed instrumentation and some really hypnotic endless tiring tension building grooves it's a good next the new Freddie Gibbs and Madlib record pinata one of the better hip-hop albums of this year gangsta Gibbs essentially hops on some pretty left-field jazzy and low five beats from mad lib and there's some conceptual tracks on this thing the flows are great the lyrics are great really paint that gangsta lifestyle that Gibbs talks so much about and just the instrumentals top-notch another hip-hop album clipping with their record clipping experimental noise hop right here on this record and tum its immense man did they come through with so many conceptual tracks on this record Davi Diggs flows are even faster his wordplay I think is heavier I love the sequel to the song story on this record and man the instrumentals I feel like they do such a great job of not only keeping them noisy like they did on their debut mid city but I think this record does such a great job of taking the current trend in unorthodox hip-hop but making it kind of accessible while still staying really abrasive to me definitely singer-songwriter record of the year hands down the new Sun Kil moon record Benji some personal heart-wrenching songs on this record that a lot of them deal with mortality and just nearing the middle age of one's life singer/songwriter Mark kozilek just freakin kills it on this record next the new Silver Mount Zion record fuck off get free we pour light on everything if you're into Godspeed if you're into post rock if you're an instrumental rock if you're into groove laid in rock with some very epic harmonized vocals get into this record for me it's one of the better rock records of the year it's really layered it's got a lot of color it's really I mean it's got a lot of grit to it I love the songs I love the melodies I find the kinetic energy that the band shows off playing together on this record to be top-notch the new timber tambor record hot dreams this is like some gothic dark tortured vocal and baroque pop from the 50s and 60s and it loved it Taylor Kirk singer-songwriter I think writes some of his best songs on this record and this is easily timber timbres most instrumentally ambitious record as well some great instrumentals on this record it's lush with keys and strings and horns some great horns from Colin Stetson on this thing it's a great little rock pop record with a very old-school vintage flare the new Indian record from all purity if you want to hear a mash of noise and sludge metal really abrasive really immense record really a test of a record a test on the mind a test physically on the body plus the riffs are just heavy they're immense it rocks but it also you know the new Liars record is definitely a favorite of mine this year as well mess I love that these guys were able to transition from rock music to electronic music fully on this record I mean they did fully on their last record but on this one this is so much more overt this is so much more upbeat just hard hitting and the songs the results everything it just speaks for itself I mean one of the best singles of the year in my opinion mess on a mission is on this record great fusion of electronic music post-punk just a ton of energy and sound play on this record - I'm loving the hard-hitting electronic beats on this thing and the eerie atmospheres that usually come into liars records also finding their way into this as well the new behemoth record Satanist fantastic black metal record really sticks to the blueprint of the genre you know really delivering all of the characteristics one would expect from you know black metal but totally ups the ante with panoramic just top-notch production since horns if you like your black metal with a lot of force but also to be kind of melodic and have an element of accessibility to it then give this thing a listen the new white Sons record totem this is a fantastic noise rock record that really just blends the the walls between those two genres sometimes it's not quite so rock sometimes it's not quite so noise it's really visceral that's for sure but it's also very intriguing with how much it experiments with sound it is an odd record and even odder is the new actress record get oval a really intriguing record not so much a very concise album of electronic music songs more of like an experimental sketchbook and actress really went all out experimenting with tons of different flavors and and sounds on this record some of them are house influenced some of them are ambience some of them are hiphop influenced some of them are from another galaxy entirely there's a bit of vaporwave on this record too he really just covers so many bases on this thing and covers them really well with very interestingly textured and produced songs the new Carla Basel occurred boy really woozi experimental tortured dreary singer-songwriter record it's not so much straightforward with it's melodies and it's instrumentation or anything like that but in my opinion it is an emotional powerhouse as is the new tune-yards record but this record is so much more lively a beat in your face really bombastic noisy and and colorful to me it's the most bold pop record of the year thus far the new Thant eFax a thread sacred white noise a great fusion of progressive rock and black metal some really hard-hitting songs on this record great riffs the band has some amazing kinetic energy playing together on this thing and finally I will finish it off with the new Rat King records so it goes really forward-thinking hip hop trio from new york great tunes on this thing they're worse tracks that paled in comparison to others but to me some of my favorite hip-hop singles of the year canal I like that these guys keep it forward-thinking futuristic progressive but they still have a really strong sense of that grimy New York East Coast flavor to it and those are my 15 favorite albums of 2014 thus far we'll have your favorite albums of the year been thus far let me know in the comments and I hope you have a nice day transitions issues issues issue in thony Fantana 2014 forever 
BqH_kA0BN98,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new apathy record Connecticut casual apathy is a Connecticut based producer and rapper whose exploits I have been following for years now back when I was in college I used to listen to a rap group he was affiliated with heavily affiliated with the demigods I fell out of tune with his new output for a while but I ended catching up back with him again once he started dropping newer records like honky Kong in my opinion one of the better rap albums of 2011 and since then he has been pretty busy he dropped a pretty huge and lengthy fire walk with me mixtape he reassembled the demigods and they dropped a new record and he has tons of ruthless verses all over the new army of Pharos album this is a new prolific revitalization for apathy scre ear but there has been no project he's been involved with that I have been more excited for than his next commercial release right here now going into this thing I did have my hesitations he did drop a video single before this album came out for the song grand leveler the last track off of this LP the video is loaded with Freemason imagery and apathy is embrace of this long-running fraternity comes through in the visuals of the video more than it does the actual lyrics of the song either way it's not really a good look for someone who's a rapper I mean all you have to do is show some of these hip-hop fans a triangle all is that Loompa natty are you loompa daddy is human Addie is that way you're popular I thought I knew you this whole time but it just turns out off would you shut up idiot ah but outside of any extracurricular activities apathy may be indulging in outside of his hip-hop career I didn't really go into this record with any expectations other than what I already know of apathy is artistic output he's a rapper that really values storytelling going into a song with a message or a concept in mind much of the time he has a flow and a delivery that is straight out of the world 90s boom bap hip-hop he is definitely a student of guys like biggie wu-tang NAS organized confusion and a lot of his production sensibilities come from the same era of hip-hop though I do think on this new record of his he has made some attempts at sort of modernizing like with the song back in New England a grimy ass banger of a track the bass is heavy they're all these wailing quirky kind of weird guitar leads in the left channel squawking out it's a song that's mean muggin it's intimidating like a 90s boom bap track but there's something kind of goofy and playful about it too then there's the song grass ain't greener we're apathy is bringing this really speedy flow over very relaxed atmospheric beat these kinds of serene instrumentals are really in vogue right now in hip hop and I think he does it justice especially with the really pretty singsong chorus on this thing then production wives apathy also makes some really ballsy sample choices like on the track Martha Moxley rest in peace where he samples very obviously and very blatantly George Michaels Careless Whisper the sax rip that opens up the track and even though it's very clear where the saxophone is coming from as soon as the song starts it's still such a blissful instrumental it just works so well so well that it just makes me think how is this not happened already but sometimes the obvious samples on this record do work against apathy in a sense like on the opening track here the title track where he is sampling Anthony Kiedis vocals from the Red Hot Chili Peppers song under the bridge namely from the chorus of the song and even though I'm not against sampling this vocal because the song is very obvious everybody knows this song I guess I'm more against how untreated the vocal on this track feels it just makes it more difficult to imagine this vocal with another groove with another context I think my least favorite instrumental on the entire record has to be the one on underground chick where there's this really blatant Smashing Pumpkins sample it's got a bit of a trap flavor with these incessant hi-hats twittering away throughout the track and even though I think it was really ambitious for to try to chop this song up in this way it is one of the more creative chops of any of the samples throughout this entire LP I guess it's how the beat comes together with apathy rapping on this song that really ends up turning me off beyond these tracks the instrumentals are pretty straightforward they're smooth they're efficient they're good at setting the tone of these tracks like the shimmering guitar chords and lines all over the track don't give up the ship the aged dusty pianos on curse of the Kennedys and Jack Ruby fitting the tone of the culture being talked about in these songs and then I guess the really ritzy horns and strings on the song money makes the world go round fits the tone and the subject matter of that track to the production doesn't blow my mind most of the time it just kind of gets the job done it's lyrically and conceptually where I really think this album impresses and kind of comes together being somebody from Connecticut I came into this record expecting some kind of connecticut-based content given the title of it and apathy didn't really disappoint we have tracks on this record that hilariously and ironically embrace Connecticut and New England based stereotypes like on the song back in New England where the hook is so stone-faced and just mentioning things like Ray Bans seersucker boat shoes Yacht Club j.crew seafood not hip hop things but the track appears way more hard as nails on the verses especially with the Chris Webber's the Chris Webb II verse on this thing was killer and there are moments on this record as well where he exposes a bit of dark underbelly and some debauchery like again on the opening the title track of this thing where he is not only talking about the culture of his past his personal past but also Willimantic where he grew up and then there are songs on here that address the the greater culture of New England in general songs like curse of the Kennedys I mean if you're going to talk about New England royalty the Kennedy family is pretty much it then there's the song Martha Moxley rest in peace if you're from Connecticut and my age or older you probably have very vivid memories of the Michael Skakel case and there are other tracks on this LP that while they may not be directly Connecticut related or New England they were late to these tracks like Jack Ruby a song that essentially makes a huge reference to the guy who shot Lee Harvey Oswald who is allegedly the assassinator of John F Kennedy the song grass is greener topically links right into the song money makes the world go round the song underground chick in a way links into the song beef and over bitches however there are some tracks on this thing that I think sound really weak when they're by themselves like the song locals-only good verse from apathy but not one of the more focused tracks topically on this entire LP and not one of the better guest verses on here either either either either either either either it not only instrumentally but lyrically - I think underground chick continues to rank as my least favorite song it's really one of the shorter and to me one of the more not cohesive tracks on this entire LP especially as apathy just slips into this what about this girl didn't high and listening to his she's a little underground chick and immediately after this the song just sort of ends meanwhile the Smashing Pumpkins sample that's already sort of trying my patience is just going on and on and on and on in the background and not really fitting the beat change at this point in the track it's just not one of the well crafted songs off this record I think and ambitious experiment but not one of my favorite tracks overall I think this is one of app these most solid projects today I think it's maybe a shade more enjoyable than his last full-length record but even this LP has its handful of songs that I either don't care for or I think pale in comparison to others just like that album did I'm feeling of strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it apathy Connecticut casual forever 
Lyf7TP5pdYQ,hi everyone banana mango here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mastodon record once more round the Sun a brand new record from Fame progressive sludge metal outfit Mastodon you might have heard their name you might have heard their music maybe you've heard that these guys have a super heavy super impressive back catalogue of complicated yet accessible metal albums throughout the 2000s Mastodon was dropping genre-defining decade defining stuff no matter what you think have blown out and however they made one of the most notable musical shifts of their career in 2011 with the record the hunter they made a move toward the accessible with this record they toned down their menacing heaviness they harped on some more melodic clean voiced choruses and started to dish out some of the most straightforward Rivet of their career and Mastodon was not alone in this shift there were other sludge metal outfits like Baroness and torch that around the same time Roche we're also coming out with the most accessible albums of their career so these guys are not the first sludge metal outfit to go pop but I think they surpassed pretty much everybody in that regard with the hunter to the point where I think the band kind of lost a bit of their grit and lost me for a second because the move Mastodon made on this record it's not usually something a band just comes back from at least in the span of a few years anyway however I was moderately surprised moderately pleased when Mastodon dropped the first single from this record high road it didn't blow me away but I was finally feeling a bit more positive toward this catchy er side of Mastodon maybe this track didn't feature their most crushing riff ever but it did have a winning chorus and I was actually surprised to hear that a lot of the deeper cuts on this thing hold up to the band manages to stay catchy straightforward but still incorporate some progressive complex interplay and performances Mastodon is definitely getting better at crafting more straightforward material that's actually interesting although it may not seem like that from the start of the record tracks like the opener and highroad though these are good tracks I do think they kind of leave once more around the Sun with kind of a mild beginning the song the mother lode absolutely my least favorite track on this entire LP it's like I'm hearing the worst of alternative rock and new metal from the 2000s all crashing together at once on this song the arena rock vibes are pretty strong with the title track on this thing would run - run and features my least favorite vocal performance of the entire record as well I'm also pretty disappointed by the abrupt finish of this track it feels like it could have gone so much longer but there are some really impressive drum fills on this thing a psychedelic colorful guitar interlude some really expansive riffs and a pretty epic chorus and after this track it's like all my disappointment with this record just melts away because the band hits a fantastic stride from the track shines at night to ember city just nearly to the end of the album the only major misstep in between these tracks is the coat hangers chanted chorus on the song aunt Lisa which is pretty ridiculous hey-oh let's get up and go and rock and roll it's like listening to a chant the Ramones rode in a nightmare but again all the track's in between these two songs great feast your eyes total barn burner with some really melodic colorful guitar leads chimes at night I love the thunderous and speedy riffs on this track just the groove of this song I love it the pace of this track at freakin rocks I love the slow melodic outro of this track - it's a really multifaceted song I love asleep in the deep one of the moodier tracks on the entire record really dreary guitar leads on this thing but some intense drumming and drum fills throughout much of the track fantastic solo at the end of the song - and ember city I think is the best of the catchy ER songs that these guys have been writing the clean voiced chorus on this thing is just absolutely soaring it's wonderful it's beautiful it's gorgeous the lyrics are a little melodramatic but I think this song is a show of Mastodon perfecting their catchy ER song the intro to the song Halloween has maybe a little bit more of a hard rock glam rock vibe than I would like but deeper into the track there are some guitar passages and riffs that I enjoy much more and the closer is the longest and most ambitious song on this entire record and while it's not maybe the most romantic thing in the world I do think it works as a finish I'm not saying this album is great not saying I love it I think it's pretty good I think right now after this record I have a bit more faith in Mastodon going down this road if the results are gonna be this high-quality if we're gonna get tracks that are as catchy and is blissful and as exciting as ember city they made their singles they made their more straightforward tracks and then they worked on making some more complex deep cuts and the final result was a more well balanced album I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next subscribe for justice Mastodon once more round the Sun blue forever

VRclyW74J_k,hi everyone Crampton ii test anno here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new absol record these days this guy is a West Coast emcees been lighting up my ears with his lyrics ever since he dropped that AB soul interlude on Kendrick Lamar's fantastic album section.80 I went on to love the album he dropped in 2012 control system one of my favorite hip-hop records of that year and on this record he gave himself the label the abstract asshole and it is a name that he has lived up to with his brags with his drug talk with his foul mouth but simultaneously his lions are loaded with incredible wordplay and references that are biological philosophical biblical so of course there was no reason whatsoever not to be looking forward to whatever he was doing down the road certainly a man who would craft a track such as terrorist threats has nothing mild in his future but that in fact seems to be the case with these days to me this record is the sound of an adventurous emcee doing a 180 and trying to write a more commercial record which in theory isn't a bad thing but the thing is writing catchy music comes with its own league of difficulties and challenges challenges are not really sure absol is up to facing four years for project after project absol has put together some pretty smart conscious out their creative hip-hop music and to totally switch around and try to write more straightforward in-your-face earworm type stuff he's essentially walking a different walk on this record and I think the end result is pretty middle-of-the-road now do not get me wrong absol is not writing totally ignorant Mego style verses on this thing but it's rare that he comes through with the mind-expanding set of bars like the third verse on the track Tree of Life one of the best verses on this entire record I especially love the ending line talking about why money is green because it's like vegetation the most important of all things his verses on the opening track here are pretty thoughtful on the opening verse to the song stigmata one of the better tracks on this thing as well and there are some lines that stick out on the Rick Ross featured song never mind that where he's saying you're a librarian got room for my dick ssin airy it's not great but he's trying although there is kind of an interesting thing going on with this track absol is opening verse on this song which is one of the deeper and more interesting verses on this entire thing is interrupted by this really short shot of what sounds like TV or radio Distortion and then it quickly goes into this R&B chorus saying never mind that never mind that it's almost as if this track or maybe this entire record in general is absolute at writing poppier simpler more straightforward music as some kind of common on not saying anything substantial it's a concept I can get down with in theory but in execution musically for a loud trap flavored hip-hop song this is pretty terrible the pacing of the instrumental is way too slow and this track is just so cluttered with the pitched vocals with Rick Ross's feature with AB souls versus with the R&B singing the constant shots of distortion changing the song from one flavor to another the guitar line weaved into the beat as well the song just has so many different things going on most of the time on this record absol isn't really delivering awful lyrics as much as he is just in my opinion delivering lyrics that I think are subpar for him not really thoughtful or thought-provoking stuff namely on tracks like hunted Stax a song featuring schoolboy q and I don't mind schoolboy q I liked his last record but schoolboy might as well have been rapping across this entire track because topically there's nothing really separating AB and schoolboy I mean they use the exact same flow throughout the entire track there are other tracks on here where the hooks are especially weak and just really incessant really redundant like dub sack and feeling us there's the song tracked off this thing which has a Atlantis snap beat instrumental riding in the background the whole song feels like he heard a single off of that new yg record and then hit the studio the only catch etrack that I think was legitimately good on this entire record was just have fun really upbeat bright instrumental I feel like abs voice definitely brings a positive feel-good vibe across as well there's a slight commentary on using drugs not allowing drugs to use you in the opening refrain it's a pretty lackluster first half of the record but the second half is I'm not going to say good but very turbulent and surprising namely with the Kendrick Lamar featured song on here where essentially Kendrick is doing with a jazz instrumental hanging in the background exactly what absol did for him on section 80 and of course emotionally it's intense its lyrically OnPoint the instrumental is amazing Kendrick Lamar's energies through the roof it's kind of the best track on the entire record there's also tracks on the back end of this thing like closure which is this terrible sad sack song where I don't really mind a bit of heartbreak or a bit of a story about a relationship on the rocks but absol is singing very weakly throughout this entire track and it just gets really tedious and dull quickly the closing track on this LP not a bad song one of the lyrically tighter tracks on this entire thing and there is a kid cudi like hook on this thing except I do enjoy it but this closing track what makes it so strange that it comes with an amazing surprise as soon as this song concludes and that is what seems to be raw audio of a battle a rap battle between absol and daylight with a crowd of people there listening to them there are a few points where it's pretty audible that Schoolboy Q is there AB does a verse daylight does a verse this lasts for almost 20 minutes and it's so thrilling and it's so interesting because absol for a guy who doesn't battle professionally really holds his own for whatever reason you put this thing on the record I think it's a great addition I mean I feel like there are a lot of people in hip-hop fans of hip hop right now who complain that there's a certain level of talent lacking in a lot of the bigger artists in the industry right now I hear you have an artist coming forward putting his reputation on the line battling someone who's pretty notable in the world of battle rap and even though people seemed a little more impressed by the time daylight was done I prefer what AB did more I just wish that more of that turned up on the tracks earlier in this record you know their songs on this thing that I love songs on the thing that I hate there were tracks that were completely out of the blue moves that were totally unexpected even though I feel at the end of the day that I'm very on the fence with this thing it's at least interesting as an experience I have to say that I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it absol these days solo forever 
r4Wtbsz3EkU,hi everyone blam bubbly blam boy you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new open mike eagle album dark comedy open mike eagle is a rapper based on the west coast and currently is a member of one of my favorite rap crews Hellfire Club rhetoric Ramirez Milo busdriver no-can-do and others all of whom I'm actually surprised don't turn up on this new open mike eagle record of the few features that are on this thing among them are cool ad of - racist Fame and comedian Hannibal Buress whose verse on the track Doug Stamper might be one of the funniest things you hear all year this album is relatively feature free for whatever reason Mike essentially takes this record grabs a bunch of producers and says I got this and this thing is essentially 13 tracks with a handful of producers crafting different beats it's not really quite as cohesive as Mike's last full-length LP Animal Hospital which was all produced by awkward but still mike comes through with a really enjoyable album of funny clever nerdy soulful playful memorable eccentric left-field art rap songs Mike isn't one of those rappers that's overly technical has a really fast flow he's not one of these guys that's going to talk tough and spin it you rapid-fire really unemotionally if he's more of the softer sensitive type but incredibly captivating relatable and hilarious he is part eccentric philosopher part charismatic free spirit part introspective brain picker part braggadocious psyche flexor and lyrically with this new record of his dark comedy he is as OnPoint as ever like with the trusty track off of this record qualifiers one of Mike's best tracks in a while a song that has been out and about on the Internet long before this album dropped a track where Mike finds a lot to be proud of a lot to brag about in simply being a solid family figure he moves on to say he might smoke you in Goldeneye he makes a really nice They Might Be Giants reference which there are a couple of on this record a really notable on his last LP - he even tells a short little story of going to Africa and blowing people's minds with his alternative style of hip hop and he says they're surprised it's free of bitches and hoes and then there's the track thirsty ego raps a song that is simultaneously charmingly braggadocious a little self-deprecating and really frank about one's ego and one of my favorite lines on this entire record comes out of this track with mike saying that he is the president of rappers who don't condone date rape the Speak & Spell line that closes this track out is really nice and I love the pitch string samples that play throughout this track they're really funky the melody is fun it's sticky overall the instrumentals on this record are a little clunky they're a little low Phi they're a little tattered and torn and thrown together but they do fit that really playful laid-back and quirky colorful style that Mike brings to the table with his flow and with his lyrics as well it's a match made in heaven really on the song Golden Age raps Mike comes through with a flow that is familiar because he's used it before a rapper that he has a lot of influence on Milo has used it before and with this track he essentially pokes fun at the current state of I guess creating art creating media in the Internet age Mike talks about this a little bit more but in another way on the track jon lovitz where he's talking specifically about touring a little bit and getting booked to play heaven to play the moon and it seems like everything that could possibly be great about the booking of this show the pre-sale the accommodations the fact that there's a 10-piece band at this venue that knows all of Mike's songs it all feels perfect but yet there's sort of a sense at least for me anyway where it's like it seems like they're just Mike also goes into more I guess sort of struggles of artists and creative types trying to make a living on the song very much money where Mike is talking about all these people who he seems to really look up to and admire and see as superheroes see is people who can fly and speak Portuguese and make beats and deal drugs he holds these people in high regard but none of them make very much money and this song and a few others reveal the only major Achilles heel on this entire record and that is Mike's singing it is pretty flat or sharp depending on which song you're listening to he's really raw and upfront about it and though in other contexts it might not work out for other artists at least here I think it plays into the recurring theme that Mike is just a regular human being with flaws though he does seem so insistent on singing on his records I don't see why there couldn't be at least some kind of technical improvement into the future as far as the straightforward rap tracks go on this thing they're great drugs Stamper I love the 99 problems referencing that if you have any more than three it's a problem it's an issue the man's ear line is hilarious of course like I said the Hannibal Buress verse is fantastic Mike actually pulls out a bit of a MF DOOM flow I would say on this track the song a history of modern dance one of the best beats on this record the best B on this record I think and one of the best hip hop beats of the year with a really murky heavy low-end bassline coming out of this thing and some really eerie high-pitched drones that are just sort of ear piercing this track really sets a tone and I like what mike is doing with this track thematically with his lyrics talking about chance meetings and strangers coming together and talking about dances maybe sort of a metaphor for attraction but also their alliance thrown into this thing like environmentalist dance signed a petition and then there's the song informations with who lady whose verse technically isn't really fantastic it sort of comes off as silly and comedic sort of like Hannibal Buress is verse but it works for the track and as far as the instrumental goes I think this is the closest the entire record comes to a legit banger and then the album finishes off with a really melodic moody closer with the lyrics and just this really beautiful female vocal sample and the instrumental it's a nice finisher for this record I think Mike came together with his most solid album to date with dark comedy I think he's really come into his own with his delivery with the topics that he continues to tackle in his songs with the instrumentals that he chooses on his projects a few songs on here that I was underwhelmed by but that's really my only major issue with this LP I'm feeling a decent a strong 8 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it open my Eagle dark comedy forever 
f-b5PravLXk,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new soft pink truth record why do the heathen rage this is the third full-length LP from electronic music producer and singer drew Daniel this is his on-again off-again musical project the soft pink truth you may actually be more likely to have heard this man's work under the name Matt mos the musical duo he has been involved with with his significant other Martin Schmidt for many years now they've essentially built a name for themselves with their incredibly creative approach to sound craft namely sampling having created songs with samples from sperm and rhinoplasty among other things the one of my favorites of theirs happens to be a record that has no samples on it whatsoever supreme balloon and these guys also did have a hand in creating one of my favorite Bjork Records Vespertine but I have not really been that crazy about their output as of late I thought their last full length LP was kind of mild maybe a little unsurprising for them and I thought that they're pretty ambitious effort to collaborate with so percussion on their 2010 album was just slightly underwhelming however I think the concept behind this new soft pink truth record right here is a pretty bold change of pace for drew it's a series of black metal covers nine of them to be exact with a quirky spoken word intro and the originals on this record come from a variety of different black metal bands and the covers are executed in a variety of different styles the artists featured range from early black metal pioneers like venom and hell hammer to Norwegian black metal heavyweights staples like dark throne and mayhem and the whole record finishes off with a cover of grim and frostbitten gaybar attract from a sort of black metal parody band the seth putnam of anal cunt had running in the early 2000s and ironically this cover is maybe one of the most authentic one of the most true to sound when it comes to drew capturing that old-school black metal flavor because most of the time drew goes completely off the stylistic map on this thing going as far as to turn some of these tracks into dance music jams with female lead vocals or taking the really gruesome campy nasty black metal vocals style and throwing it over some break beats or just some generally funky electronics the whole thing the whole aesthetic the whole idea reminds me so much of that Dirty Projectors record that came out a while ago that Black Flag covers record rise above similarly this soft pink truth record seems to show very little concern for anybody who might have grown up with these songs and sees them as unchangeable and sacred but non purest fans of black metal I think they may find a lot to love in in some of these covers a lot of them are interesting creative very colorful full of personality surprising and many of them do a lot to bring the lyrics forward and make them more of a focus not really obscuring the lyrics behind any kind of wretched screaming or shouting personally the tracks I enjoy the most on this record are the ones that are sort of truer to form like the venom cover black metal even though the track is electronic and it has sort of a playful vibe to it I do think soft pink truth brings forward kind of a an industrially tinged version of this really hard-hitting black metal song I love what he does with the chorus on this thing and even though this track is quirky in a sense it does have kind of a grim presentation to it and there are other tracks on here that I think are equally successful but maybe a tad sillier like satanic black devotion where in the middle of the song as the track moves into a bit of an electronic breakdown you get a sample of I've got the power surprisingly though this doesn't really ruin the vibe of the track even as the song progresses away from this really dark grim acoustic intro the song beholding the throne of Mike goes over really well too even though much of its backing rhythms are dance oriented the only times I really get disappointed with the tracks on here the feature does the nastier more gruesome vocals are saito mattock rites and buried by time and dust I don't really mind that some of these tracks are backed with vintage electronic music grooves but just the tambour the weak tambour and some of the dinky electronic sound on these tracks it feels like somebody's trying to write me a really threatening letter in comic sans going even further down this road are the songs I mentioned earlier that are essentially dance songs with female lead vocals like let there be bola frost and ready to fuck the latter of which I do like but let there be bola frost instrumentally just feel so generic and even though I'm not totally head-over-heels for these tracks I'm still kind of in awe of the ballsy gutsy moves it took to remake these songs like this which is actually kind of how I feel about this entire record in general some may definitely pull their hair out over this record I might to an extent if I had more and some may definitely call this record the hipster black metal apocalypse but I still think this record is very fun it's entertaining it's definitely perplexing I'm feeling a strong 6 to Lite 7 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana the soft pink truth forever 
2XdD_BJ5D18,"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the self-titled caustic window album caustic window is one of the many pseudonyms of famed electronic music producer Richard D James aka effects twin and this new record from caustic window isn't really as new to him as it is to us allegedly it is a group of songs that were set to be released around 1994 but only made it to test pressing and now it's all over the internet thanks to the efforts of a Kickstarter which raised almost $70,000 just to buy a copy of this test pressing and then play it to digital and pass it out amongst the backers of said Kickstarter and now miraculously one of these digital copies is sitting in front of me calc your chest to burn Mia CD of it Carew's still running Windows 95 it was a good OS and from the 90s just like this record so I guess it's appropriate seeing how this record comes out of that early mid-90s part of Richard's career it doesn't sound too unlike his first two ambient works albums or his analogue bubble-bath EPS under the afx name there are even a few tracks here that dabble in the more distorted harsh abrasive rhythms that appeared on his I care because you do album that dropped in 1995 though there isn't really anything on this record that is as lavish lush or as layered on the whole this cost of window' LP is pretty skeletal and straightforward but that is not necessarily a bad thing since FX twins early work is known for doing a lot with a little technologically and sonically there is success on this album with tracks like stomper which is incredibly monstrous tense and dark or thoroughly freakish and distorted a noisy track cunt or squidge in the fridge which is actually a really cute tiny quirky piece of acid techno with some really pretty and serene piano keys but with house trip back and basic for FX twin these songs are some of them run a little tedious like the song Flutie or jazz phase or mumbly there's the song finger e as well which to me is a track that sounds like it grabs parts from three different compositions and just matches them together with a really tense techno beat some whimsical synth Odyssey melodic leads aloud in your face stuttering basin and a cowbell it's just like a Frankenstein monster of track limping around going it's a mixed bag it's a little hit or miss but it's still a decent collection of tracks and an interesting reminder of how far electronic music has come since 20 years ago now this thing may not be the absolute gem under the unturned stone that everybody was hoping for but it's worth checking out even though Richard was already well on his way to better things on his next few records I'm feeling a strong six on this LP transition if you've given this thing up listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it cost it window effects twin forever "
26axVHigRdY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new loan record reality testing loan is a pretty versatile electronic music producer that hails from the UK dropped an album a few years ago that I loved I thought was one of the better electronic music albums of 2012 galaxies garden and this record was a bit of a departure from the typically wonky glitch hop inspired occasionally house inspired music on his previous records yes there were elements of house music on galaxies garden but this record was so much more futuristic and colorful Hyper's well songs reaching up in some pretty speedy tempos and even though the canvas loan was painting on was a very synthetic one he added what felt like some very organic elements was sounded like some metallic percussion some hand drums and these drums seemed to be playing Caribbean style rhythms this brought the record a really distinct flavor and an amped-up energy and now all of a sudden loan comes through with the follow up to that record and production-wise compositionally it is so far off the mark I feel like I'm listening to an imposter is the issue on this record a lack of viscera is there less kinetic energy between the rhythms and the synths on this thing are the melodies less sharp are the tempos too slow to be honest it'sit's a little bit of all for all of these issues stack up into a painfully inconsistent and unmemorable record occasionally that upbeat tropical and electronic vibe comes through from a few years ago but rarely does it actually live up to galaxy garden like the song air glow fires which has this really awkward punchy synth phrasing that makes me feel like I'm listening to some really clumsy Morse code over a house beat or a track like Aurora and Northern Corridor a song that starts decent has a great groove but doesn't really bring that much in terms of progression to keep the song interesting from beginning to end it just sort of grows stale and grows dull when lone isn't trying to rekindle the same magic from his last record he's taking d2 into hiphop instrumentals and glitch hop that is so toothless he might as well be making elevator music songs like 2 is 8 and Meeker warm energy the synthesizer leads on these tracks were written as if their creation were merely a chore or like the melodies on these tracks were decided by just randomly choosing notes within the scale that fit the key of the song it's like the melodies on these tracks were composed via some kind of incredibly boring soulless algorithm occasionally there's a track here and there that sort of reminds me of a video game circa early 2000 sort of like Nintendo 64 or something like that just like on galaxy garden but I don't really feel like I'm in the midst of an action-packed adventure or race rather the instrumentals on this record remind me more of like a stark screen something you'd only be listening to long enough for the game to just begin again the melodic compositions on this record they're not that distinct they're not that sharp they're not that sweet they're not really that anything this record is lacking in a great deal of punch in comparison with loans previous material and not even in such a way you would suppose this album is taking a more ambient approach or something like that aside from the first track on here which is a very ethereal opener and rather than taking part in the track building the track progression he did on previous records here we're getting these really redundant instrumentals and some of them are backed with really tedious totally uninteresting vocal snippets that last a little too long to me this record is just so passionate it's so bland it's so background it's so boring I just really was not expecting this sometimes this thing is pleasant but that's about it I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana lone forever 
9AS2e4vV_ps,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd before I start this video I want to say that in Hamden Connecticut tonight we are doing that intimate evening with Fantana live needle drop magic thing if you still want to come just come to the doors at 7:00 p.m. grab a ticket and we'll do this thing I will leave some information down in the description box about this and yeah we'll take it you will take it from there stepping out back in hey everybody I read an article yesterday on forbes.com of all places they were doing an article on what's going on with YouTube right now apparently they are embarking on the creation of some kind of music streaming service based off of the platform they've already got running already and even though they don't advertise themselves as such as many of you may already know if you've done your research YouTube pretty much is already a music streaming service they get more music stream hits whatever you want to call them than any of the legal music streaming services out there right now from the last study I've read if you combine all of the hits that sites like Grooveshark Spotify and Rdio so on and so forth if you'd like all the hits these sites get YouTube Dwarfs all their hits ten times over then this is this is just music streaming you know this is just music streaming and I don't know how this study was conducted but these music streams I'm guessing that they're that they're just the legal ones because as you and I know there are plenty of songs and albums on YouTube right now that are incredibly obscure and people are just streaming them and they don't have like the artist's name attached to them or anything like that it's just some music fan that happened to have the mp3 or the record and they took the recording and threw it online so YouTube is a massive music streaming service people buy people in droves go to the website every day just to listen to music so now YouTube's realizing that has decided that they're going to sort of pull together this music streaming service now and in the process of doing that they have drawn up a contract for labels and independent musicians that I understand is different than what someone like me would be offered and this isn't like that not only is a different but part of the issue from what I understand is that the independent musicians or the independent labels are not being offered the same sweet deal that these major labels are of course and what I think is going on here is I mean of course these contracts are not being formed because YouTube thinks that they're under paying musicians Google things that they're under paying musicians or anything like that I think what might be going on is that YouTube and Google are realizing that people are just going on their site to listen to music and realize based upon the business model of other music streaming services that they could pretend they could potentially be paying musicians dirt rather than what they're paying them now I think they might have realized that they're over paying and they could be getting away with paying them next to nothing and which i think is incredibly unfair because i don't think there should be some different going rate for musicians or people that just go onto youtube to listen to music i mean if you want to hear a song if you want to see a music video you're sitting down you're clicking the same kinds of links you're watching the song you're watching the music video through the same kind of portal that everybody else is you're seeing the same kind of adds the overall experience is the same except you're only hearing audio versus just seeing somebody's video and another thing that somebody brought to my attention is how are we even going to distinct if I between what is simply music and what is a video because the thing is what if I came out with a song but prior to it I don't know I put three minutes of me talking or I did a spoken word piece or I put a short film before the song or something like that what if I were to mix these mediums you know with would my song get kicked off of YouTube would I have to make it under a certain contract or I would have to put it on the streaming service just to comply with these rules since people might be primarily just watching the video to hear the song so you know there are some questions as to what the content could potentially be defined as and on top of that not only will some of these independent musicians be getting ripped off monetarily but also in this article which again I'm going to link you guys down there in the description what this article also says is musicians who fail to comply or fail to hop on board with this contract might in fact be getting whatever content they have on YouTube now ticked off of YouTube which is actually incredibly depressing and saddening to kind of see this platform changing because over the past several years YouTube because of the way the platform works I mean I know it gets a lot of complaints and I hear a lot of them and I understand a lot of them but as far as music goes music discovery I think YouTube has been one of the sturdiest and more trustworthy platforms you can find out there because I mean it tells you what's hot it tells you what's getting a lot of hits it tells you what is interesting to other people in a really organic way of course you know there are people out there who theorized the certain artists from certain labels are buying YouTube clicks buying traffic buying like so on and so forth just to make their videos seem so hype and that may in fact be the case with some people but a lot of the time I don't think it is the case and I mean some of the hottest artists of the past several years have been broken by the YouTube platform ASAP rocky Tyler the Creator Danny Brown freaking Death Grips freaking who else I mean Justin Bieber got hot off at YouTube I'm trying to think of who else you said burn hmm creator yeah look there have been a lot of artists off of YouTube who literally wake from nothing and from simply just putting a song onto the platform they turned into overnight sensations and I think YouTube has to sort of tread lightly when sort of changing the way that works because that's potentially a model that's going to bring them traffic into the future you know the virality of the music video of just having the ability to put whatever content up you want onto the platform creates a certain unpredictability that could potentially create a paradigm shift in taste and musical trends and so on and so forth if YouTube gets rid of that all we would have left right now is like blogs and stuff and music magazines and music websites for taste making which is completely fine I work in that industry myself and I completely respect all of my music review writing brethren who do the same thing but I feel like as far as the internet goes YouTube is one of the best platforms we have and just stumbling upon something you know I mean if I look up some random-ass noise rock band I'm just gonna find maybe several dozen songs from any number of records they've ever put out just thrown in front of my face and if I click on any of those songs I'll have many other songs recommended to me from the same band and potentially other bands as well it's about as close as the internet gets to just freakin flipping through a whole catalog of Records and just deciding randomly which record you'd like to put on so I think if YouTube goes forward and pulls together a platform like Spotify where you have algorithms and you have this interface that pulls together these really bland unimaginative totally unchallenging recommendations then I mean you know not only are people going to stumble upon interesting things less more likely but I think people might be less I think inclined to use it because the excitement the surprise the the unexpected I guess sort of the the chance element isn't going to be as strong so I mean that's just me theorizing on the whole thing in terms of how people might not end up liking it who knows they might pull together a good interface but still at the end of the day I'm sort of worried about whether or not these independent artists are going to get ripped off you know because I think I think if you make a video that's just simply a song and it gets a million views even though people aren't viewing it as much as they are listening to it but if it gets a million views I think that video deserves the same million that a youtube video creator deserves or an artist deserves who's on a major label it makes sense it's the same portal it's the same experience people are interacting with it in the same way they'll make YouTube like the radio was in the 80s and 90s don't turn it into this thing where it's hard for artists to break into currently right now we're suffering from kind of an oversaturation situation where yeah sure you have tons and tons and tons of mediocre stuff just going through the flood gates but shrinking the floodgates down doesn't eliminate the mediocrity because you still have the issue of wanting to compete for the lowest common denominator and gather as much eyes and ears as possible by creating music that appeals to as many people as it possibly can which is fine there's nothing wrong with music like that but it's great to have alternatives it's great to have artists who don't necessarily fit that bill and I'm just sort of afraid of what's going to happen to those artists when this music streaming platform or this contract or whatever goes through and it could potentially be harder for a lot of these people to be making a living harder than it is already you know to me uh up until this point whenever a certain artist has asked me about getting their music out there YouTube to me has always been a recommendation put your stuff on YouTube billions of people are on YouTube all the time if you want your stuff to be discovered and that's a good place to start and it if if this thing goes through and it's very clear once it's all erected and functioning that it's not benefiting artists I can't see myself making that recommendation anymore into the future all right let me know what you think forever 
mM3eEJeQih8,that hi hi everybody slam that he dumped an over here the the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the newsela purrs sloop sloop errs mixtape help this guy is a great rapper and a member of the Midwest rap crew the bruiser brigade most known for their figurehead Danny Brown and a lot of the projects these guys have put out thus far like the recent dope head mixtape that ep these guys put out not too long ago have pretty much been loud eccentric yelping bombastic in-your-face hip-hop but this help tape takes it to a whole new level what caught my ear going into this project and made me really look forward to it were the lead singles teasing toward help that just went dumb and when absurd tracks like can't hang sagging plateau songs where Z lubbers brings wild inflections and even wilder similes and metaphors bar stuck in your head like woodpeckers pecking or one particular ad-lib where he is saying that he will make a particular girl's heart melt and then he screams in the background she's melting got your Grande mani pan my phone bills got her granddaughter doing a tip drill some of the deep cuts on this thing get even more insane as Zulu per says that hoes are on his dick like bird on a statue or the raw repetitive shouting on one particular hook where he's screaming yo bitch got it let me tonight yo bitch let me tonight some of the songs on this tape are so raunchy they might even make little Wayne blush the song BM which is about a baby mama drama pretty much is one of my favorites on here one of the more hilarious tracks on the record where he is screaming that he's not gonna be anybody's baby daddy and saying that he's scarred for life really trying to paint himself as the victim of some kind of female entrapment but as far as the flow goes on this thing it's interesting the quality of the flow on these tracks truly depends on the energy level being delivered on these songs when the delivery is quiet the flow is there it is consistent but when he goes loud which is often he goes absolutely overboard and couldn't give a whether or not he's on tempo and sometimes it can't even be bothered to rhyme I feel like I'm listening to some kind of bastard child of Death Grips and your average swag rapper now there's not a whole lot of topical diversity on this mixtape a lot of the lyrics on this thing are pretty asinine and as I said before raunchy but Z loopers always searches for some different instrumentals some that are darker than others some different weirder stranger noises that he can make with his mouth there definitely are different instrumental vibes on this record which is great in theory given that there are 17 tracks on this thing that stretch out to about 50 minutes and even though I do think there are great fun and totally hilarious tracks on this project I don't think Z lubbers has quite mastered the art of crafting a project that is interesting track 4 track 4 track because some of the more toned-down songs on help the momentum the interest for me really dies down because as the intensity draws down in his delivery in the instrumental he doesn't really come forward and offer better more thought-provoking lyrics to sort of fill that gap not only that but some of the production on this record is kind of weak maybe a little too dark skeletal and bitter for an MC use whose lyrics are depraved for a guy like this I think the beats really could have been a little more lush colorful detailed could have banged harder though I will admit there is a unique combination going on here in terms of instrumental style and rap style the quieter and moodier tracks on this project are incredibly inconsistent especially on tracks like I'm so sad where the lyrics are laughably awful and even though the bangers really perk my ears up they could be a touch inconsistent to some of them just aren't that memorable outside of the vocal ruckus that Z loopers brings to the table sometimes it seems like there's more of an emphasis on just him going absolutely apeshit versus saying or writing a lyric that's actual we clever or really funny or memorable really sticks in my head I like eccentricity but I like songs as well I really do appreciate the bold strange personality this project brings to the table the incomparable level of energy there are plenty of tracks on this thing that I think are great on their own but as a front to back listen this can be a little bit of a slog I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thang transition if you've given help a listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should are you next and that said Anthony Fantan Oh help forever 
VezTFmabGWo,hi everyone anthony Fantana here the internet space test here and it's time for review of the new Death Grips album what are you doing protesting we think you're too harsh on the new lamb and already record and you get it review it again who is we me and Mike CeCe that is just a picture of Mike C town it's not even what his voice sounds like protect me Death Grips is an experimental hip hop trio hailing from California this is the first half of their fifth LP which I believe is going to be a double album it's the third project they have dropped straight out of the blue since they hit it big with records like ex-military and the Money Store and got dropped from their label Epic Records after releasing their third LP no love Deep Web completely for free that compiled with some of the Bands internet antics along with some infamous no shows at some live dates Death Grips actions are about as loud and in-your-face as their music but their last project though musically was my first real letdown from the band it was definitely one of their loudest bluntest and shortest releases yet but some of these tracks did feel sort of unfinished and that they just incessantly looped over and over and over and didn't really bring much progression or dynamics to the table and on this record there didn't seem to be as much lyrical input from the band's frontman ride some fans were quick to defend this record saying that maybe it was more of a flatlander or Zach Hill endeavor but still even if that is the case I didn't really find a lot of the songs on this LP especially deeper into the record to be all that fleshed out but I will say that it sounds like Death Grips took some of what they picked up on government plates and brought it to this new record as well however it is slightly less accessible the songs on this record or not that visceral if you're looking for a beat you can really bang your head too viciously without having to stop and some really strong memorable catchy hooks you're not really gonna get that here Death Grips drift even further into in accessibility into experimentation all the songs on this one disk of the powers-that-be are condensed into 32 minutes of tracks that segue right into one another so quickly it's difficult to tell when one song begins and another ends unless you're really looking at the track times this thing is a dense digital onslaught of difficult to decipher poetry grooves and song structures Death Grips is sounding more esoteric than ever even though this record is difficult musically and lyrically there are some familiar themes that do turn up in what ride says on this LP there is the song of my sleeves in which I do catch a lot of themes of death as a person you are temporary suicide bride saying that he will take his life and quench his hearse sick fucking lyric and the music embraces that sense of being temporary as well this is one of the longer tracks on the LP and it's incredibly jarring as it breakneck transitions into one moment that completely does not match the one before it then there's black quarterback I think here we're getting a moment where ride is putting himself into a bit of a braggadocious state but when he does that he's just so dark and sick and threatening on say hey kid I get a lot of themes of just spitting in the face of mediocrity normal living what society deems to be a perfect life there are some mentions of OD'ing on this track as well and of course the song fuck me out is talking about the sex but takes the act of sex down a very dark and physical avenue not a very happy and emotional take on sex instead much more twisted their lyrics were on catching references to mental affliction possibly race this is one of Death Grips most cryptic records yet it seems like the closer their audience gets to figure what they're trying to communicate the further they dive down this hole and at the end of all of it I wouldn't be surprised if they had nothing up their sleeves at all more than on previous records ride to me vocally comes off a lot more diverse there are moments where he is just shouting screaming his brains out deathly quiet whispers and everything in between the start of the track black quarterback the way ride is flowing on this track his inflection it actually reminds me a bit of a sob rock and say hey kid there are some moments in the middle of the track especially where ride as a indulging in a bit of spoken word where he reminds me a little of del the funky homosapien so maybe in some respects Death Grips is becoming a little bit more open about their influences and working with other artists as well for one they just dropped a recent collaboration which is going to be on the new bug album and this record may be just the first half of the powers-that-be is actually a bit of a collaboration with Bjork the band credits Bjork is being featured on this record however as far as I can tell she's only really been sampled a lot how quickly they loop her voice how they pitch it up and down and how they manipulate it makes it kind of hard to decipher the source material there are some moments where her voice does feel clear though like at the end of Billy not really but outside of that any incessant intense stuttering female vocal loop could potentially be her these loops are actually difficult to listen past sometimes they really smother these songs and make it difficult to dive into the details like on black quarterback but even beyond these vocal samples these instrumentals are difficult this is Death Grips glitchy ax Strecker det like the really jittery beat on fuck me out as Ryder's is just talking very calmly over this insane rhythm or the track voila which has this onslaught of vocal samples and and beats that come right after this ear piercing scream or the screaming synthetic noise on the opening of the track up my sleeves this is easily some of Death Grips most abrasive and difficult to pull apart material yet beyond that I'm just gonna say that I'm liking this record so far I'm not going to score it technically this is only the first half of the LP but I do want to give my thoughts on what this record is thus far transition if you've given this Death Grips record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it also subscribe million dollars forever 
SXDRPJLqh8Y,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lana Del Rey record ultraviolence lana del rey is an american singer-songwriter who is now putting out her second full-length album after hitting it big with the name Lana Del Rey and singles like the song video games as well as the LP she dropped shortly after born to die which continued to drop big tracks for her like summertime sadness blue jeans and the title track of the LP personally I wasn't really a big fan of the record but I did like its fusion of vintage vocal and chamber pop together with hip hop beats but there were a lot of things holding me back from loving this LP like the cliche dreadful and childish lyricism stereotypical bad boy love interests and older men as well when she's trying to work that Lolita angle at the end of the day this LP has about the emotional depth of a middle schoolers diary especially since all the female leads in Lana's songs her or otherwise are too weak willed and starry-eyed to really see a crappy situation in front of their faces and do anything about it it's pure daytime talk-show Mellotron and in my opinion Lana's not that great of a singer either there are too many tracks on this record where she just a pathetically moans and groans her way through tracks under the guise of sounding sexy or emotional it's just bad acting I might as well be watching the first Twilight movie and ultraviolence right here is the sequel new album for Lana new set of songs new team of producers a few familiar faces here and there but some of the most notable new ones being Greg Kurstin who helped produce the new luckily record and Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys who actually handles a majority of the production on this record and it's actually not a bad change of pace because instrumentally it does bring her closer to the vocal and chamber pop that influences her so much from the 50s and 60s this record to me gives one a much more weight as an artist because of how instrumentally lofty it sounds however a lot like the new Black Keys record these instrumental accessories only go so far due to a lack of interesting songs and lyrics in some respects ultraviolence is in the weaker record for Lana a lot of the time she doesn't even sound like the focus of her own album here because Lana succumbs to the reverb heavy sleeper hold that link Ely did not her new record and sometimes I think her trademark personality gets lost when she reaches up into this baby voiced falsetto which she relies on more than ever on this record the songs are nowhere near as punchy or as catchy as they were on born to die on here they're much more syrupy and long-winded the first track on here is almost 7 minutes long and songs of that length kind of become an issue when vocally you have the personality of a wet paper towel and all the characters in your songs read like a trashy romance novel a lot of deviates from these supposedly tragic romances occasionally but when she does it's not really a pretty sight like on the song Brooklyn baby we're all Lana seems to be doing is just creating this really obnoxious Brooklyn young female stereotype who gets down to beat poetry and listens to old jazz records and only seems to be infatuated with old things simply because they're old and it might be some kind of satire but if that is the case a lot of forgot to put the joke in there somewhere it's not there there's also the song fucked my way to the top which obviously seems like a song title that is just thrown in there to troll haters and get people who don't like Lana to start saying oh yeah of course she fucked her way to the top but lyrically it's a song that seems to dump on some kind of person Lana has beef with who she calls out as being a copycat and I don't know who this person is she doesn't mention her by name but still calling somebody a copycat is a pretty bold statement coming from somebody who just mercilessly rips off and grave Rob's every pop culture icon from the 50s and 60s to create her art then there's the song money power glory which lyrically is just vapid greed it's just a dreadfully boring song especially with the flaccid chorus on this track Moore has never sounded so less and there are other flaccid courses on this record too like on west coast where the chorus when it comes up and all the instrumentation slows down it just sucks the wind right out of the song the track ultraviolence ACK sad girl a particularly redundant chorus I'm a sad girl I'm a sad girl I'm a sad sometimes she's falling flat sometimes she's falling sharp and for every moment that she sings that is passable there's a moment like the finish of I'm pretty when I cry where she's trying to vocalize laughably in her upper register Lana on this record on the standard edition did save the best for last as soon as the track the other woman started I gave my undivided attention to the track to the lyrics and was actually Wow by the first four lines of lyrics on this track thinking that they were a beautiful clever and smart portrayal of what it's like to be the other woman in a relationship the lyrics on this track were just uncharacteristically good for Lana Del Rey and that was absolutely true because the track was actually written by the best song is written by someone else overall this LP instrumentally production wise it's not too bad there are a lot of beautiful and endearing moments on this record but lyrically vocally and and sometimes melodically this record is just gross it is dying to be tragic it is dying to be meaningful but it wants to get there without any sort of philosophical thought without any sort of soul-searching because truth be told this record is too shallow to even have a soul to search through I'm feeling a strong one - a light - on this record transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why there's a thing underneath my head that lets you subscribe this record has no soul I'm saying here again and what should I review next cool cool Anthony Fantana Lana Del Rey ultraviolence forever 
QVtTjuLERT4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bones mixtape garbage bones is an Internet rapper I was first introduced to his work earlier this year through the teen witch mixtape and I have publicly stated through of a certain social media platform that I think it's the worst mixtape of 2014 mostly because a lot of the songs on this tape take inspiration straight from the Columbine shootings which in concept isn't necessarily a bad thing I mean many artists over the years have tributed great tragedies in American history however in this particular instance the execution was so lazy boring and uninspired that I couldn't help a feel of this project was merely just exploiting the tragedy however I did come away from this tape and other bones tapes after listening to teen which liking his aesthetic dark atmospheric cloud wrap with a southern trap flavored flare something three 6 mafia fans can get into if they like their lyrics a little more spaced out a little more glazed over and with the production sounding a bit more modern somebody who's into little ugly man I think can get into but for me personally the the pitched vocals the pitched down vocals aren't really there to be so distracting bones really just delivers his straightforward normal regular voice I've seen some people compare bones to yung lean to however it's it's it's really not that much of a comparison because I think bones has been doing it longer I think the tone of his songs is darker more somber more serious his lyrics don't feel quite as absurd a lot of the time but I understand how some people could just misconstrue bones for just another internet emcee and at the end of the day maybe maybe he is who knows he does have the simple straightforward trap beats the emphasis on atmosphere his deadpan an ice-cold delivery makes him feel a little lifeless and lethargic at times there is the occasional gaudy use of auto-tune on this record too and there are moments where bones lyrics sounds like he's just completely making them up off the top of his head while totally stoned out of his mind and a lot of songs on the cell P just end abruptly and are not that fleshed out most of the tracks on this project laying around that one or two minute mark the entire tape even though it has over 15 tracks lands around 30 minutes in length throughout garbage there there are some glaring flaws but in a lot of ways this tape is actually what I would like to be hearing in the darker moodier underground side of hip-hop right now this tape is actually almost what I would have wanted to hear out of this Space Ghost perp album that dropped on 4ad a few years ago because even though in Bones lyrics there are elements of current day swag rap and braggadocio money violence drugs so on and so forth there are some really depressing dark introspective moments as well there's some conceptual tracks on here where actually big as verse is kind of clever like on Linksys broadband router where all of his lyrics have to do with internet modern-day technology it's a little tongue in cheek but still manages to pull together a very real dark vibe my favorite track in this line being URL blunts - my IRL face and not only are there dark dank trap flavored cloud rap songs on this LP but there are also tracks that incorporate some acoustic guitar pretty beautifully like on the track lay me in the river which has this guitar lead that sounds like some early Modest Mouse guitar lead there's some real elements of self-hate in the lyrics that bones brings to the table on this track but as dark and as sad as his songs feel sometimes it's very clear that he doesn't take himself that seriously there is the song if you had a Zune I hate you which is actually really more of a spooky black song where he's singing all over the track it's actually one of the better recorded songs I've heard him on I do not care for his black silk tape project whatever I don't think his vocals are that strong I don't think the recording is that good I don't think the beats are that great to me it's absolutely boring but this song in particular I did find somewhat captivating even though it did end short and there are a few good collab tracks on here with some features from Xavier Wulf as well as Eddie Baker but even the songs on here that I like they just tend to end really abruptly again it's that brevity keeping a lot of the songs on this LP from really leaving a lasting impact on me even though they may start well and they bring a good tone and vibe and maybe some decent lyrics to the table but a lot of them just cut out a little too soon and I'm left aligning more and even though I do like this project that's kind of the overall thing I'm just left wanting more a little bit more in terms of the length of these songs a little less filler and a little more lyrically as of right now I think bones is putting out some interesting stuff I think he has a style I think he has an interesting direction going for him but I'm kind of left wondering if he really has the ambition to push his projects beyond projects like this I don't doubt that a guy like bones has the potential to put out a better project but I'm kind of wondering if ambition is actually in the game plan for a lot of these internet rappers who just kind of seem to be putting out sort of apathetic somewhat nihilistic projects I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition if you give in garbage listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana bones 
9fIpMIsf_o0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and esoteric warfare is the latest full-length LP from famed Norwegian black metal outfit mayhem this band's career dates back to the 80s they are one of the original black metal outfits out of Norway this is their first full-length LP in seven years I believe however it is not uncommon to have a bit of a wide gap in time between releases the band's existence has been nothing if not turbulent they're truly a group that lives up to the name they slap themselves with not only with how they've experimented with their sound on various records dabbling a little in electronics and avant-garde metal and spoken word but they're sometimes violent breakups and lineup changes have been the biggest contributor to the folklore of that which is mayhem like a photograph of one of the band's earliest members dead being featured on the front cover of the live bootleg dawn of the black hearts the issue with this photo is that it's a picture of him after having committed suicide or another early member of the group Euronymous having been murdered in cold blood by Varg Vickery's AKA Burzum both of whom perform on Mayhem's infamous debut album and the most recent change to befall this LP has been the loss of longtime guitarist producer and songwriter blasphemer and even though two long-time mayhem fans this loss may seem significant no matter how bloody it was a lineup changes never really stopped mayhem from sounding hellish before so I don't see why it would now just like the band who made it this record lives up to its name esoteric warfare the album features that classic old-school lo-fi necro style of black metal production getting into this record sonic details involves wading through a waist-deep swamp of Sonic muck and the other side of the coin is warfare this record is looking for a battle but it is a skilled and calculated and sinister warrior this LP is straightforward black metal with some occasionally angular and progressive riffs and odd grooves here and there a little like chimera but maybe it touch more experimental and not nearly as well recorded but discography comparisons aside get into the cell P if you're looking for some ruthless dark dismal black metal riffing some sharp melodies some really brittle shimmering guitar tones relentless drumming and a lot of the time some experimental odd instrumental detours and interludes like on the songs I wore around the 1:30 mark you're getting this wall of whispers and lo fie guitars which is significantly softer than many other moments on this track or on the song Watchers we're all of a sudden Attila breaks into this throat singing the guitars your way drone ear or the song Trinity all of a sudden the guitars died down there's all these sirens what sounds like gunshots there's some death metal growls work later into this track as well atilla's vocal performances overall on this record are pretty diverse if you're familiar with his career this is not the freakiest you've ever heard him but he does bring a lot of vocal styles to the table from the traditional black metal wretch to some truly evil shouting - aah nearly every song on this LP features some kind of abrupt change or sudden detour and I would call it just window dressing but I think the ideas that mayhem brings through these changes are usually pretty novel however the first half of this LP I think does run a little average in terms of just a black metal sound but on the second half of this LP I think mayhem experiments a little more boldly especially around the halfway point where the songs tend to slow down a little bit get a little noisier get a little bit more atmospheric and the more aggressive tracks on the side of the record like corpse of care and throne of time I think these songs are actually more vicious and freakish overall this is a fine mayhem album not necessarily the crushing return one would want after seven years but certainly a great late era record there's a lot of musical detail on this LP there's musical diversity there's personality there's experimentation there's eccentricity mayhem do a great job of balancing between making metal music that is animalistic and thought-provoking I do think the production is lacking sometimes pulls away from the potential punch of this record atilla's vocals definitely could have used more space especially when he goes into his lower register they tend to sound a little suffocated and the bass drums on this record for as fantastically as they are played by Hellhammer who plays at speeds that just are mind-boggling they are so overpowering and tend to drown out the subtleties and the guitars and really just overtake the entire song especially on the first few tracks and the really flat plastic tone of these bass drums don't really do these tracks any favors either still I think this is a flavorful killer and solid black metal record I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh mayhem forever 
__MzJoGgYLk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet busiest music nerd I do not smoke drugs before my reviews I am NOT high while I do my reviews that is unprofessional sometimes I like to have a little giggle because I think life's funny Lazaretto is the second full-length LP the sophomore LP from guitarist multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Jack White a key the weight mean you could call him that a key weight that I am sure he does not go by he was greatness uh so Jack White's second full-length album only his second full-length album and it's only his second because he has spent most of his time rising to the top in other bands like the dead weather I was the rock on tours and the infamous White Stripes the garage and blues rock duo who introduced me to Jack White's songwriting in the first place personally for me when it comes to Jack White it does not get much better than the White Stripes first for full-length albums their last two LPs weren't quite as raw as their previous records and with tracks like Blue Orchid also were host to some of their worst songs I have my reasons for being on the fence with Jack White's other major projects but as far as his solo stuff goes Jack isn't quite letting go of the songwriting style that he has built his reputation on thus far but simultaneously he's not really lending his new songs the raw and explosive energy that made his past works so great in the first place and the softer ballad type songs on Jack's debut aren't quite as moving or as delicate either I admire the instrumentally ambition that Jack delivered on this LP but the final result was kind of middle-of-the-road still despite that slight disappointment I can't say I went into this new record over here looking to be disappointed again I did go into the cell P really enjoying the lead singles from it and I personally think Jack White is too much of a perfectionist to come out with a project that is total crap unfortunately though Lazaretto is not the firecracker of a record I was hoping for though I will say that Jack white definitely successfully up the production quality added loads of musical detail into this thing instrumentally this record is impressively assembled it's refreshing because of that even if Jack's songwriting style is kind of the same at its core the fiddle all over this record the solo on Lazaretto fantastic and is that harmonica solo on the back end of three women it sounds great I love the sweeping and weeping vocal melodies on the track would you fight for my love so grand so wonderful so epic the background singers on this LP are consistently great there are lots of very confident playful colorful pianos on this record like on just one drink and alone in my home and with highball stepper Jack shows that he's still no slouch on the guitar with a solo that makes his sixth string scream for mercy again the additional instrumentation on this record is consistently fire Lazaretto sounds like it was produced and orchestrated by a passionate madman but the other side of this coin is singing and songwriting and disappointingly the singing and the lyrics on this LP are way too humdrum and sober and just plain to be madman in fact they are just sane like with the song just one drink the way the instrumentation comes together on this song is so tame and so underwhelming just one drink must be literal because the song doesn't even feel close to catching a buzz then there's the song alone in my home which like I said has an amazing piano part on it and I guess melodically this is one of the more upbeat tracks but lyrically it's one of the sadder tracks on this LP and Jack White's vocal delivery doesn't really show it I would actually say emotionally on this song he sounds pretty unaffected or there's tracks on here like the painfully boring three women the opener to this LP a song with a 12 bar blues structure something at one point Jack White was able to make sound fantastic and exciting and refreshing again but with the really uninspired lordy Lord refrain and Jack White's lack of interesting lyrical takes on this three women situation the whole storyline of this song is pretty tedious I have seen a few people comment on the increase in country ballads and country songs on this latest LP from Jack white and and I definitely do feel that increase as well the acoustic instrumentation on the song entitlement sounds genuinely rootsy but vocally this song also sounds genuinely frigid I get that songs like this might be delivered with earnest intent but in my opinion Jack's lyricism his delivery has never been so profound or intense to warrant that sort of thing really Jack plays the role of the wild eccentric so much better which is why a track like black cat licorice goes down easier even if it's not the best track on the record not that this LP started off amazing but Jack White truly does save the worst for last on here with an acoustic ballad that maybe has the most tedious refrain on the entire record and features a bunch of verses sung by vocals that are just Jack White multitrack with Jack White and placed together in close harmony in this really obnoxious way the end of the first verse doesn't resolve that well the second and third verse seem to play with this melody and and veer off of the structure in the formula the melodic formula of the song without even really establishing the theme of the track all that well to begin with it's the flimsiest most filler type track on the entire LP and it feels like it was only placed in this spot because it's the quietest this LP to me is just a mixed bag through and through it's incredibly ambitious and great for Jack white at this point in his career at some points but emotionally this record is incredibly lacking I feel like with its listeners this album wins them and dines them and showers them and really expensive clothes and jewelry and so on and so forth but it doesn't love them I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on the sell P transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jack White Lazaretto bottle 
0k_hTuQiU8E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and bless  is the title of the latest track them record these guys are a New Hampshire band this is their fourth full-length LP of dark crusty punk metal fusions if you remember back in 2011 a few years ago I dug on their last full-length album darker handcraft a record that I admired for its ferocity but musically I thought these guys could be a little bit more distinct there were some riffs and some melodic guitar leads here and there that stood out but this record was not really a powerhouse when it came to musical composition and not only musically but sonically I actually think that trapped them is starting to lose their flavor as well in the ever-growing pool of heavy and nihilistic hardcore acts out there a lot of which have been produced by Kurt Balu of converge bands like this routine as hell or Baptists or the secret black breath nails dead in the dirt you recently defunct Gaza young and in the way and even though this help you I think is just a smidge more aggressive than trapped ends last record I'm getting pretty much the same sort of unmemorable vibe here there's a riff there's a melodic guitar lead here and there that may make a particular track stand out like the songs organic infernal and gift and gift unsteady two of the better tracks on this LP or the song former lining wide the walls not one of the more melodic tracks on this LP but it's definitely one of the more ferocious trap them really puts aggression on top on this particular track but it's just not enough to keep the songs on this LP interesting or keep this entire LP interesting which is trap them's longest record yeah at 47 minutes which to me is really just too long to be doing one thing and one thing only at least one thing well even though trap them is mad as hell boy do their vocal sound buried on a lot of these tracks and and sound pretty run-of-the-mill as well as the guitar tone here too which is super bodyless and flavorless just so distorted that has no organic qualities whatsoever the guitars all over this up here just blocky with no dynamics stylistically trap them does make efforts to break this record up with songs like them which is a bit of an interlude track with guitars and vocals which comes through the really hard-hitting finish and they're slower and more dismal tracks on here like savage climbers one of the longest tracks on this LP but trap them is really stiff performance doesn't really bring the the finesse that I think is necessary to do a song this slow and this depressing however I wouldn't really say on this LP overall that the performance is terrible it's definitely passable it's definitely there and the production isn't terrible either I mean it definitely gives trapped them a loud and clear sound but a sound that's enthralling that's live and in the moment and has its own natural momentum this record does not have to me bliss sounds like something that would sound much greater with trap them playing it live and in person because as a recording when it comes to this darker moodier more nihilistic hardcore metal fusion this record is about as predetermined as a color by numbers activity page I'm feeling a light decent 5 on the cell P transition if you give in this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it trap them bliss forever 
K3lJ2BKSGeo,I am so annoyed right now I can't even handle it hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd typically I don't talk much about politics on this YouTube channel personally I feel like our government embarrasses itself enough on a regular basis to the point where I don't need to point it out there getting God's spying on us for whatever reason they lack the capacity to give our veterans our wounded veterans adequate health care and they basically been unable to put the end to a war that is older than a lot of my viewers at this point and with this video I'm going to put a little fuel on the fire I hate to break it to you but our government tortures people duh everybody knows that with music duh everybody knows that as requested by me my dude Sam Sutherland over at ox TV has put together a video that is essentially a short history of music used as torture by America I am going to transition over to the videos so I mean it's it's going to be hard I've never done a transition to a totally different video like this before so will require supreme concentration transition issues it is the first use of music in American military action is kind of funny during the US invasion of Panama in 1989 the army continuously played Van Halen's Panama in an attempt to drive Manuel Noriega to surrender and things have become much less funny since then after Panama music played a bit role in American offensive action the FBI used Nancy Sinatra and Tibetan chants at Waco but it was the advanced interrogation techniques of a post 9/11 military landscape that brought out the big speakers Industrial Godfather's Skinny Puppy recently dragged this issue back into the public eye when they invoiced the United States government for 666 thousand dollars following the revelation that they're pummeling tunes were being used to soften up prisoners for interrogation so went to the BBC and the BBC is you know they came up with a statement saying that they had got in touch with the Pentagon and they could neither deny nor confirm receipt of our invoices so now we've gone on and in recent the invoices can we've gotten new connections with new addresses of the Department of Defense and the Department of intelligence here's what softening up entails six or twelve hours in a dark room with this played so loud that you cannot sleep or think skinny puppy's complaint may be new but the guts of this story date back to 2004 when the testimony of numerous Guantanamo Bay prisoners revealed that loud music was being used to psychologically torture inmates for months at a time but it didn't start with metal it started with pigtails eventually the members of the u.s. psychological operations or psyops team led by sergeant mark Hansel found some more threatening music to bang they found deicide deicide led to the usual suspects Metallica Nine Inch Nails and Skinny Puppy but not every band resented being used in a torture setting when a rumor began circulating the Metallica had requested Enter Sandman be removed from the playlist Christian metal band demon hunter stepped up to the plate crack they went so far as to send CDs and patches to American military personnel the Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden was wearing a demon hunter patch when he did it but in an attempt to perfect what is known internally as futility music interrogators went further than metal they went as dark as you can possibly imagine I love you You Love Me Barney hasn't signed up yet but artists like REM and Pearl Jam have joined forces with the human rights organization reprieve in order to find out exactly what is being used as futility music 5 the US government one dude that's not joining up buddy from drowning pool the fans bass player thought being used as a method of torture was an honor and that some kids in America pay for that although based on the fact of the band's most recent record sold half as much as their last record not that many kids there's a tendency to view the horrors of guantanamo bay as an old story sprung from the cartoon villainy of the bush-cheney use but the abuse of prisoners at American military black sites is ongoing with music as wide-ranging as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Sesame Street being used to keep people awake for weeks on end what do you think of futility music is it okay for an interrogator to use a nine inch nail song without Trent Reznor's permission conversely is this whole conversation just a distraction from the overarching horrors of advanced interrogation techniques let us know what you think in the comments of this video and if you like this exist be sure to check out more episodes at youtube.com slash this exists thanks very much to Anthony for having me even though I miss your old hair very much transition again thank you very much to Sam for putting this video together for this channel I will leave a link down there in the description where you can check out his channel you could also click on my face if you want to check out his company's channel as well and music used to hurt people what do you think about it does it make you sad it makes me sad fucking depressed really forever 
ZqGesno_FiQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for I think this one's going to go well a monthly segment that we do positive attitude here positive p.m. a y-you know review where I talk about in a gauntlet a series of records that I wish I had reviewed in the past month but I didn't really get a chance to or maybe it wasn't feeling up to it for whatever reason there were other records I wanted to review instead let's go the new closure in moscow record i believe these guys are from australia as well pink lemonade a lot of people been asking me about this record but i'm just not seeing what so special or interesting about it just kind of sounds like i'm listening to mars volta with portugal the man and really that's it it just feels like they're pulling from these two bands styles so obviously they're yet to really come through the sound or even a songwriting idea that is distinct that is really their own or is memorable i even think to a degree they are not even as interesting as those bands even though i do think in a sense they do do their sound justice it's not like the production is terrible or anything like that but i'd rather just listen to portugal demand and mars volta next the new atmosphere record I didn't like the lyrics on this a lot of the time cringing at so many bars on this record that's all I can really say about it the beats for the most part we're fine production was fine but just so many cringe-worthy moments in the lyrics a lot of which I don't have the time to go into because this is a why you know review but prime examples like the Kanye West track on here just so many rhymes and similes that I'm just like the mommy tattoo line which I think was on the first track the LP I'm not I'm not going to get into it just wasn't liking the lyrics I just think atmospheres done better next the new young and in the way record if you're looking for something bringing together crust punk hardcore punk in black metal this thing is furious this thing is head crushing it is so fast it is bad and uh there are some tracks on here that I don't think are that memorable there's one track in the middle of the cell P where it just switches from this really fast-paced song literally like just like a bad edit in the middle of the song then directly going to something very ambient and spacious I like that a band that gets this loud has an appreciation for atmosphere and subtlety and more dreary sounds and melodies it definitely brings some variety to this record not always in the best way because there is a terrible interlude track for the back end of this thing but it does end with a very powerful nine minute song all that being said it's a pretty decent combination of these black metal and hardcore punk flavors I didn't love it but I do endorse it as well as the new Kishi Bashi record if you're looking for a lot like that Owen Pallett record I mentioned Kishi Bashi in the review I did for Owen Pallett if you're looking for something lush lavish but much more poppy and upbeat and friendly and smile inducing the colors on this record are much more just playful do get into this record if you're looking for pop music that is ultra ultra layered ultra ultra orchestrated very dense and very fun then listen to this kisi Bashi album the new Metronomy record these guys are a pop outfit hailing from the UK I thought there are a few singles off of this thing especially the song love lighters the title track from this record that I thought were fantastic sounded kind of like a an Abba song but maybe stripped back to its barest of elements but on this LP even though there are songs on here that I liked that I thought were good I was kind of being held back by the same stuff I didn't quite enjoy about the band's previous records and I think sometimes their production sometimes their instrumentation and even their singing performances even though I think metronomy come together and they write some great songs the way they execute their songs in the way they record them can be a little shoddy sometimes and I think it ends up hurting them in the end because I think these flaws I think these shoddier characteristics don't really end up working in their favor in acute or endearing way the new intuition and equilibrium record equilibrium producer intuition West Coast rapper if you're looking for hip hop that has a jazz wrapped flavor very chill if you're very laid-back give this thing a listen I wasn't huge on it myself but only because I think there weren't enough tracks on here that just were bangers you know came through a little more aggressively the entire record is so laid back that it tends to blend together a little too much for me but I do think there are some strong individual songs on this thing goo libram good producer intuition good rapper I just wish there was more variety on this thing and that's all and then there is the new Conor Oberst record which honestly I have not enjoyed I have I have been listening to his more recent material but I have not enjoyed I mean really loved a Conor Oberst record or a brighteyes record since I'm wide awake it's morning I've been pretty underwhelmed by everything that he has done since then except for the recent singles that he came out with when he reassembled desaparecidos which I mean those songs were fire to me those singles were fire to me for the most part he seemed way more passionate you seem way more driven on these tracks he was just so worked up and it felt like his lyrics just had so much more purpose to them especially as he was attacking some political issues in some of the songs that he was writing for this reassembly of the band however in this solo capacity Connor seems to have fallen back on his laurels a little bit and is delivering some very tame instrumentations a very tame songs just the the pain the emotions just none of it feels turned up into the read like the stuff I enjoy from him the most and finally the new horrors record I I'm pretty disappointed in to be completely honest I thought their last LP skying was fine though I wasn't totally down with the direction they were moving in on that record mostly because I thought that their more gothic their more hard-hitting their more post punkish material in their early discography was more original was more interesting was more distinct now I feel like with this record they've made a full transition into just sounding like a really boring dream pop shoegaze cover band of one of the more popular groups that came out of the UK or Glasgow in the 80s or 90s right now this is the horrors that they're least interesting and it's painful to listen to as a result I also gave a listen to the new plaid album thought there were some interesting electronic compositions there some of which are very glitchy oddly grooved but I didn't think the sound craft was all that novel or exciting on this thing I didn't think textures were all that vibrant or or novel sort of redundant thing I just said there but I digress there were some quirky playful tracks on here that I thought were fun that I thought were interesting I guess what I'm saying is that plaid has never really been one of my favorite electronic music duo's but if you are looking for a group that has a bit more experience under their belt because their discography does trip back then do give a listen to this album and the new killer be killed record this is a metal supergroup you know who's in the supergroup I'm just not that thrilled by it to be completely honest it's just another supergroup that's just there okay it's just okay it's not that exciting to me maybe it is to you but letting you know you know who's in the supergroup maybe you'll be like oh how are you supergroup whoa check that out I'm 11 but me personally not doing it and that is this month's why you know review transition if you've given any of these albums listen what'd you think of him did you love him did you hate him why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana why you know review forever 
Blz9I0q2Hq8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Ben frost album Aurora this guy is an Australian music producer multi-instrumentalist and soundtrack composer lately he has been keeping busy putting together film scores as well as a collaboration with Daniel bjornsen but it's been a while since we've last heard from Ben in a full-length studio album capacity 2009's by the throat by my count an album that not only dabbled in the very moody dark ambient soundscapes and drones that we typically expected from Ben but also chamber music there were some pretty intricate compositions on this record as well as a little bit of abrasive miss noisiness by the throat is a really diverse and skilled album I recommend you listen to it however this latest project from Ben is not nearly as diverse in fact I think he very intentionally narrows his scope down to the more synthetic and harsh elements of Ben's compositional palette on this LP Ben is embracing heavy industrially tinged rhythms shrouded in harsh walls of noise little baby high-pitched squelched melodies hidden away in apocalyptic fuzz I love dark ambient music like this that is incredibly textured the two latest Tim Hecker records actually come to mind both of which might actually have been influenced by Ben frost to a degree given that the 2009 album by the throat was so distorted and was so textured and Tim Hecker actually named it as one of his favourite records of the year on self-titled magazine's website still admittedly though I am feeling just a tad underwhelmed by this new Ben frost record for music that is ambient music experimental music Noise music there are very few moments on this LP where I feel mystified where I feel like I'm being brought to another world this music to me doesn't really have that strong of a sense of place what I mean to say is is this record I kind of just see right through it for what it is just pretty transparent a little uninspiring I think the sounds on this LP as they are presented to me they don't really drive me to imagine or really feel anything the sounds are just merely the sounds and throughout the duration of this record to me they just kind of stay that way that might have to do with the composition of these songs but supremely I think it has a lot to do with the flow of this album which i think is terrible there's nothing significant in my opinion about how the tracks on this LP complement one another this thing to me really feels like just a mixed bag the first half of the LP for example is loaded with these whisper quiet ambient tracks I would actually even call the third track on this LP almost a field recording not only are these tracks not that gripping it seems like they're both really too short to elicit any kind of sense of calm but it seems like the only reason these songs are in the tracklist is just so that the next track immediately after them can bust in with an incredibly loud intro that's ear piercing in comparison in volume this happens from the song flex to the song Nolan this happens from the teeth to secant this happens within the very short track on this LP diphenyl oxalate and while I don't really mind jarring music I found at least in this case on this record it just sort of lost its luster as I was listening to this album repeated times now as far as the louder tracks on this LP go separately I wouldn't even call them that interesting the song Nolan for example is incredibly chaotic with all these drums bells synthesizer leads a drone hanging in the background - I think and none of it really ever assembles into anything coherent what ends up happening is the song just turns quiet and slowly progresses into a really loud massive brittle and distorted finish a finish that's not nearly as epic or overpowering as it is just shrill and kind of tedious I feel the same way about the closing track on this LP - and as far as the song secant goes this song to me seems more focused there are huge massive drums on this track and rumbling sub-base the rhythm on this song it is the chilling reverb surrounding these drums reminds me of like an old old early early swans track but again as the song progresses we get louder we ladder we get more intense and we end up having a track that once again is really shrill is really ear piercing but the composition that the distortion is masking or over modulating just isn't incredibly gripping it kind of underwhelmed me in the same way that when I listen to let's say a sleigh bell song it's an OK pop rock song but for whatever reason it's just turned up to maximal distorted volume for a bit of a thrill on the second half of this LP there is my favorite song on the album Venter another slow burner that picks up some wintry drones and some bells along the way the way the song is paced actually reminds me of like a moment or two from swans the seer and while the ending of this song is noisy I do find it to be more tolerable than some of the other tracks on here but even the moments I like on this LP I just find them to be wrapped up far too much in their own chaos like the explosions the distortion the destruction the decay that you hear on this record it's encased into the album and it really only effects itself and I'm just an outside observer and it's just really not translating to me I do commend this album for its experimentation I do commend Ben for doing something different this time around I commend this record for just embracing the tenets of of noise which is usually an element I find interesting especially on music such as this but I didn't find this record to be even half as cinematic or as engaging as Ben's last LP I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this album transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it huh Ben frost Aurora forever 
Od3bBCq5mkY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new blue album good to be home this is the latest full-length LP from underground West Coast MC blue he's got a few really good projects under his belt especially the ones where he collaborated with rapper and producer exile like smell my flowers and below the heavens give me my flowers give me my flowers there was the LP he put out a handful of years ago no York which was a bit of a botched release from Warner Brothers Records when he signed with them it's an LP that's decent it's really trippy it's West Coasters Flying Lotus production on this album blues bars and delivery are much more chill and toned down ever since that album blues output to me has been really really hit or miss with all these one-off solo projects that are maybe a little low fire kind of demo quality or collaborations that didn't really seem to escalate his name any further than I already had been escalated I just feel like that a lot of his stuff lately hasn't really been that stunning or ambitious so of course I was incredibly indescribably excited when I first heard that he's going to be coming out with a new LP right here with a producer with a one producer working with one producer for the whole thing meaning that possibly this record will be focused and then on top of all of that this album was also going to be a double album which in the music world is basically the mark of ambition but I did not come out lovin this thing in my opinion among other things this record really is overly long either because there's just straight filler on it or they're just a lot of songs that pale in comparison to others and just don't keep the heat don't keep the momentum of the album up mostly because of the production the production on this LP gets so distorted gets so muffled that the vocals kind of get lost in the bass the highs the treble of these songs doesn't really translate all the time or it just impedes on the overall quality of the song there are tracks on here like the West and the 50s for example which to me because of the week recording don't really sound like anything other than see a stick demos I actually was not able to begin enjoying this LP to the slight degree that I do until I threw it on headphones basically eliminating all the really bad bass mixing and mastering just really finding a way to make the flaws on this record less audible and don't get me wrong I love fuzzy warm slightly lo-fi left-field hip-hop it's why I love producers like Madlib and J Dilla Madlib just came out with a record this year with Freddie Gibbs that is amazing but right there on pinata that's like where the low Phi line is is drawn for me go any further down that road and Freddie Gibbs lyrics on pinata are basically inaudible and good to be home just doesn't step over this line it Rockets past it like it's a finish line overall while I do enjoy the composition of these instrumentals I think we've got some really great jazz and soul sampling throughout this LP there's some good keyboard leads here and there the vibe and the groove of drums and the rhythms on these instrumentals are pretty good as well but it sounds like Bombay had no other choice than to take these beats and in order to carry them from where he produced them to the studio to record them with blue he had to put them on the dustiest crappiest most warped cassette tape in all of California the lyrical side of this album is really the winner here and there we get a lot of braggadocio some personal looks at Blues past and present and a bit of a tribute to the West Coast there are a lot of West Coast emcees and artists featured in the track listing of this LP there are also a lot of references to places in California as well as culture and artists that came out of there like dr. Dre ice-t Ice Cube and the list does not stop there and even the final bonus track on the first disc of this thing which I wish came earlier actually as a bit of a G Funk vibe in the instrumental to me to me to me to me lyrically the most interesting track on this entire LP is the return a song where Blu is rapping by himself and he's essentially rapping about his past talking specifically about his name how he was given this nickname he came up with it despite the fact that there were Crips and just people in general asking why his name is blue was there any kind of gang affiliation so on and so forth saying that he never gangbang and talking about how he stuck with that name despite all the drama around it and how he loves roots from and so on and so forth it's a beautiful tribute and it's one of the few moments on the cell P where I think the instrumental is great in the low five production really works in favor of the weeping horns and strings then you have Posse tracks on here like boys in the hood which features a relentless verse after verse after verse from West Coast rapper Fushan among others and everybody is pretty much rapping about growing up as kids respectively talking about Saturday morning cartoons there being parents who are also addicts and for the most parts really the tracks that have the most emcees on them like three or more that are consistently the most exciting they're typically really no BS and just really get down to business plus with people on here like alchemists and evidence and prodigy POC dibs on here Imani from far side is on this record as well this LP really is kind of bloated with features I would actually say a lot of them sound kind of phoned in but at least the feature list does give the listener quite a bit to look forward to not not every verses fire though that cost verse at the end of whipped cream is a complete mess the second disc on this LP the second half of this LP is a little better there are a few beats here and there that are clearer than others on the first disc and I think this disc brings consistently more conceptual songs tracks like he-man and welfare and rap dope and child support all really decent tracks if you don't like this album thus far stick around for the second disc it definitely does pick up and if you do like this album well you're in for a treat but still in my opinion the second disc of this album still suffer from most of the issues that plagued the first disc a little filler here and there a few features to many the recording quality really destroying the momentum of these songs still there were shining moments on this record though where I thought blue was delivering some of his best material and in a sense I did get an ambitious project and even with some of the tracks that I thought were just okay I was imagining myself in an alternate universe where the song was actually chorded really well and it sounded pretty good there at the end of the day while there are a lot of qualities on this album that I like this help he just left so much to be desired in terms of just execution I'm feeling a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh blue forever 
QZkHxln2jQw,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new parquet courts record sunbathing animal this is the follow-up full-length album to the breakout LP light up gold from parquet courts that came out a few years ago these guys are a Brooklyn band fronted by Texas transplant Andrew savage a musical workhorse whose art I have been following for quite a while now through his other projects like Ferguson Geronimo teenage cool kids different bands different songs different vibes however there is a strong slacker sentiment that runs deeply throughout many of Andrews projects the most gripping thing about this album is its attitude and it's repetitive ultra simple songwriting style nearly every song on this LP revolves really redundant ly around these basic punky grooves and riffs and the vocals on top of these riffs vary from talking slash singing really blurring the lines between talking and singing sometimes I can't quite tell which one Andrew is doing when he's not doing that he's delivering all these really off-key yelps or sometimes he's just shouting his vocals the vocals truth be told they're not that masterful on this record the playing is a little loose the energy is a little wild the songs are our little memorable and the whole thing is a little interesting I like where the band is coming from for the most part like on the song she's rolling which is the slow plodding rock tune fronted with these hypnotic minimal lyrics and the instrumentation on this track just grows noisier and more chaotic and more dissonant as it carries along with harmonica and distorted guitars the whole thing feels like a touch of Velvet Underground worship however the band offers nothing in terms of interesting lyrics and legitimately exciting sonic chaos truth be told this song is just tedious and kind of torturous there's just not an interesting song or riff or lyrical idea at the root of that's track it even the faster more interesting more energetic more visceral songs on this record suffer from the same issue even though on the surface they may be more entertaining because they display a more explosive performance like the title track on here and black and white tracks that are fast paced their fiery instrumentally they remind me of a combination of the minimal very strip back simple and basic instrumentation of wire combined with the goofy rock-and-roll swagger of the modern lovers but again is there an interesting song at the core of this very light and breezy ruckus not really even on the slightly more toned down tracks on this LP like Oh Ramona which to me breathes the slacker energy of a band like camper van Beethoven and maybe feels like a touch of solo Jonathan Richmond as well even though I like the grimy guitars the really mundane vocal delivery on this track and the black of wit or anything interesting to say in the lyrics really just kills this track for me and I'm not just saying that it it fails in comparison to the artists that it seems to pull from but I don't even think this song lives up to previous projects I've heard Andrew savage front some of which have been gut-wrenchingly hilarious or sharply satirical the closest I think parquet courts comes to an interesting lyrical verse on this record is the song instant disassembly in terms of the pace of the song and in terms of the the melody of the song it's one of the sadder and more moody tracks on this LP and it definitely captures that vibe it definitely captures that emotional impact really well but this track is just drawn-out needlessly for seven minutes and I do not think parquet courts deliver seven minutes of ideas over the course of this track there are a lot of songs on this LP that I don't think start that well and the ones that do there's not enough significant development over the course of the song to keep things interesting I feel like most of the tracks on this LP are just one little idea for a song or a verse or a part of a song that if somehow been stretched out to the length of a song and all these songs which are spread incredibly thin are stacked on top of one another for an album that is spread incredibly thin overall I think this LP has a good foundation I think okay courts have a lot of attitude just like they did on their last LP I think there's a gritty tone to the guitars and the drums I think these guys are endearingly lazy and enjoyably loose in their delivery in their performance but outside of the faster tracks on this LP at least to me this record does very little to hold interest I'm going to give this thing a light two decent four and a gold-medal of the slack Olympics transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh parquet courts forever 
Rhxuyujfep8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and neon icon is the latest full-length LP from Houston rapper riff raff man who is a Gucci mystery wrapped up in a Versace enigma and locked away into a Louima his recent rise in popularity has been pretty unlikely considering that he was an MTV reality show vet who's 15 minutes of fame were up but miraculously through a series of mixtapes singles features and collaborations and James Franco essentially playing him in that recent Spring Breakers movie riff-raff has a ride to his rightful place as a musical and titania on Diplo's Mad Decent label and through that label he is dropping his largest commercial release yet neon icon now riff raff is not your average rapper he's a goofy mother yes but it's a little more ambiguous than that you can just take riff raff as being silly but he has some undeniably catchy and absurdly clever lyrics or you can take him seriously but he very clearly doesn't even take himself that seriously and a lot of his lyrics clearly do have a humorous intent to them riff raff mostly relies on a kind of comedic shtick that admittedly does get old after a while and even riff raff himself knows that which is why he tries to break things up a little bit on his other projects and this album with slower tracks and ballads and sketches and radio-friendly pop rap jams avenues where riff raff silly inflection and lyrics don't have quite as much comedic impact kind of like the song time a track where I don't even think the song is supposed to be funny I think it's actually supposed to be meaningful the song that's a bit of a personal look back at riff Raff's past musing on the social construct of time talking about how it passes by a dime-a-dozen observation that even coucher chesta could point out to me time moves the day like way it sure does friend admittedly I'm not really impressed with how philosophically gallo this track is and how weak of an attempt this song is to stir up an emotional moment and his singing on this song is straight garbage yeah it's it's moments like the closing track on here VIP pass to my heart where I hope that what riffraff is doing his image his songs everything is really a stick a big fat stick because the idea of someone making this song seriously frightens me but part of riff Raff's persona is that the things he says in the way he looks and the songs that he sings are all worth kind of gawking at the gawk is an essential part of the riff raff formula and now that he has a pretty significant amount of fans who enjoy his trap flavored songs that have all these ridiculous sort of tongue-in-cheek absurd lyrics you've got to bring these people in and also give them something to gawk at because if you're not then they're just simply enjoying your music and even though this is the worst song on the album by far and I'm very happy that it's at the end of the LP as opposed to in the middle of it there are other terrible tracks on this LP - like the song cool it down with Amber Kaufman singing on the hook a song that with its light rat be in its acoustic guitar sample on the song it feels like I'm listening to a whitey Ford sings the blues' song to go back to the song time I feel sort of the same there as well except there's a banjo in the background of all things it's actually maybe a little bit more like that terrible collaborative track that Nelly came out with years ago with Tim McGraw oh it's not musically identical but it is similarly corny and really horrific blend of genres and then their songs on here where whether they're jokes serious I can't quite figure it out I'm just shaking my head at them like maybe you love me a song that just doesn't have that riff-raff flavor to it it's a generic radio pop hit with a chorus that has very little bearings on on anything that riffraff is saying in the verses to the track you could plug any rapper to this song and it would work just as well which is why it's so disappointing to hear it on a riff raff album because he's nothing if not weirdly unique and songs like this just failed to live up to that reputation there are a handful of songs on this thing that I think are great like the intro to this LP which is absolutely perfect except for what sounds like some surfer dudes riff Raff's versus his bars are insanely hilarious and the beat on this track sounds like something out of nwaz Straight Outta Compton then after this you get the crux of this album those trap bangers with those riff raff isms in the lyrics wetter than tsunami how to be the man aqua very dolphin tiptoeing in my Jones amazing tracks off of this LP some of riff Raff's best material yet in this style really what riffraff does best period what we know him for and yet he does it so seldomly on this LP it's just disappointing that there are more tracks like this in the track listing but if there's anything I can rely on riff raff for into the future I'm sure that he will keep me gawking and he will keep me guessing I'm feeling a strong 5 on this LP transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next riff raff neon icon forever 
FihAfj0FALk,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and right here ghost stories is the sixth full-length LP from famed pop rock alternative rock outfit Coldplay in the independent music gangs that that I run with Coldplay tends to get a lot of hate and on numerous occasions I have come to their defense in the case of Records like X&Y and Viva la Vida I happen to think these LPS have some very good songs on them and some very illustrious beautiful production but for a rock band Coldplay has very little in the way of grit urgency which is something I usually like in my rock music but if at least you can write something that's beautiful or just genuinely gorgeous and moving I could vibe with it but I don't really think Coldplay's tendency to do that has translated onto their two latest records even though I do think these new albums do sit in unique positions for Coldplay stylistically their last full length LP Mahal was easily their most poppy and sugary released to date whereas ghost stories to me is their dreamiest their sleepiest their most low-key album I also think this LP is where Coldplay is sounding the most like some of their most obvious influences like Radiohead and sigur rós take the opening moments on the song magic which has this very simple kick drum snare pattern with a guitar rhythm guitar playing in three over this 4/4 beat totally sounds like something Thom Yorke would just come soaring in on with his little falsetto I think Coldplay has been on kind of a Radiohead kick lately especially considering that the track atlas that they landed on the new Hunger Games soundtrack also sounded kind of Radiohead inspired I would actually even go as far as to say the song midnight off of this LP sounds a little bit like one of the closing tracks on the new boney vert record a track that sees these really eerie ice-cold lead vocals singing with an odd off-putting chorus effect throughout the song over very ethereal soft instrumentation the track eventually builds into a very subtle 4/4 kick drum it is nose prai's that this song has some production on it from John Hopkins a great electronic music producer from the UK who has collaborated with Coldplay on a few occasions he has a stellar record titled immunity that you should definitely check out but this collaboration with John Hopkins and this driving 4/4 rhythm is just an ominous sign of what's to come later on this LP when Coldplay collaborates with none other than Avicii on one of the final tracks of this album and it's a song that unfortunately I don't think Coldplay really comes out the victor it feels like they just bring on Avicii in order to facilitate in order to embrace all of these incredibly cliche EDM formulas and it just ends up feeling like a really obvious attempt at hopping on a trend Coldplay even simplifies and dumbs down their lyrics to the lowest level on this track in order just to make them fit into the preconceived EDM blueprint there are actually quite a few moments on this LP though where I really enjoy the guitar or the vocal melody like off the track magic and then there's the song true love and I can't really put my finger on it either it's the vocal melody or it's the chord progression totally reminds me of one of the softer more psychedelic Beatles tracks off of their late era stuff like White Album or Abbey Road but instead the song is delivered with more serene epic instrumentation really lavish strings so I do really like some of the tunes that are the foundation to these tracks but instrumentally sonically so many of these songs are absolutely sterile kind of lifeless especially with the big embrace of electronic beats on this record which I mean I'm totally fine with electronic music if you go down the road of finding and crafting some interesting sounds but so many of the rhythms on this thing or just bland and uninteresting especially the ones like on the track Inc which I am pretty sure Timbaland must have had a hand in it sounds like a rhythm he was about to use for something else and it just landed on this Coldplay track but again the sterility of the sounds on this record it feels like every member of Coldplay had their instruments locked into this bacteria-free laboratory and they were just wiped down and cleaned and then in order to play and perform on this record every member had to go through a decontamination chamber get gassed go into the room all the people behind the board's wearing hazmat suits to make sure not a single germ made it onto the record I like that the whole LP feels like a really holistic experience with one track just slipping softly into another this album to me feels like Coldplay really paid attention to the flow of this thing much more than they did on their last record however I also think maybe these tracks are blending together so well because the entire album is slightly uneventful they're just some moments on this LP they're just straight they're just straight boring even the songs that I like feel that way to a slight very slight degree and instrumentally there are songs on here that just make me cringe like the track ink lyrically is this song about a metaphor having to do with the pain of loving someone but also getting a tattoo possibly maybe getting a tattoo of someone's name or a tattoo for someone please educate me but whenever I was reading into the lyrics of these songs I wasn't really enjoying them especially this one finishing line where Chris Martin is saying hey I wish you were here I wish we were with each other watching TV I don't know if the lyrics on this record are in tribute to some kind of major personal loss they most definitely could be and and if they are they reflect these pains and these life events in the most mundane of ways to me this LP is just bland overly tenderized adult contemporary pop ballads with a new-age twist and and that's about it I'm feeling a decent of strong 4 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Coldplay ghost stories forever 
su4ZsUDJWcQ,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new clipping record clipping is a West Coast hip hop trio this is their sophomore full-length LP I broke down their debut album mid city last year it ended up being one of my favorite hip hop albums of 2013 clipping features the artistic input of Jonathan Snipes William Hudson and Davi Diggs all of whom separately had their own different musical styles and projects some of which were collaborative and dabbled in ambient music Noise music drone hip hop but in clipping they have found common ground for all of these musical styles producing hip hop instrumentals that are harsh abrasive and loaded with unusual samples but lyrically clipping came off as being incredibly influenced by the violence and the hedonism in gangsta rap dahveed's lyrics simultaneously showed a high level of self-awareness like he wasn't really wholly embracing or endorsing this lifestyle more just going for a gritty portrayal of it in his rhymes and in his delivery I think Dobby comes through with a high amount of personality sometimes the speed at which he raps is really impressive and together with Jonathan William he can pull together songs that are either incredibly catchy like bout that or on the flip side something much more cerebral and vivid in terms of storytelling like the song story after the release of mid-city it didn't take clipping too long to sign with Sub Pop Records and now I'm just kind of sitting here waiting to see if they can recreate that noise hop magic that they were able to on their debut LP and I I think they do clipping brings new sounds and experiments to the table and simultaneously makes a record that I think is a little deeper a little more accessible like with the song work work lead single from this LP and features all these bouncy metallic samples that are just springing throughout the entirety of this track it's a really odd sound for a hip hop song but simultaneously I think the song features one of the darker and more catchy bass lines on this entire LP a really nice head bobbing groove this track instrumentally to me is this catchy as any new beat from DJ mustard and obviously pulls a bit of in fluence from the whole Atlanta snap revival trend going on right now then there's tracks on here like dominoes which very bravely works in a children's chorus sample and a really nice piano line it's a risk that pays off big time especially with an interesting verse on this track that features what seems like a vivid lyrical portrayal of a schoolyard or throw down then there's the track get up on this thing which features an amazingly creative ingenious sample of an alarm clock going off really not only taking the sound of the alarm clock but also borrowing the tempo of the alarm clock for the background of the verse and sounds really simple really skeletal of course you're not hearing anything else other than this alarm clock but as it works into the course you get this amazingly sung hook from Mariel Checotah and underneath her voice this alarm clock gets harmonized with other alarm clock sounds and all of a sudden becomes panoramic and wide reverb heavy and epic and this track is a part of a really interesting progression in the middle of this album that starts with the song tonight then goes into the song dream and then get up and then the track or die then there's also the track at the end of this album titled ends and there's a really awesome fire you just explosive fast flowing intro that kicks off this entire LP it's very clear that clipping paid close attention to the flow and the feel of these songs as they segwayed into one another of all the catch your tracks on this LP the most glaring flaw is actually in the song tonight though which features this ridiculous auto-tune chorus from Davi where it's actually the the throat enos of his singing on this track that makes his performance sound so kind of silly there's a weird bee changeup that comes in the middle of this track too that's sort of unexpected and gangsta move three 6 mafia actually features on this track who was actually my most anticipated feature of this entire LP but sadly she didn't end up being my favorite not that her verse is terrible or anything like that I would say overall none of the features on here absolutely mind-blowing however in the greater scheme of this LP what they bringing to the table just makes sense juice king tea cocked pistol Cree gangsta boo a lot of these people are really seasoned long time underground vets that even though clipping isn't making true-blue gangster rap it very clearly shows that they pay attention and kind of know their so not only does that sort of bring a bit of credibility to these tracks but I think it also brings balance to what dahveed is doing lyrically and flow wise as well which is typically very detailed and flashy now even though there are catch of your tracks on this LP there's another side to this album as well that gets much more dark demented and experimental like the song Body and Blood which essentially brings new meaning to the phrase industrial hip hop where you've got these heavy thudding distorted kick drums that are just doing the song is loaded with all these sexual phrases that you would typically hear in a more popular radio friendly hip hop song but the track is actually about a type of black widow seductress woman who lures men to kill them and disassemble them brutally and then there's tracks on here like inside out which sort of is this funny tongue-in-cheek nonchalant portrayal of violence in the streets happening around everyday life and it sort of points out the absurdity of how weird it is that this is sort of becoming an everyday thing a lot of these street violence themes are also addressed on a much catchy or beat on the song summertime there's the song Story 2 which is the epic sequel to story off of Mid City which follows the very dark tale of an entirely different character who seems to be getting over a kind of a dark past where he was a bit of a serial arsonist but on this track maybe because he tells somebody in confidence who was very close to him karma makes sure that he suffers the same fate that many of his victims did then there's the song ends which not only is toward the end of this LP but also talks about the ends of stories in the middles of stories and the ends of lives it's this track and others on here too where you get da be diving pretty deeply into a lyrical theme that he follows very passionately from the beginning to the end of a song and I would actually say conceptuality the themes that play into each individual song offer this LP and this LP as whole is maybe one of this records biggest selling points and then the entire LP ends off with Williams mix which is a bit of an odd noise piece that takes sounds and samples from all of the songs previous to it and just delivers them in this really overwhelming relentless jumble and it's pretty appropriate finish overall I love this thing I'm incredibly impressed with it and I think these guys top what they did on mid-city I think this is an incredibly creative hip-hop album probably the most creative hip-hop album I'm gonna hear this year and not only is this LP incredibly experimental but I think it's good and it's technical and it is skilled and shows talent by the traditional standards that we judge hip-hop for the most part that is the one thing that I think clipping does very well in comparison with all the other experimental hip-hop artists out there right now I think it's amazing that they're able to come through with a record that is so standard and yet so unorthodox the instrumentals on this LP overall are disorienting they're strange they're perplexing and at times especially on tracks like dominoes beautiful moving gorgeous and rich I'm feeling a decent two strong nine on this LP transition if you given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana clipping

CwMpxT3587A,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question from me to you recently I had been thinking with my mind about technology and music about how they impact one another more so technology music but I was thinking about something I used to do when I was younger and I used to buy cassettes and I used to buy CDs and I used to buy records I mean I still buy records but I was first doing these things whenever I was curious about an artist who had kind of a track record was sort of popular and I was looking to get into this artists work one of the avenues to do so was to buy a compilation a mix as it were of songs on some kind of physical medium that were pretty much this artists best hits fan favorites so on and so forth and the first compilation on record I ever bought was a copy of Ramones mania and I have the proof right here this compilation was a pretty decent span of some of the best and most popular songs from the Ramones career however I haven't listened to this compilation in years and I haven't really bought a compilation in years and it's got me kind of wondering whether or not compilations are sort of useless at this point right now our computers and our phones have become our windows primarily to the music world and chances are if there's an artist out there who's gained any sort of traction in the public consciousness whether it be through hits or albums they have a lot of critical or cult acclaim or you can just search for this artist on the internet and hear some of their best tracks for free be it on YouTube legally or illegally there are some people it's still pirate music but of course there's tons of streaming services as well like Spotify and Pandora and so on and so forth now of course I know and I understand that there are artists out there who have really held out on allowing their music to be broadcast for free on the internet I'm not here to sort of attack their philosophy or question their motives but I'm here to ask if you think these Greatest Hits compilations really don't serve a purpose anymore I mean for me they did two things one introduced you to some of the best music from an artist whose music was really only readily available to you through a physical medium the internet kind of solves that just by allowing us to go on it and listen to pretty much every song that's ever been written recorded it's just convenience and - I suppose compilations serve a purpose if maybe you owned a bunch of music from a particular artist at one point and you want to try to I guess recapture that or just kind of get the best stuff all in one group and even the Internet addresses that desire to some degree so if hit compilations pretty much gone out to pasture at this point well kids who are ten twelve six now be seeing these four artists that we're listening to today that are popular at this very moment like 10 to 15 years down the line or is this practice pretty much just going to completely die out even in digital format the best hits from Arcade Fire if you really want to hear any of those songs go onto YouTube go on to any music streaming platform and then from there based off of what songs you like by the record that they come off of if we're even buying music 20 years from now so let me know what you think best of hit compilations totally pointless at this point transition question question question question ask questions forever

k53xc1uVMXM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new self-titled I hate god record this is the comeback album from New Orleans metal outfit I hate God their first studio full-length LP of brand new material in 14 years the band left us on a very gruesome note back in the year 2000 with the LP Confederacy of ruined lives which was a pretty typical record for I hate God heavy noisy abrasive disgusting and I hate God we're not the only metal group in the 90s pumping out these heavy sludgy aggressive riffs there was neurosis of course there was down in crowbar of which I hate God member Jimmy Bower also plays in there's also The Melvins but I hate God was easily one of the most stomach-churning of these groups their music just had a reputation for being more savage more grating heavy distorted guitars primal drums that had a nice punch to him really gross Friday vocals from longtime frontman Mike Williams and then there was the occasional bluesy guitar riff working it into the bands very sludgy brand of mayhem as well and even though the Blues most likely was a musical influence on I hate God directly considering that they were from New Orleans a lot of the blues elements that turn up in the band's music for the most part comes off a lot of the time like Black Sabbath Tony Iommi worship speaking strictly in sludge metal terms I hate God was pretty much on the polar opposite of the finesse scale from a band like Isis back when they were releasing a steady stream of LPS I hate God didn't have much to offer the world in terms of evolution and experimentation but they had the punch you in your face a tude of five bands in their genre so now I hate God is back with this new self-titled record and after 14 years and I'm sure it definitely helped that a lot of the members of the band were still active in other groups but after 14 years their sound is feeling pretty unchanged they are working with a noticeably clearer production sound on this LP but for the most part the guitar tone the drums it feels like all their instrumentation was locked in a room their amps stored away untouched in some studio somewhere and then they just returned to play and it's just all the same because it wasn't touched like I said earlier there are some slight but noticeable changes though I think the vocals are a bit nastier I think the guitar riffs are a little stiffer and the clarity of the recording on this LP maybe puts the band that a level of sonic cleanliness that they didn't really need in a way I think it kind of subtracts from the impact of a band whose style is all impact because at this point I mean you know honestly I hate God is not writing some of the most original riffs in sludge especially in an age when we have people experimenting with the genre so boldly with noise such as bands like Indian and stone Titan and Lord mantis of course crowbar and down are still active there's also groups with flashy er playing and heavier recordings than this like Mastodon and high on fire however I still think there's room in sludge for keeping the genre keeping new records in the genre close to the roots and just keeping things disgusting keeping things straight forward keeping things visceral and that's exactly what the band does from the opening track on this thing agitation propaganda a song that takes these heavy sludgy guitars and pushes them into a punk tempo not a novel song but hard-hitting at least however I think the band goes straight from ruthless to toothless on the very next song with all these staccato guitar riffs that really have no thrill to them whatsoever it's just so tedious listening to the band hammer through these riffs I think the same thing happens on the track framed to the wall in the second half of that song which is kind of disappointing considering it starts off as one of the fastest and most explosive songs on the entire record but there are songs on this record that I think are legitimately crushing toward the back end of this LP where I think more than ever on the rest of this album I hate God is truly sounding like their old selves especially with the second-to-last track here which gets incredibly heavy and doomy especially with this wall of blaring guitars on the tail end of the track just so massive but some of my favorite and what I think the most memorable parts of this LP are are when I hate God are kind of at their blues iasts there's the song quitters offensive which to me sounds like Led Zeppelin on cocaine and meth for a decade adding to its rap sheet every year that goes by and in the process you get one of those really disgusting mug shot progressions where okay Physical Graffiti is the first one and this is the last one there's also the song nobody told me which has these beautiful harmonized guitars in the middle of the track which is a really nice change of pace from the the relentless sludge throughout the rest of the album and there's the track worthless rescue to where I hate God actually pulls out I think some of the sweetest guitar leads on the entire album I hate God's incorporation of leads and melodies like this it's it's good but I do have my slight reservations about it because I think they tend to approach them with so much aggression that they suck the soul out of them a little bit like they really took these melodies and they just seared them on a hot coal grill for 24 hours till they were just like burnt to a crisp I think it's really admirable that I hate God was able to come back with a sound that is so true to their past shovel records I mean it's it's very clear that I hate God cares about their sound but maybe at this point in their return the the joints are not completely fluid and moving yet because despite the volume of this LP they're just so many spots where I think that the animalistic nature of the band doesn't really translate into the listening experience because there are quite a few riffs on this record that either grow stale over time as they are repeated through these tracks or just aren't even interesting to begin with I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given Recker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh I hate God forever 
VFBMewMCCxQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and this is the latest full-length LP from New York Bay singer-songwriter Sharon man and are we there this is Sharon's latest full-length album yusin's breaking out in 2009 with her album epic on bada-bing records and even though Sharon has brought on a lot of instrumentation and guest musicians and producers since her early days of lo-fi just her and her zeal just self recorded tapes there's been a lot of change but Sharon's foundational songwriting style has been pretty unwavering slow dramatic indie rock and folk tunes where Sharon's voice really just steals the show takes the reigns in modern singer-songwriter dumb Sharon is one of my favorite voices and for whatever reason on this LP much more than on her previous - she's reminding me a lot more of Joni Mitchell in a good way unlike some other singer song writers out there Sharon's music isn't really catchy or upbeat or hooky I would actually even say this is her least catchy album yes it's coming out with epic are we there really demands patience and takes its time it is a slow burner it is the slow burner of slow burners not only because a lot of the songs here work at a very slow or mid pace but it's also because of how elongated a lot of the instrumentation on this record is nothing really punctuated s' these songs in a really rhythmic way everything just seems to be droning on and moving very glacially and wringing out and I would not call this record do me or shoegaze or experimental like that but the the the layered and very instrumentation does set a very gloomy tone to me it's like I'm listening to a national record I would actually recommend this album to somebody who was a fan of the national I think the instrumentation is a little bit brighter and personally I find the singing to be much more engaging mostly because I find Sharon's voice to be so powerful so emotive so passionate now this very slow songwriting style is something that Sharon has been honing for years now however I am NOT as drawn to it as I am her melody writing her song writing her lyrics and her vocals the slow instrumentation on this record I think works in Sharon's favor a lot of tracks here like Taking Chances it's also one of the few tracks on this LP where Sharon takes keyboards and drum machines and really puts them at the forefront of the song sounding like Beach House occasionally and I really feel like this track and in others on here is really an attempt at changing up share and sonic palette a bit but despite this change this little bit of window dressing Sharon's songwriting style pretty much remains and she delivers one of the most emotionally crushing choruses on this entire LP I not only love just how heavy the drums are at this point in the song how wonderful Sharon's singing is at this point in the song but I love the rhythm and guitar on this track to just really crunchy cutting through all the instrumentation just skipping on the groove in the song your love is killing me moves that this really glacial three four time signature at least that's how I read it and it's like galloping in slow motion as Sharon calls out in her lyrics all these ways that she could be prevented from chasing after this person whose love is essentially killing her just have her legs broken so that she can run after this person extreme but Sharon delivers these lyrics beautifully and with a lot of heart and again that very powerful voice the closing track on here let's loose a little bit lyrically Sharon talking about how people are accusing her of being a one-hit wonder she's doing dishes she's in someone's bathroom it's got one of the sweeter choruses on the LP it's just really warm it's really rootsy it really does paint that picture of the Sun coming up but then Sharon about being in trouble on this chorus as well can't let things get too warm after remind people that they're kind of Jerry too I suppose there's a good handful of tracks on this LP that I really love for their slow pace for their moody attitude but all too often I think the instrumentation on this record because of its a very slow pace and because of how the guitar is the keys etc drones on rather than hitting a really strong rhythm the record sounds kind of syrupy formless kind of undefined there are at least a few tracks on here where I think the instrumentation turns into this flavorless mass that masks the song more than it does enhance it songs like you know me well and break me tracks to have great vocal melodies and good choruses but man does the instrumentation just get mundane and the verses are just completely unmemorable to me and I feel the same way about the opening track on here to a degree as well tracks like nothing will change become a welcome change of pace instrumentally not just because there are some really nice woodwinds on this track but because the instrumentation overall isn't so heavy it's not so overbearing it's not droning me into semi boredom and as a result just the overall tone of the song and Sharons vocals too are really soft they're gentle they're intimate they seduce me musically the track tarrif on here is great for a lot of the same reasons but features horns rather than woodwinds however not every stripped-back moment on this record is a total winner for one there are two piano ballads on here which completely stunned me in that they aren't two of the more gripping songs on the record considering that Sharon really built a name for herself on just her vocals and her guitar overall I liked this record but once again I didn't love it I'm still sticking with Sharon I'm still looking forward to what she's doing in the future considering that still even on this LP she delivers at least a handful of songs that I think are fantastic that I love easily taking chances is one of her best songs and one of the better songs of this year but still I think she allows her instrumentation to either get the best of her by covering her up or just not being that interesting of foundation of course there are tracks on here where the instrumentation feels well arranged but there are so many spots here where it feels really too bland to be all that gripping I'm feeling a strong six on this record transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Sharon Van Etten forever 
A46QN81TRQc,oh whoa hey everyone hi hi hey hey hi hi hey hi Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new own palette record in conflict Owen Pallett is a singer a songwriter a composer a violinist really a multi-instrumentalist and a ranger and for years he has lain lush instrumentation into the tracks of the indie elite like Arcade Fire and grizzly bear and Jim Guthrie and Titus Andronicus had up in the National and Taylor Swift and Linkin Park Owen has collaborated a lot but his music whether it be under his own name or Final Fantasy has an essence of its own Owens music takes a very dramatic tender and theatrical approach to immaculately layered chamber pop instrumentally his approach is usually more refined and beautiful than it is catchy bubblegum or immediate for sure Owen does not come off as straightforward as other chamber pop other baroque pop artists out there like Kishi Bashi or Andrew Bird or Sufjan Stevens to me Owen Pallett records like Heartland take a much more musical theater approach to the writing and the presentation of the melody of the lyrics the string arrangements don't really have any snap or pop to them a lot of the time they're just very softly and gently adding drama to the singing and the storyline Owens tracks in my head whenever I listen to an Owen Pallett song I see a bunch of people on stage under spotlights in Victorian dress all singing in unison and working at these sort of lay miserably choreographed dance moves even though there are tracks on here like on a path and I'm not afraid which to me are oh in as usual instrumentally his vocals feel kind of distant there's a splash of reverb there in front of him it seems like there's a pit orchestra of stringed instrument ation oh and multi-tracks his vocals and creates vocal harmonies he makes use of horns as well it's a very intricate assembly of instrumentation but the builds the crescendos in these tracks they're very gentle the very subtle they're very soft and despite some of the electronic elements woven into these tracks it all feels very organic still despite continuing a lot of these familiar characteristics Owen Pallett tries to write some of his most straightforward material yet on this thing like the title track on here which has this really strong constant groovy bassline a drumbeat I've never heard an Owen Pallett song that is so groove intensive there's all these swirling synth arpeggios working to the song as well just this more constant rhythmic instrumentation in the background really picks up the mood of Owens music and just because this is playing a larger role doesn't mean that the strings are really taking a backseat because he really has a lot of strange experimental flourishes and embellishments of strings throughout the track Owen continues this straightforward streak on tracks like the secret seven and song four five and six or the song coral which has these clicking twittering little bits of rhythm in the right channel of the track just making such a quiet sound the horn sections on this track are just sweeping to me Owens music is sounding more textured it's sounding more punctuated than ever I really admire the risks that he's taking with instrumentation on this record and I think it's leading to a lot of positive results especially on a track like riverbed which is the one track on this LP that is incredibly loud and I think Owens the loudest track yet man is this song crushing in a sense with these wailing screaming violin leads there's a heavy kick drum on this track a really strong snare I just love the melody of this song the melody that the strings are playing and the melody that own is singing as well isn't too bad either but his vocals are continually not the most gripping thing in these songs I will get into that in a second but I want to say that I've never been so smitten with an own palette release instrumentally and yes even though Owens music does usually have beautiful strings in it at some point I think his tracks for four years have lacked the snap of the artists he usually does arrangements for so it's nice to hear faster tracks tracks with bigger synth accompaniment tracks with heavier beats songs that are just more lively in instrumental tone but to me Owens biggest Achilles heel throughout all of his discography kind of remains and that is his voice I don't think he's the worst singer in the world he certainly is great at writing vocal melodies that stand out past whatever the instrumentation behind him is doing melodically he does have kind of a flimsy falsetto but his voice rarely if ever strains mostly because I think he's really good about not writing himself out of his range I guess my main issue with Owens singing is that he's not the most passionate singer he doesn't have the most emotional power out there he doesn't really bring a lot of conviction to the table in my opinion to me the emotional tone in his vocals on a song like riverbed isn't all too different from the delivery that he uses on a slow tender song on here like the passions where Owen is telling what sounds like kind of a seduction story so yeah I do think Owens singing style can get a little mundane at points and can get drowned out by the instrumentation that he arranges and performs but at least the songs are written well the instrumentation is produced well the way the instrumentation is is arranged is fantastic for the most part I'm really liking this album I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana Owen Pallett

CvqtFg4CDLc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new trash talk record no peace him I drink your swag I drink it up trash talk is a West Coast hardcore punk band this is their latest full-length LP and they have had a pretty steady stream of full-length albums and EPS ever since they formed in the mid-2000s a lot of the time releasing these projects through what I imagine is their label trash talk collective occasionally on a release here and they're releasing something in tandem with another label but the most recent deal that they have inked believe it or not has been with Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all that Odd Future with them trash talk has released their last full-length LP this full-length LP and this relationship is not just business it is artistic as well with trash talk collaborating with Odd Future performing with them live and truthfully it makes me glad to see new groups out there sort of working to create this cultural crossover between the hardcore underground of rock music and hip hop not that there weren't already groups in the past like body count but trash talk and odd future should at least be congratulated for continuing this tradition for the most part in my opinion the cultural boundaries between all of these genres are for the most part arbitrary there's no reason that people can't be slipping through each one of them at their leisure and enjoying them all plus I really love that recent collab track these guys put out with Flatbush zombies all in all trash talk definitely seems like one of the more well-connected groups and hardcore music out there right now but as far as modern hardcore music goes to me it doesn't get more inconspicuous than this new record the most surprising things about this LP were the intro and outro traction The Alchemist and the two features from King cruel and wiki of Rat King when it comes to straight-up Punk tracks there isn't much about trash-talks muddy guitar tone and sort of muffled lead and gang vocals that brings anything distinct or memorable to the table never mind original or refreshing trash-talk is way too far away from breaching that border to even consider it I could at least say that the recording quality of the first releases I heard from these guys like Cydia and is now as well as that awake EP that came out on true Panther sounds back in 2011 at least the production there was brighter it was heavier it was more overpowering but listening to deep cuts on this record like bodies tougher this song to me not only has just a forgettable riff but the recording quality of the track and just the performance of the song I feel like I'm listening to a demo from a band with a tenth of trash-talks experience there are tracks like locked in skin as well where I really feel like the the muddiness of the vocals kind of kills the track and then their tracks on here that I actually hear the vocals like leach but I kind of cringe at the lyrics I mean I get the sentiment of the song talking about somebody who is leaching from you or someone who is a bit of a poisonous person who you want away from you but this story is just put so plainly and so witless Lee that there's really nothing there for me to connect to the experience that the lyrics describe there are tracks on here that are decent like SOS one of the catchy ER songs on here some really nice guitar leads on this track too as well as the whole one of the lead single type tracks from this album where the guitar riff on this thing rides a kind of weird groove leaving a lot of space in the very fast aggressive riff and I feel like because of that unintentionally the vocals read a little bit better which makes me connect to their ferocity so much easier however this winning streak doesn't really keep up on the rest of the LP for the most part I get songs that I feel like they're not that bad but they're not that fantastic either I definitely give it to trash-talk for coming with ferocity and energy they just don't have Tunes or personality in their corner on this LP to me this record is middle-of-the-road hardcore it's hardcore for the sake of hardcore and that's really it to me this LP is kind of homogenous it's it's flavorless it's more stereotypical for the genre than it is exciting fionna life 5 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it trash talk no peace forever 
RQIuDXJTGbc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd cow I'm trying to lose some weight so this video is going to be low cow fighting and it's time for a review of the new self-titled full album from pink guy pink guy is the alter ego of youtuber George Miller aka filthy Frank you may know his material from the disaster music YouTube channel believe it or not he started the Harlem shake craze that was so popular early last year and if you're not really familiar with his material outside of that video typically he specializes in a lot of very absurd racy offensive ridiculous humor the type of stuff that you would only find on the darkest deepest most disgusting corners of the Internet where the people who are typically saying this stuff are hidden behind a veil of anonymity so that it can't be tracked back to them and given that I'm pretty familiar with Frank's style of humor so far I have to say going into this LP I got pretty much what I expected a lot of low budget beats and ukulele tunes set to humor that's so cheap Walmart can't even price match it but still is the humor cheap and disgusting enough on this record because I think personally my biggest disappointment on this LP is that I did not walk away from it offended enough and my greatest fear is that there are people walking the planet right now listening to this album and walking away from it completely unoffending how many balls were licked on this album how many nipples were rubbed like a dozen each tops honestly I don't even think anyone died to make this record there's nothing on this LP that I heard that would get filthy Frank sentenced to life in prison in a court of law then there's sexism which there was definitely not enough of on this LP yeah sure there are sexism toward women on this album but I think Frank could have done more to offend every single gender type and sexual orientation out there where was the full frontal nudity we was the bestiality also I thought the production Kanye brought to the table on the cell P was really weak I mean some of his worst beats ever the 30 Rick Ross features on this album as well I mean while they weren't bad I was kind of disappointed to hear Ross rapping better than pink guy on a lot of these tracks out of all the features on this record I think the only one that really resonated with me was the Beyonce feature because I mean her singing on pink guys cover of fuck the police was actually quite moving and there were other tracks on here that to me just sort of fell short of their real potential like the song peanut butter which is about having peanut butter placed on your balls that a dog can lick it off but if you've ever done that sort of thing you know cashew butter works better there's the song it's okay to eat a whale which I mean we all know just from that title alone that there are way more things that are okay to eat even the song kill yourself after listening to it 67 times I didn't want to kill myself I just came away from this thing just not feeling like there's enough poop and pee on it there's enough poop and pee and hate and poop and pee pee and whiz while it's not a really bad LP overall and pink guy definitely has a style that when you hear you're gonna know it's it's is it's his definitive style what I was ultimately disappointed by was just how little I hated myself after listening to this record I didn't even feel like I needed to take a shower I'm just worried that people are going to listen to this LP and not question whether or not they want to live on this world anymore because of just how horrifically gross it is and it just didn't happen after this album was over I just just felt completely normal you know I think anybody who likes this record is essentially let me know what you think Tran

to give a shout out to local artists over here local Connecticut artist Daphne Lee Martin if you're on the lookout for some singer/songwriter stuff some folk music vibes then look up this record it is Frost I believe this is her latest full-length LP or she's just about to drop another one but I think she put this one out last year if I'm not mistaken so Daphne Lee Martin I will put a link to her music down there in the description box she actually runs a record store in the Connecticut area called The Telegraph and she passed me that that record of hers so wanted to give her a shootie alright moving along let's go into whoo a very heavy recent edition a lot of metal a lot of jazz in this one in this vinyl update so you know for those of you who are into that sort of thing get excited boom electric wizards dope throne listen if you're not a Satanist and you're not a bong smoker don't be like me and as soon that because the devil is smoking a bond on the front of this record that it's not necessarily for you the riffs on this thing are awesome the production is heavy it's just distorted it's just thick its massive the vocals are just so that they're distorted as well and just just have a really aggressive tone to them and the grooves man heavy slow monolithic grooves on this record are great you know if you're in the mood for some really heavy massive doom metal then do look into this LP and we have a lyrics here as well we hate you great fantastic song title and I love the um you know obviously with the cover we have kind of a shiny finish on the cover and I love the labeling on the record itself how we kind of have like the silver labeling on the LP itself it's a double LP it's a double LP and I already showed you guys the gatefold you all know how I just you know love a good gate fold mail the the very um slippery black sleeves that come with this as well it's really nice finish on on everything really nice packaging with this double LP here I don't I don't know what sort of you know if that's a new pressing or an old pressing I mean I'm sure it's a more recent pressing of the record though I know the record isn't that old but there you go Electric wizard dope throne if you're looking for some doom metal look up to that and I know this is definitely a reissue but it's also some more doom metal hmm dope smoker y'all dope smoker don't actually dope smoker here dope throne hope I said okay I don't I don't want to mix those two things up the do middle fans will have my ass so sleep this is a reissue of their quintessential our long song album dope smoker reissued through Southern Lord and really nice nice beautiful I mean freakin beautiful pack on this thing I just love the figures that they put on here um you know many of you may be like no I don't you get the original or you know by the origin over really hymen you know I trust Southern Lord to come out with a good rear according of this record or you know good recording of this record and I trust them to come out with good packaging as well and I mean I this image over the original image of the of the original pressing of this album I mean this is beautiful I just love this desert mural and it opens up into a beautiful purple gay fold right there you see like a shiny moon and everything I mean they really put it all into this thing and there's some beautiful sleeves on this thing too which actually if you like look at them if you look deep into them it's like this really meticulous right out of the song dope smoker on this album you know you have sonic Titan Matt x 1 sonic Titan all times for hotel room all times for 12th solid riff Matt x 2 it's this is really meticulous right out of each riff and section of the dope smoker song which i think is a great thing to add into this into this packaging you know if you're somebody who's like really interested in the in the history of of this song of this project so you know III think sudden Lord did this project did this repress a lot of justice on this thing there's like a nice little photograph insert that comes with the record as well and and I know that as far as like the repressing color I got the black you know I know there were other colors in this repressing unfortunately I did not get a a crazy color but it's still a wonderfully thick record I actually have not put this on my my turntable yet I'm kind of waiting for a free hour to listen to this song although this record is just thick and it just is like skin-tight inside of this uh inside of this sleeve over here ah ah try not to uh put my fingerprints all over the freaking thing but there you go there you go sleep dope smoker I know some of you uh neo psyche fans are going to be going crazy over this next gatefold that I have with me oh don't don't to misplace anything pretty straightforward here animal collected strawberry jam got this in a trade I believe yes I did get this in a trade so thank you for trading with me I traded a few records that were in the collection for this I have not actually played this pressing that I have here right now though I have already I've had for a while a digital copy of this album just never had a just never had a physical LP copy of it so like I said have not played this on my turntable yet though I do like this really really strange art just uh really watery abused strawberries that look all slimy and disgusting it's a definitely unsettling to a degree lyrics right there looking nice looking wonderful yeah you know just like a really nice straightforward gatefold package shiny as you can see maybe you know with it being so white maybe I would have liked something that was like more of a matte finish or something like that but whatever it's just like a picky picky ass thing doesn't really matter sure still a great record alright next of the knife silent shout have I showed this one before I don't think I had I've had it for a little while but I hadn't gotten a chance to put it on the turntable when I first got it so I don't think I did this one in a vinyl video so yes it's not a gatefold but it does have a lot of record in there it's just a single huge sleeve and you know if you're not going to do a gatefold I do like to know that I do have room to put the records into the sleeve but I'm not going to be dragging them out and just pulling them out or ripping them or anything like that I'm surely complaining about packaging throughout this thing now I do have two sleeves here that come with a record though the records were not in the sleeves when I got it they were just kind of sitting outside of the sleeves inside of these white sleeves maybe I'm supposed to pack these white sleeves in the black sleeves I don't know maybe these black sleeves are is like optional if I really don't want to use them and I just want to keep them in good condition or something then I don't have to we have lyrics on both sides of these things and on the other side we just have silent shout written very tightly in the middle so and I love that I love the finish of these sleeves in a very beautiful texture going on right there and the records themselves I mean they play great they're a fantastic condition as they should be since they're new and you know just like a really nice straightforward black double LP right there with the knife shine a silent shout so if you're in the market for some electronic pop but with a very dark tone to it because this is definitely the the darkest project I've heard the knife put out if you're looking for some electronic pop music with a very dark moody tone to it then I would look into this record you know this record was pretty much the precedent for what Fever Ray did on her self-titled LP which was my favorite record of 2009 so if you're looking for something that does go a movie that does go down a moody road like that then I would say look into silence out next a classic for a lot of you pretty obvious pretty straightforward okay computer Radiohead why do you saw it back there a few reviews ago this was in a trade as well somebody traded me this oh my god who would trade away Oh Radiohead's okay computer somebody who didn't think it was amazing I mean maybe they just thought it was okay you know whatever a lot of people ask me and I'm just going to say here I do prefer kid a to this record just because I feel like Radiohead obviously went down bolder territory on kid a though there are some damn good songs on this thing I ice and this is definitely a point in Radiohead's career where not that I heard this on the bends or their debut album but there's definitely a pretty pretty obvious Pink Floyd influence going on on this LP whereas when Radiohead went into kin kid a you know that's a record that I could definitively say ah you know that's that's Radiohead being Radiohead and not much else in terms of this really awesome fusion of art rock and electronic music that many of us know them for a lot like what I was assuming was going on with that knife LP we do have you know sort of very colorful detailed artful sleeves that are in the record itself and packed into these colorful sleeves are just simple white sleeves that hold the album and I believe there's something like really funny cute playful on the labeling of the record itself rather than saying side a side B side D it says that eenie meenie miney and Moe as far as the sides yes it says a this is aside me and this is side Eenie so that's cute that's cute that's precious I like that sort of thing it's nice so yeah I would I would pull the records out I mean they're just standard black records you know nothing incredibly amazing about them you know they play great they sound great so you know no complaints on that end but um you know I would pull them out but these sleeves are just freakin hard to put in these other sleeves I'm not supposed to be doing that I don't know just don't get mad at me next the baby Huey story the living legend the baby Huey's story the living you let yeah I mean it's it's it's baby Huey he's a soul singer who I mean when you read the liner notes of this record which has a bunch of information on him you know you see that his rise to fame wasn't exactly uh you know well not not necessarily rise to fame but I what I mean to say is that you know he had an untimely death which is essentially what this record you know lays out in your face as soon as you open up the gatefold so and and the reason I looked into this record initially you know I didn't buy this sort of on a whim you know I knew what I was getting into is because I've had a digital copy of this record for a while after buying some songs off of it that I knew were really popular hip hop samples and looking into those tracks I found that these are really great soul tracks with great drumbeats fantastic horn sections and just a really great voice I mean baby Huey while I mean he wasn't the greatest soul singer ever to live he certainly had a lot of personality and if you are into soul music you know he's definitely worth looking into and beautiful red record right here did not even know this is red when I was getting into it so really psyched about this I just love this thing it's such a bright beautiful red it looks wonderful on the camera and it looks wonderful in front of my face so if you are interested in not only great soul but music that is is known for its sample ability in the hip-hop community then I would look into this album baby Huey living legend moving into a little bit of jazz in this next array of LPS here ah yeah not a lot to say about these other than that if you're looking to get into jazz you know these are obviously all reissues so there's nothing like particularly special about these particular pressings but if you are looking to get into jazz I highly recommend any of the LPS I'm just about to show you boom Art Blakey Jazz Messengers Monat Art Blakey one of the Great's when it comes to jazz drumming and a lot like Miles Davis Art Blakey would use the Jazz Messengers as kind of a project of his to collaborate with a slew of other artists you know he would just take on different artists with every record a lot of the time people who he saw sort of just being great at that time in jazz music or people who he saw as being sort of on the come-up and came out with some great records not only this one but caravan for example another favorite of mine with him so if you are looking to get into jazz in general you know especially this 50s 60s 70s trio quartet quintet jazz Bop so on and so forth cool then I would look into our Blakey's moanin right here especially if you want a record where you can really focus in on the drumming because of course with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers that that is one of the key components not that jazz drumming his week or on other records but I mean you know he's known for his drumming he is a fantastic drummer next I'm trying to think of another jazz drummer to recommend you that uh thinking off out the top of my head I mean that never I'm just going to keep going on next Roland Kirk's I talked with the spirits this this record of his is one of his flute records Roland Kirk was a master of numerous woodwind horn reed instruments but this is one of the moments when he really focuses in on his flute abilities and I serenade to a cuckoo is the opener on here one of the best melodies in jazz music in my opinion and he and and there are records that he's done I think he over the course of his career on LP he's done at least a few renditions of that song and this is not my favorite but it's still a great song and um yeah you know I mean he's had sax records he's had records that have a multitude of different reed instruments on them but if you specifically want to listen to his flute stuff I would recommend this record so Roland Kirk talked with spirits there we go and finally Sonny Rollins saxophone Colossus cool cool so you know again another very straightforward reissue pressing record is great prestige level labeling on there and the clear sleeve and you know all this stuff just sounds great on LP you know the truth is that a lot of records like this like these jazz records that were recorded in this time period you don't need a whole lot in the way of fancy packaging when you repress them because I mean the appeal of buying them on record is that they were recorded analog back in the day and that's just really how they sound best so mmm so there you go saxophone Colossus Sonny Rollins and finally I'm going to end this video with this Deerhoof record Apple oh I actually saw this band live recently over at the space in Hamden Connecticut where they played a bitchin set and just bought this copy of this record I believe for 10 bucks you know I mean always brings money to shows to support the artists that you love so that you know you can just give them some money for a record that you can probably buy cheaper from them then you can online or in a store anywhere else we have lyrics obviously on the other side of that insert that came with a bit of interesting strange art and you know if you're looking for indie rock and indie pop with a really quirky idiosyncratic edge then I would get into Deerhoof and it's a really strong guitar and drum playing to I mean you know that's the thing about deer if there are a lot of indie pop and indie rock bands out there but they are strong players especially their lead guitarist and especially their drummer Greg just fantastic players and they're really tight playing together too and it's really off the wall and this record is blue so wonderful blue shiny color which you can actually kind of see the camera in it right now and oh yeah you know that's it that's it for this week's vinyl update so what records have you bought that recently made it into your record collection again thank you to those who have traded me some stuff so that I could feature it in this vinyl video and hopefully I will have more records for you soon to talk about and show you that have made it into this collection hopefully you get some interesting recommendations for stuff based off of what I have just placed into the record collection yeah that's it transition you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best I love you forever 
7BByISrInfI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new roots record and you shoot your cousin the roots fantastic philadelphia-based hip-hop outfit been at it for years you may also currently know them as the house band for the Jimmy Fallon show but before that prior to that they came out with many classics hip hop classics like this record over here Things Fall Apart Game Theory's gray do you want more organics if you love hip hop if you love live instrumentation if you love jazz rap if you love hardcore hip hop if you love gritty lyricism then do get into the roots music however with this latest strain of albums that they've been coming out with inside projects and collaborations and experiments their trajectory has been a little turbulent a lot of surprises coming down the pipe from the roots don't really know totally what to expect from them these days and it's made some of their more recent records kind of exciting to look forward to but I'm not gonna be taking on this new roots album by myself I'm actually gonna be talking about it with Joel of the daily guru this album is about to change transition and here we are through the power of the internet with Joel aka the daily guru like I said we're gonna be talking about this new roots record Joel lots on the record Wow um you know I will say that first off I wasn't a huge fan of the last record when it dropped one-and-done came out and when I heard the single that they released for this one I was even less excited about it I didn't have very high hopes and this is one of the most unique records I've heard in a long time in that I was first completely disappointed with it and now less so after 30 or 40 listenings I'm not as disappointed are actually Parts I really love about it but but only like sort of less so so it's sort of like I'm not in love with the record but I I don't it's not nearly as bad because I think this is almost to kind of jump to a summary almost I think this is the sort of record that you're gonna need to spend some serious time with before you can actually and what they're doing with it because the first two or three listens I have a feeling a lot of people write it off widget which is weird because it's so short you know expect that such a short record would not dominate so much of your time yeah and I mean especially with the roots it's almost like for them given their usual album links this is almost like an EP for them because I think it's only like 31 minutes or something which was very nice about a lot of those tracks are interludes mm-hmm and a lot of one - the one that sounds like it's almost like a door buzzer oh yeah yeah and neither tracks might hear that don't even breach that three-minute mark you know yeah yeah it was it was a bit strange because they really don't dig in a lot you know and I'm looking at it right now I have to say I didn't care for this record but still I I think it does have its unique qualities in their discography and and I think this adds up to the fact that like you said you may need to give this thing more lessons this is easily their most depressing record I think dad's record I think this is their bleakest it's dark you know one of the things I wrote down as I said it sounds like this album was created and like a burned out warehouse with like the windows blown out because it has a very almost concrete feel to it it's a very desolate record it's an album that I think draws from a lot of the same storylines and from a lot of the same emotions and from a lot of the same issues fueling a record like undone but here instead we're getting kind of a darker musical component to match this kind of storytelling you have all these seedy characters or not really necessarily seedy characters but records but characters that are turned seedy by their surroundings over time and not really seeing the way to get out of it and just sort of going along with the narrative of this place where they're being raised where they're grown up just this life that they're they're used to and you know now we're we're given so much darker and just dreary or instrumentals to to back that up for me that's a good thing I mean looking at it overall I enjoyed the music a lot more than I did any of the lyrics which again isn't that strange for the roots because they're fantastic and I also that was also because I didn't feel there was much lyrical continuity because there were so many different people showing up on the record and you know well it does have an overall loose storyline I think they were trying to do it too much and it didn't work in the end I don't know you know a lot of people have been making a big deal of this record being another concept record just like undone and undone to me is so interesting in that you kind of have this one character who you get to know in a sense in a lot of different ways you hear satyr tracks recited through the eyes of this person you hear more aggressive tracks recited through the eyes of this person so you get to know this character in a lot of ways you get to know his doings his thoughts his motivations and on top of all of that the storyline that leads to his death is played in Reverse on the album itself and while this record itself is also being tagged as this concept album I'm not really hearing it done to the impressive degree that undone was I mean for sure you know the roots deal with a lot of these same themes but they string it out among a bunch of different characters and I mean is is there a concise storyline that is played out from beginning to end not that I've picked up instead I'm just kind of getting a bunch of I don't know vignettes or just sort of just personal musings or monologues from this variety of people who were all going through this series of tribulations yeah I definitely saw this kind of monologues almost like it to me it almost struck sometimes as a pulp novel a musical pulp novel and that you know you got you got a little brief interludes or you know you got little brief views it in these people's worlds they were all similar they were all similarly dark and destitute but there really wasn't that connection between them and again I think that's where I kind of fell apart with the album lyrically because it was clear they were trying to have some cohesive theme but it just wasn't there maybe it was because they didn't dive into these characters deep enough I couldn't quite put my face on it but for whatever reason these characters to me weren't as interesting as the character that they delivered on undone but uh I think maybe the most glaring issue on this record is with the production as dreary and as bleak as it is which does give this album a unique edge with songs like tomorrow like you said which was a lead single from this LP had me incredibly just not excited for listening to this album not only because I thought the beat itself was really redundant and I thought it'd be a bit of very fake sounding reverb on raheem wantons vocals on the track was just like just like production faux pas rule number one but I mean I think lyrically the song was really underwhelming as well I mean and then the singing as well which wasn't terrible but it just felt like I don't know if it's felt like they were trying you know I kind of I I think it's a thing everybody is sort of thinking people who enjoy the roots is since they became the house band on Fallon they're playing with each other three with each other three four or five nights a week and there's really no time for that creative of that individual creativity to really kind of start again and I think maybe that's why the records just haven't been as impressive I feel like the roots haven't lost not at all their sense of adventure but you're not really getting the depth and the length they hit you with a new idea and then that new idea falls flat because they don't find out a way to actually make it stay appealing for the length of a record and even draw these ideas out past 40 minutes yeah I'm done I mean undone while it was longer than this record it was still one of the root shortest you know it wasn't the longest records and on top of all of it that album was ended with a bunch of these really weird awkward instrumentals these little instrumentals of the sounds so much better maybe just interspersed in between tracks throughout the record but instead they were all just bunched together at the finish and didn't really sound like much they just kind of sounded again kind of like this album a little bit of an epilogue of I don't know unnecessary ideas unnecessary only in the regard that I mean they're not going to become necessary until they figure out how to draw them out into something more interesting not only did tomorrow underwhelmed me but other tracks on here sort of like the coming with Mercedes Martinez which I think was the eighth track on the record a song that while it wasn't bad it was sort of an interesting little vocal and experimental piano piece yeah it's not something I usually want to hear from the roots and it's not something that I want to hear from the roots at all if they're gonna come at me with a record this sure yeah there was really only one track on the album that as a complete piece really made me say okay you know that that's a that's a cool cool song it was the song Black Rock and I just thought it came together well there to me it would have been kind of a middle middle card on a great album you know it wasn't enough to build an album around I think it was the strongest overall you know on this record and and yeah there's a good key part on it there's a good groove to it and I did find myself turning it up and playing it again here and there but overall yeah the music to me was good the lyrics I mean one of the things that's always made the roots great is that they brought fantastic orchestrations unique orchestrations doing things that nobody else would do in hip-hop they kind of done that here but the other big part was there are always great lyrics and they're just there I just didn't find the lyrics to be what I would call great anywhere on the elbow well that hasn't disappointed me what disappointed me you know specifically on a track like Black Rock which I believe is a song that has dice raw singing on the hook that hook is awful yeah that is an awful hook his singing on that hook is terrible and I have no no idea why they let him do it that's what I think my number one you know where you were talking earlier about production I think that's what comes into it is in a number of different ways you're just like they're a band who understands music better than most anyone else in there genre and and better than most people in popular music today why are they making mistakes like that that are so glaringly obvious it you know are they are they just lazy or does it come down to the fact that they're like oh you know we're gonna sell a lot of units let's just do that and it was with one of the opening tracks I'm here with Paddy crash uh-huh I know a lot of people sort of make this comparison to singers when they don't care for their voice but she really sounded like a cat to me like I was listening to like it was just not appealing it was overdone it was it was it was to present in the song it was like all hook that and that and that's another thing you know and which which I think also adds to the disappointment that people have with a lot of the roots most recent material when it comes to the rapping and the verses I mean it was it's it's really the longest song on here which i think was about five minutes long that really hits you with a series of bars I think black comes with the longest verse on the entire track dice raw comes through with like a few bars and there's a short verse toward the end of the track there's no hook on the song whatsoever it's just straightforward bars after straightforward bars and while it wasn't a bad track it just it just didn't live up to the expectations that I have for their older stuff or even their most recent stuff either you know I feel like roots have made a really interesting and for the most part successful transition into an area of their career where they're able to write more deep thought-provoking from a conceptual standpoint songs instead of simply relying on rap and rap and rap and rap and rapping and that's fine this this however I think is their first major failure on that conceptual side of the fence you know they've had their records when they were more into that hardcore hip-hop area of their career that weren't as good as others but even this record to me sits below those but but you said this record ended up like growing on you a little bit after you gave it numerous listens I mean what ended up making you kind of come around on in a little the music it you know the lyrics really like I've been saying but lyrics really never got me they never really did anything for me but musically I was finding bits and parts of the hooks where I said okay this this isn't this isn't terrible and you know some of them I was like okay actually I actually like that orchestration yeah some of that some of the piano same finding these tracks are just really pretty and just really dreary they just really hit a good spot that is where I enjoyed the record is like I said try 30 or 40 listens in when I kind of know where it's going there's that there's some really good grooves hidden in there some nice bass lines but overall I it's I guess it's what I expected after I heard the single that is just like oh that's what you're gonna advertise this record as I think I got the record I should have expected given that that was the first track that they would have handed us yeah you know and Mike the thing I kept saying to myself as I'm listening to it is are they just not hungry anymore and this is what happens when a hip-hop collective kind of for like a better term reaching middle age and kind of have it a little bit cushy so they're just kind of trying to make the music they know their audience wants I'm not saying they compromise their integrity I'm saying they know the kind of stuff their audience wants and they're just kind of giving it their best shot now I think I'm gonna leave it there score wise I'm really feeling at the most it's like a decent too strong for on this thing really I'm gonna give it a five and a half because there are one or two piano progressions that I really really like and for me to say something is more on the you know terrible side as opposed to the good side I wouldn't put this there because I do think musically it has a lot to it and maybe they can take these back to the drawing room and do some remixes ie make them better and you know we'll see we'll see like part two of this alright Joel thank you for coming on the Pantano the roots and they shoot your cousin forever 
jQfCJVAwFL8,hi everybody Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new tobacco record ultimate ooh massage this is the third full-length solo effort from multi-instrumentalist and black moth super rainbow frontman tobacco aka Tom Beck now under the name tobacco Tom has consistently put out material that doesn't sound too unlike what he already does in black moths super rainbow a band whose music is pretty video syncretic and unique but personally I find the musical the compositional component of their songs to be a little shallow at times that can depend on which black moth super rainbow album you're listening to and if you're at all bothered by a really simple melodic approach but black Mouth super rainbow sounds still is is undeniably unique I know a black moth super rainbow song when I'm hearing it I know what I'm hearing they're very trademark specific brand of electronically tinged psychedelic pop fronted with all these whisper quiet vocoder vocals and basic drum machine rhythms that are fed through this really distorted low Phi fuzzy production style along with keyboards guitars some bass it's really dirty it's grimy it's trippy purposefully aged I think black moths super rainbow takes a lot of production cues away from musical projects like Boards of Canada but I think they take that influence and do something much more fun and playful with it now like I said a lot of these same qualities that are in black moths super rainbows music they carry over into tobacco but there are some pretty strong differences for one especially with the debut tobacco record there's an overtly strong instrumental hip-hop vibe on this record however that has been fading away since tobacco first came out with that debut record and here on this new album it seems like it's completely dissipated I think ultimate to massage is the most experimental abrasive noisiest hell thing that tobacco Tom feck even in black Mouth super rainbow has put out thus far but typically fuzzy production you find on Tom's projects is much more to struck on this record some of the instrumentation on this thing literally disintegrates into Distortion just vanishes four little tiny spare seconds of time some tracks on here like blow your heart come through these early bombastic beats and there are a handful of songs on here that are very chilly and apocalyptic and depressing in tone as well and some of the more upbeat tracks on this thing are sonically dense either because of all the effects laid into these sounds or because tom is just layering more synthesizer into these tracks whether it be chords just droning in the background or arpeggios or really bright melodic leads it's like every song here is a little tiny psychedelic pill which you take and each comes with its own trip some are nightmarish and horrifying and unsettling others are very fun and sweet or calming and blissful it's like I'm being transported to a different world where everything that I assumed and thought I understood sonically is just flipped on its head everything's melting everything's neon colored and sugar-coated not only does tobacco do a better job of bringing sonic diversity onto this LP but I think he digs for more interesting sounds as well I get that sensation right from the start of this LP with the song streaker which has these unsettling screams these broken cymbals this very Spacey sort of off-kilter beat that feels like it has a very loose grip of the tempo there are these sluggish since sequences playing throughout the song they're very woozy and then to top it all off this vocoder vocal that is just so guttural and low and deep and monstrous I feel like I'm listening to a satanic transformer try to sing me a song I've never heard tobacco this twisted he is just abusing sound on this record and it's beautiful it's just enjoyably warped and there are other songs on here that fit that description as well like with the song face breakout which has these very off beat drums these lead vocals that don't really feel like they're on the tempo either and are just whispering out out out out but these really loose verses are matched with a beautiful tight and just lush instrumental chorus that has all these synth layers in it they're so blissful they're so glassy so just I just want to lick them and then there's omen classic another incredibly warped track on this LP where the vocals just swallowed and what seems like maybe a low-pass filter but there's a lot of over modulated bass on this track as well so the song just feels really thick and just reverberating and then there's a song blow your heart which feels like this fuzzy just distorted aggressive robot Punk song like I'm listening to the world as it were if our robot overlords came down and destroyed the human race but somehow in the process got into our drug stash and became addicted to psychedelics and this is what they be doing all day just making music like this and these abrasive strange hard-hitting moments are not only great but they make the sweeter more serene spots on this record really stand out because they bring a good counterpoint to it like the song creaming for beginners which feels like a mind-altering lullaby then there's 13 pools City McKnight Road and father sister Berserker two of the more compositionally ambitious tracks on this LP I think these are the two most impressively put together tobacco songs not only in just the entire record here but into that goes entire discography blackbaud super rainbow including that to the song father sisters also matched with this grand sweeping melody that plays throughout some parts of the track that reminds me a little bit of Frank Zappa speeches and regalia now there are some downsides to this LP in my opinion for one it just feels like a mixed bag of tracks a lot of these songs are very short they're kind of brief like I said they're short colorful strange trips but it is still a very good collection of these very short strange trips there are some tracks on here that have a lyrical component like eruption which is completely asinine and then there is a song or two on here like the second track on here which do run a little redundant and mundane but still having said all that I still think this is one of the more creative records I've come across this year one of the more sonically engaging and interesting records I've heard this year just so overwhelmingly colorful and noisy and fun some fun beats some fun melodies on this thing I just loved Jers Bravo to tobacco I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it my friends my needle drops Anthony Fantana tobacco's smacko forever 
fopTU6h2tjU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new valentin fire record splinters this is the sophomore full-length LP from the uk-based metal outfit valent fire they're seen as a bit of an underground supergroup considering that the band's frontman and guitarist Gregor Mackintosh played guitar in Paradise Lost band member Hamish Glen cross also played guitar in my dying bride as well as the band solstice and the band's drummer Adrian Erland sand also played in Paradise Lost as well as Cradle of Filth and many other bands too now I first came across these guys in 2011 when they dropped their full-length debut album titled a fragile King it was an album that combined the the slow and heavy sounds of doom metal with the abrasiveness of death metal sonic Lee it was a little standard for death doom but the subject matter of these tracks were really what caught my attention a lot of the tracks lyrically on this album dived into the personal suffering felt by Gregor Mackintosh after losing his father to lung cancer in 2009 and the lyrics go about addressing this addressing this pain addressing this loss in a kind of poetic way which was a pretty moving and emotional and interesting angle for a death metal record but there were a lot of very slow dreary deep cuts on this LP that just didn't really connect with me but still the performances on this record were good it seemed that the band put value on production value with just how massive and atmospheric a lot of these songs sounded and while I wasn't really familiar with Gregor singing abilities prior to the release of this record he seemed like he had the makings of becoming a really monstrous death metal vocalist and then I heard Kurt Beaulieu of converge was doing production on this thing who you may or may not know is is really probably my favorite producer right now however I did not just fall in love with the sound of this Valon fire record as fantastic as it is with all these very clear punchy pummeling drums blood cape guitars vocals sit in a really perfect spot in the mix oh that's great but it's really the fact that these guys came through with a more diverse record this time that really had me listening to this thing from beginning and end and and liking it however I'm not really sure if this change of pace is going to please death doom fans or even hardcore death metal fans people who have been following the band up until this point I mean valent fire still comes through stillbirths some really slow monolithic devilish death doom on a few tracks here they even managed to embrace a little bit of melody on these tracks but I would expect nothing less from a band related to my dying bride however mixed in with this handful of songs Vallon fire puts in some really fast paced songs to some really violent songs these guys seem to be embracing sort of a death and roll aesthetic like you would get with the bands such as entombed but I actually think going that far back isn't as accurate a comparison as a more recent band that does death and roll like black breath who Kurt Beaulieu actually did production for as well like the 1 minute and 27 second song instinct slaughter which is speedy its relentless its ferocious and heavy it's got kind of a punk attitude and doesn't sound too unlike band like nails with on silent death at least in the guitars so to some people especially hardcore death metal fans who like these various strains of the genre to not bleed into one another too much this LP might sound like kind of a mixed bag but personally for me the guitar tone does the sound of the drums and the vocals are enough to create a common thread that runs throughout all these tracks plus I'm sort of into the idea that this depressing cloud that the band was formed under on their debut album is dissipating or - sort of moving away a little bit freeing the band up to explore more aggressive material because there are certainly tracks on this LP that transition from these slow do me guitar passages to something more hardcore and overtly aggressive despite that I have to say I don't think splinters is going to be the most bold and refreshing death metal album you hear this year but I do think it brings together a very good mix of tracks that are incredibly visceral or very bleak and depressing in their slow pace and heaviness the most stunning of which is the song breath the longest track here it features all these melodic guitar leads some of which are harmonized with one another that are woven into these monolithic riffs riffs that are encased in to this buzzsaw Distortion and lyrically I'm catching a lot of the same loss and and religious themes that I was hearing on a fragile King and they still work pretty well here the title track is another example of these do mere flavours executed in a really great way and from here it just seems that the band gets faster and heavier and more aggressive but it's not like the band is playing doom and they're playing fast paced death and roll there's a bit of a gradient here and on the most intense side of this gradient these more fast paced aggressive songs can occasionally be a little hit or miss like the hyper aggressive instinct slaughter that I mentioned earlier this track and other songs on here that tend to land around the two-minute mark while Vallon fire is perfectly capable of playing this fast and playing this aggressively there's not much about the sound of their instrumentation or their riffs that really sticks out it really feels like they're just going through the motions on tracks like this even after they put them immediately after some of the slower songs on this record as if they're creating this really breakneck change by putting the slowest track here next to the fastest and shortest track when I mean really in reality it's all loud as hell and super crimey and aggressive so it's not like the the change is that great there are some more aggressive tracks on here that manage to pack in a little bit of melodic finesse though like scabs the opener on here which has this interesting little for note I believe guitar lead that really brings a somber tone to these riffs which are really slow intense and heavy at the start of the song but then the band immediately breaks into something speedier and more intense I also love the wailing guitar leads that call and respond with the vocals on the track savages arise there's a killer breakdown on the second half that I love and the band manages to bring a lot of very surprising changes and just twists and turns into this two minute and forty second one time on this track there are a lot of just riff and performance highlights throughout this album and that's because at the end of the day even if you are underwhelmed by valent fires lack of originality they are a well-greased death machine with fantastic production good songs and good riffs most of the time their approach might be a little too simple to blow anybody away especially a seasoned death metal fan but I personally value the fact that whenever I listen to this thing I'm having a pretty strong physical response to it yes at the end of the day I do really want more from this band lyrically and compositionally but I still think that if you're looking for some death metal that's gonna hit hard and be thrilling be exciting be aggressive then there's no reason not to look into this LP I'm feeling strong 6 to a light 7 on this transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantino forever 
WX1qWv05ILU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the nuke Romeo record white women these guys are a pop duo of known for their vintage Flair embracing the sounds of disco synth funk New Wave Chromeo has been doing it for over 10 years at this point in my opinion they have a few decent records under their belt or at least the very good business casual to me that record and fancy footwork are loaded with just top-notch poppy sexy sensual pop songs that have top-notch production that feels modern but also has an extreme attention to detail when capturing a lot of these old-school cues from the errors of music that they are so obviously borrowing from the lyrics on chromia records are typically very flirty they're hyper sexual they're playful they're kind of lovestruck but chromeo usually does a good job of taking these themes and presenting them in a very silly tongue-in-cheek kind of self-aware way so I never quite feel like just totally rolling my eyes of what the band is doing and typically they never really let this silliness they never let this excessiveness overshadow their talents as producers and songwriters Chromeo can pull together some killer singles bonafide lovin and don't turn the lights on and night by night which i think is the duo's best song so I went into this new Chromeo LP excited for a few different reasons one the song jealous killer single - business casual is my favorite record of their so far so you know I'm only sitting here assuming that crumby is going to continue creating a streak here and just dish out another great LP and also on top of those two things disco synth funk these vintage pop sounds they're making a bit of a comeback right now and if any group out there is deserving of sitting a top of the wave this new neo synth new ultra new disco revitalization it is Chromeo they've been putting in work this stuff however I don't think that that's going to be happening on this record I do think there are some good songs here but nothing I hear that is going to be really a cross over hit for them breaking them outside of they're already pretty passionate fan base but chromeo definitely tries I mean this for them is a pretty star-studded record they bring quite a few notable guests into the tracklist on this thing I'm just not hearing a whole lot in terms of improvement in production quality and this is some of the worst chromeo songwriting I've heard in their four album discography now for the most part the guests they bring onto the sell piece seem to do a good job I mean Toro y Moi Solange Knowles ezra from Vampire Weekend ASAP ferg for whatever reason appears in the music video for jealous and like I said with jealous Chromeo does bring a great single to the table I love the funky slap bass line the dance beats the bright scents the hard groove and the song has one of the most addictive courses of 2014 in my opinion Hackett didn't is and the Tori muah feature on come alive goes over really well another great chorus on this LP and even though I'm not really the biggest Toro fan he fits in like huh bit of into ChromeOS sound good [Music] but outside of these tracks the highlights on this record while there are good moments they tend to run a little mild not ChromeOS most fiery material the track with Solange Knowles who sings really well during her appearance on lost on the way home then there is the song old 45s which to me lyrically is kind of like ChromeOS mission statement for their entire career where essentially you have the chorus saying that if you feel like romance is dead if you feel like romance is gone find an old jukebox with old 45s pop and nickel into it and this romance this love in music will come alive then there's hard to say no which has a great melody over the chorus and is a nice little piece of synth piano pop that I could hear Billy Joel pulling together back in the 80s then there's the very instrumentally lavish fall back to you which has these disco tinged string sections on the acta sound beautiful but there are so many tracks on this thing that of I cringe at for one frequent-flyer melodically and lyrically one of the worst chromium songs jet lag you must be tired watch out you might misfire anything your heart desires I want to take you higher one two three you and me can you move up my velocity and there's this Tina Turner style hey that pops it against this chorus and don't get me wrong Tina has great songs and her discography especially during that era in her career but it does not go over well on this record to me tracks like this are as in bad taste as chromeo gets and they failed to back these sounds up with a really good song this continues on the song sexy socialite which i think is another pretty cheap track from chromeo not only is the course slightly asinine on this track but I really don't get the sentiment of the song it seems like the narrator of the track is stalking this girl who is a sexy socialite who likes to party and have fun and drink and go crazy and public gatherings whatever and the narrator is just wishing either she was a different person or she would change or she would give him attention or he could just find a way to get her attention there's even a bad rap verse toward the end of this track delivered at a very snooty girl voice you know if she wants to party just whatever if she doesn't pay any attention to you you know who cares it's hardly a song subject and then there's the song over your shoulder which seems to be putting itself into this kind of weird white knight role when it comes to winning a woman's heart it's well intentioned but the results are not good essentially the song telling girls hey don't be self-conscious about your size and the shape your butt and your breasts don't be buying into this grass was greener mentality don't be looking over your shoulder at other women as if every woman on the planet is inherently jealous of the physicality of every other woman walking down the street he's trying to ease this woman's mind about her physical imperfections of sharing her about them but also switching these lines about getting this girl undressed or getting between this girl's thighs like hey don't be worried I still want to have sex with you which makes the the song feel kind of sleazy and disingenuous then there are other tracks on here like play the fool which just feel incredibly nondescript to me in the greater scheme of ChromeOS songs and moments like as resent allude while I love as Rizzo and it's a nice little piano piece it doesn't really add anything to the album to me as a whole it's just a bit of distracting filler from the fact that Chromeo has not drawn up some good songs this time around so instead we're just going to hit you with a celebrity guest of every album in ChromeOS discography this one is of the most questionable quality just a lot of corny lyrics at every turn weak melodies just alright production and just again some of ChromeOS most uninteresting songs yet I'm Fiona light to decent five on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino Chromeo forever 
8NQyDKbGVOg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new swans record to be kind I know this is this review a little late but you know it's it's two hours long give me a break hey give him a break give me a break give him a break what is on your wall give him a break what is on your wall are you spoiling the review right now me too get on the thing put your face on the thing spoiler oh this is the latest LP from the long-running experimental rock band that formed over 30 years ago swans in that 30 years the band has gone through a lot of albums and lineup changes live records and breakup as well as a subsequent Reformation there's been a lot of sonic evolution as well in their 80s and 90s output you can hear everything from the grating sounds of noise rock no wave and industrial - post-punk ambient music post rock as well as full crock and gothic rock leading up to the point when the band broke up Annie don't be so depressed said worried depressed people don't really just care about the score the early just wanna hear what you got to say about the music cause he loved you so much you think so yeah you know so you know what I think you're right I believe in you yeah I'm gonna do it with all my heart and emotions you go girl even though there's all these various genres in swans past they seem to be onto something kind of new with this latest string of records they've been working on which I actually think started a little rocky with the LP my father will guide me up a rope the years between this record in 1996 is soundtracks for the blind were not spent completely silent I believe there was a swans b-sides record that came out and michael gira was spending a lot of time on solo efforts collaborations and bands like Angels of Light which swans was sounding eerily alike when they came out with this comeback record over here however the sort of gothic and country vibes that came through in that project were changed significantly once swans dropped the seer in 2012 it was a record that saw the band filling out their sound with backup vocals electric guitar vibraphone dulcimer woodwinds pianos synths chimes swansea ambition was unmanned instrumental standpoint but from a compositional standpoint as well since this record had some of the group's most long and challenging material yet especially with the 32 minute title track on this thing it was material that was just unsettling very disturbing hair-raising but explosive as well and groove heavy to like on tracks such as mother of the world which has these just stuttering riffs that repeat repeat repeat repeat Danny Danny Danny and swans take these repetitive stuttering riffs and just build and build and build on them with larger instrumentation or they manage to bring a really clever musical transition through moments like this in a way sort of reminded me of the songwriting that swans were embarking on with the longer tracks off of soundtracks for the blind but the constantly ascending instrumentation on those songs but they were definitely going for a different vibe and they had just a larger more grander presentation on the seer it's like on this record they really return to improve upon the formula they were working with in the mid-90s so it's no surprise that on this latest record from swans we see these folk influences drift away even further and instead we're getting this larger emphasis on heaviness on instrumental density on slow incremental progression with a lot of these songs as they move along becoming hulking monstrosity 'z that are impossible to take down it swans as you might already know them if you gave a listen to the seer back in 2012 but in the meantime since that album was released I think they've done a great job of improving upon that formula as well with better production brighter guitars heavier bass more overwhelming crescendos intense off-the-wall vocal performances from frontman and main brain michael gira and most importantly I think swans does a fantastic job of just keeping the tension up in a lot of these songs especially the more aggressive and lively tracks on this album I think to be kind displays a mastery of tension another reason you might be familiar with Swan sound on this record is if you've been paying close attention to the band for the past few years because a lot of this material is kind of already out songs like to be kind have been in the Swans live set since the seer tour at least and a load of the songs on to be kind ended up on a live slash demo CD that swans did a limited run of not too long ago not here not now however the material on that CD takes on an entirely different life on this record and the presentation is is no less amazing despite the exposure that these songs have already gotten screen shot the first song off of this LP kicks the entire record off perfectly it starts with this quiet hypnotic little riff that has a sinister swing to it doo doo doo doo didn't then the drums pop in they sound so crisp they sound so fantastic they sounds so clear throughout this entire record I just love the drum sounds on this thing shout out to john congleton and the band slowly builds the pace and the sound and the instrumentation of this track up piece by piece by piece they take huge queues from minimalism on this record and just how these songs move forward the progressions that this track and others bring to the table are just so seamless they move so fluidly it's beautiful and I love the crescendo that this song builds up to it's like they're really just working on creating this sense of emotional pressure that they hold until the very last moment lyrically michael gira goes through a lot of words pairing them the word no no this no that no this no that and these words all seem to have some kind of common thread running through them no dreams no suffering no time no pain etc a lot of the words that michael gira is saying no to I think have a lot to do with humanity and just the the idea of life as well as religion we could potentially have all this freedom and yet we put all these barriers around ourselves for the most part that we make up or at least that's what I get from the track putting the word no in front of a bunch of words over and over and over again at the end of the day is kind of vague in a way so I'm sure there are going to be people out there that come to different conclusions than me however still ended up being an interesting thing to read into as I was listening to this record and there are similar lyrical and compositional themes that run through the other songs on this record too like the song some things we do which is the somber five-minute string piece with very chilly stone-faced vocals fronting the song and even though five minutes is not really a short amount of time for a song the track does feel comparatively short tend to the other tracks here considering the track comes right after one of the most intense songs on the record and how relaxed it is throughout the entirety of its length it's kind of like an interlude and lyrically we have a similar pattern instead of know--this know that we have we this we that we love we learn we taste we fuck we touch michael gira seems completely obsessed with the things that we do whether it be by choice or by nature conditioning I think in a way Michael might be kind of disappointed with the limitations that mankind has on it whether they are self-imposed or otherwise the song a little God in my hands also takes this repetitive riff structure building and building and building but starts off much funkier much more rhythmic it's one of the moments here where swans takes and already loud and very engaging very visceral piece of rock music and then just makes it louder and louder and louder there are some amazingly overwhelming walls of horns and glitchy synthesizers on this track that just make my mouth peel back every time to smile because man are they just ear piercing body destroying not only that but just the flavor the tone of the music on this song it's so cartoonishly villainous like just imagine the worst villain you've ever seen ever he's twirling his moustache he has a cape he's tying damsels and kittens and babies to train tracks and again we get another similar lyrical pattern there are parts where michael gira does divert from this pattern on this song but we're getting forever this forever that Forever Lazy and I dare say this song sounds little Primus see a lot of the same riff build repetition characteristics show up on Natalie meal as well as oxygen which I think starts off more aggressive than any other track here especially when it comes to the rhythms and just the pace of the song this is a much faster track than many other tracks here and even though it's eight minutes long this this really is swans at their most straightforward on this record especially with Michael Cera's really animalistic vocal performance favorite Wow I stood out in oxygen this is the most insane he sounded since swans early days on records like greed and filth and cop and in a way I don't think this record is too far off from what those early swans LPS do formulaic Lee the ugly the repetition the primal appeal of the drums and the grooves however with to be kind this formula is being taken to a more refined and complex level and managing to stir up a slew of different emotions in the process like with the track bring the Sun which is the first half of this longest song at 34 minutes it has one of the most crushing introductions of any song on this album with all this instrumentation just piling on top of one another pummeling on this one note over and over and over it is so heavy and yet very bright and blissful it's just the power of sound on display on this thing and these rips eventually give way to a drone it's like I'm listening to swans embrace the idea of music or sound as a religious experience something that mentally can set you free bring you to a higher plane because simultaneously while swans music is very loud and is very visceral I think there are loads of cerebral appeals to the music on this thing too there are moments on this record that I think are meditative as well as hellish and fearful it's like so many songs here just function on the most basic of human emotions this album is primordial beginnings evolving into complex networks of instrumentation that are all marching to the bee of the same drum becoming more advanced as they move forward all focused on the same goal in the same way that like an ant colony would be or the human race itself without being fully conscious of it but with every song here that goes in this direction the power and the sound and the size of the music becomes so great that it eventually just crumbles under its own power that's essentially the end of the song bring the Sun and then we have this transition over to to salawatu which sort of seems like the calm after the storm for a moment but then eventually there's all these noisy riffs hammering down with such relentlessness and speed and ferocity it's like what was once organized has devolved into chaos the guitars and the drums become this wall of noise feeding frenzy all ferociously tearing away at the same rotting corpse and then the instrumentation grows from that into something organized once again which is kind of the cycle of life and things on this record this beginning order growth mayhem death cycle which actually might not be too far fetched of a theory considering that the second half of this track is named after the Haitian revolutionary that helped put into motion the revolution that eventually freed his country from its French oppressors in the early 1700s and late 1800s and on this track michael gira brings one of the most insane vocal deliveries of any track on this record really just sort of shouting to sing their moments on this song that devolves simply into Michael rolling his arse and barking it's just another amazingly intense moment that this this record serves up and then there's tracks on here that I think break up the vibe of the album a little bit like the song just a little boy which oddly enough the the very weird soundscape of this song as well as the oddball vocals kind of remind me of some tracks from David Lynch's latest few musical efforts and in the title of the song itself it says it's dedicated to Chester Burnett aka Howlin wolf one of the most enigmatic blues singers and songwriters of all time and I think swans actually live up to that dedication with how bluesy the drum be and the bassline of this track are but of course for this album they're slowed down to the pace at which a predator pursues its prey sneakily this track doesn't contain one of the more climactic builds on the entire album but it's still really riveting with Michael Cera's vocal delivery and all this maniacal laughter that plays here and there throughout the track I also love the atmospheric drone behind this song and the strung-out slide guitars the lumbering groove which feels incredibly woozy then there's the song she loves us one of the more multifaceted tracks on the entire LP starts off with one of the most gnarly riffs here after several minutes it devolves into these noisy dark pummeling chaotic riffs and the last 10 minutes are spent sort of with this jangly really in a way joyous psychedelic rock instrumentation that just grows more and more and more sinister reminds me of the Stooges in some respects sort of like listening to of I want to be your dog it has a very steady steady patient pace to it but continues to build and build and build further and further and further as it reaches the end point of course meanwhile michael gira is shouting more vitriol over the instrumentation here yeah Amos FAC backing all this very lewd lyricism a lot of which has to do with sex with hallelujah another moment on this record bringing very primal human necessities functions instincts together with religious imagery there's Kirsten supine which starts off as one of the most beautiful songs on the entire LP are really pretty ballad with these sparkling melodies hanging behind the vocals and it just hits another fantastic skipping groove on the second half of the track which just builds up into eternity and explodes toward the end and the finisher on here to be kind has one of the most crushing blows of finish on the entire record and is completely deserving of the throne which it has been given on the Ford of this thing swans just do such a fantastic job on this record they do such a great job taking this very clear formula and just applying it in so many different ways bringing a decent amount of variety to the record instrumental variety emotional variety there are pretty songs on here there are hard-hitting songs on here there are slow burners there are more direct moments and even though yeah it's not as long as soundtracks for the blind that record to me is is not really a holistic album in the way to be kind is soundtracks for the blind was was you know literally a soundtrack for a movie that didn't really exist that was kind of the the mental idea that swans had going into that record to be kind to me is swans most cohesive while ambitious album yet and this plays into why these songs are so long but I think swans actually have expanded the notion of entrancing rock instrumentation on this LP the songs on this record significantly blur the lines between exciting and numbing and not only is the recording amazing the pacing of these songs is fantastic there are just so many interesting passages and twisted layers to these songs this thing is just so captivating and live and free-flowing and yet it feels so meticulously placed together and on top of all of that I find this excitement / numbness ambiguity really intriguing I'm feeling a 10 needs a Jan transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's as swans to be kind forever 
-qsmQxWkiAs,this is your sin lets my boy this is your baby boy that's global I miss him you know that is sad no more cuz your ex-wife took them away cuz you review two mini-albums sub together oh yes my boy that's my son hi everyone invented here the internet minute nerd and it's time for a review of the new video sound machine record its self-titled this is the debut full-length LP from the london-based band which is fronted by British Nigerian singer you know Williams whose band features horns bass loads of percussion guitar synths the eight-member lineup of her band leaves a lot of these tracks feeling really full and intricate and layered there are a lot of bright horn brakes on this record funky bass lines really lively performances throughout a lot of these tracks performances that my body just cannot deny if the song let's dance let's say we're playing at the club I would throw down the energy on this record on some of the tracks is pretty stellar so this is a very visceral LP but the influences that go into this album as well make it interesting enough to kind of huh contemplate there's afro beat and highlight music flowing throughout the veins of this album as well as psychedelic rock disco funk as well and most of the tracks here feature these really odd intrusive synthesizers that leave some of the tracks here feeling kind of experimental a little noisy post-punk II some of the tracks here have these subtly futuristic electronic qualities to them but if you strip these synthesizers and electronics and synthetic drums away you would have a record here that sounded kind of like a blast from the past just like an obscure afro-pop or afrobeat gem recorded in the 70s that never really quite got traction and I'm not trying to say that the synthesizer is on this record aren't good there are a few moments here where maybe they're a little unnecessary or they're not adding that much to the track but I think what the synthesizers and the electronics do on this record is interesting you have this very vintage afrobeat instrumentation throughout this LP but you've got this anachronistic thing going on with the sound with the synthetic sounds weaved into these drums and horn brakes and guitars and that is a sense that the cover of this album tries to give off - you have this very retro looking color palette as well as a black-and-white picture featuring a pop singer like figure dressed in a very colorful and densely patterned outfit from a country and a decade that both seem foreign to me and on top of all of that she's clutching what looks like a brand-new synth so this band definitely has style they definitely have a goal they definitely have a mission statement in mind which I think they give away a little too easily over here but they still use this style to deliver some really fun funky memorable tracks like the song let's dance I love this track for its fast-paced rhythm the quirky synth work and the vocals on top of this thing - it's one of the few moments where Eno comes off really eccentric and kind of oddball --is-- the groove is top-notch on this thing if this record came out in the 70s I could see it being this really strange obscurity that a guy like James Murphy would bring into the studio for inspiration when working on a new project you've got the song the talking fish which is more of a funk influenced track and has one of the stickiest bass lines on the entire LP initially psychotic grimy colorful really smile inducing guitar solo tour the back end of the track there's woman of substance which is at a point in the record where things are toned down a little bit more getting more soulful get more spacious the tracks tend to run a bit more cerebral softer more patient what sounds like analog beats on this track they sort of repeat and plot along against this intensely growing instrumentation one of the best vocal performances from Eno Williams is on this track as well and this is just one of the many examples of moments on this record where I can just get lost in the rhythm these guys have a really hypnotic quality to the way they approach grooves they continue down this more subtle Road with tracks like prodigal son which is the most expansive song on the entire record six minutes and then there's got to move got to get out which is just the chilliest closer just before a little outro interlude there's tons of hand drums layered into this track these really explorative improvisational synth leads not only does the album get more chill as it goes along but I think it moves in a more synthetic territory too or maybe that's just a sensation that is I'm just feeling on my own there are tracks earlier in the LP where I am really enthralled with the beat or the mood of the song or just the horn brakes which are pretty classy like I'm running or The Tortoise which actually that track has a really obnoxiously long fade-out outro that I don't care for too much but the issue that I have with these songs is that maybe for what obviously seems like the mission statement of this record they're a little average maybe sounding a bit too much like run-of-the-mill afro beat but still regardless of that I think the playing in the performances on these songs are good and I still think that a lot of people could get something out of these tracks and there are songs on here like ooh-ahh the peacock as well which I do like but do feel a little short of breath which is maybe the the biggest Achilles heel for me of this entire record other than that I think that they could get bolder and explore this afro beat afro funk electronic fusion a bit more this record is kind of short just about 30 minutes and considering that they're working in a genre that relies on just expansive linear grooves I think a lot of these songs could have gone longer even though there's clearly a lot of good playing on this record even though there's a lot of talent even though these guys clearly have sound in mind it's very obvious to me on this debut in a lot of respects these guys are still feeling out the idea of this sound still exploring the possibilities of what this kind of fusion this kind of sound could mean I hope from here on out they just push harder and they push further than they did on this record because if there's anything that holds some of these songs back it's that they didn't experiment enough as is I think this record is very good it's relatively solid I think it's going to be an enjoyable listen for a lot of people but I'm mostly excited for the incredible potential that I think these guys do deliver on with a handful of tracks here just kind of waiting for that to bleed into whatever else they manage to put on the rest of their records into the future I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it drink more water a video bomb set the sound machine self-titled forever 
KVD4K6dQ5ss,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's it's time for you the new little dragon record Nana boo boo bit of a rubber band these guys are a Swedish pop quartet this is their fourth full-length album and if you give a listen to this record their last record you're gonna catch a lot of very smooth danceable synthetic beats topped by one of the best vocalists in what we currently know as electro pop you ki mean igano a singer so talented with such a distinct voice it has landed her and her band numerous collaborations recently her voice sounds amazing there it sounds amazing a little dragon stuff very soulful very sweet occasionally her voice reminds me of singers like police for example but maybe you kini is much more smooth and sensual and sleek it was even a bit of a neo soul vibe to little dragons earlier stuff that reminded me of a Erykah Badu a little bit however from this debut record little dragon moved into much poppier sharper more colourful territory with their sophomore album Machine dreams and then a few years ago with ritual Union the emphasis came off of the choruses and instead went into the beats way into the grooves kind of making them progressive more linear instrumentally bringing the songs more in line with electronic dance music which actually made these songs really fitting for the live setting where little dragon would expand some of them and turn them into jams and for the most part they are repeating that formula on this latest LP of theirs there isn't much in the way of musical contrast between the verses and the course is on this LP but just like with ritual Union I think it's also done to keep these songs kind of linear in structure and formation like on the song only one which has a very very very atmospheric ethereal intro which is one of the moodiest points on the entire record and then this track which for the most part was rhythm las' up until the end point of the song suddenly busts into this hard-nosed techno beat that brings the track to a close it's definitely one of the cooler moments on the entire LP I just wish little dragon had the ambition to make it into something larger and that's the thing on this entire LP little dragons move their compositions in these songs they're not large they're not huge they're not ambitious they're moves across these tempos across these grooves are very small they're very subtle which worked on ritual Union a set of tracks where the melodies were really sticky the beats and the grooves were captivating or undeniable or really attention-grabbing however I don't think those characteristics follow through 100% on this latest record like with the first single drop off this LP clap clap you Keeney's vocal acrobatics across this song are great from the harmonized vocals on the chorus to her vocal improv store the middle of the song where she's singing you know you want it but the beat doesn't really do anything more than just serve as a foundation instrumentally I think a lot of tracks on this record are devoid of any gripping ideas and especially the full band live and lively sound that I've come to expect and have enjoyed from previous records which actually would have made it easier to get lost in some of these grooves take the song killing me for example this track to me like many other songs on here sounds like something that could have been put together by a producer and Yukimi collaborating not really the full band that I know little dragon is and they have a great drummer and not that I necessarily prefer real drums to electronic drums necessarily it's just that the beats on this thing are hardly a replacement like with the title track on this LP which has this really slow three four time signature going on and the song sort of plots through this sub bass snare pattern that it just rotates through over and over and over and over occasionally swapping a snare for a clap and this groove gets boring before even the one-minute mark of the song is hit and the instrumental just lacks the humanity and the sensuality that I think would complement Yuki's voice really well even with strings being laced into this thing I think the same problem comes up on the song pink cloud - just everything sounding - static - rigid - cold - stagnant the most single worthy track on this entire LP is the song Paris it features one of the only beats on this entire LP that I don't think someone could sleep through and Yuki's vocals are actually much more lively on this track in compare with other songs it's also got a lot of bright synth leads bouncing throughout the track too and really this is the only track on the entire LP that I would call truly single worthy because so many songs on this record lack significant musical and rhythmic development beyond whatever ideas are introduced toward the beginning of the track makin some of these songs feel kind of repetitive more like motifs than a well-crafted tune with multiple distinct parts like the song pretty girls which is a pretty song but not that memorable or the song mirror which cuts out immediately after the first major change in the track which introduced some very heavy rhythms I would chalk that up to it being kind of an intro but it's just about as long as other tracks on this record there's the song cat rider which is very atmospheric it's beautiful it's a patient song it's very ethereal and I think it features one of the most beautiful vocal performances from Yukimi on the entire record really moving and soft stuff however I would be lying via omission if I didn't say that I feel like the instrumental could have done more I feel like the track could be more than this structurally and really that's kind of how I feel about this record as a whole I really enjoy the sounds for the most part I enjoy the vibe I enjoy you Kimmy's voice and I think there are some good songs some very good songs hidden throughout this tracklist as well the issue for me is that they're presented through a lot of this dull humdrum repetitive instrumentation that weakens the pop appeal of these tracks and causes a lot of them just to fall into the back of my subconscious as they're playing before the end of the song even comes I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it also click on my face to head over to Dominic Rayburn's lovely channel who actually animated this little end slate that you're seeing right now forever 
CklabgHYnGA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Black Keys record turn blue the Black Keys are a rock duo hailing from Ohio a lot of people know them for their very vintage rock sound which is incredibly indebted to garage rock the Blues the very soulful voice of frontman and guitarist Dan Auerbach as well as a very groovy and beefy drumbeats of drummer Patrick Carney I mean they're a duo there's not much more they can be known for on some of the Bands best records their sound is incredibly stripped back simple and straightforward thickfreakness rubber factory that really awesome EP of junior Kimbrough covers black keys had a simple sound that had a lot to offer but they had since moved past it in the late 2000s the band started gaining more attention getting a larger audience and put them on a larger label it put them in a position to work with in-demand producer Danger Mouse who they have been working with consistently since initiating this relationship on the LP attack and release which is possibly my least favorite Black Keys album a record where in my opinion the keys basically lose their viscera they lose their edge they lose their Rock gusto in favor of adding all this extra instrumentation all these bells and whistles completely doing a 180 on the very simple sound that got them to where they are and do not get me wrong I do not favor the idea of just making the same record over and over because in a sense I think that's what the black key started doing shortly after the release of attack and release with the records brothers and El Camino two records that to me rehashed a lot of the ideas of their older stuff but with better production do not let that deter you from listening to these records Brothers was actually an incredible success for the keys it was really that moment where they were in the spotlight and they executed in a way that pleased old fans and knew I do like the LP and even though I do like quite a few songs off of El Camino as a record I think it's uh it's disappointingly predictable so I kind of went into this new Black Keys LP turning blue dying to hear the band try something new even if it's just new for them I was in a position where I was convinced that I would settle for that and I got it however only in a sense though while this record is not as simple as El Camino or brothers I mean it's definitely not as raw as those albums either Black Keys come through with what I think is kind of like the sequel to attack and release in the sense that there are tons of bells and whistles arranged instrumentation all around this LP not really the bluesy and garage inspired grit that we've heard on numerous records from these guys much more clean much more pristine refined a place for everything and everything in its place and this is a pretty exciting prospect when the opener of this LP started weight of love the longest song in this entire LP and a really interesting soulful psychedelic rock Odyssey that I would call progressive but only because of how expansive the song structure is however as I dive deeper into the LP many of the songs on this thing just do not deliver either because of ridiculous production choices like on the song turn blue which has one of the best hooks on this entire LP but for whatever reason there's this really weird wishing noise effect or keyboard playing over the entirety of the track it's just a piece of sonic filler that doesn't add anything to the song it only subtracts there's the song fever which sonically it's much different for the Black Keys but songwriting wise it's maybe one of the cheapest Tunes I've ever heard these guys pull together it sounds like a Foster the People song the Black Keys have more soul than this and they definitely prove that on the song year-in-review which to me is the most true blues soul song on this entire LP out of all the older more vintage sounds that these guys emulate this one in my opinion really goes over the best because not every experiment and moment of emulation on this record is that pretty like the closer on here which just sounds like a nightmare of a Creedence Clearwater Revival song or even it's up to you now which feels kind of like a Strangelove's inspired garage rock tune with all these jungle drums in addition to the Black Keys trying out a lot of new flavor and coming out with a mixed bag of results dan comes through with quite a few moments on this record where he is singing in falsetto and the results of that are mixed as well actually no I mean that they're more uniformly unpleasant to listen to like the song bullet in the brain and waiting on words especially waiting on words which is this sort of acoustic ballad in the midst of the record that has these guitar rhythm guitars that open the song up that sound just like they're coming straight out of a stroke song and Dan's just I guess pouring his heart out singing on this track but it just it's just not going over well in terms of holding the pitch and really just sounding kind of goofy there are just so many songs on this LP that I don't like for all the reasons I just listed but the record as a whole to me is just kind of drab it's unexcited because of how grand reverb string kissed bloated and middle-of-the-road it is the drums and the guitars on this LP just don't have that much oomph they're kind of tampered down by all the strings all the extra instrumentation it just seems to suck the energy out of this LP and not only that but I think a lot of what this extra instrumentation adds isn't even that interesting a lot of the time the strings don't really punctuate as much as they just kind of drone on and just fill space that would have otherwise been filled properly with bass guitars and drums or there's tracks like 10 lovers which has this really obnoxious synthesizer lead playing the exact same melody as the vocal melody just underneath the vocal it's completely unnecessary and just the tone of the synth is annoying it seems like the more sounds the black keys throw into the recipe the blander they get overall with turn blue I feel like they've taken a step toward sounding kind of anonymous I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Black Keys forever 
UrCN1B8QtDw,ha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new egg lock record the serpent and the spear sphere egg lock is a Portland metal outfit this is their fifth full-length LP and they are known specifically for their pretty distinct blend of black metal folk music dark folk neo fold which is incredibly melodic dynamic Agalloch actually is not a bad band to check out if you're new to black metal and you're looking for something to ease you into the sound with a lot of melody a lot of beautiful seductive mystical guitar leads I recommend records like in the mantle and especially AGGA locks 4th full-length LP mera the spirit dropped in 2010 was one of my favorite records of that year and was my favorite metal record of that year and it's been almost four years since the release of this album and in the meantime there hasn't really been any major lineup changes there on the same label nothing has really led into this album other than an EP that the band dropped in 2012 called Faustian echoes a 20 minute long piece that was actually pretty solid and considering the egg LOX discography so far has been pretty much flawless there's really been no reason to not go into this LP expecting the band to just turn out another fantastic album my guest in this review Elliot Quinn you can find his YouTube channel down there in the description box he is a young bright reviewer with a wide vocabulary hailing from the UK who has an immense passion for metal music for someone so young he has a really attentive year and loves metal music both new and old so I'm pretty psyched to see what he thinks about this new Agalloch record transition hi everyone Anthony Fantana here and like I said magic of the Internet we are now here with Elliot Quinn and we're going to be talking about the new Agalloch LP Elliot essentially what were your thoughts overall on this new record going into this I didn't really know what to expect mag a lot because each other for me is just starkly different there's an obvious evolution but um each album you can definitely tell them apart and sound um I thought if you get someone to add a lot this will be one of the album's I would give them I mean if I suppose it really depends on what that person's all the interference and petal or something you might want to do for actions against the grain if they enter Prague then the mantle is the perfect way to go um overall I think this is an incredibly strong Idol op record I mean I can thirteen mo of the spirit which a lot of people probably disagree with um I prefer to ashes against the grain and I currently think it's about around Hell folklore not wears a mantle yet in my mind it only needs a few more lessons I find it very difficult to describe adults music some people say it's in a meal flow something the sex black-metal do matter progressive um and all of those are true some more trees and others I feel on this album they've really combined on everything they've done so far into one you know record which is you know great for some people some people maybe one's more evolution I think it's winning that they can look back over their catalogue and I'm really taken clips from all of them was my overall thoughts on the record but obviously I've more things to say about their about some of the deeper cuts um I'm sort of I want to say I'm far into the opposite but I'm not as in love with this record as as you I mean I think I think it's maybe just a touch under their debut it just lacks the instrumental diversity for me and it lacks in a way some of the vocal diversity for me that I've loved on their previous LPS and and there are some moments on here where I'm not like is crazy on the production in that it's sort of like the mix is off sometimes it's like the drums and the rhythm guitars are just overpowering in comparison to some of the lead guitars and the vocals both of which are typically really stunning and tend to lead the way on Agalloch records but just don't seem to be doing so on a handful of the tracks here you know my favorite songs on this entire LP were like the acoustic interludes all of which I thought are really beautiful but I thought that uh some of the tracks on here tended to run just a little tedious mostly because I felt like Agalloch was a sort of rehashing a lot of ideas that I've heard them run through in the past and some of my favorite moments on here reminded me merely of just like marrow of the Spirit not necessarily in a terrible way there are certainly a lot of great endings to these songs with harmonized guitar solos and some interesting transitions but to me this is definitely not a favorite of mine from them what tracks did you did you come out loving the most I kind of prefer when I go up go down a more progressive route when their songs are longer I mean only my favorite idol that track ever is in the shadow of health and hanyan they're a couple of really good songs on this one a plateau of the ages which is the set laughs track um I was really involved 12 0 minutes long and I'm I felt that just moved in so many different directions I mean it shift at the beginning of the track it kind of sound what stuff I thought I've done before like I understand what you need and I kind of thought you know if they're gonna really get me sick I like give me overkill for two minutes with this music but by the end of the track and it clicks brought everything well it went good metal the other track what do you think was the worst all the tracks on the album well I actually have to agree with you completely as as far as my favorite track on the LP flats a plateau of the ages was definitely a standout in my opinion I thought some of the melodies on that record ran on that song and a little darker and some of the more triumphant tracks on the album and that definitely made it stand out and I thought it was one of the few moments where Agalloch actually came through and in row of a multi-faceted song that just kept me engaged from beginning to end on the opposite side my least favorite track on here is actually the second longest track on the entire record birth and death of the pillars of creation to me that just the the two alternating riff notes and chords that eventually glide into these acoustic guitars that just have some very mundane chords playing through them and then to return to that riff but layer guitars on top of them it was just a really tedious listen it was like the band was really just sort of going through the motions and not only was the cop of this track not that interesting but just it wasn't that it wasn't that visceral either there just wasn't any excitement to the performance and I know a Glock has never been one of those overly aggressive bands or anything like that but I mean there are plenty of songs off of mayor of the sphere which you could also argue as well as their debut you know two of their least overtly aggressive records but you know still a very strong groove to some of these songs whereas it wasn't catching that as much with this record it just felt a lot more reserved in a way and not really in a way that I thought was intentional because it certainly allowed album but there's just so much on here that just feels like a Glock running out of ideas in a way you know not really doing anything more than we've heard them do already you know with these similar beats and these similar blast beats and and you know this a very similar tremolo guitar layer harmonization that we hear on a lot of tracks too and while I don't really mind any of these things in theory you know it's just the way I block structures their music just not as many winning melodies to me came out of the process and you know while I don't mind these acoustic interludes I do like them um you know they don't come out to me as stunning or as amazing as some of the other stuff that has worked into their records as far as interludes are just quieter or more subtle moments that evolved that involved acoustic instruments or piano I really be like we are what about the interviews in a sound and in scope but um you know they kind of blur together a bit and I understand that they almost have to just give you agreed they give you a bit of time to kind of um without yourself for the rest of the album but when it's in the middle of when it's at the end um but I don't know they kind of learn together bit too much me knows quite a lot of similarities between them which can work very well I mean we needed to varnish yellow and green I saw a lot of similarities between these two albums um when they have the seams on those you can kind of see similarities you can also see differences and I feel but only issue I found the in Toulouse was that they kind of did begin to blur together and on another compare the bonus was that when I was in the fairness I kind of get this euphoric feeling um it's kind of more catchy it's more straightforward and I don't think I've got going for that on this aisle but it gives me a similar emotion and um again I've often kind of turned away from yellow and green when it came out because people were expecting something dark or something heavy or something um something more smudgy and then they came up with this more outfeed bracket and I feel that's kind of what I've done here some people are gonna you know turn against today it's going to be a grower for a lot of people again like yellow and green it kind of clicked in me instantly what did you think of the production because that's what's kind of a turning point for a lot of people some people love it simply to hate it either just in general on the entire record I mean like I said earlier I thought like the mixing just could have been handled a lot better in terms of rhythm guitars and drums overpowering some of the tracks on this LP whereas the the guitar leads and the vocals aren't really stealing the show like they typically do on an Agalloch record and and I feel like what lyrical and what vocal diversity now their vocal diversity there is on this LP it doesn't really come through because sometimes the vocals drown out a little bit I think the record sonically is more claustrophobic than I would have liked from Agalloch you know while I know they have a black metal sound and I know there are metal band in general I've never and they do have do metal influences on some of their earlier records I've never really seen them or ever really wanted to hear them as overpowering as this record is at some points you know I think this record is heavy heavier than records like the mantle and their debut and mirror of the spirit but as a result I think it's kind of glossed over some of the details that I typically look for in an Agalloch record you know I mean while it is heavier I wouldn't say it's so heavy that it's menacing or that it's exciting or that it's really just like giving me a darker tone or anything like that you know I don't think this record is really a significant mood change either in the way that you sort of bring up yellowing I like that record too and you know sort of uh understand a lot of the the disconnect that people have with that LP because it is a shift in mood from red and blue you know I can't say that a Glock really pushes themselves into a different sound or a different mood or really expands upon anything that they've done before on this latest LP of theirs you know dude do you feel that way um yeah I kind of see a point that's kind of what I mentioned at the beginning I mean when I'm like I was about 13 I know that's completely different scenario you know they were a legendary band and they've just come back after the 30 plus years without their lead singer um this is a band really in their prime but when something came out of that piece of people because it didn't really push forward or do anything new it kind of stuck to what they'd already done but kind of done some new things with it um I don't have definitely done a lot more things than 13 ever did um but yeah this one other thing to music I tend to look for grooves and rhythms and stuff like that I'm not much of a lead fan or I'm not really into vocals you know instrumental music music with vocals has a really change of my view on it too much unless they really do stand out um and I feel this does go from a rhythmic vibe and again I can attend a lot of people away because nobody focusing on their folk influences or their um well at folk metal influences or anything like that um it's kind of folks along they're doing me they're more progressive elements and again a lot of people aren't with me a fan of that so it completely works for me um you know that shows in just how much I love this album but I it's weird because when I heard the Satanist and then people didn't like I was like how do you not like this your metal fan how does this not appeal to you I can almost see a lot more people not enjoying this album um just weirded me you know loving it so much and then also understanding why people wouldn't like it as much um I don't know how to explain I can see that it's an old record some aspects but it's just kind of connecting with me in a way that an angle of housing hasn't in a while so I know most people will disagree with me but that's just completely how I feel about the zombie yeah no I mean I can I could definitely feel what you're saying about the progressive elements and just sort of a Glock relying on just their volume as opposed to you know those full elements that we've always expected from them and they definitely show up on this record as well but you know maybe maybe they're sort of looking to drift away from that in a sense and kind of just become a more aggressive band you know and and if that's the case they definitely succeed from a volume perspective so what would you say a score wise your feeling on this record um currently I'm looking at a nine I don't know it could go drop in the future I'm not sure it's currently battling vaninatha taking it to my comment album of the year um it's weird no I mean if that's how you're feeling about it that's how you're feeling about it and so I mean you know if you're saying it's bad I'm a Satanist right now which is actually a maybe my favorite metal record of the year so far it's it's most definitely going to be in your top ten then you think at the end of the year no matter what happens I'm kind of holding out for bazarov hasn't mastered all to make their way into the McIntosh away from me um but right now I don't see much you know sending out of the top ten no could be out of the top five by the end of the year just don't know that I can't expect to get out of the top line don't you get for school right now if you're like me beyond just the the lighter end of a six right now strong five late six definitely wouldn't go any deeper than five on this thing like I said earlier you know I think Agalloch still has the personality they still have a lot of the elements that a fan would come to expect from them compositionally vocally musically you know so it's not like there's a massive disappointment in that regard you know if you've enjoyed their past records there's still a lot to enjoy here but if you've heard their past four records is there anything here that that really pushes beyond what they've done before sonically or musically you know I don't think so this is definitely a louder record and there are some appealing tracks on here but there's just quite a bit of material on here that I'm just very on the fence with yeah I think we're gonna close it out like that so Elliot thank you for coming on again it's fine yeah a lot of fun to do this all right Anthony Fantana Elliot Quinn egg lock the serpent and the sphere forever [Music] [Music] 
RjWLVFVlof0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Mac Miller mixtape faces Mac Miller is a rapper producer singer and songwriter if you have been following underground and mainstream hip hop for the past few years now you most likely have heard of this guy I've dug on some of his previous projects but have also had some reservations about some of them - some of them are not lyrical enough for his delivery is just too monotone he's too poppy he's too stoned he's too goofy or he's giving us really bad singing / terrible pho jazz instrumentals I don't even know what this was the issue that I have with Mac Miller's music really depends on the project that I'm listening to of which because over the years since he has broken out onto the scene he's become more and more prolific I'm also a fan of the fact that his come up just seemed so natural and so organic and so self created he consistently gets collaborations from reputable rappers and producers and he seems to be a hard worker it doesn't really seem like there's ever a moment where he's not collaborating with someone or getting ready to put out a new project himself and artistically and instrumentally I think he's been getting more ambitious as well not a perfect record his last full-length LP watching movies with the sound off but easily his most creative album yet some of his most abstract lyrics yet are on this project as well as some of his most progressive instrumentals so I was kind of surprised to see that I enjoyed yet another project from him faces now surprised that it's good or that it has a lot of the characteristics of watching movies with the sound off but I was surprised that I dug it despite the fact that it is about 90 minutes long and even though that's an admirable quality in a sense it's still the tapes most glaring flaw I think we can all agree to an extent that Mac Miller is really yet to reach a point of emotional dynamics and maturity where he can actually hold a project for 90 minutes straight and deliver a group of different sentiments and emotions and messages in the process sounding fresh and engaging and entertaining with each one but still even if this project is a little bit of a slog I do think that Mac Miller here more than ever has done a great job of capturing the the plight of the modern stone slacker a regular everyday kid who wants to pursue his dreams but in the process might have gotten a little too deep in over his head with fake friends misconceptions of fame drugs insomnia depression but in the process he still has lost his passion and his fire and his hunger still I will say that this is a record that Mac Miller fans are going to enjoy above all those that have kind of a vested personal interest in seeing Mac Miller do well for a lot of you out there hearing a successful rapper crying in your ear might not be your favorite thing to do you might have bigger fish to fry but in my opinion the rapping the storytelling the personal emotions that are delivered authentically and the production are all improved to the point where Mac Miller might just change her mind on some tracks because on this project I think Mac does deliver some of his best songs some of his greatest artistic feats tracks like happy birthday where lyrically Mac Miller's going into the situation where there's a birthday party going on downstairs and yet he's depressed and he's feeling awful about himself but everybody around him is just looking for a reason to celebrate and a reason to party and have a good time nobody really cares about this slump that he's in there are songs on here like Diablo where he kind of goes into his dark side tracks like wedding where he's rapping to a love interest and trying to convince her that he's like the worst person ever basically warning her about him there are tracks on here like angel dust in Malibu or Mac Miller essentially gives us like all of these addiction follies in this addiction rationale and then there's songs on here like San Francisco where Mac is essentially giving us all these moody blunted musings that are kind of funny interesting clever I get a few chuckles out of them I love the clunky beat on this track as well as the very jazzy instrumental on the song here we go some very heavy sub base on this instrumental and this is one of the few moments on this album where Mac Miller comes off really energetic and charismatic laying out some bars where he's kind of like setting things straight a little bit talking about how a lot of people weren't messing with him until he hopped on a brain feed or be from Flying Lotus this last LP and how he got where he is all without a Drake verse all without a J verse but maybe he does go a little too far when he pokes fun other internet rappers for spending their advance on 2 Chainz and a Gucci verse I love the wordplay but I think Mac Miller is kind of guilty of the same thing on this very project with the Rick Ross verse that pops up later on this tracklist and I do like the song itself it's a trap flavored banger it's got a nice hook to it it's about Mac Miller kind of dealing with insomnia and is really high-energy as a result I guess the energy that one would need to not go to sleep but the Ross verse on this thing is uh in the middle of the verse there is this glaringly awful line where he says getting money so complicated I'm the I'm constipated and then Ross spends a few bars in the track telling us that in his opinion Mac Miller is real he's really real I'm just wondering if anybody else is just sensing the irony of having the fakest guy in hip hop right now tell us how real Mac Miller is I mean I can't even handle it truth be told should have sprung for the Gucci verse there are some other features I see credited on this project but also don't go over well like the absol verse on the back end of the song polo jeans with Earl Sweatshirt which is a non-existent not only that but this track is an incredible mutant of a song Mac Miller's and Earl's bars are alright they don't really make this a killer song an incredibly memorable song but throughout this track there's all these vocal samples of these kids playing this really violent game screaming at one another angrily and under this Mac Miller is just like mumbling this incredibly faint weak uninteresting hook and I don't know if he wants to give us a vocal cut this interesting or funny or a hook just give me one or give me the other there just some moments on this tape we're obviously Mac Miller and his features are not following through does he care about this tape does he care about how it sounds about how it flows about how it comes together about whether or not it actually looks professional in the end I mean schoolboy q comes in on the song friends not really rapping or anything like that just quietly in the background yelling Miller Mac Mac Mac Mac just shouting like a troll I mean don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite tracks on the Tyrel p it's one of the most ambitious songs at 6 minutes and 38 seconds and personally I think it's one of the more telling songs for Mac Miller with him talking about friends and drug addiction and his relationship with his mom a little bit more misconceptions with fame on this track and some issues with self-esteem there's also the matter of the King Ralph feature that might be on this thing I didn't hear anything and then Thundercats featured on just like a very clumsy short tiny fifty-three second instrumental interlude which to me is just like an incredible misuse of that magical unicorn bass players amazing talents if he's involved anywhere else on this LP I'm unaware maybe some of the great bass lines on colors and shapes I don't know Sir Michael rocks is one of the few rappers on this project that is credited and actually raps and comes through with a pretty notable verse I mean it's slow its spaced out it's very monotone just like Mac Miller but there are some clever lines this one about I love you more than Kanye love Kanye him and Mac trade one verse after another I kind of get this sense of stoner camaraderie on this track are kind of like drug enabling I mostly get this sense because at this point in the record Mac Miller seems to be in kind of a drug haze that leads him to it's sort of depressing crash a few more tracks down the road and if there is one good thing about this LP with all the tracks that it has I will say it is that there are different facets of this record where Mac Miller seems to be in different moods here and there I mean it's all one kind of slow long very background blunted mood together but there are different shades of it throughout this thing there's a Mack Jones feature that totally comes out of nowhere on the song uber and you know it's not bad while it's not one of the more memorable tracks on this thing it is one of the few features on this thing it feels like a true-blue collaboration with mike jones rapping about a girl that Mac Miller is mentioning who might be sort of unfaithful to him and Mike Jones is kind of serving as this witness to the situation the Vince staples versus is okay and maybe the most surprising verse on this entire LP is the second earl verse that starts off the song new faces where he's going hard he is hungry he is aggressive I've never him so awake so the features on this record can be kind of hit or miss as well as the solo tracks - like the singing Mac Miller does on the song colors and shapes which I mean while it's not as excruciating as some of the songs on watching movies it's still really a low point for me on here and there's a good chunk of songs on this record especially toward the back end in my opinion that are incredibly underwhelming just outright boring uninteresting just kind of redundant in this long 24 song tracklist what songs on this thing are the best will most definitely depend on who is listening but this project is undeniably bloated and a lot like movies with the sound off this record works best sort of hanging in the background blunted chill music that's not really demanding your attention immensely but upon closer inspection it just doesn't really measure up but still I will say that I think lyrically Mac Miller is delivering more personal and thought-provoking food for thought on this project than he has on some of his more recent stuff however I think just the fact that Mac cannot kill his babies on this thing kind of cancels out that positive I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this project to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next that's it Mac Miller faces forever 
MAR7XwtT_M4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan coming from mr. Stephen Furtado dear Anthony just want to say your videos are helpful especially when I am feeling uninspired I want to hear your input on something I've been thinking about lately I have noticed some really great hip-hop artists coming out recently that you've recommended as well as some Foulke and EDM and synth rock synth pop artists there hasn't really been too much Rock going on on the charts I feel like when I dig for new rock punk bands nobody is doing anything at all that is inspiring where do you think rock punk and guitar music in general is headed and do you have any recommendations or know of any interesting original rock movements happening right now do you think Rock is dying out Thank You Steven Furtado dear Steven to be completely honest I've been asking myself the same questions lately especially since now more than ever I've been seeing all these people online talking about the death of guitar music I don't know why these people are calling it guitar music as opposed to just calling it rock maybe at this point saying Rock is dead is too cliche to say which is ironic because I think a lot of these people are trying to assert that rock is becoming cliche so we shouldn't like it anymore because somehow I don't think these people have liked funk and mariachi music and folk as well as blues and country in mind when they talk about the death of guitar music not only that but the guitar has played a pretty significant role in numerous records that are relevant in the underground relevant in the mainstream when it comes to albums as well as singles what about that Avicii song with Aloe Blacc there's acoustic guitar all over that thing and and Daft Punk's get lucky Justin Timberlake's the 20/20 experience Kurt Vile the war on drugs swans Godspeed you black Emperor that 1975 song chocolate converge deafheaven sunbather I know they're like some one direction songs that have guitar in them anybody who says guitars are old and therefore are not cool anymore or they're relevant so on and so forth they're stupid they're idiots either that or they they don't really know a guitar in a song when they hear one because as as musical institutions drums and pianos and stringed instruments have been around much longer and yet I don't hear anybody saying the death of drum music the percussion is just so passe however still I understand where this feeling that rock is dead or dying kind of comes from right now in this very small sliver of time in the greater world of popular music rock is not really leading the way and it's been a while and I mean a while a little while since we've had a breakout band like Nirvana or Metallica or The Strokes or the white stripes or Modest Mouse or Death Cab for Cutie that kind of came from the underground came from the indie sphere the college rock circuit and broke out into the mainstream and resonated with rock music fans resonated with music fans in general at numerous levels right now electronic music and hip-hop are kind of leading the way they're currently the go-to for a party soundtrack and historically if people want to party to it it does well on the charts and if you can appeal the young people teenagers and twenty-somethings you're better off as well in terms of relevancy EDM fans are one of the largest and most vocal musical fan groups that there are and even though the music industry signing artists and so on and so forth as well as the radio do play a role in what's hot and what's not I think innovation plays a pretty significant role too and right now hip-hop in EDM are bringing the most instantaneous trendiest sounds in music that are out there at the moment and as a result I mean even pop artists are scrambling to grab dubstep drops and Trapp instrumentals for the backgrounds of their songs just catch people's attention but even in the underground there are plenty of artists out there that are cutting edge as well like James Blake Nicholas jar burial Flying Lotus clipping Death Grips Shabazz Palaces but then again you know what's what's really new moly is ecstasy for the most part EDM is a blend of house techno pop music as well as dubstep and the fact that a lot of people think that these genres are new only highlights the ignorance that the general public has toward electronic music twerking is old Daft Punk went disco and just sounds like a police song most of us are composing songs out of the same 12 notes in the chromatic scale playing in a 4/4 time signature singing in English and studies have shown that in terms of volume rhythm melody sonic texture that a lot of today's pop hits sound incredibly alike meanwhile rock music is at this middle age point where it's like reflecting on its past and thinking about how awesome it used to be so as a result you have a lot of bands focused on reviving the past of 60 psychedelic rock post-punk shoegaze jangle pop just hardcore punk rock and you know there's nothing wrong with that doesn't make them a bad band doesn't mean the album is bad you know some of these bands do write great records I mean for example the new Queens of the Stone Age LP one of the least innovative things of last year but greatly produced fantastically written rock records so while I don't think Rock as a genre is incredibly cutting-edge right now I think rock still has learned innovate I mean it's such an umbrella term bands like Radiohead The Pixies Oasis Pink Floyd Killing Joke Velvet Underground Jack White REM they all fall under this umbrella and considering that all of those bands have such incredibly distinct sounds that there's still got to be room for something different something new to occur and not to say that there isn't I still think there are some innovative and cutting-edge and interesting things going on in rock music for example the new deafheaven record sunbather really broke out last year when it comes to this American shade of black metal that's going on right now there's a lot of experimentation and innovation going on in black metal in general there are a lot of bands making crust punk sludge metal and power violence blending these genres together that are sounding incredibly heavy dark and extreme bands like nails and trap them the latest Flaming Lips record was pretty weird there's also bands that while they're not anything incredibly new there's still really idiosyncratic creative and nobody really sounds like them like Deerhoof also freaking melt banana one of the craziest rock records I've heard of last year and then there's also the latest LPS from Kurt Vile and the war on drugs and not the greatest albums I've heard ever but they're bringing full crock together psychedelic rock and krautrock I mean not a lot of artists you could put on a list that have done that and if you can't throw that in the comments because they'll check those bands out and even though it's not cutting-edge I mean there's there's an incredibly healthy strain of new emo bands out there right now kind of also proving that rock isn't dead since I mean it's obviously still existing since there are so many people out there that want to play it listen to it and buy it you know are any of these bands ready for like mainstream success or anything like that yeah I can't really say but what does popularity matter anyway not only is real popularity fleeting but a lot of the popularity that we are subjected to on the Internet music Oh sphere is merely just relative you could go to the electric dayz focal and see all these people there and be like rock is really dead isn't it in the same way that you could go to a New England metal and hardcore festival and deem that electronic music must be dead too and you know if Rock is dead in a mainstream sense but still exists in an underground sense I'm not really going to complain either you know it's not like every moment spent at the top with rock being in charge was was pretty but if rock music is going to thrive in the way that has through the 60s and the 70s and the A's and the 90s and the 2000s it's going to have to do the same thing that it did in all those decades and that's do something different that's experiment that's innovate that's reject the past and look toward the future bringing back all these old-school sounds is cool and everything but the day we decide that we only want to do that is the day the genres pretty much over transition where do you think rock music is going is it relevant anymore is it important anymore as a new sound going to come out of this genre where are the more cutting-edge bands and rock music in your opinion right now where the interesting albums coming from what are the interesting albums Anthony Fantana music forever 
U6Zbc8Q3Jgo,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lykke Li record I never learned luckily is a Swedish singer-songwriter I have been following her stuff since 2008 when she dropped her full-length debut record youth novels an LP that I hear was basically the start of a trilogy which is ending with this latest third record of hers and the connections between these three peas must be incredibly personal because the sonic shifts that Lee made from record to record are kind of what turned me off to her music in the first place back in 2008 youth novels just wooed me with these plinky sweet little quaint piano ballads that were so endearing but on her sophomore record it seems that Lee just kind of took on this incredibly serious tone and I have no idea why maybe to make her song sound more mature there were some tracks on this that did have a quaintness to them just like the debut record like silence is a blessing but it just was not as lovely frequent collaborator producer writer Bjorn landing only helped Lee bring a much more panoramic grand large and in charge sound to this new record this thing was soft and pretty in cavernous like a beach house record but in its best moments much more dramatic and going down this road churned out some really great singles for Lee that helped boost her career like I follow rivers and love out of lust and Lee is working with Bjorn again on this new record as well as Greg Kurstin of the burden the B as well as songwriter Rick Knowles and this new LP of hers also brings a bit of a sonic shift to the table from her last album what Lee is showing off on this latest LP this new side of her is stripped back sad heartbroken bear overly emotional really dramatic passionate this change of pace occurs most boldly on lead singles like love me like I'm not made of stone one of her best tracks ever in my opinion her most heartfelt song I love the acoustic guitars on this track they're just so loosely strung they just seems so so organic and her voice it's cracking it's wailing it's just pleading it's begging it's screaming and there are lyrics on this track that hint toward the failure of a relationship on the part of the narrator they might have just screwed things up but the lyrics also deliver this touching portrayal of selfless undying love it's like we're in this terrible place right now but we want to get in this great place and even though the picture in a sense seems beautiful you know love me despite mistakes love me despite flaws lead delivers these lyrics in a voice that sounds like she is she's pleading with this person to love her rather than you know sounding warm and inviting or something like that it's like she's really kind of using her last bits of strength - granted this person who she might see slipping away and I'm assuming the request for this relationship restart did not go through since the title of the next track on this thing is never gonna love again a very sad song subject which is matched with some incredibly saccharine instrumentation which is incredibly smudged by the reverb that's just slathered onto this record it's it's kind of like looking at a really freshly painted very detailed portrait and then just a bucket of water is dumped onto it and then all these fine lines are just blurred and I guess that's kind of the other side of this record these Pleasant easy on the ears very instrumentally lush pop tunes that are just so-so just overwhelming with reverb to the point where they just seem large and grand and and humongous and yet blobby and kind of formless and sometimes even though this is pop music the least gripping thing about these tracks is Lee's voice mostly because maybe the melodies not really stand out or her voice itself is kind of buried in the reverb or buried behind the instrumentation tracks like this on this record range from the guitar driven opening track I never learned where essentially Lee's vocals which are multi tracked and just layered on top of one another singing throughout this song are so soft and just so Laidback and just so blended in with one another it's kind of like listening to background vocals sync throughout the entirety of the track I was kind of sitting back waiting for a louder bolder more emotive vocal to kind of step in and steal the spotlight on the song but it never happened ain't no rest for the wicked' is probably the best of these instrumentally lush and very reverb heavy tracks not because it's produced better or anything like that but because melody wise and song wise it is the best tune it's one of the few moments where the really strict back verses that contrast the dense choruses actually brings a very wonderful and catchy and sticky vocal melody to the table but even though this song was delivered early on before the release of this record I think the track gunshot was even more single worthy I think maybe the most true blue pop song on this entire LP despite the very moody opener on this track it's maybe one of the sweetest songs on the entire record and even though there are highlights on this LP like that tracks like silver line and just like a dream are near unmemorable I would say skippable tracks if it weren't for the fact that just the instrumentation is pretty and feels good while it's on but these are not tracks I see sticking in people's heads toward the end of the year while I didn't think this LP was terrible I liked it overall I still think it's an honest shame the more songs on this thing didn't really go down the road of the best track on this entire LP love me like I'm not made of stone the closest this record comes to that sentiment once again is the almost bare piano ballad sleeping alone that closes the record out it has maybe one of the most heart-wrenching sentiments on the entire album but it's nowhere near the emotional climax of love me like I'm not made of stone and as it is the finish of the album it's a kind of an inconspicuous finish when the song is over and the album is over I was like huh that's that's it it's done and that's another thing this is the shortest record Lee has put out yet I mean it's it's just over 30 minutes we're her two previous records were at least 40 not saying that forty minute records are necessarily better than 30 minute records but if you're going to hit me with 30 minutes it's got to be all killer no filler unfortunately that's not what I got there are several great tracks on this album in my opinion and with the album tracklist being so short that's about half the album but these great songs are padded out with tracks that are just phenomenally okay the loads of effects on this LP just keep the instrumentation and Lee's voice as well from having any bite or any real emotional impact you know the most stripped back raw and just straightforward song love me like I'm not made of stone is the best on here for a reason because it's so emotional because it's so upfront with with everything there's nothing to hide whereas on every other track here it seems like all that Lee and Bjorn are trying to do is obscure things and hide things and push things behind reverb and just shove things into a corner for what reason I'm not sure I know that not every track on here is an amazing song but I think so many songs on this record could have come out better if they were just given the dramatic reading that loved me like I'm not made of stone was instead we're just getting the series of songs that are simply just going through the motions of contemporary indie pop and that's it I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition if you given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana luckily wounded rhymes I never learn forever 
wrxdKLFSf3M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for God monthly hell aka why you know a review where I talk about a whole bunch of Records all at once that I didn't get to do a formal review on from this past month April and just wanted to touch down on them a little bit not necessarily saying they're terrible not necessarily saying that the worst thing ever some of them are pretty decent but maybe where my cup of tea but I think that they might still be worth checking out for you if you know you're into that sort of thing so please if you love me allow me to make this segment as painless as possible and just sort of breeze through these records I'm going to list all the titles down there in the description box they'll also be popping up here on the screen as I'm going through the records first the new proto martyr record protomatter record now if you're into really reverb soaked kind of gothic post-punk music then check this record out I think there are some good tunes on this thing but there were some shorter tracks on here that I didn't think we're that special I wasn't that impressed with the vocals I just thought it was a little bland a little run-of-the-mill for the style of music but if you're totally crazy into it then I I recommend you check it out next the new current 93 record this is some some preheats some pretty interesting experimental folk music really progressive really strange and admittedly for as long running as the band is and David Tibet has been making music under this pseudonym in this project for years not not terribly familiar with them not even going to front not even going to pretend I was actually talking with Mike c-town who was actually a huge fan of this band Mike c-town from dead and hip hop sort of a getting his opinions on this record sort of letting me know where it sits for him in the entire current 93 discography because they do have a pretty sizable discography and at least from my point of view while I didn't dislike this record it just felt like maybe it's not the best entry point for somebody who's like not that familiar with the and mostly because the project seems to be so personality-driven I mean you have full concern really layered really strange and over that David Tibet's very odd and and very impassioned poetry he is so over the top he is so theatrical over this instrumentation that it just makes me feel like okay maybe I need to try to get into one of their more accessible records or something like that and then once I get a taste for his personality and really enjoy and sort of see what he's doing lyrically and and really sort of just just appreciate his eccentricities then I can come into something like this that that is a little stronger the new danger EP if you're in the market for like some French house some electro house you might want to try this thing out especially since it has a like some 80s progressive synthesizer music in there 80 70s like you know some very epic sondtrack were these stuff but for danger I didn't really find this new material to be all that special or cutting-edge or interesting you know and I've been waiting so long for a new EP from this guy you know this dude was definitely much more popular when he was coming out with music around the time that justice was really hot when people were like really dying to hear more French house stuff and since then his output is kind of petered out and has grown less interesting there's the new Gridlink record if you're looking for some grindcore that has some ultra ultra melodic guitars that are just so all over the place I mean this record really is way more melodic than you would ever expect a grindcore record to be it does make them quite a unique act in grindcore music however it is just so intense it is so dense it is so just non-stop it is so relentless that even someone like me you know who usually advocates for music that goes that route was kind of like ho-ho hawawa this is is really a test this is a test of your attention span despite the fact that the record is only like 20 or so minutes but it's also a test of your physiological self you know I don't think people who who are unfit physically can can really appreciate this music I think you have to be like you know at peak physical condition to utterly get into to what the band is doing on this record you know because the drumbeats are just so ah they're so relentless the vocals are this shrill retching throaty I I get I get winded just listening to two tracks off of this thing but if you're looking for extremity next the new Afghan Whigs record a kind of their comeback record alternative rock band made a lot of great records in the 90s that people really fawn over however you know for me this is just kind of a disappointing comeback for them not to say that I was really hotly anticipating this record I've never really been much more than a casual Afghan Whigs fan but on this LP I mean the vocals just strain and strain and strain and strain and a lot of the instrumentation just seems so run-of-the-mill you know for for alternative rock and when the vocals are straining to me they have kind of a goofy personality to them you don't have to agree with me it's just my point of view on it you know it's just how they feel to me just not like in this record someone who I'm even less invested in the new Asher Roth record I don't remember the title of this record I completely forgot the title of this record retro hash that's it and that's because my brain is trying to do me a favor of erasing this record from my memory because it is such awful boring generic lifeless meaningless stoner rap that I mean if if you're looking to go to sleep put this record on you'll go to sleep by the third track most likely either that or you're going to be scrambling to turn this record off as soon as tracks like tangerine girl come up whereas your Roth's awful singing over this really atmospheric instrumental is just too much for me to handle some of the beats are okay but lyrically Azeroth is as uninteresting as ever and for everyone who's just listening to this record to get high to it you could be getting high to better music you deserve better nextly new Merkabah record many of you may not know about this LP I checked out the band found him out on band camp I recommend that you go see that band camp give it a listen if you're into do metal on guard metal metal fuse with jazz music this is a really lush and and gloomy record I mean there's a lot of color to this thing but it's very dark and spacious as well the riffs are heavy however I didn't really find there to be a lot of electricity between the band as they were playing just listening to the band play these songs out just felt kind of I don't know uneventful but still I I do think they have an interesting sound I think they have an interesting tone that that is worth checking out if you're looking for heavy stuff that has some instrumental diversity next the new Y Oak record which has more synthesizers kind of leading the way in terms of instrumentation but to me that's the most significant change that this record makes it's just a bit of a change in terms of instrumentation a bit of window dressing change how the band functions at their core really isn't that different to me personally I just prefer my pop music to be a little less dreamy a little stronger a little bolder a little bit more impactful and that's why Y oak just doesn't you know one of those bands that I'm that I'm that interested in next the new woods record um passed on reviewing this thing unfortunately you know woods I reviewed pretty much every record they have put out you know studio full-lengths ever since they put out songs of shame you know I actually had to delete that review a while ago because of a I had song clips in the review that's why I had to delete all my 2009 output but I digress in this new LP of theirs I'm finding it to be a lot like their last album in terms of the instrumentation just sounding way less reverb soaked in their older stuff just waste sunnier way brighter way more upbeat there are a few tracks on here that have a kind of psychedelic jam sessions on them that I like a lot however in terms of songwriting I just thought that are some potholes on this record and you know just overall in terms of sound in terms of tone in terms of style this record is just kind of woods like usual and and I felt that if I did a review of this new record I kind of just be saying a lot of the same things that I've said about the past few records you know I wasn't blown away by it I didn't love it I thought it was fine I thought it was decent and you know again like I said with their last LP when I reviewed that Woods is just kind of one of those bands that changes their sound and evolves incrementally however the change in between this record and their last one is so incremental that I just didn't see any reason and just making a review again it's not a bad record and if you're looking for indie flavored folk rock with some psychedelic undertones then this thing is worth looking up but don't be surprised if you dig into their back catalogue if this is your intro to them and find that a lot of their older stuff sounds a little too similar to you the new Odonis Odonis record I thought this LP was an interesting mix a lot of dark underground rock styles from post-punk to noise rock to gothic rock to industrial it was just a little too hit or miss in terms of songwriting for me I thought that the band tended to where their influences on their sleeves a little too much to the point where this record as a whole is kind of drowning in its influences a little bit you know there's no one sound or idea or theme or persona that I get out of this LP it's kind of like this mixed bag this sampler of like post-punk / gothic rock styles from the late 70s early mid 80s there definitely are standout tracks on here like are we friends you know killer single but I'm waiting for the band to kind of come together with a more uniform distinct sound that is the thread that runs through all the tracks that they write next the new autopsy record death metal band classic death metal band they had a few death metal classics under their belts check them out I ended up passing on this LP not because I thought it was bad or anything like that sir better than their last album which had a few tracks on it that I thought ended abruptly weren't really all that fleshed out or kind of got boring in the midst of hearing them play out this new LP of theirs I think is built a little better I'm noticing some harmonized guitar solos on this thing or just a little more melody in general of course autopsy as one of the best drummers in death metal autopsy also has one of the most gruesome vocalists in death metal and when it comes to those two things they do live up to the standards that they have set in the past however this is just really autopsy as usual for me I felt that aside from just more fleshed out songs and a little more melodic color I was pretty much going to be saying a lot of the same stuff about this record that I did their past record not saying that's a bad thing if you are a death metal fan give this thing a listen but you probably already know this record exists because I mean if you're a huge death metal fan you kind of have to know who the hell autopsy is next the new Teebs LP unfortunately I did end up passing on this but if you are looking for wonky ambient electronic beat music off of brain-fever records then do give this LP a listen while I think that this record is more interesting than Teebs past work that tended to be just a jumble of shorter tracks a jumble of shorter tracks assembled in a pretty large group these songs felt a little more fleshed out a little more structured to me still that the tone of the record wasn't that gripping or wasn't that interesting I mean at best it sort of is pretty mood setting background music but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing I mean as far as music that kind of hangs in the air you could definitely do much worse even though these tracks didn't really hold my interest I do think that Teebs does have a way with sound craft as a lot of people on brain Peter records do you know there are some very pretty beautiful and just gorgeous sounds littered throughout these beats finally to close out the nucleus record food this LP for me was a bit of an interesting one it was a surprise in that there is a lot of sonic variety on this thing there's a country ballad on this thing as you would expect there are popular tracks there are smoother more soulful neo-soul there are contemporary R&B tracks on this thing however I think at this point in her career instrumentally and songwriting lines as well Cleese's is maybe at her most dynamic and organic as well this record really feels like a very personal intimate record from kelis however I think every musical side of this album you know it depicts different genres and different flavors across the record with each song kind of being named after a different food to sort of reference oh this song has a certain flavor the song has certain mood the songs are certain this the song is certain that to sort of run with that analogy there were some foods on the menu that just had more spice than others while some felt kind of run-of-the-mill or bland or like whoa I could get this kind of chicken anywhere however I just mean that in terms of the song and the instrumentation vocally police I think is still steps ahead than a lot of new singers that people are making a big deal of in contemporary R&B now and those are all the records that I guess I wanted to touch down on cool cool transition if you given these LPS listen what did you think of any of them did you love them did you hate them why and have a nice day Anthony Fantana why you know review that wasn't too bad sorry forever 
4-Ds7dKjIRE,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Damon Albarn record everyday robots setup question punchline Damon Albarn famed singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist you may be already very very very familiar with his work from bands like blur and gorillas they dropped their last album a few years ago actually Plastic Beach nice little electro pop hip hop record fusion and a great record to close things out before Damon Albarn kind of put gorillas on an indefinite hiatus but Anthony what about this huh huh what no no I have no idea what you're talking about total dick well now the gorillas is on hold Damon is focusing more on solo endeavors which I mean it's cool even though Damon Albarn isn't gorillas technically you could in theory get just as excited over a Damon Albarn solo LP considering that he did a great deal of the songwriting and the instrumentation that went into those gorillas records so any solo Damon Albarn material could feasibly be like gorillas material right but that's not really what happens here at all instead with albums like dr. D he's embracing his singer/songwriter side his opera side his choral music side and with this latest full-length LP of his his singer/songwriter side remains but it is much dreary er much more depressing and electronically tinged to with synthetic beats some of them are subtly glitchy I guess you could say some of these tracks are a little trip hop or downtempo but no matter how far down that road Damon goes on this LP this record still doesn't stray away from that solo singer/songwriter vibe too much and overall this is a record whose music perfectly reflects the cover the songs here are grey they're moody heads down no reason to look up no reason to like look forward into the future the one exception on this record though is the song mr. tremble Oh which once it comes on it is a huge change of pace in that it feels like I'm listening to Sunkist Caribbean flavored island pop Damon's voice sounds a little too weary to give it that upbeat feel that it's really shooting for not to mention the instrumentation sounds like the Wiggles are playing it this track is the one significant moment of emotional variety in the middle of this record and it falls flat on its face the only other left hook on this record is the closing track heavy seas of love where Damon is actually still on his choral pop kick maybe that actually isn't too much of a left hook since that was on his last record as well but still it does vary from the formula of many songs on this album and even though a lot of the vocals on here feel a little too theater they feel a little too train I do think they add a lot to the song and it is a beautiful song and Damon sounds really passionate over the chorus as he's singing the heavy seas of love refrain even though the record is a little hit or miss I do like that this song comes through and and at least leaves things off with a very big grand feel good mood outside of those two tracks the forecast for this record is in the low 60s it's overcast there's a drizzle with a slight chance of this album is like listening to one long sigh get let out over really beautiful instrumentation it's so one-dimensional in that regard and even though the the depression it does feel very real this record does feel very bleak it's it's not so strong that it really grips me or moves me emotionally it's just kind of like I'm I'm listening to a fly buzz in the room which I am inhabiting and I don't know where the fly is I can't see it but every once in a while I'm just hearing just like this really annoying emotional itch scratching in the back of my head I would say that I have zero patience for whatsoever if it weren't for the fact that Damon actually backs some of these gloomy moments up with decent songs like the song everyday robots the title track the opener on this record I like the eerie string melodies that are looped and played throughout this song the patient be the sad piano the rhythm is like a bit of a noisy very colorful rhythmic Trail Mix dis really nutty and vocally this is one of the few moments where demons blasé attitude actually is a little intoxicating the lyrics do kind of focus on the current world's follies and technology which there were some songs on Plastic Beach that dealt with that these issues of modern identity Damon essentially painting people as everyday robots who are just going through a routine and texting sexting and if you really wanted to confirm the sadness on this LP no need to look any further than the song lonely press play a song that's kind of about music as a refuge at least how I interpret it the groove is a little smoother on this track than it is on others acoustic guitars blend with piano really nicely and this track has of course the stuck in my head from first listen and there's a moment lyrically in the pre-chorus to this song where Damon is singing a line that has me thinking is is he singing about fans sort of using his music as kind of like a shoulder to cry on or something to kind of get them through the day whether he's reaching out to people who listen to him or sort of just talking about more of a personal experience it is a beautiful track songs like hollow ponds and photographs continue to impress me from a songwriting standpoint however there are tracks on here where there isn't much about them other than the instrumentation that grips me when it comes to the vocal melody when it comes to the lyrics I mean Damon Albarn comes off pretty uninteresting kind of boring just nothing really to report like The Selfish Giant and you and me I love the distant fluttering flute melodies on the former patch that I actually think the beat kind of outshines Damon on this song it's it's just literally more interesting than what he's doing with his voice and then with you and me while I do like the descending keyboard melodies on that track they're kind of weird odd experimental I think they bring a lot of flavor to the song there is a god-awful steel drum solo in the middle of the track that completely ruins the vibe of the song I'm assuming that the steel drum is synthesized whether it is or it isn't it is not a good addition to the song overall this record consistently brings seductively sad songs with instrumentation that is very smooth it's tasteful its well assembled some of the samples here and there feel a little bulky but I think it adds to the glitchy tone of the tracks the damon does make these songs feel a little rough in some respects despite their very soft nature but as i've said sometimes through the soft instrumentation a gripping song or gripping melody or lyric doesn't even shine through and while there are highlights on this record good songs and I do think this record is emotionally potent at least when it comes to the instrumentation sometimes I feel like Damon's vocals are just a little too drained in the way that I feel like sometimes the vocals are a little too drained on like a national record or something like that but I mean obviously to an extent I'm sure that is intentional I mean how can you not expect some kind of apathy or bleakness coming from the music with an album cover like this representing it still I mean I guess I have a hard time being enthralled by such expression or lack thereof which I guess is kind of the point feeling of strong five to a light six on this thing transition oh hey sorry I totally up the color balance on this video seems to be fixed now but you know got to get through these things Damon Albarn everyday robots music would you think of this record love you hey have a nice day forever 
h64DvnMaCnU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Andrew Jackson jihad record Christmas Island Christmas coming early this year hey you know good try betting on that not really a good joke they did shut up Andrew Jackson jihad Arizona band that I've been following for a little while now this is their latest full-length LP out on side one dummy records if you give a listen to their stuff expect to hear some Punk flavored folk or what some people would call anti folk and artistically and in terms of recognition Andrew Jackson jihad comes out ahead of a lot of bands that also get this label and I think it's for a few reasons for one the last few records have been taking on heavier more ambitious just harder hitting production which i think has brought the emotional impact of their songs so much higher but even strip back Andrew Jackson Jihad's tracks still have a lot of punch thanks to the depressing sad bitter and clever lyricism of their frontman Sean bonnet his voice is not for everybody it's kind of a weakling voice but he does embrace this flaw wholeheartedly and I think uses it to his advantage to catch catch catch catch to give his lyrics a certain kind of tone and even though he's not the most technically skilled singer ever he does have a very good grasp of folk song writing and punk energy I just find his lyrics to be incredibly thought-provoking smart witty and there are a few songwriters out there that I think as well as him depict this sad hilarity in just really terrible situations addiction racism hate depression family people who are lonely the downtrodden the self-center the self-loathing to me sean songs are just perfect depictions of the highs and the lows of the human condition and just really obsessed with it with the two extremes so with their most ambitious album yet knife man directly behind them I was anticipating this latest record wondering what they're going to do next would there still be a lot of personal stories and fears delivered on this record what the production still be really grand going into this record I had these questions and and maybe they weren't the best questions to have because this is my least favorite Andrew Jackson jihad records since their debut and it's for a few different reasons but the main one comes down to production and instrumentation this new record of theirs is put together so methodically and so plainly that there's very little in the way of drama or finesse coming from the guitars from the really generic piano embellishments that happen throughout the cell P and the drumming - it just all feels so incredibly reserved and doesn't really reflect the emotional wreck that Sean and these songs really are instrumentally this is Andrew Jackson jihads most middle-of-the-road record yet the song Temple Grandin that opens this hashed up while I don't mind this track songwriting wise I think it is one of the better songs on the entire record the track instrumentally just feels so flat and distorted and compressed it kind of sounds like I'm listening to the mountain goats do a Neutral Milk Hotel cover like how in 1945 or something like that it's just not really a flattering sound for Andrew Jackson jihad while I guess they wanted to make a song that just buzzed and was kind of rough around the edges there's like no momentum there's no explosiveness to the instrumentation on this thing I feel like there's kind of a limit to the fidelity on tracks like I want to rock out in my dreams - which tries to have these really explosive crescendos backed up by these grand tubular bells what sound like tubular bells not only is the instrumentation on this track not that grand but this song features some of Sean's biggest lyrical potholes like saying I miss you and I can even rhyme that with kiss you a lyric whose self-awareness doesn't really save it for being a cringe-worthy moment it's really like Andrew Jackson jihad was trying to write their pop record on this album or at least an album that feels better than other Andrew Jackson jihad releases the most self-deprecating moment on this entire LP is the closer where Sean is talking about how he's a salad glove he's the Forever Lazy he's this pointless and useless and worthless thing that shouldn't be saved which is nowhere near the level of personal suffering that's been displayed on previous releases I mean to me the best song in this entire record is Linda constat which is this track where sean is is talking about losing his and just crying and being moved deeply by a beautiful piece of art in a museum lyrically it's a hilarious song but this track in a way is sort of about something positive and that's fine there's nothing wrong with making positive music and music should not simply be valued by whether or not it makes you sad or how much the singer hates himself or just how authentically depressing the music feels in my head what I'm thinking of is what emotion is being depicted and how well does it depict it but while this album doesn't really seem like a depressing record that's angrily pointing its bony-ass finger at the world's flaws it's not really a record you would put on if you wanted to be in a good mood either because there is still a lot of just very disturbing lyricism on this LP which I will say is is most likely the strongest thing this record has going for it like on the refrain to the song Temple Grandin which defined a nicer way to kill it coda is absolutely genius if you google who Temple Grandin is I like the lyrical theme on the song Kokopelli face tattoo about all these horrible things that won't necessarily suck any less just because you hate them so why waste the energy and getting naked playing with guns is a great track as well and weirdly enough lifts a melody from the cars track just what I needed tastefully and I love the very morbid imagery that comes into play on the songs all the suicide and all the cult themes that are on that track or played out in the same sort of sad yet hilarious way that I typically expect and enjoy in Andrew Jackson jihad songs sean is definitely still a riveting and a passionate storyteller with a lot of flair and a lot of personality but I also think on these tracks on this record overall there are more non sequiturs than usual - that don't really add up into the theme of the song at least as to how I interpret it anyway and let me also say there are some tracks on here that try things different with instrumentation and with sound for Andrew Jackson jihad real left hooks for them but I think they are severe misses on this record some of my least favorite Andrew Jackson jihad songs ever like the song coffin dance which to me sounds like a really lackluster shoo-shoo song or the track deathless where I think Shawn is really pushing his vocal abilities to sing kind of this desert rock tune with these elongated vocal harmonies over the chorus what do you have you know this record starts off relatively strong finishes with two really good tracks but it's just littered with tracks that I'm just feeling are very very hit-or-miss throughout the middle I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing unfortunately transition if you've given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Andrew Jackson jihad Christmas Island forever 
sVZ5oiYKc5g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bad bad not good record 3 bad bad not good is a toronto-based jazz trio this is a third record if you haven't figured that out it's out on innovative leisure records and you might remember back in 2011 these guys were making waves doing instrumental reinterpretations of hip hop instrumentals from artists like nas and odd future and they were also going a step further and covering like video game music from the Zelda Ocarina of Time soundtrack the production was good the performances were tight these guys definitely value raw energy and just explosive electrifying togetherness then they did flashy solos or anything like that but the quality of the performances and the playing and the solos all got turned up on the band's next full-length LP BB ng - and on this sophomore record the band also experimented with putting some more original material on the LP as well as taking out covers from James Blake and Kanye West even My Bloody Valentine on the final track here and lately these guys been doing backing instrumentation and production for other artists as well like Earl Pharoahe Monch and lately they've had some really awesome Flying Lotus and tonight covers that I've been hearing them pull out in the live setting as well so at the moment bad bad not good is sitting at this really interesting crossroads of jazz and hip hop and modern electronic music and interpreting a lot of this stuff they're just a really fearsome Punk spirit and all these flavors come together on this new record of theirs that is 100% original material but maybe not quite as jazz oriented as I was expecting or hoped bass piano and drums still work as the foundation of bad bad not good sound but they work in a lot of other sounds as well like sub base hits and guitar and saxophone and what sounds like strings this is bad bad not goods most instrumentally lush release however there doesn't seem to be as much of a focus on the solos on this LP or just jamming in general now there are some solos on the cell that do stand out and do sort of you know really take the spotlight like the upright bass solo on the song eyes closed or the bass and drum jam on the song kaleidoscope and there's the song differently still which is a bit of a an old school jazz oasis in the middle of this LP where the trio is sounding like a trio from the 1960s now even though there are solos on this record that standout in bad bad not good definitely make room for them in the mix in the structure of the song the band is obviously just working with a different formula now they've moved beyond improving over other people's stuff that they are recreating and are now just creating their own original material and because of that it seems like they're more focused on just making a good song that sounds very nice as opposed to coming together with a fiery performance of said song take the song confessions for example which has Leyland Witte on at playing saxophone frequent collaborator with bad bad not good however his playing on this track is I don't know just a little tame little uninvented and comparison with what I've heard and do with the band before yes it definitely breaks up the sequence of these tracks by bringing a nice bright beautifully sounding saxophone into the mix but it's not like an explosion of a track for me despite the very pretty and smooth swells of sax drums pianos and bass on a lot of the choruses of this track and and I do love the very hypnotic saxophone cycles that Leyland is playing through on the song it's just really obvious that bad bad not good is more worried about composition on this record than they are improvisation and it's not necessarily a bad thing because the effort does show like the song kaleidoscope which starts off with these are Lee Chile keyboards and eventually builds up into these saxophone melodies these saxophone harmonies that sound like something out of Frank Zappa's hot rats the instrumentation on this track is really just rich it's really grand it's beautiful then there's the song eyes closed which has this really dreary you reverb so guitar playing throughout at the band builds up to a really climactic finish at the end it's really in my opinion a quality nod to post rock and then there's the song since you asked kindly which isn't one of my favourite tracks on here it's not really a riveting song for me it gets a little redundant in the mid section with these repetitive key our leads but it's one of the more unexpected tracks for me on this record because it takes kind of an instrumental synth pop direction with the analog production it sounds like the song was recorded 40 years ago or something and then there's songs on this record like can't leave the night which is one of the lead singles to this LP and on this song bad bad not good essentially come up with their own version of a banger with these keyboard melodies that sound like they were taken straight out of a Flying Lotus song and these sub bass lines that hit once the drop comes that feel like they were pulled straight out of tonight track and the track is fine it's decent I've given a multiple listen since it was originally released on the Internet but as I listen to in the context of this record many times I can't say I'm really excited with the song beyond the concept of it it's like bad bad not good is really trying to refine the banger trying to refine this hard-hitting bombastic thing and it doesn't end up subtle enough to be seductive and yet it's not hard-hitting enough to the point where I flip or I just go crazier I get this rush of energy once the drop comes and the same kind of goes for the song cs6 t2 which kind of shoots for the same formula but is much more ambitious with a more expansive song structure tons of strings that help bring the song to a climactic finish but here as well bad bad not good try like hell to fit these sub bass sounds into the song and a logical and tasteful way but it's just short of actually being so with this LP overall I'm not in love with it but it's not really like a huge disappointment for me or anything like that I thought it was good I think bad bad not good still brought a lot of positive characteristics to the table for one the production is fantastic I think they blend their influences creatively there's a lot of sound play on this record I think stylistically bad bad not good continue to be adventurous and I think it's really interesting that they're incorporating just nothing but original material on this LP and most of its really good but on this new record or there's I don't think bad bad not good really puts the performance fire into these tracks that they usually do other people's material weirdly enough or other older original tracks like rotten decay for example and because of that this record can kind of be a little mundane sometimes every guy on this LP feels so methodically planned and feels so measured that even the high points even the the climaxes of the record just kind of hang in the yellow but still I can see even that being a turn-on for other people you know this is bad bad not goods most orchestrated LP it's also their moodiest LP I was just hoping for a bit more emotional and instrumental variety on this record and just maybe some stronger playing but that's about it I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantan oh I'm not good forever 
CDnmljiOutY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for me to list off some of my favorite records of April great albums as you already know April's dead and gone it's May and an April was was an unprecedented month for me oh I had so many records I thought were great maybe I was just uh maybe I was too lenient I don't know I mean maybe I was maybe I was just just just ready to fall in love I have no clue but man I just I just loved a whole ton of releases this past month I was just feeling so good man but whatever whatever let's just talk about these freakin albums that I thought were great for one the new tune-yards record Nicky nack such a colorful explosive experimental eccentric in-your-face pop record with a lot of attitude great lyrics fun personality the colors Duke the colors just such a fun vibrant record if you're looking for a pop album that just pulls out all the stops then give this thing a listen like I said in my review this is the shot in the arm pop music needed this year to really just turn up next the Carla Basel ik record boy really dark dismal depressing record I love it though oh god do I love it Carla's voice the really strange woozy off-kilter instrumentation just such an emotional impact of a record and it's just this really tortured insane vibes true insanity going on with this record really in a lot of respects it is it is pretty disturbing and I love it for that reason next the new Thant effects atthe record sacred white noise what a solid black metal LP on here and not just a black metal LP but a bit of progressive rock in this mix on this record as well some really great bass lines that stick out and play a really important role in the mix just great recording great guitar tone really fearsome primal drums and some nice accompaniment from keys here and there as well strings to just really well put together solid ambitious black metal record not the boldest thing you're gonna hear from a group from the West right now but still just a very well put together nicely perform just lightly executed black metal record alright the ideals record prayer for terrine these guys are from Australia just metalcore noise core extreme core destroy everything in your face core with some saxophones mixed into the background too and a few tracks that just sort of you know are off the beaten path and kind of vary away from that and some pretty ambitious songs on this record too you know these guys are pretty progressive for a band that seeks out to make this much freakin noise this is an intense record this record just does not show you any daylight whatsoever it's just destructive album destructive toward emotions toward mental things this record lives up to the word extreme in about every way that I think it it can you know just don't go into this record lightly expect a sonic beatdown alright following that up the new girl talking freeway EP what a badass hard-hitting catchy as hell hip hop PP haven't heard from freeway in a while haven't heard from Girl Talk in a while and especially haven't heard from them together it's great to your Girl Talk making beats again and also making really concise succinct hip hop beats with great hooks great grooves really flashy colorful samples throughout the beats as well and freeways sounding re-energized and really amped up as well yeah he's not the most flashy or clever lyricist a lot of his lyrics are really violent they're in your face they're blunt they're straightforward but I think they work over this style a very colorful kind of fruity production takes the edge off a little bit makes it kind of fun just a really great freakin EP also the Rat King record so it goes really progressive psychedelic experimental interesting New York hip-hop record right here these guys are forward-thinking and to me that there aren't a lot of artists out there right now that have this sound there are a few tracks on here that we're kind of a turn-off to me like Puerto Rican judo and after watching the dead-end Hip Hop review of this record I did come to realize how scatterbrained the flow of this LP is but still in my opinion songs like protein canal as well as remove your rank as some of the most interesting hip-hop songs I've heard this year so if you're looking for something from New York that is weird it's off kilter and it's definitely trying something new especially with the beats give this record to listen next the new timber tambour record hot dreams this is to me Americana nostalgia gothic that's all I can say about this record it's like listening to old vocal pop tunes from the 50s but redone in the dreariest de strangest most unsettling way possible and while Taylor Kirk is is still a really good songwriter on this LP you know he's really good at writing tunes good at writing hooks he has a great command of melody and I love his just voice I think what really makes this record stand out in the timber timber discography is just how ambitious the instrumentation on this thing is the strings are beautiful the keyboards are beautiful the horns on this record are beautiful just the the instrumentation is just so lush and just wonderfully assembled and put together on this LP even though there are some songs on this record that I think pale in comparison to others I think that timber timber could be doing more to write a record that is a bit more of a thematic of an experience a bit more of a holistic experience but still not one track on here I think falters in terms of just the sound and the production of the instrumentation and finally the new white hinterland record baby another really solidly put together artpop record with really great singing I think catchy tunes there are some wonderful ballads as well on this record I don't think it's the most cutting-edge thing you're going to hear this year but it is incredibly consistent with just good songs good singing good execution good writing and those are essentially my favourite records of this year so if you're in the mood for some hip hop for some metal for some noisy stuff for some interesting pop music then then head down there in the description box give these albums a listen explore them check out the reviews and and see which one of them resonate with you you know again this videos up just for anyone who might have missed any of these reviews because they do tend to put out a lot every month transition what were some of your favorite records from this April let me know you're the best anthony

RO4Gc_tF6Ck,they said hey buddy you'll get out of here I know Roos Oh Cal you are so funny sexy and tough I'm so lucky to have you as my long-distance internet boyfriend I know baby girl Cal is one head chicken and okb I got a goal all right will I see you tonight oh you know why I got it I got a YouTube channel too right over here [Music] you have a long-distance girlfriend right now how many of these calls are you going to make and are you going to be interrupting the start of every review now yes let's in probably at least I know uh where did you even meet her bill I BRE how did you meet at the library if the relationship can grease when did you go to the library of debt Jeff can you meet people on the library they have a chat room oh the chat room makes perfect sense let me do this review before I go freaking insane this is the latest full-length LP from Sleaford mods divided exit they are a Nottingham duo hailing from the UK obviously and their dynamic is is pretty simple producer Andrew fern puts together these really simple grimy minimal beats built out of sequence drum machines or like loops and murky bassline and occasional synthesizer here and there and Jason Williamson who with this really thick ass accent spits this rapid-fire blue-collar vitriol against rich people and work and his surroundings and privileged people and music scenes and people who spend all their time on social media and a slew of other things from the sound of his rants it would seem that the list of things that don't make him angry is shorter than the list of things that do and even though their approach seems super basic super stripped-down super simple I kind of love it the vocals are in your face there there shouted they're not screamed or overly aggressive to the point where they're like unintelligible you could still very much tell what Jason is saying if you can read past his accent I know they're going to be some people out there have no freaking clue what he's saying I would call a spoken word but it's it's really more like shouted word and there is a decent amount of variety among the instrumentals that Andrew produces like with song airconditioning which has this beat that just plods along really mechanically and has all these distorted bass guitars with Jason's voice on top of it all distorted too like it's coming through a really old loudspeaker or something or the song tied up in knots which has a punch of your drumbeat it's a little cleaner in terms of the sound of the instrumentation there is a very very very subtle synthesizer part that plays in the background and some really strong out warp guitars that kind of find their way into the track as it progresses just finding like tiny little subtle ways to add flavor to the song beyond Jason's yelling the beyond Corgi definitely sticks out because of the shuffling drum beyond that one and there are songs on here like you're brave where the beats and the synthesizers they take an overtly electronic approach it doesn't feel like there's a natural organic sound in the entire set Sleaford mods really do a lot with just a little and that's what their sound and that's what their songwriting style - the beats on this record do not really change up that much from the beginning to the end of the song they don't really progress that much and rarely do they ever shift to make room for a chorus or something like that if there's ever a chorus on any of these tracks that is if there is one it's usually just sort of Jason shouting some kind of refrain with no warning whatsoever because you really don't know when his rants are going to end the repetitive grooves on these tracks merely just kind of set a mood and lay a foundation for Jason's very over-the-top rants and even though I wish the beats just did a little bit more to steal the show away from Jason occasionally I still think this record is one of the more refreshing things I've heard this year it is incredibly bold it is unique in a sense but it is not without its forefathers I think the very post punky instrumentation and the endless rants at the Vogel's bring to the table sound a lot like the fall numerous fall records it's it's kind of like the falls formula 280 except the beats are obviously looped and electronic and the fall never really stepped past that spoken word border that Sleaford mods obviously do and there are moments where the really intense vocals on this record and how charged they are with a particular viewpoint how they're really shoving it in the listeners face it reminds me a bit of like a crash record but obviously with a very different viewpoint and even though Sleaford mods definitely wear their influences on their sleeves I think they get away with it just a little bit just because of how much personality they have they have tons of personality it's essentially what this record runs on if you're not into the personality of this record there's very little here musically that you're going to appreciate instead you're either going to connect very deeply with a lot of what Jason is saying and it's going to make you laugh it's going to make you angry or you will be turned off completely and Jason's words on this thing they're explosive they're clever I think they're entertaining I think they're biting they're satirical I think there's a lot to read into with what he's saying it's kind of like listening to a really good stand-up routine where there's obviously some sentences and some context being ripped out just to make the whole thing move faster but some lines some lyrics do stick out of his very speedy diatribes like how he says right at the opening track here he can't believe that the rich still exist much less run the  country he also talks about the stink of piss being so strong that it smells like decent bacon and then he goes into this weird Kevin Bacon reference he yells about jerking off in someone else's toilet he's laughing to himself about portraits of Debbie Harry being on sale he's yelling about local art he's saying the chumbawamba weren't political they were just crap but in the midst of these songs that are just relentlessly hitting me with one sentence one idea after another there are songs on here to stick to a pretty clear concept like under the plastic and NCT where he is crapping all over music scenes everything from the venue's to kind of the scenesters that show up to these shows there's the song tweet tweet tweet I'm sure you can guess what that's about and also livable which I think has one of the most hilarious points of view of any track on this entire LP where he starts the song off talking about how okay you go to the bathroom you stink it up and then the smell kind of goes out of the bathroom and fills the air but before it hits your nose there's like 10 yards or so fresh air in between you and the bathroom so it's not like so strong it's not so disgusting and Jason refers to that as a livable things being horrible but not so horrible that you can't just like subtly tolerate it yeah it kind of scratches at the back of your mind driving you insane slowly it's moments and themes like this that I wish came out a little stronger on a lot of these tracks not taint ain't ain't ain't say that there aren't recurring ideas on a lot of these tracks I mean many of these songs deal with just this general malaise and aggravation with the life that Jason leads I love the idea of this album I love the oddity of it I think it's hilarious I think it's funny I think it's entertaining however it's it's also an incredibly one-dimensional album and a lot of songs on here pale in comparison to others with roughly every track on this record going for the same formula this record gets kind of predictable it doesn't keep up the excitement I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next my dog is coughing right now my god are you okay Anthony Fantana Sleaford mods forever 
PhCE3XxgHSQ,hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album more than any other day this is the debut full-length album from Montreal based post-punk art Punk outfit outfit on earlier this year they hit me with a few songs from this forthcoming record that got me scratching my chin not just because there's hair on it so I'm just it sounded like these guys were picking up a lot of cues from the vocals of guys like David Byrne of talking heads with this really eccentric erratic delivery and some pretty unusual lyrics to that center around some odd topics or everyday life or some hilarious statements take the title track of the song where the vocals tell the listener the title of the song and then say that the listener should open up the text books or a magazine whatever reading material they can get their hands on it's completely absurd it's ridiculous it's funny it's clever it's smart it's interesting it's off the beaten path that reminds me of my boys over here an MX 80 sound or like some of the mid-eighties slacker groups out there like camper van Beethoven I don't know and the same spoken-word eccentricity shows up as well on the song around again where we're getting some thought-provoking statements on the subject of god those are just the lyrics though musically it sounds like pulls from artists like cap and jazz or even Slynt a lot more the band occasionally writes songs like the track habit that are based off these very slow loosely played instrumental builds that get more intense as the band continues layering on keyboards and violin especially toward the back end of this track where the song gets very Velvet Underground s but the vocals on top of this musical moment are much more manic and there are other spots on here too where the band brings much more tightly grooved tracks with more nimble bass lines and very detailed drumbeats reminded me of bands like the feel ease or even mission of Burma you know that more artsy side of punk rock this happens on the song the weather song I love the head-bobbing groove on this track and I love the transition in this song from the verse to the chorus as the band brings in these punching keyboard chords and the way that the band plays through the track is interesting too it's like they're repeating the same parts over and over but as they get closer to the finish there they're just playing a little more intense a little louder just digging in a little harder I like that the recording on this record tries to maintain kind of a live-in-the-moment feel even if it is a little messy or a little too cacophonous at times with the drums and the guitars swallowing the vocals a little bit more than I would like them to and when things get loud the drums and the guitars clash a little awkwardly as well there are just moments where I think the recording could be better but for the most part it does sound enjoyably raw the band continues to deliver decent songs but even with these newer tracks the comparisons to other artists out there don't really stop at least in my head like the song forgiveness which is this wandering sort of directionless ballad that floats atop this bed of violin phrases that reminds me a little bit of Simon Joyner especially with how the vocals are just moaning really painfully and you know even though I know it's really hard for a modern band not to sound like at least someone in the past I guess the strong similarities to other artists that I'm hearing and just the plethora of different artists that it seems like awed may or may not listen to it can get a little distracting for me from time to time and I guess that's because I don't really find Ott's approach all that distinct though I do think they do their influences justice there are even moments on this LP like the opening track with the really bouncy sort of dreary guitar phrasing toward the back end of the song that really reminds me of women another great experimental sort of off-kilter lo-fi indie rock band from Canada again I think this band channels its influences really well for the most part I think they do them justice I think they write some good slow burners I think there are some moments here where they create a really nice ruckus and top it with some interesting lyrical ideas but is the ruckus always memorable there are some moments here where I think no but for the most part yes though I do think this is a relatively solid record there are some parts here where it feels like I'm trying to draw their instrumentation out which they do a lot on this LP the songs on here are not incredibly short or anything like that there are six or seven five minute tracks on this LP the two shorter songs on here just about four minutes so as the band is drawing out these instrumental moments on these longer songs they can lose steam here and there still I am feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ought forever 
d1kwJtkFtwA,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future record honest future is a rapper he's based in Atlanta I've known about him for a couple years now back when he was getting hype off of a few big singles from his pluto record like the song same damn time which is this trap flavored ear worm of track the song was as hilarious in concept as it was catchy and even though it was not the most lyrical track in the world the drug boy lyrics were entertaining and the beat freaking banged however there was another side to future sound that I did not care for at all sound that came through on singles like turn on the lights a track that when it dropped I remember a lot of people commending it for being a nice song devoid of swears and expletives a sort of a love song and I guess you could call it a love song you could say the future yeah he doesn't swear he's not really dirty or filthy on this track but he also isn't isn't really singing or or rapping I have no clue what he's doing his barely coherent vocal delivery is obscured even further by the auto-tune he throws all over his voice on this track because even as the auto-tune does bring a melody it barely works to cover up future's god-awful singing behind it but this is the closest thing future has to an original sound and it is the sound that really kind of has him popping off a lot more than same damn time songs like this have been getting him tons of play in the club and because of that I can only assume that this is the direction future is going to move in with his future stuff so going into this new record of his I wasn't expecting very much and and I didn't get very much I barely even got a little now if you'll allow me to be honest the only good song on this record the one good song on this record is move that dope perfect drug-dealing soundtracks stellar beat for Mike will made it really dark grimy baseline love the drums on this track too future is is like legit rapping on this song he's coming through with a pretty straightforward flow it's not amazing it's not hence it's not energetic it just kind of works it serves its purpose as he intros the track but then push a tee just assist assist barrels through and just steals the whole show with a really well-written verse knows better knows he knows better on the cocaine nice wordplay there also the rhyme scheme that he does with fish scale fish tail and the designer that he misspells there's a bar here where he says he was Versace before me goes Pharrell's versus pretty funny and casino as usual if you're not familiar with him does come through the verse that emphasizes energy over lyrical content which is fine casinos all right but as far as the rest of the record goes the features are incredibly weak or underwhelming or even mistreated like the song never satisfied with Drake like Drake just sort of sing raps a few bars on this track with future interjecting occasionally assign really a verse it's more just sort of a hook a hook but not quite a hook and the song just fades out before even the two-minute mark arrives it's like this track only exists to have Drake listed on this record it's an incredibly lazy pointless song that just says to me Wow future doesn't care the people putting this record together don't really care which is sad because in the list of people on this record Drake is is easily one of the better rappers dark times I know then there's Andre 3000 on the back end of this LP where I mean his verse is fine it's not one of the better verses I've heard him do but this is essentially an Andre 3000 track with future appearing every so often and Andre has just given his guest verses away to people who don't deserve it especially on a beat like this why would he say yes to this instrumental it's so shoddily mixed and put together it's so flat sounding there's a wiz khalifa verse on this record that's laughable but what's even worse is the kanye verse it's really on the bottom rung of this LP in terms of features first he comes through with this trophy wife trophy life line making it really apparent right from the get-go that it is phoned in and he doesn't really care and then there's a line deeper into the verse where he is talking about how Kim has slept with these sports players before him we makes him feel like he scores whenever he's sleeping with her essentially trying to make light of the fact that everybody hit it before him Wow even twisted through Kanye's point of view the image is still not flattering it's ridiculous but not as ridiculous as features auto-tune falsettos that sound like whale calls in the middle of the ocean so the guest rappers do not save this record but the instrumentals don't either not that they're bad I think a lot of them are actually very well put together and could do well on any other Atlanta rappers album but future just does not complement them at all he ruins them he just distracts from what might make some of the beats on here good one of the better beats on here the intro look-ahead really great instrumental I love the vocal sampling in the background of this track the track rhythm sound fantastic but there are moments in his verses where future is just shouting over this beat and isn't even on tempo and there are other songs on here where I mean essentially in terms of futures flow and just the sound of the beat like the song t-shirt I mean it's it's just about as generic as Atlanta rap gets right now and the biggest single on this entire LP honest essentially is just kind of a repeat of the formula that future did on tracks like same damn time which I mean is fine it's a good formula it's catchy it's memorable it just kind of sticks in your head it's another earworm kind of track but I'm not finding this song as entertaining as same damn time as ridiculous or as over-the-top or as funny aside from the ear warm of just being honest do we really care about anything the future says in between the repeats of just being honest just being honest just being honest to be honest I don't think most people do nobody's really eating in his bars and being like oh yeah he said that hmm the future is definitely not a good lyricist he's definitely not a good singer not without auto-tune anyway and he barely comes through with an interesting flow most of the time on this record there's never a moment on the cell P where he just really goes hard or sounds exciting or really sounds thrilling on the microphone and on top of that he tries to come through with some of these really awful just like ear grading ballads on this thing like trophy wife with Kanye and I bu you know when it comes to this kind of stuff to bring it back to me those again I would rather listen to them because at least they have some electricity between their flows as they hop from one verse to another verse to another verse at least there's a bit more energy there's a bit more excitement to what's happening with them with future a booth between all the really unmemorable bars between all the really unmemorable bars and the tone-deaf moaning set to auto-tune I'm not seeing what's to like about this record and the song blood sweat tears really brings it home and I think makes a statement it didn't really intend to make where future is essentially saying he wishes everybody could see the blood and the sweat and the tears that went into this record he's saying I wish everybody could see it and you know I'm going to have to because I cannot hear it I think this song and maybe this record in general is a show that you can literally bust your ass off and not make a single good sound which is why it's important to work smarter and not harder I'm feeling a strong to to a light 3 on this record transition if you've given honest to listen what did you think about it be honest Anthony Fantana future forever 
yS27JEUJXXc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tune yards wrecker Minuten yards record Nicky nack this is the third full-length LP from multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter merrill Garbus in this project as well as her bassist and frequent collaborator Nate Brenner and even though tune-yards is only a few albums deep into this project so far they have already built a really strong name for themselves and in a really distinct sound for one very lively layer drum beats that are pulled straight out of the African tradition the rhythms on this record are just so detailed they're rickety they're noisy but they're really nicely executed and tightly pulled together the grooves on this thing are are irresistible whether the drums are live or we're getting some drum loops or there are some synthetic drums being woven into the mix with a lot of the melodies of these tracks being brought by Merrill's voice or some light synthesizer accompaniment or Nate's bass lines and the lyrics on this thing I like a lot too I think there's a lot to like with what merrill Garbus is saying on this record sometimes the songs on here address some sort of personal struggle like on the opener find a new way or bring some societal satire to the table like real thing and there are plenty more moments on this record where the lyrics just bring pure humor or absurdity sort of like on the interlude here which is a weird narrated spoken word dystopian future that involves a cannibalism I guess I just like that this record just has so few lyrical inhibitions and as a result I think Meryl makes a lot of really bold and fun and memorable statements another thing I love about this record Merrill's voice it may actually be my favorite thing about this record she has so much personality pitch and power passion every time she harmonizes with herself with background vocals on this record it is near perfect and this happens whether she is very gently beautifully crooning on one of the ballots here on one of the slow burners or when she uses wild squawking on a track like rocking-chair where she's really digging in and you know really started to put a little bit of a rasp or just some grit on her singing - and and even though I think there is a lot of technical execution to her voice there's a lot of greatness to the way that she sings still her voices is not really for everyone it's a bit of an acquired taste I think it's just a very unusual tambour than I think many people are used to hearing women sing in even though Meryl has really beautiful and feminine falsetto the low end of her voice tends to run a little androgynous or maybe even sounds a bit like a bleeding sheep or like a large bird of some sort but despite these quirks Meryl is still a really great singer whose voice is incredibly soulful and as far as the songwriting goes on this LP I think it's super tuneful I think it's super tasteful much more than her last full-length LP who killed and I don't really think the songwriting disappoints on this LP either I think Meryl does a great job of bringing the usual level of oddity that goes into a tune-yards record but is able to bring some really great choruses and some very sticky melodies to the table - whether that be on some of the ballads like on wait for a minute which is one of the more beautiful songs on this record and Meryl does a fantastic job of sort of throwing the song off-kilter a little bit with these vocals that oh that sort of throw off the timing of the song then there's the song look around another great ballad on here but it's sort of in a weird nine eight time signature where a beat sort of gets thrown off on the back end of the bar and the hard hitting bangers you can call them or the the single worthy moments on here like water fountain I think are fantastic - or the song singko which I think has a bit of a disco influence to it like a bit of a post-punk thing going on and then there's the Kozar manchild on here which is one of the few moments in popular music where for the last track of the song you may hear the artist put the weirdest moment of the entire record right at the finish as opposed to like just a tear jerker or a really sad track to kind of bring the whole thing to an emotional climax and this is completely fine to me it fits in with the overall theme of the record unexpected surprises being relentlessly playful seeking to make truly fun poppy music that doesn't hold itself to a whole lot of standards because as memorable and as infectious as this record is and as you know hardcore it is into these verse chorus verse song structures merrill does a good job of finding way to throw a weird wrench into the works with most of the songs hear the sound of the record is really kooky for lack of a better word again sort of like on the song manchild where some of the effects playing throughout the track sound just kind of cheap or silly but this song like others on here is is is one of the more bold and political statements on the entire record with Meryl kind of staunchly declaring that you know this is my body no means no yes means yes ah it's one of the few moments on this entire LP that's just a slight overload and and this was also a problem on who killed it dropped a few years ago but it's not as great an issue for me personally you know there's not a moment on this record to me that feels like the song gangsta which I didn't want to get into why I don't like that track but still being bombastic and being in your face and being super colorful as part of what has made tune-yards one of the more unforgettable musical acts to break out over the past several years for sure Merrill can get a little annoying sometimes but she's also incredibly bold and creative so I went into this new record hoping that she would find more creative tasteful and novel ways to apply this weirdness that this project just seems to be bursting at the seams with and I think that happened in my opinion this is a great listen I think it's the shot in the arm that pop music needed this year the reminder to wake up and experiment a little bring some primal or unusual rhythms to the table just futz around with vocals a little bit or layering and instrumentation just go wild rather than be obsessively concerned with smooth sexy slick or trendy or nostalgic or politically correct or appealing this is Merrill's best set of tracks yet I'm feeling the light too decent eight on this thing Tran yeah boa if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it anthony Fantana yards Nicky nack forever 
5O52mY0F9LQ,what's wrong with your face how do you deal with this facial hair crap it's so glitchy kales a man's man hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Lord mantis record death mask these guys are a Chicago metal outfit whoo I have been sort of keeping tabs on since I first heard them in 2012 with what I believe was their sophomore record pervert er a record that I thought was a pretty impressive mix of black metal and sludge metal with these massive heavy sludgy riffs as well as very relentless blast beats and retched vocals the combination just felt really natural on this record however the the downside of this LP was is that this marriage of two different extreme metal styles was really the most original and significant thing that this record had to offer because the vocals and the riff writing were not really much to write home about this record was still definitely heavy and abrasive and menacing it just wasn't that memorable from a musical standpoint so I was pretty surprised to hear these guys come through with the new record where that they change their sound up pretty significantly as well as deliver some songs that I love and I think are exciting of course this record being death-mask which we're going to fix right now voila and this is really one of the most sonically of progressive metal records that I think you can put your ears to this year like with their last LP Lord mantis is still black and slugs but I feel like they add so much more to the mixture as well for one nose weaving it into these walls a very heavy bass e ringing out riffs which seem a bit slower and spaced out this time around like a bit of doom influence working its way into the fold and then there's the vocals too which I think are so much more vile and gruesome on this record especially with the vitriolic lyrics that are pretty chilling sometimes with its really thunderous guitars and just a Raye civ distortion there is another record that this help he reminds me of that I loved earlier this year Indians from all purity which is a metal record that also brings sludge together with noise as well as doom in a bit of drone it is one of the most depressing nihilistic grading and sadly Beauty beaut beautiful records I think you can listen to this year as well as a very challenging an Indian's guitarist and vocalist is actually on this record on the song negative birth and believe it or not when he comes on to sing the results aren't that much different from what you're getting on the other tracks that Lord mantis brings to the table however I don't really feel like this adds up into a redundant release just a copy of whatever Indian did earlier this year to me death mask is kind of like getting a pretty good sequel to a great slasher flick that I loved earlier this year but you know the sequel to the movie comes like two years earlier than I would have expected it and you know maybe there's a little more blood maybe there's a little more production value maybe the killer guy kills using a lot of the same elements a lot of the same ideas Indian essentially just turns up the bass turns up the fear turns up the the grim atmosphere on this sound that Indian has been toying with like the song body choke the opener on this record which kicks off with these are really punishing heavy guitar notes that are just banging and wringing out very resonant there's some primal drums that helped set up the tone as well but once the song really kicks into gear it hits the perfect sludgy dumi tempo they build it up with some very sharp dissonant guitar peji oohs I love the refrain on this track about bondage and yeah jokes it's an insane moment in the song and then the band changes up the riff and goes into the second half of the song that is absolutely terrifying really noisy really abrasive the band could not sound more hellish they repeat the same formula on the next track death mask but they managed to put like a a pretty catchy refrain on the back end of that track something they are able to repeat as well on the song possession prayer which features this dark Sikh mantra of the ress said all right and this track features one of the most pummeling riffs on the entire record - and sort of surprises me with these subtly electronic drums that pop in around the middle point of the song bringing the track like a slightly industrial flavor I love that a lot of tracks on this record are really long they're ambitious they're multifaceted in a sense they're kind of progressive as Lord mantis is stringing tracks out past six seven or ten minutes there's a lot of evolution that goes into these tracks from start to finish and for the most part that happens on the entire record itself - like with the song you will gag for the fix which is this three-minute piano interlude of a track maybe not that memorable or interesting compositionally but sort of an essential intermission of the middle point of the record sandwiched in between all these incredibly heavy abrasive tracks but not every experiment and attempt to diversify this record really adds up into a winning track I mean the song coil which has this incredibly stiff and and just to slow riff that I just I can't help but get impatient with it it just gets so stale by the middle point of the song and it doesn't help the band throws these really gimmicky vocals on top of it that have these effects laid into them where they're made to sound kind of robotic and what's even more disappointing is that still on this new record Lord mantis does have a slight tendency to fall back on these really generic black metal and sludge metal riffs or guitar passages or drum beats and merely try to coast on the fact that yeah we're putting them together in a sort of novel way that you haven't heard too many times overall I like this record there are moments where I'm incredibly impressed to the point where I feel like Lord mantis bests Indian and not even on the track where Indians vocalist is featured on here that's actually one of my least favorites but I also have to say this record is terribly front-loaded I don't think there's a single song in the second half of this record that is nearly as interesting as any of the material in the first half sure it's not all terrible but it just doesn't hold my interest as much at least up until the very final moments of the closing track on here where the riffs and the walls of noise just get really really really intense I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this record transition if you give in this Lord mantis LP listen or any of the tracks off of it what did you think of them did you love him hate him why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Lord mantis forever 
IJ6klK0yvXk,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a super exciting final update not editing that just gonna let it sit there awkwardly anyway a final update like I said vinyl update and this one as I already said so redundant right now is a special one considering that last week was Record Store Day if you guys remember I did a recent video telling you some Record Store Day releases that I was looking forward to that I will be that I was looking out for this coming Record Store Day and um yeah you know what you know what I got some of those releases and I'm just going to share them with you now and let you know what I picked up and let you know what I got and got a few things in here that aren't Record Store Day related that other day that I just picked up because I wanted them but uh some Record Store Day stuff in here you know let's start off with uh start off with this big old puppy over here big ol baby oh man you know I when I said I was interested in this release I didn't fully know the mammoth size of this thing the five vinyl records that are in this package of this LCD soundsystem live album this is a track four track five hour recording of their final performance ever and I haven't even laid the needle on this thing yet mostly because it is so long and honestly I just want to I want to have a day to listen to this thing I don't want to like freaking you know stop in the middle of it or something like that you know unless to flip the record or whatever get a drink or go to the bathroom I mean I want I want to listen to the whole thing you know and and and this is most likely going to happen on a weekend not this weekend but I will be listening to this this Roxette in its entirety but um you know so again I cannot comment on the production as of right now but like so many great LCD Soundsystem tracks everything on this thing you know pretty much every track you would want on a freakin record of there's like you know like this you know like a this kind of goodbye performance or anywhere or whatever and um just so elaborate I mean God um here are the five individual records all of which have you know pictures of the the people who are at the show with a you know sort of a thank yous and credits and a soo of other things sort of on the on the backsides of these uh of these records and you know so you have this giant mammoth cardboard sleeve that encapsulates the entire thing and then you have like these mini sleeves all of which are about the size of like a normal record sleeve that you would like buy in a record store and further inside of these even more sleeves of pictures of balloons pictures of the band playing pictures of other various things that were there at the night of the show so I mean it's oh it is a pretty intensive package and um you know considering LCD Soundsystem is one of my favorite bands of all time and that I really uh did not go all out this past Record Store Day you know I just said to myself you know I feel like having it I should I should have it this year you know I mean but part of one of my I guess disappointments with it with a previous record store day and not this past one but I remember vividly wanting but not purchasing at the moment that I could the ten inch box set of the up Setters Blackboard Jungle dub which is when my favorite dub reggae records ever fortunately however I did not make this I did not that same mistake this time around this year when I grabbed this reissue of the up setters super ape another fantastic dub reggae record if you are looking to get into that genre and not only are the tracks on this thing good vinyl sounds great it's a double LP unfortunately not in the gatefold you guys know that I do have a a pretty big crush on Gate folds in general but it does come with a massive poster of the front of the record and not only do the record sound real nice but on the D side on the D side we have an etching of course nope it's upside down so upside down outs right side up obviously if you if you can see that is the super ape right there that is the super ape on the cover of the record he is looking pretty super he's definitely an ape it's the super 8 so you have a cool edging on the D side of this reissue totally sweet totally sweet also down in the comments as I'm packing this up and putting it in tell me what you think about people who buy Record Store Day releases Record Store Day releases these limited run releases and then put them up on eBay immediately after have you ever done that do you uh make a ton of money off that and you know I'm just sort of I heard a few people talking about that on Record Store Day and I know there's some people who do it I'm just sort of wondering if that's that's like I buy these things because I want them you know I'm like not trying to speculate on anything here's another thing that I am very happy to have from this past record survey I think you know earlier the Record Store Day I could be totally wrong on that but um but it I did get it in honor of Record Store Day Record Store Day yes Dead Kennedys Dead Kennedys uh in god we trust' incorporated massively fantastic hardcore punk EP the fastest EP the fastest collection of songs I've ever heard play like jello biafra doesn't even care about whether his lyrics are intelligible most of the time they're playing these songs so goddamn fast um and I think we've got a bigger problem now is one of my first favorite Dead Kennedys tracks that Nazi Punk's off and both of those are on this EP it's 11 inches obviously it's a picture disc music on both sides clearly and what's different about this EP it's not just some normal reissue of In God We Trust incorporated you know which if you go to a record store you know that has older punk records or you go to a record show you are pretty likely to run into a copy of this EP but this is a copy of what the people putting this EP out or putting this picture disc out MVD audio this thing also comes with a a DVD video of the sessions that went into this EP they are calling this EP previously unreleased lost sessions of these tracks and I mean they certainly sound that way you heart you are hearing alternate takes of tracks from this EP on this picture discs at least in the case of songs like rawhide and we've got a bigger problem now either that or the takes of tracks like hyperactive child and dog buy and keep owned are so identical to the takes that the Dead Kennedys used on the final version of the EP that I can't really tell that great of a difference in terms of the performance anyway what definitely does give this record away as something different than that original Dead Kennedys EP is that the the mixing is is pretty different the guitars definitely not as crushing as they are on the original tapes and while it's kind of shocking at first and I think ultimately it does make this picture disc more of a fan you know pursue more than it is for someone who has no clue what Dead Kennedys are all about you know do listen to the original version of this EP instead but if you're a fan it does make it interesting to listen to these versions because with the guitars not being so crushing other things like subtleties and jell-o's voice or what the drums are doing or what the face is doing all of these things sort of become so much more obvious like on the song dog bite I mean if you've listened to that song a lot of times you know in the background of that song they're ridiculous dog barks you know who that could be being performed by a D H or Klaus or East Bay Ray I'm not sure I haven't checked out the DVD quite yet don't know if that footage turns up in there and you know those sort of a is made apparent by that but um you know there's so much louder in these demo versions of these songs that it's kind of hilarious but also there's a lot of guts to the playing there's a lot of excitement and also tons and tons of in-between song banter to the point where like before the song we've got a bigger problem now Jello Biafra is like literally you know discussing with either the band or the producer behind the board like hey uh how should I sing this part or should I like try this when I sing this or what not so it's like you know kind of on the fly they're deciding how ultimately these songs were going to sound on the record you know and you're sort of audience to that and it's it's a really cool thing again I think I think a must-have for a hardcore fan of dead kennedys and even though there are some people out there that do complain about the audio quality of picture discs at least in this particular instance wasn't really seeing it you know sounded really clean to me the only real buzz or hiss that I was catching was um you know or sort of a flaws in the recording that I was hearing was mostly to do with the original tapes or the the sessions themselves you know there is like you know a little bit of hum going on when all the instrumentation is silent which I think has more to do with you know just the recording of everything that it has to do with the record itself it's it's an interesting little peer into the efforts and sort of the energy that went behind that In God We Trust EP alright next record because I'm a fan of the band and I was sort of dying to hear what this sounded like so I couldn't like say no to an opportunity to hear this when the chance came to get a copy of this the automata Gucci Scott Pilgrim vs. the world yep versus the world the game soundtrack so if you didn't know on amount of Gucci fantastic 8-bit rock outfit and they did the soundtrack for the Scott Pilgrim video game and the cover are - this thing is amazing and there's some really cool images of the game and the band the tracklisting sort of also talking about you know crediting the songs to certain members of the band which is actually really cool you know it's interesting to see what songs come from which person in the group because they're never quite fully understood the songwriting dynamic of automata and Gucci and it's it's going to be interesting to sort of listen to these songs over and over I listen to this record once they're all ready to sort of listen to them at certain C if they're certain qualities or characteristics that I can catch when one person is composing a song versus another but maybe the process is more collaborative than the simple wider notes will lead on but anyway the coolest thing about this record about not only does it sound great and a lot of the songs on this thing are pretty interesting I think the only downside to this record is that there are a lot of abrupt fades to the tracks on this thing so if you want to continue hearing them they just kind of like end out of nowhere and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that I mean these are literally video games songs I mean you know they sort of repeat as you are playing through a level or a stage or something you know they don't have like a very clear finish middle beginning and whatever they just kind of continue as you're playing so you know these songs really only last as long as they need to and then they all kind of cut out so you know if you're dying to hear the music from this soundtrack or just dying to hear some more stuff from on amount of Gucci maybe you really loved their last record or you love the set an inch singles that they put out a couple of years ago that they're so good they're so good my skateboard will go on amazing but yeah the record sounds fantastic and it is like this clear yellowy greenish color really nice really nice see my face through it you can see my face through it oh my god so yes it's it's totally gorgeous um you know kudos to anybody who was able to pick up a copy of this thing you know hopefully there's going to be more copies available at some point all right moving on movin on movin on movin on movin on - I got you know I'm a big Destroyer fan had to get this never owned this on vinyl and I think Dan Behar's work is amazing and this is a gatefold and as 180-gram got all the lyrics in there magical and yeah you know it's it's it's pretty plain straightforward packaging and everything like that you know it's just like a really nice well put together package black vinyl um like I said 180 gram destroyer this night second-favorite - Street Hawk you know and kaput I love kaput but he has no I love kaput like I said straightforward packaging you know just just an opportunity an excuse to finally own that that album on vinyl you know if you're into eccentric crazy singer songwriters get into destroyer you know Dan Behar is uh definitely one of the best out there in my opinion alright and I think I only have one more yeah I only have one more record store anything I have a few more records after this but this is my last Record Store Day record and this is the record that got me out participating in Record Store Day period this is the record I had to freaking have on on Record Store Day liars mess on a mission 12-inch with an awesome b-side the song blah vets and also remixes of this track from black bananas freezer Jam and silent servant yeah black bananas freezer Jam remix and the silent servant remix um I think I dug the black bananas remix more than the silent servant remix but not so much that it like it it doesn't ruin the wreck or anything like that this is just crazy insane this is like string this is yarn in like like wedged in between the two sides of this freaking record and pulling it out here wish me luck oh you know you all you have the really cool says liars there on the on the sleeve and dumb yeah I mean let's let's let's bring this in a little closer let's bring in a little closer shall we oh come on we gotta we gotta like you know like focus yeah there you go okay now you see this crazy you see this man you see in this the colors Duke the colors so yeah there's like all this crazy yarn in the middle of the frickin record of course it sounds freakin amazing and I've noticed that like there is a weird kind of design flaw with the record like right here like right right here there you go that like little piece of yarn right there is almost like coming out of the record and you can't like really tell but it's almost like causing like kind of a raised bump on the record itself um I don't know you know I I mean I've played this thing several times over and I haven't noticed like any change in sound quality or anything like that as I am you know playing through this record so I don't think it ruins it or anything like that but it's just like an interesting little quirk in this record that is already so quirky to begin with you know like not every vinyl that has this yarn and it looks the same you know you can't like shake it around or anything like that it's it's wedged in there so you know like in a way each copy really is unique to a degree and you know that's just kind of another weird thing that makes it stick out or whatever you know so yeah this uh this this freak it's freakin liars record this is this is the reason I participated in Record Store Day in the first place I was just like dying to get a hold of this thing you know the the wedge over here sort of in the middle is a little rough looking you know but but again it's just a really interesting uh concept you know in terms of like putting out a piece of vinyl you know it's stuff like this that hold on come on it's stuff like this sorry just had a little a little cleaning issue there it's stuff like this that I think is going to you know keep vinyl interesting into the future you know creative ideas like this you know I mean of course I love the song and I think the new Liars record that the single comes from is one of the best tracks of the year but as soon as I saw this thing online I was like ah you know like what the hell the this this is definitely the most eccentric craziest most colorful weirdest piece of vinyl data that I own and I'm going to be excited to have my hands on it for years to come let's get into a few records that were not record store day centric but I did manage to pick up recently shoe shoes Nina Nina Nina Simone covers on the shoe shoe record a lot of you guys may remember that I reviewed this record earlier in the year just a really strange rendition if he's Nina Simone tracks just incredibly weird and unorthodox to the point where you're either gonna love this freaking thing or just outright hate it or be kind of lukewarm on it but secretly hate it on the inside but you don't want to freak out about it or nothing but uh but yeah you know of course I love the music on it but um I just saw this and saw that it was a just a really nicely put together package in that just like the cover it just looks so beautiful and just impressive in person and on top of that there's also this really cool grey white pattern with the with the record that looks fantastic looks great I was just playing it earlier today looks fantastic stellar stellar little package and I love the sexy black sleeve it's like I'm pulling out a porno kind of is alright moving on moving on again what do you think of these people you take Record Store Day releases they put them up on eBay like you know what you know what you're gonna pay a whole ton of money for this amazing Liars 12-inch curious you know just just doesn't seem cool Tim Hecker imaginary country drone ambient music on here not quite as rough as you know some of the stuff that he's been putting out recently but still really Pleasant and beautiful and a little dreary as well at points uh two records thrown into a big chunky sleeve out on cranky records and um you know nothing amazingly crazy about the packaging you know the records are just black they they look wonderful you know it just looks and sounds great you know you can you can you can buy records sometimes Jess cuz they sound good just cuz there's good music sauna you know something all about the flash sometimes but you know still Tim Hecker imaginary country I am I have listened through this a few times before digitally a while ago but have not listened to it all the way throughout vinyl yet I'm like 3/4 of the way through it I'm going to revisit it maybe tonight after I love doing this video next we have we have man my boys my boys I actually have not laid the needle on to this record yet so I'm like you know maybe they won't be my boys after this maybe I'll be like whoa I hate this but I don't know if that's beben augu or otherwise known as bad bad not good latest record three got it on vinyl I'm gonna lay it right there next to my crazy ass flashing lights twelve inch with the amazing etching on the  other side of that thing sorry for swearing nice package they pulled together on this thing man nice guys I mean you know if this record totally  sucks then you still put together a hell of a package that's that's all I'm gonna say that's all I'm gonna say the the just the the job that you guys an innovative leisure did on this whole thing is is wonderful it just looks great looks great and um you know again I love the gate folds the records themselves look nice I love the the freakin labeling on this thing - nice clean grey with the other very simple font it's minimalist it's sort of dark and I just love the contrast with the back side of the the the record r2 you know we just have this like really weird dark portrait of the band where it kind of seems like on the front side where we're like looking up at them as if like you know but we're like down in a deep dark ugly pin they're like it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again we're like no oh we don't want to get the hose but on the side they seem like three chill guys they seem like three totally chill bros you know they seem like three like cool guys that you want to hang out with and you go hang out with them and then you end up down here don't trust these guys I'm telling you don't trust them so there is that I have to lay the needle on that soon very soon and and then finally uh timber timbres new record hot dreams oh my god I saw this thing in person and I was like you know I really love this record it's one of my favorites of the year but I was sort of thinking like should I get this on vinyl and then in person when I saw that the record star I was like wow I can see myself in it and if there's anything I love it's something that looks like me so oh I'm just kidding but anyway yeah I mean obviously you can you can see you can see the camera in it I mean jeez yeah it's just a beautiful silver rendition of the of the cover art you know we have this beautiful little download sticker here and this moon right here we got this moon that isn't on the original cover art but it's actually just like printed it's a sticker it's a sticker on the sleeve itself so you know you pull the record out and you don't get the moon the moon goes and then you just get this I mean again you're actually just seeing the whole room this is like tnd behind the scenes right now you know this is just so this is just so behind-the-scenes timber tambour on the other side god this is reflective this is so reflective I didn't even realize how reflective this was until I started talking about it in this video because I must have just been looking at him in like whoa this is great and didn't even realize I was I could literally see myself in this freaking records um and you know how I said the moon was gone it's actually not gone at all I completely lied because on the flip side of this sheet that tells you all of the artists and the personnel involved is a giant silver moon oh my god just just nice beautiful beautiful beautiful job on this thing and also really nice job on the labeling on the inside as well because we do have moons here on the records the moons man the moons it's really a really nice consistent theme and it is a heavy freakin freakin pressing I was listening to this record earlier sounded immaculate oh man did sound fantastic Oh timber timber they did such a great job with the instrumental moments on this record it's really upped the ante on that I have to get a detailer Kirk have to give it to his band you know I know I spent my money on this so I mean I I don't have to but I still feel like I have to thank you for you know like it wasn't like this is a gift or anything like that you know I spent my hard-earned cash on this but still I feel like it was still a gift um because of just like the the obvious effort and care they put into the look of this package you know this is definitely going to go down as one of my favorite uh you know vinyl records that I've purchased this year a wonderful little presentation there you know I love it when I buy a record online or a download record online as like a promo or something and or like I buy it off iTunes or whatever and um you know I like the cover art the cover art looks nice but then when I see the record in person the cover art is either totally different or it's just got a different kind of flair or presentation to it or something like that you know some that just makes the in-person experience that much more special and I love that timbre tambour pulled that off with this release and yeah that's it for this uh new Record Store Day immensely long vinyl update cool cool transition what records did you buy on Record Store Day what new releases made it into your collection anything you're particularly proud of any sort of amazing vinyl releases that you got your hands on that are super rare have a really awesome look to them you know post some links post maybe a picture to one of them or something you know let's have a discussion down in the comments you know and just sort of talk about what a what each of us got and um yeah that's it that's it man Record Store Day Anthony Fantana vinyl forever 
LNJVP7FBjCY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dear Anthony I have a topic for you that I think you should really think about and hip hop some of the guys I am the biggest fan of our extreme lyricists guys including Eminem Kendrick Lamar and NAS and in this genre what I only really think is important are the lyrics now don't get me wrong if songs have dope beats I think that's really cool too and that's why I think good kid maad city is so successful but guys like 2 Chainz Juicy J waka flocka and Chief Keef who only really have the beats are adding to the stereotype that rap is garbage what do you think let me know thanks yours truly Nik Colombia dear Nik I understand and sympathize with your gripe you know when it comes to mainstream hip-hop right now uh it's it's not really like a high point for lyrics but even great lyricists classic lyricists like Biggie and like Tupac wu-tang so on and so forth even they to a degree despite their lyrical talents did depend on instrumentals as amazing and as telling and as thought-provoking as the story is on the track juicy I think we can unequivocally say that if that song did not have a beat behind it and a kind of catchy chorus that it would have never become one of the most essential tracks in hip-hop today but still even though there are a lot of rappers out there who are blatantly dependent on their instrumentals I think there is kind of a a silver lining to this dark cloud I think producers are finally getting the attention and the respect that they deserve the people who make the beats are in my opinion more influential than they've ever been people will go out of their way to listen to a track that has young chop producing or clams casino or The Alchemist or Dilla or Madlib and this is a trend that's been growing since the 2000s when you saw a lot of producers stepping out of the background and into the spotlight guys like Kanye who obviously made that transition from producing really great tracks for jay-z to doing own solo stuff and we also have Timbaland and Pharrell and Little John too in Swizz Beatz not only did these guys bring new and cutting-edge sounds in the 2000s and helped to craft some of the most essential singles during this time period but they also became icons that we either respect or remember pretty well today and now that we've kind of left the 80s and the 90s in the dust which is you know an era in hip-hop where the MC truly reigned supreme real hip-hop fans are going back and starting to in retrospect truly truly appreciate the foundation of what guys like the RZA and DJ Premier Rick Rubin bomb squad dr. Dre and the dust brothers laid down as well as other producers too and even if we're not really thinking about it in the forefront of our minds beets have had major impact on who's popular who's not whose album is successful whose album isn't I mean Snoop Dogg transitioning from doggy style to the Dogfather losing dr. Dre thanks to a lot of this turbulence over a death row led to that record just not being as well received long-term as his debut and also jay-z hard-knock life that instrumental was instrumental to his career the whole idea of a rapper spinning over this cutesy musical number and turning it into something kind of gritty in the process was something that excited the mainstream and really rocketed jay-z's career now for me personally a great hip hop song just comes down to balance balance between the lyrics and the beats you know there's nothing more disappointing to me than a hip hop song that has a fantastic instrumental but really weak bars or just a boring emcee and vice versa now what makes a good beat in what makes a good MC or a good verse of course is all subjective even a guy like Chief Keef closes some kind of emotional gap on a song that wouldn't necessarily be connecting with people if they were listening to just the instrumental of a song like I don't like for example where I mean it's a good beat it's a great beat but you know people wouldn't know what not to like if they just listened to it with no lyrics you know you know some people just want a really simple straightforward stick in your mind kind of message and even though there are artists out there like Chief Keef I can't really say that I feel that he's wrecking hip-hop as a genre or giving it a bad name or anything like that I feel that hip-hop is old enough where it can kind of stand up for itself and that you know the artists and the Great's of the past speak for the genre now and not literally what I mean to say is that when somebody comes up and says hey hip-hop is crap instantaneously there's going to be like a dozen people just saying hey you know what illmatic you know what a quim and I at this point hip-hop has had enough artistic successes that I don't think there's anybody out there who could be making music so horrible that they'll just wreck the whole genre and give it a horrible name and the truth is the Chief Keef is like the tiniest piece of the puzzle in this whole equation and yet he is the billboard of it all and he receives the most hate because of that bigger slices of the pie in this equation are for example the music press that fawns over Chief Keef and continues to cover guys like him not because of the quality of his music but because his appearance and stories about him drive traffic and musical audience is a bigger factor than Chief Keef as well they watch his stuff they talk about it they spend money on it and labels play a pretty big factor as well because the labels support these artists because they know that you're gonna buy it so our lyrics important of course like you said good kid maad city fantastic record I wholeheartedly agree but you know across hip hop's history there's been artists who are way lyrical and there's been artists who are super simple and ridiculous and playful  to Live Crew even back then there's a clear difference in quality and depth between tracks like me so horny and Slick Rick's children's stories so this dichotomy has been running a while and it hasn't destroyed hip-hop yet maybe the balance is a little more skewed toward the MCS that are really straightforward to have really trunk knock and huge memorable beats but you know who's to say that it can't swing back in the other direction in the future as long as there's an audience out there for lyrics there is still hope not that things need to totally go back to the way they used to be because I do like the sound of producers getting respect transition what did you think of this video what do you think of Nick Colombia's letter and which do you find yourself favoring Beats or lyrics you mortar beats person you marry lyrics person you kind of in the middle what do you know Anthony Fantino beats milks forever 
rw4YjdWaswE,I must be the HEI got a lot of buzz so I make that Monday all the hate just pollinates my ego as it inflates I'm one of the Great's it ain't up for debate misheard me like you what my so come on and grab a place so I can relay a current stay of the day-to-day before Bob cool a sashay across a creme brulee okay okay don't play don't play I apologize for my shitty flow but honey I got my nuts in your Cheerios Wow hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pixies record indie Cindy Pixies or as they are otherwise known The Pixies are seminal alternative rock band hailing from Boston and they pumped out four of the most essential records in this genre in four short years surfer rosa do little tramp Lomond and my personal favorite bossa nova a little bit of surf influences on the songs here really explosive choruses Frank Black's trademark screams and and melodic vocals as well a really distinct guitar tone on these songs really bouncy sharp reverb on some of the instrumentation two really fun sticky songs occasionally some very out-there song subjects Pixies really had a sound and and a vibe of their own in their time in their heyday the band hit a creative stride that was nothing short of amazing in this short period of time which was ended abruptly in the early 90s by band tensions but then just about ten years later the band reformed but nothing really came of it other than you know like some live shows and stuff like that until last year when Pixies dropped their first big single in a long time announcing that more material was going to be on the way and that song was bad boy and this song was sort of met with a lot of mixed reviews some shrugs some hardcore fans were happy and excited others were just really really disappointed and almost simultaneously this song came with the announcement that Kim deal was a fish after years of tension and hiatus and everything like that officially leaving the band I mean not a complete loss for her considering that she's always had some creative output for herself with the breeders a very well known Pixies side project and this song bag boy built up to an EP which led to another EP which led to a third EP all of which were met with pretty lukewarm responses there were some incredibly lackluster ballads on these EPS like and row Queen where Frank black is singing very boringly over this very very very reserved rock instrumentation and he has this weird effect on his voice to make his singing feel more robotic or something like that I guess to play into the theme of the song and there are tracks on here as well that try to build off of these really aggressive in-your-face spoken word verses like bad boy and the title track from this thing too but there's not much in terms of message or delivery that that's really all that gripping that warrants anything more than a few initial listens you know it's not anything that I'm that I'm dying to return to and there are moments on these EPS as well like magdalena 31:8 where really it's it's maybe the most unfinished sounding song that Pixies have put out across all these EPS it just feels really Undine amick and sort of flatlining throughout the entire track just a little redundant a little boring sort of like the tracks silver snail I feel like the slow pace of the song and the melodies in the lead vocals on this track imply a bit of an epic mood or like an epic feel that the the song actually doesn't deliver and then the song blue eyed hex which is maybe one of the louder standouts on this entire EP series and I couldn't quite put my finger on what what the guitar riff of this song was reminding me of but when Frank black starts just screaming really shrilly like retching violently toward Leah this track it comes to me this is like a really bad ac/dc parody and there are other tracks on here that are just really middle-of-the-road poppy alternative rock songs that Pixies fans wouldn't bad and I at if the band's name wasn't attached to them like ring the bell and another toe in the ocean and the thing is Pixies fans even with the band's name attached to these songs aren't really batting an eye at these tracks for sure they still have their sonic formula memorized for the most part a lot of it I don't think has translated all too well to this more modern recording setup but even with a lot of the production qualities being present on this record there's a lot to be desired in terms of the vocal delivery and the song and melody writing and the performances as well obviously these EPS fell short just enough to keep even hardcore fans from really spreading the word about the Pixies latest material because now with this new record this new album from the Pixies you know because the phrase first album in 23 years is way sexier than a compilation of a bunch of EPS that they put out recently are we that out of touch with what the Pixies are doing that we could just be told that and be like okay yeah and you know even though I was kind of on the fence with a lot of these EPS separately together as an album a lot of the songs here are even more unpleasant and just not that interesting to listen to as a group I just find these songs intolerable unless you're the kind of person who was tolerable of textbook examples of disappointing comeback records I'm not really finding a whole lot to love on this record the only songs that I really dug were Jaime Bravo which has some fantastic vocal harmonies and melodically and just tune wise is one of the best songs this record has to offer and then there is what goes boom which is really the the brightest spot this record has to offer in terms of that more aggressive side of the Pixies and I think can go toe-to-toe most definitely with some of their past material as well just really great over the top ear grabbing vocals from Frank on this track and a very heavy hard-hitting riff overall this is this is an incredibly lackluster return for Pixies to be completely honest however if you've been following their exploits with these EPS leading up to this record you pretty much already knew that I'm feeling a strong three tool like four on this thing Tran position if you've given this record to listen or the EPS that preceded it what did you think of it or them what should I review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Pixies forever 
scJ9fS5S7bo,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pharoahe Monch record PTSD this guy is a Queens rapper back in the 90s along with fellow MC Prince Poe dropped a few classics like their self-titled record and the album stress under the name organized confusion if you want to hear some really savage and enlightening conscious hip-hop and boom bap check out that stress record back in the day organized confusion add a sound that wasn't too unlike a lot of other acts in hip-hop in their area around that time like wu-tang or Kara's one or black moon but the technical aspects of their rapping especially mantras rapping as well as some of their weird and progressive song topics and instrumentals and their speedy flows as well just kind of set them apart from a lot of the other artists who came out of that landscape take the song releasing hip nautical gases for example from their debut record sonically and lyrically I mean this is a pretty insane progressive track there's some weird stuff for New York boom bap in the 90s so these guys are definitely experimental for their time and and went on through their lyrics to influence guys like mm as well as Aesop Rock if you're the kind of hip-hop fan who is big into lyrical concepts mod should be on your radar organized confusion should be on your radar you should go to your record collection and already see these records sitting in there oh are they in there well I mean not in mine but you know I wish they were there in this progressive experimental and very lyrical character trait is something that much went on to hone in his solo career when he started that in the late 90s and even though the record he kicked things off with internal affairs in 1997 was a great record his his solo output has been kind of spotty at best especially when it comes to the gap of time in between each record I mean he followed up internal affairs almost 10 years later with desire and then four years after that came the record or and now with just a few years in between war in this new record we have PTSD and I'm guessing from the acronym album title and the sort of similarly corny cover art as well as the continuing war theme in the album title itself that mantra is kind of in the same creative mindset that he was on war attacking a lot of the same lyrical topics like war like oppression but with this Newmont record I think a few more ideas get thrown into the mix I think a lot of the strike on this record is more personal specifically dealing with suicidal thoughts depression mental illness there's a lot of demons being fought on this record when it comes to the personal emotions delivered on these songs I think PTSD has more punch I think instrumentally it has a little more punch - and I think much comes through with more energy and more aggression when it comes to the instrumentals on this record there's nothing really all that trendy or modern or flashy on this thing for the most part much stays in his sonic comfort zone there's a lot of boom bat beats on this thing that wouldn't sound too uncomfortable on mantras previous three records or any number of hip-hop records that came out of New York in the 2000s like with the songs rapid eye movement or the jungle or bad MF we have a lot of strong crispy snares and thudding kick drums back by horns and guitars strains these actually come through on the song losing my mind which has a pretty nice vocal guest on the track then now well over this course there's just something about this song that reminds me of a track or two from like the two most recent routes records anyway it's very sad very somber song and then there's the track dream which has one of the most upbeat instrumental zhan the entire LP really jumpy uppity horns just popping in and out all over those things from really just some very sweet smile inducing soul vocal sampling and then there's the song scream which I do enjoy to a very slight degree because if it's really uh north instrumental some really weird guitars playing all throughout this thing it's one of the noisiest beats on this record but Monch does some really campy weird ass singin on the hook on this thing he's singing along with this guitar lead that he doesn't totally line up with when he is singing it's it's sort of sloppy in an intentional way but it doesn't really come off sounding that good especially as he's saying sometimes this world makes me feel like I need to the track is just super shoddy and then there's tracks that really try very hard to set a very sad tearjerker tone like broken again which has this really weird skipping bassline that does not link up with the drums as well as it should and really takes the momentum kicks the groove of the beat off balance not really seeing the the appeal of this particular instrumental and then much puts himself on top of this really weird Hendrix like pedestal on the heroin addict interlude as he is rapping and speaking and singing and yelling over this acid soaked guitar riff and these very hard-hitting beats it's got a really strong 60s psychedelic rock influence to it and this psychedelic rock and pop sound continues on tracks here like the closer the grand illusion where the stepkids actually come through and help the instrumental out with some really colorful since some very eerie chilly sung harmonized vocals and thistles and thistles and as well maybe not the kind of sound that I necessarily want to hear backing a menthe record but still it's it's one of the better of the unconventional ideas that this record has to offer PTSD is far from a perfect album however the instrumentals are rarely the staple of a menthe record and even if I don't really like a beat or I don't like a hook on this LP it rarely stands in the way of me enjoying what Monch is doing lyrically like I said on this LP I think March is showing more energy more creativity more eccentricity more just crazy ideas the levels of wordplay that his lines work on are fantastic sometimes working on two or three or for different visual or lyrical images and references at one time and when matcha isn't doing that he is occasionally delivering these tongue twisters of alliteration or internal rhymes within a bar that I couldn't even begin to start reciting like on the track time to or maje says that the streets are painted in gold but that fades because it's painted in henna and the side of the grass that's greener it's greener unless it's a sua get get to get it sua side instead of the side of the grass or Jenna side and on the same track there's a verse where matcha is literally stuttering through his lines as if he is a soldier or a veteran that is suffering from PTSD there's also the track losing my mind where he poses this really morbid morbid piece of imagery with baby's insides being outside outside of a house of God that's ungodly this inside outside inside outside switch up against one another a few times and then there's a line where he's referencing Dick Cheney and George Bush and Colin Powell all talking about : dick and Bush has three separate things but bringing them together at a very clear shot at their administration and then there's the song damage which I think has one of the most hilarious pieces of wordplay I've heard this year kicking off the track with this line about how rappers waving guns or llamas in front of the camera that's just drama it's llama drama and when those cameras are attached to dollies he calls those guns dali lama's since they're just being waved for the cameras there's the track rapid eye movement on this thing with black thought where maje delivers some really corny cartoony ultraviolent very relentless lyrics I mean going to the point where he says that he grows five times his size and grabs mace by his thigh and then whack someone with mace it's a it's it's pretty over the top but still funny and one of the better tracks on the LP Black Thought really lives up to the bar the in-your-face aggressive and sort of braggadocious bar munch sets on this track with with very little problem and then there's a quartet of tracks toward the end of this LP that focus a little more on concept and theme than they do raw and really dizzying lyrics like the song the jungle where much is essentially rapping about urban enlightenment trying to turn people who are struggling through life in the city onto some alternative ideas and of course there are a plethora of jungle metaphors throughout this track too and then there's the song broken again Vermont essentially gives us a first-person view of the suffering in the bliss that comes along with this heroin addiction that he's on about on this track and he uses a icy seed everyone to sort of let everybody know or let everybody in on this whole heroin thing line that actually reminds me of a cc'd line that andre 3000 used on a track with UGK there's the title track of this thing where March is essentially dealing with some suicidal thoughts and the song dream where mantras referencing wu-tang in a big way especially ODB with the place to boom line on this track and you know this record is so dark at a lot of points it's so sad at a lot of points and even though the song is kind of corny it's a little too cutesy for its own good it really is the bright shining moment this record needed to kind of pick things up a little bit especially with Talib Kweli x' verse toward the end of this track it's really one of the better verses on this entire LP and i think it's frickin hilarious especially the moment where he is rapping about stopping smoking altogether and then he found that as soon as he stopped and gave it some time he started to dream again and the list of things that he says he started to dream about a completely ridiculous you know even though there's a lot to like about this album and I love a good deal of the tracks on this thing there are some glaring flaws here as well that are just kind of huge turn offs for one the hook guy I know I'm a stickler for hooks sometimes but I feel like in this case it's it's kind of justified the worst thing that the hooks on this record do at times is just deliver bad singing I mean either it's off pitch or it's just delivered in a really boring way to the point where the hook is just just really inconsequential to the the songs quality it just doesn't add that much to the track the title track on here scream broken and sadly enough even the track where the step kids are on the closing track on here you know that they're really eerie chilly vocals while they sound fine the really obvious rhyme scheme that that goes into the lyrics that they're singing just does not go over too well and then there's bad  which I mean I I got a call foul on this hook you know do I'm a bad  burn in the pop wine it's it just the know despite Monch saying that every verse is a virtue on this track that this track has some of the weakest verses on the entire LP and obviously every hook is not a virtue and finally the skits on this record leave leave a lot to be desired either they are not funny though I do sort of see the concept sort of like when Monch is talking about the side effects of medication that one may have to take or that one is prescribed and then there are these sort of weird computer voice sketches where mantras sort of being talked to by this woman robot voice telling him that he's at this memory facility and so on and so forth it just sounds really low-budget and does very little to sort of set a scene like I know these sketches are trying to do overall this is a very good listen for mod she brings lyrical fire for the most part on these tracks I think his ambitions are higher than they were on his last record I think his lyrical concepts are better but there are a few lyrical potholes here and there like eating a bag of baby dicks half-baked hooks a few underwhelming instrumental choices but still some of the better hip-hop tracks that you can hear this year this record does start off strong it does deliver highlights throughout but it does become a little hit or miss as you travel through I'm feeling a strong six to light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Pharoahe Monch forever 
qUFXgTdYBwk,hi everyone and sorry for this tan oh the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review of the new John Frusciante album enclosure John Frusciante accomplished silho artist guitarist multi-instrumentalist collaborator with many but I'm sure you know him best through his work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers being a key element in some of the band's most celebrated albums to date now last time I caught up with John it was through an album review for a record that he did that I didn't like at all not even a little nope PBX funicular intaglio zone easily one of John's most uncommital and unconventional records ever really low five recording on this thing a mess of different ideas and instruments on these songs and melodic and noise layers all presented in this really unorganized way as if it were like an appealing aesthetic for the entire record some really distorted breakbeats on this thing some very thin synthesizers and guitars and some truly awful singing on some of these songs too this record was so out of scope with John's past major successes like the will to death and curtains and empyrion that I like I'm sure a few others assumed that this was gonna be kind of a one-off that John would never really return to but even with a very different title and and presentation in terms of the cover are anyway we're essentially getting a redo of the entire aesthetic that John was shooting for on PBX you know maybe the recording isn't quite so distorted and isn't quite as lo-fi sometimes I mean the mixing is still pretty wonky and there aren't really any moments on this record that sort of hit me like I'm listening to like a demo of a Nine Inch Nails song per se but you're still getting a lot of oddly mixed and just sonically missed placed drum machine beats and break beats just very speedy busy break beats and there are some experimental sounds on this record that are slightly harsh or dissonant but it's not like the adventure so far into the unknown that any of it feels incredibly new to me especially since I've given John's PB so listen if this record like John's last record is any kind of adventure it's it's really just a personal one and once again on this new album the singing I can barely stand it like on the song sleep how is the singing on this song good seriously and as far as the backing instrumentation the drum beats still sound really out of place they still sound really gaudy and they sound cheap too I feel like we're being past demos once again on this record along with the song run and along with the song fanfare to which is a sort of a more accessible straightforward synth pop ballad on this thing which once again kind of mirrors that whole pbx formula because that record while it was weird and unpleasant and just really ham-fisted and clumsy and not really in control of itself it had a few moments in it that like oh wow this is pretty poppy in comparison to everything else here that i don't like at all occasionally with the instrumentals on this record john does manage to pull together some guitars and synths and drums that create a moody atmosphere like with the song shining desert which also has these very eerie vocal harmonies or there's the song stage where john delivers some epic vocal harmonies against all these weeping guitar leads and there is a great guitar solo at the finish that is equally melodic and noisy really intense and passionate if only John were able to execute at this same level on this record and his last record when it comes to his vocals and the recording and nearly everything else you know I could go through naming a lot of the tracks on this record picking out just simple little morsels of melody or just some kind of instrumental idea that appeals to me but that's pretty much what I do with every song on here you know I when I listen to a song I want to enjoy the song from top to bottom from the recording to the way the instrumental sound to the way everything is being performed from the execution of the guitars to the drums to the proficiency of the vocals but once again I just feel like I'm in a PBX position and I'm just being forced to pick through baskets of bruised fruit you know this record is is again just like a sequel to that one in terms of the quality of the songs and the quality of the sounds this is just PBX all over again it's no better it's no worse I'm feeling a decent - strong - on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino enclosure forever 
71iEgW0ABhY,hi everyone Ethan e-dawg tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a carsten review of the new Chet faker record built on glass can Chet faker sing ow yes yes I think it's a perfectly logical question to level against this full-length debut from this Australia based electronically tinged neo soul and R&B singer however it's it's not really a question I see a lot of people asking I mean this dude definitely proved that he was worth checking out with a EP put out a few years ago that received a somewhat warm reception and then there was also the project he dropped recently with fellow Australian musician flume on this record he actually had a minor hit with the song dropped the game however I just don't think the vocals deliver on this record in in a genre where there is so much pressure to deliver the goods vocally for example on the track talk is cheap they're all these mundane verses all over the track just Chet's voice it's not that passionate or interesting he hangs around in his lower register he writes a somewhat nimble melody for himself but he clumsily stumbles around it and when he's not doing that he's straining his vocals on the hook and he sort of seems to confuse straining for passion and even when he hits melodies that are sort of in his mid-range he doesn't really hold on to the pitch that well or just very badly transitions from one note to another you got a feel on your own there's also a really terrible vocal solo at the end of the song where Chet is essentially layering his vocals on top of one another trying to harmonize them and it does not go over well the best thing about this entire track is the horn aided instrumental then with the song gold Chet sings a majority of this track through a really flimsy falsetto which is a shame because melodically I think this is one of the better songs on this entire record I just think it should have been handed to a better singer there's very little in the way of tolerable VOC middle-ground for me on this record either Chet is this is just giving himself vocal feats that he can't accomplish or he is on point with the pitch but he's delivering his vocals with the passion that someone would give to I don't know handing you your order at the drive-through then there's the song melt where Chet invites on an equally unskilled and unfashionable Danao to the pitch he makes the same mistake Chet does on talk is cheap and hangs in her lower register and can't stay on key there she's not even in tune with the instrumental some of the time and then there's 1998 which I think is this album's one shot at a danceable Club single it's sort of a slow sensual track but still has a pretty driving beat this instrumental actually wouldn't sound too uncomfortable on that disclosure record that came out a little while ago but when it comes to pitch and when it comes to passion once again Chet does not really deliver and the deeper cuts on this record are even more insufferable sometimes like with cigarettes and loneliness where Chet kind of goes indie tronic and it's really one of the more uneventful tracks on the entire LP or he's attempting to harmonize with his own lazy off-pitch singing on the song lesson in patience which really lives up to its title I could barely make it through the one listen that this track deserved you know maybe some of this really off point singing would be tolerable if Chet brought more interesting songs or lyrics or song ideas to the table but I mean it's it's just a series of heartbreak and love songs at least that's how I'm reading them and then as far as the instrumentals a lot of them are just really smooth quiet electronic in and bland there's not a lot to what's going on here instrumentally in fact Chet sounds a lot like much of everything else that's going on right now he sounds like the less interesting James Blake to me or maybe even like a Jamie wound who also does electronically tinged contemporary R&B and soul however jamie has a set of pipes on him or maybe you could even compare him to mayer hawthorne or Jamie Lydell who I mean is not the best singer in the world either but at least he makes songs that kind of know how to have fun you could even throw act and santhu in there when they get together you know not only is Chet just not delivering the technical ability to make these songs really come to life on this record as far as his vocals go but it seems that there's no shortage of more interesting alternatives out there to you know to me in a nutshell this record is just it's just modern soulless soul and that's it sometimes the beats are decent sometimes the melodies are okay sometimes the instrumentals are just easygoing and pleasant you know they're not offensive they're not exciting they're just kind of there and sometimes a little sweet and you know inherently they're not terrible but Chet definitely make sure that you know you're not going to want to stick around and enjoy them because of his lack of singing ability and his lack of just conviction on these songs conviction I'm feeling a strong two to light three on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Chet faker built on glass forever 
B42U6Puyx7U,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jota Lea record home like no place is there these guys are in Massachusetts rock outfit whose sophomore record right here dropped a little earlier this year upon first impression it didn't really grab me if you get into this LP you're gonna find a lot of very shouty melodic sort of dramatic and poetic and punk spirited rock music that many would call emo a genre of music I know fairly well I love the bands that make up this genres roots in the in the 80s and 90s like kappa jazz american football Sunny Day Real Estate jawbreaker as well as mineral and let's not forget rites of spring whoo I remember getting into just because around that time I was a big Fugazi fan that time being college and the reason I got into this style of music in college is because it was continuing to dish out really good memorable artists that a lot of people were excited for like brand new as well as envy or like gospel or page 99 or circle takes the square if you'll you know allow me to uh throw some screamo bands not just strictly emo bands in the mix but simultaneously as there were these really creative interesting bands in the underground emo was also seeing quite a bit of mainstream success thanks to get up kids jimmy world Dashboard Confessional to a lesser extent what Conor Oberst was doing in bright eyes and while the style is not really as relevant mainstream wise as it used to be it's never really died in the underground however right now there is a bit of an emo revival going on however I wouldn't really say that's the case as much as there is just a brand new young audience out there for it with a brand new young group of bands playing it snowing the world is a beautiful place a lot of the stuff that goes on with top shelf records crash of rhinos and screamo music right now is is generally pretty healthy as well so after years of being a fan of this stuff I'm sad to say that a lot of the time when I come across these newer groups they don't really have a whole lot to offer me in terms of of a new idea or even a terribly distinct sound though I do have some favorites like the world is a beautiful place you know where from my home state as well as if you'll allow me to throw to Chez amore and there even though they are technically as screamo act I'm just not finding a lot of artists out there in the genre that are cutting edge and no that is not like a suicide pun however I guess in a sense it doesn't have to be since emo is not known for pushing the envelope it's known for being emotional but even if a band isn't really like totally reinventing an entire style of music I like to hear something that makes me feel like ah that's what the sound this band has goes for you know that's what their sound is like that's how I know a hotel your song and I wasn't really getting that when I first heard the band when I first heard them I thought they followed the blueprint of this style of music just a little too close for comfort to the point where I just didn't find a whole lot about them that was memorable however what kind of made me change my mind and revisit this LP is not only were tons of people recommending it to me every chance they possibly could but also I think the songwriting on this thing is pretty good and more ambitious than the average group in this style as well especially with the opener here which is aptly titled as an introduction to the album this is probably one of the best starters to a record I've heard in this style in a while I love the gently strum guitars on this track of course they're thin they're twinkly they're bare they're dry the vocal melody is really nice and the way the pianos come in later in the track it's just a really well put together song and even though the hotel ear just sticks to this blueprint really passionately I do not foresee them letting go of it or even really venturing outside of it on the rest of the album even as I am enjoying this track it's still nice to hear a band who clearly has a strong appreciation for melody as well as vocal harmony it's this musical detail and effort and the pretty good performances that go into this record - as well as the decent production that make me feel like the hotelier while they do stick to this archetype early closely there are cut above a lot of these bands that are doing the same thing but are just too for me to want to enjoy this bands lyrics are actually pretty readable a lot of the time to do this song as well as others on here are pretty dynamic some tracks on here like the track in framing feature really huge group chorus vocals that feel harmonized and shouted very nicely the band really knows how to put a song together but still stylistically there is a really strong element of blandness in my opinion as I dive deeper into this record I'm just not even finding a whole lot of variety either maybe even since in some moments that are making my eyes roll a little bit like the song live in drag which seems to be the band trying their hand at like a screamo track but the riff on this song only really ends up feeling like a bit of a knockoff of the guitar riff on the La Dispute record edit your hometown or the release skippy rhythm guitar riff on the track your deep rest which sounds like something straight out of a Third Eye Blind song and that vibe doesn't really change up when the song gets deeper into the verses however it was kind of moving when I listened to the song more and more and read into the lyrics a little bit and found out that the track is sort of really about dealing with the grief of losing a close friend and sort of as a result of this misery of skipping out on the funeral pretty hard-hitting realization which I've had several of across the tracklist of this record just listening to the lyrics specifically on other tracks like house broken you know overall I thought this record was decent I liked quite a few tracks on it and I'm glad there are bands out there right now that are sticking to this style and not doing it the injustice that I thought a handful of groups were in the 2000s that were blending this genre of music with really really really clear just elements of pop just radio friendly saccharine pop you know groups like this truly appreciate the roots and the origins and and the sound however still in their very deep appreciation and emulation they're yet to come through with a distinct take or style aside from just a sheer lack of surprises and some tracks really paling in comparison to others I'm not really finding a whole lot to complain about you know the hotelier if you're gonna be into this new strain of bands in emo Midwestern emo you could do a lot worse I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why do you think I'm a total bastard dickhead for not loving this band and and not loving snowing I'm sorry I'm sorry snowing fans I don't love snowing you know I don't I love all the bands that came before snowing most of them anyway like I listed earlier I still love you though okay okay yep pretty Fantana the hotel ear formerly known as the hotelier forever 
rJ-GxWyqnu0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the carla basel ocurred boy god I hope I'm pronouncing this correctly Carla is a few decades deep into her career right now which is filled with solo albums various side projects as well as collaborations with everyone from Nils Klein to shoo-shoo to even Lydia lunch so you know she's just farting out rainbows in every direction typically she dabbles in a lot of folk and country rock as well as noise alternative rock experimental music she's putting at this latest record of hers via constellation records and musically she manages to blend together all of these genres that I said she has worked with previously boi is a bit like a cross between the outright experimentation and slight avant-garde ISM of Records and projects like Evangelista brought together with the more rootsy more traditional sounds and songwriting styles of her solo debut redheaded stranger in 2003 there's actually a song title on this record that mirrors an album title from 2004 from a record that she put out called I'm gonna stop killing now the chord progressions on these tracks the lyrics the way these stories are told some of the melodies that are delivered in these tracks to a lot of it just lives eat breathes the style of a backwoods country folk or blues song but these sounds are just darkened to a significant degree it's like all of a sudden we have turned from going on a daytime stroll through the forest to a muddy nocturnal trudge through a foggy swamp the instrumentation on this record for the most part is really slow it's it's very much subdued though there are moments where it all comes together into this mass and creates something loud though there isn't much on this LP that that individually is is like super loud or blaring are really aggressive even Carla's vocals themselves are not quite as in-your-face as they were on projects like Evangelista she isn't really reaming or shrieking on this record instead on numerous tracks here Carla has this stone-faced intensity that comes with the kind of drama that is really eerie kind of haunting kind of intimidated and just the sound of her voice on this record - it's so weary it sounds like the vocals are hundreds of years older than the person who's actually singing with them there are some moments on this record like drown to the light where the vocals do strain a little bit that's somewhat of a turn-off for me on this LP but it doesn't happen too often but still even when the vocals are doing just fine Carla's voice it's it's it's a little much you know actually like all the instrumentation everything about this record is just a little much and while you know I can't say that that's necessarily a bad thing I do enjoy this record it does appeal to me but it does feel like the vocals as well as the instrumentation on this LP are driven by this like very real tangible mania and it's it's kind of scary there are scary moments on this record like when Carla is just very quietly whispering that she wants to up the whole world or when she's sort of wandering through her thought process as to why she's gonna stop murdering people with shotgun blast to the head on the track gonna stop killing or when she is going through the very esoteric and cryptic description of what is quite possibly a very surly and a sexual situation on the track dance land not only are a lot of the lyrics on this record really darken and morbid and disturbing trip but just Carla's delivery man she just sounds so drained and there are other moments here where it seems like she's doing spoken word but also singing simultaneously just the lines are blurred so much she's on the border of singing or on the border of speaking you know that this this entire record is on the border of something the border of insanity the border of falling apart the border of maybe being composed and kind of well put together it's hard to describe I mean there is some beautiful melodic and instrumental detail in these songs there are some very interesting lyrics I mean obviously a lot of effort win to these tracks but there's something very unique and off-put with how disheveled a lot of the performances on this record sound with all these strung out vocals with background vocals that barely line up with them all these very loosely played drums and guitars like all the instrumentation on this record is wasted and trying to progress itself through one of the worst nightmares imaginable that is exactly what the first track on this entire LP sounds like with these very sparse but hard-hitting drums this bass that is just grinding and just really ugly and very sparse there's only like a few notes of bass and these lyrics and this vocal delivery that it just kind of feels like this person is coming up to me and hitting on me and trying to get me in their Cadillac and this track progresses into what I do not know all of a sudden these electric piano keys hit and it seems like all the instrumentation loses its composure I wouldn't say it's like super ferocious or like making a whole ton of noise by being ultra aggressive it's just like nothing is like lining up it's just so weird it's like all of a sudden I my eyes have blurred over and I can no longer tell what's going on even though I am clearly picking out keys drums bass and Carla's voice just like crazily back stroking through this mix the sound of the instrumentation on this thing is really was e it's freakish it's disorienting and a lot of the time tracks on here including this one are just way too insane and just out there to even string together like a decent or coherent ending you know a lot of the finishes on this record are a little abrupt they're sort of sudden I mean I think this first song didn't just need a stronger ending but maybe even like an entire third act however there are only maybe a few tracks on this record where these abrupt ending is really ruin the momentum and ruin my enjoyment of the song like what is it baby and drowned and like I mean I guess if all the songs on this record were really cleanly written and had concise beginnings and endings it would make the really disheveled sound and look of the instrumentation sort of like a big fat lie Carla really puts together a singer-songwriter record that is challenging it's obtuse and it is non-traditional from head to toe if there's any clear logic objective - what she's doing on this LP it's maybe to keep you guessing especially with the closing track on here number X it's this weird droning subtle instrumental with these beautiful guitar melodies being played throughout and then all of a sudden Karla comes in in the final few moments of the song just to deliver a few lines of lyrics and the track just finishes don't blow me out before I finish burning I've settled into a life of learning wouldn't it be fine if that check out time I was doing what I'm doing right now and with this really poetic nod toward death I'm assuming the album just stops and it's it's a really chilling moment on the record it's really chilling finished it's not an anti climactic finish it's a chilling finish you know rarely on this record does Karla leave me with a really catchy song but she always leaves me with a really weird and strong impression like on the industrial II flavored track one hardman which has all these mechanical just banging and clanging drum beats there are all these ugly noises playing against one another and in Carla's vocals go absolutely twist it insane to the point where her lyrics basically devolve into just you know a very quick utterances of no no no no no no no no no no no no no I just want to scream listening to this track it just gets more and more intense as I listen to it and you know I I just want to like just just yell Carla are you okay especially with lyrics on this thing saying that there are veins with railroad tracks on them or you know metaphorically comparing railroad tracks to veins vice versa so on and so forth also the imagery of like the hands melting I get a lot of the same reactions out of the track deeper than the well which is maybe one of the most frightening tracks on this entire record however Carla does manage to transmit some legitimately beautiful moments melodies expressions through this sonic torture garden like the very slowly galloping bead and the bluesy electronic piano keys and the very nice soft bass guitar on the lazy crossbones which is maybe the most composed song in this entire record in terms of listen ability and cohesion of the instrumentation but there's still a lot of weird sound play going on in the background and of course the song just gets stranger and stranger as it continues you know this this coherence does not last very long there's also a few really beautiful string crescendos on this LP and there's the song dance land as well which to me is just like a really weird rusted merry-go-round of a song where I just feel like I'm being brought through this very soulful very dark but also kind of blissful and relaxing a set of sounds I just feel really entranced by what goes on with this track just a lot of different emotions hitting me on this one you know this is this is a really great freaking record it's really enjoyable record and and and not one that I think may be enjoyable to you or many other people upon first listen I mean you know lord knows that I was not loving my initial listens to this record outside of like a few tracks and then as I was just revisiting it more and more I just realized what a freaking complex and weird onion this record is you know not that on the surface or at first it's gonna appeal to you as being overly simple or plain there's just a lot going on and there's just a lot that doesn't like I said earlier line up you know this this record is really just just everything is just so messy and intentionally just like put out of place and the fact that everything isn't assembled really tightly kind of distracts away from the fact that there is a ton of detail in this record and some beautiful melodies too and some really clever and vivid lyrical imagery while I think boy might not go down as one of the more well known records of this year it's certainly going to be one of my favorites in terms of just man the emotional power of so many songs on this thing and just just the the oddness of this record really does make it at least one of my most unique musical experiences of 2014 so far I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing Tran if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Carla boy music forever 
W1APvyVVm-4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new fenty faxes yes record sacred white noise these guys are a Toronto black metal trio and they are dropping their full-length debut this month following up an EP they put out several years ago through Dark Descent records which this record is also coming out through their EP unfortunately did sit by me however this record and the first song off of this thing the first song to drop the first song to open this record up did not the title of this thing the bright white nothing at the end of the tunnel clearly this band does not take making statements lightly this song title is is weighty with verbiage and an message to I guess sort of proposing that maybe when we're facing death at the end there is nothing even the title of this record seems like an incredibly poetic tribute to the art of black metal in that the guitar sound so brittle and so distorted like a wall of white noise and how the fanaticism surrounding this occult sub-genre of metal is almost religious in a way however it was not just this bands a way with words and album titles as well as their incredibly difficult name and this stark black and white depressing album cover that caught my attention it was also their sound who'da thought sound would actually make someone want to listen to an album the bright white nothing on this track the opener to this LP as I've said opens up with these manic organs just creating this cacophonous dissonance and man it's just soaked in this really wide panoramic reverb that isn't too much but it just feels a natural in a way it feels like I'm listening to this band perform at the altar of some kind of black and Cathedral but also aside from these organs there are also these winding guitar leads that are really bright really sharp and once the rest of the instrumentation kicks in it's just hard for me not contain my excitement for the fact that this track is recorded and produced fantastically every bass drum pummels every symbol as clear as a bell the snares just crack through the mix the guitars are really bright again as I said burning searing fiery and what's even nicer is the bass is incredibly present on this record bass not really a major player traditionally in black metal records typically it's something that thickens up the mix a little bit if it's even there but here it's actually playing a pretty significant role the vocals on this record are animalistic they have a range of I guess screamed pitches they're not quite the high-pitched wretches that you would expect from a classic black metal record there are some guttural lows on this thing that I think death metal fans would appreciate as well as just the overall heaviness of the record along with the really precise performances on all these tracks to this band is incredibly tight there is electricity there is momentum to the way that they play together and the sound that they create is just this stark sick ferocious and tortured sonic palette and aside from the sound and the performances there is another thing that makes this record stick out and that is the band the way they write their tracks for the genre anyway it's pretty progressive I wouldn't say it's incredibly flashy or technical or really really indebted to the old school of prog rock in the same way that murmur record I loved earlier this year was with their very obvious King Crimson influences but fancy facts ass does get pretty adventurous with their song structures they don't mind multi-faceted songs they don't mind tracks they just kind of shift pace like on the opening track here that has like I said this dizzying angular guitar lead that is played over these drums that are constantly shifting back and forth between these busy fills and really intense blast beats then all of a sudden the band segues into these really loud quickly strum guitar chords there's this fantastic guitar passage in the middle of the track that has all these guitar leads in the left channel just building up and up and up intensity tension while all these guitar leads in the right channel our careening downward it really just screws with my head and occasionally there are these keyboards adding a little bit of thickness to the track and just even more dissonance it's it's insanity the band really knows how to keep a song exciting from start to finish the band exemplifies this again on the 11 minute closer here it's the longest song on this LP as well the same string sounds that play out on the first track here play a larger role in the very bleak depressing intro that kicks this thing off it's a really haunting introduction and these same strings play into some really great tremolo picked our melodies on this thing and also back up some spots where you're getting these really weird dissonant wails of strings it sounds like blood dripping down a wall in a horror movie there are moments on the song as well where the band is just hammering on these pummeling riffs and the entire song let's get off with just a this very sharp wall of white noise sacred white noise again these are multifaceted songs but it's not like they're so dense and the band fills these tracks up in a really gimmicky way with so many ideas that the songs lose focus every shift every change in direction that the band makes feels really coherent the flow of these songs I think is really good I think the only downside to the way that the band writes and performs some of these tracks is that these subtle details of the way that they write these songs and their performances well does tend to get overshadowed in just the hair but maybe for you this is something that you'll dig up and acclimate yourself to a little bit more with a few more listens now I do think this record also brings some decent diversity to the table like eternally falling which is a bit of an interlude track in the middle of the entire LP with these really cavernous lonesome melodies calling out very slowly moving monolithically just up until the point where at the very end drums bass kick in and you get these really slow brooding riffs that transition into the next track pretty nicely while I do think that this song does drag on a little bit I love that this band can present a blunt and aggressive side as well as a very slow and subtle side pretty well and the song where I end and the hemlock begins is one of the I guess comparatively one of the more glacial tracks on the entire LP with just how slowly the chord progression is moving and spiraling downward definitely one of the moodier songs on the record and the bass lines occurring behind these chords are actually pretty angular just jumping all over the place later there are some really anthemic guitar solos on this track that feel like the melodies that they're playing are really archaic and then some guitar passages that feel like they were pulled straight out of like a Mahavishnu record there are a few other very high velocity songs on this record as well that also bring many highlights but they are really intense as well and like the other songs here will require some attentive listening to really pull apart this record basically functions on six tracks that are spread out across 44 minutes so it's not too long the man album and we don't have too many songs on here either it's not like we have a bunch of tracks that feel like they are cut short or anything like that the songs on here are meaty all of them leave me full I don't feel like I'm left wanting more the record isn't so long that I would call it ambitious or anything like that it's just diverse enough to cover all the bases it needs to on its 44 minute runtime so while there are some really impressive elements to sacred white noise in some regards I do think this record does jest enough there's a lot of experimentation going on right now in black metal and safety facts F is obviously far from being the most experimental but still they pulled together a really really great exciting record not necessarily exciting in terms of the ideas they bring to the table though I do think these guys are pretty far from just being a strictly traditional black metal outfit but more exciting in that the songs are written really well the riffs are great and the playing is fantastic the recording is just top freakin notch I'm feeling a ds2 strong 8 on this record transition if you've given this LP a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it sacred white noise anthony Fantana forever 
SHBr1pEgq34,on you know it is what's going on I am making a quick video to let you know in case you haven't already heard that right now and I know a lot of people are sad that and have been sad that mars volta pretty much disbanded at this point at the drive-in came back for a few live shows but uh i'm not sure if they're like totally and completely back together still it seems like these beloved bands are really in sort of a weird state of flux right now i mean we still have solo stuff coming out from omar which is okay but uh but still you know we're hoping for you know more stuff like bolta at least they're more raw output and more stuff like drive into sort of a you know come together at least me personally i'm sort of wondering what's what's going to come of this immense talent that guys like Omar and cedric have and just the amazing sound that they put onto their best records in these bands and it seems that they are back with a new project called anti mask apparently flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers is in on this as well and they are going to be dropping a new full-length record from what I understand but right now over here they have a little band camp that has several songs on it and these tracks are raw as hell I mean like at the drive-in raw but still like a lot of the great fantastic playing that not only is on at the drive-ins records but you know sort of the the technical ability and the talent that they've developed over the years working together in at the drive-in and volta as well I mean you know the songs are raw but they're really detailed too i think the tracks so far really good and I'm just going to pass the band camp your way down there in the description where you can check these songs out because if there's anything that's going to be really exciting and sort of worth watching a project anyway that I'm going to be hotly into pating as far as like a sort of a post hardcore sort of progressive punkish kind of project it's going to be this one so here you go like I sat down there in the description check out the band camp give a listen to the songs and if you hadn't known that this project was was floating around I mean it's it's it's been about a week or so that people have been talking about the band sort of dropping tracks individually here and there and seems they brought them together over here on this band camp just a handful and maybe more songs will be leaking out soon into the future I hope so all right Anthony Fantana anti mask forever 
ku9BgerCj_k,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new little herb album welcome to phase oh man thank you kill an old problem what the hell is on your head no you know definitely not to see me hair cut or nothing and my head that you get no why do you got to do this to me you know just sometimes you want to be like you'll in seeker this is not happening this is not happening you are not doing this to me whoo well there you go we're back baby little herb is a Chicago rapper and this is his breakout project welcome to phase ole and he has dropped previous mixtapes in the past but this is easily the biggest of everything he has done thus far in terms of buzz and the momentum for this project continues considering that he just dropped a fresh new single with Nicki Minaj now herb is a part of this current strain of trap rappers coming out of the Midwest right now specifically Chicago a lot of people calling this stuff drill do not go into this mixtape expecting a progressive eccentric like chance the rapper or to a lesser extent vic mensa herb sits on that more grim dangerous violent side of the Chicago rap scene right now with guys like Chief Keef or little Reese who is actually featured on this tape and on this tape herb teams up with other prominent locals make a noise in Chicago right now - like little Dirk and King Louie now typically this stuff is super duper aggressive it's loud which I like but it really fails to connect with me on a lyrical level especially with guys like Chief Keef though I may love a lot of the hooks I may think it's catchy I love the production I just find a guy like him obnoxious to listen to for long periods of time I get that his message comes from a real place I can only assume but without the skill level to frame this reality of his in an interesting and captivating way I just failed to see what's going to be interesting about him for the long term that's why continually the real star of all of this drill music out of Chicago right now in my opinion has been young chop I think he's got loads of talent I think he has a good head on his shoulders and I think his production exemplifies everything that is new exciting and explosive about this brave new world of trap music but little heard though he is the first voice to come out of this wave that has actually grabbed me on a lyrical level and not to his word shed light on anything that we couldn't already guess given that he is from a place whose reputation is overshadowed by its murder rate the drugs the the violence they're all here on this project but her puts a coherent vivid and lyrical face on this story in a lot of respects he's just as savage as his peers like on tracks such as on my soul which the hook on this song sounds just like something that could come out of a Chief Keef track but the lyrical imagery going into these tracks is just a lot more grimy and his flow his delivery is way more forceful and convincing and even though he doesn't have the most distinct voice I think he's showing a very nice level of skill for someone who is his age and with this amount of content under his belt he's very comfortable with a more speedy flow like on the back end of the song love to stunts or the slower more spaced out very pronounced deliveries that we hear over a lot of these trap beats currently and instrumentally he's pretty diverse as well he is as comfortable over these trap instrumentals as he is some soul sampling boom-bap and topically and emotionally I feel that he's really good at playing both sides of the fence - from hardened young criminal who's sort of locked into this hellhole and doesn't see any way out other than to kind of give in to the ebb and flow of the bad things happening around him but at times he's also repentant for the things that he does he's a critical observer of the world around him as well and yeah maybe I am overthinking this whole thing to an extent some would say that I am bringing an outsider perspective to the table given that I did not grow up on the southside of Chicago but here's a news flash I am an outsider to every record I listen to I am NOT in the artists head and what is art if not something that allows us to understand the perspective and the emotions of the person who created it hmm so anyway herb does have lyrics he has flow however that wasn't really hitting me on the first few tracks here I thought that he sounded just a little amateurish on the song at the light even though I thought the hook was solid and a lot of the lyrics were there then again there was the song cool and right after where I thought the chorus on this track was kind of awkward really out of shape and I wasn't really impressed by the lyrics on this track either they just didn't strike me as special especially with the mention swag and with the true religion jeans which is one of the most baffling fashion trends I think that has come out as of late True Religion I think right now makes one of the ugliest pairs of jeans I've ever seen in my life and I remember when I was a kid when South Pole jeans were popular herb doesn't actually grab me on this tape until the track fighter flight which is a huge change in direction on this thing instrumentally and thematically he raps about how all he cares about is himself and his family because nobody else does he's fighting to survive he's not from Beverly Hills so he has no lies to tell really and then there's the song four minutes of Hell part 3 which is this grimy trap rap song he goes back into that direction but the lyrics just seems so much grittier on this song he really encapsulate some self into this lyrical hell where he just kind of feels like he can't escape and I love the epic female vocal samples hanging in the background the big clanging bells but even though he lashes out against his setting on a lot of tracks here simultaneously he sees it as all he has right now just like on the closing track here he sees himself as being indebted to this place as much as he suffers for it there's the song on the corner which oddly enough you might find this surprising with its distorted auto-tune hook I think is one of the best tracks on this entire LP killer chorus on this thing I love the repetitious on the corner refrain it's ear worms like this that really make this song sweet and repeatable and topically it is a song of warning to stay off that corner because you know what the hell happens there there are some tracks in the middle of this project that I don't dig too much like Designer where things just get a little too shallow and sonically this just sounds a little bit too much like a amigos track or something and there are moments where the relative gap in talent between herb and his contemporaries out of Chicago right now is a very obvious like when King Louie hops on the mic on one track here is just not as charismatic and as convincing or as lyrical as herb and the same goes for little Reis but he is actually able to come through with some clever hilarious and very bold and lines that makes up for these gaps like how he tells older rappers to just quit completely and make way for the younger guys how he says that if you're making money you should be feeding everyone on the block and he asks how one rapper is hot when his album just flopped for me this project has really at its strongest in the first half it finishes up relatively well there are tracks in the second half like still up which brings another boom backbeat to the table that sounds really great lyrically herb dies a little bit into his past he gets nostalgic on this track and starts talking about his come up in the rap game a bit I love the drive and the passion and the aggression he shows on the song love to stun and I think the chorus is one of the catchiest on this entire LP - but on the flip side the song ain't for none is maybe one of the most obnoxious tracks on this entire l page with just such a lopsided be and the mixing on this song is just so weird - the hi-hats are completely out of whack and even though I know those ear worms are really important those repetitive lyrical ear worms are important to this style of music they just get a little redundant on this song and a few others on here too you know overall I did like this thing a lot I still think herb is very young he's still finding his voice but he has a great foundation to build on with this project I think he's showing a lot of talent and I think these are some of the better songs I've heard off of any trap mixtape this year and right now anyway herb is definitely the most coherent convincing and lyrical emcee to come out of this new aggressive strain of rappers from Chicago I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given Faizal an - listen what did you think of it love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it Anthony Fantana little herb forever 
niyLKbA2_Xs,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan dear Anthony I love your reviews even if I don't always agree with them but I guess that's what makes them so much more fun to watch them thank you so here's the thing I've been trying to get more into experimental and avant-garde music such as lower case free jazz and drone especially noise and others that fall into the spectrum but I'm having some difficulty actually appreciating them for what they are I mean I don't hate them really I know what genres I like and which ones I'm not so appreciative of it's just that I don't get it at all now I've done some research on these genres in hopes of understanding where these artists are coming from and what made them create this kind of music I've even asked some of my friends for some tips on how to appreciate more challenging music however it just makes me feel more alienated and confused when I try to listen to them and half the time I don't even understand what they're trying to convey I know I don't have to force myself into liking anything but I partly do just for the joy of it the challenge and I do want to understand and appreciate but again I just don't get it with that being said do you have any tips and ideas as to how to like this kind of music do I just need to listen to it over and over again until I get it and that would probably drive me mad honestly how do you personally get yourself into this kind of music and enjoy its nuances era T PS say hi to cow era T thank you very much for the letter it's a really good question a lot of people ask me how to appreciate darker more experimental more abrasive styles of music occasionally which I do review and I am a very big fan of here's the thing this is a really huge gigantic conversation in which there are a load of different issues to be addressed so of course I could not just do this exploration by myself I brought on mr. Mike Rugnetta of the PBS idea channel you can find his stuff down there in the description box and we are going to have a lovely conversation as to how one should go into the miles of music mindframe wise and go about appreciating them transition and here we are with the magic of the Internet we are speaking with Mike Rugnetta of the idea channel right now and we're going to be attacking philosophically this email to you guys it's not gonna attack in a nice way Mike and I mutually are pretty big fans of a lot of the genres of music that were mentioned in this email but I think a lot of the same mental preparation goes into enjoying each of them but I mean that's at least my perspective of Mike what kind of mindset do you put yourself into or what do you go into free jazz or drone or noise or lowercase sort of expecting or wanting to hear what kind of emotions are you looking to feel moved well that's a really good question um you know I like I don't know at this point because like a lot of these kinds of musics like you know especially noise and drone like those are things that when I put on music like I am probably just likely to put on one of those things so like it's not I don't think I have like a special like feeling that I'm trying to get or like a mindset that I'm in but I think if I were to think back to like when I first started listening to those things um you know like I think I think that what what got me into a lot of that stuff is feeling like there was more to pay attention to which which I really like like there's there's different ideas and more more different ideas going on than in you know whatever I was listening to before you know like I probably would probably like pop electronic music or whatever you know whatever the alternative was for me at the time and so yeah it was like you know it was it was something like uh not like an intellectual exercise but there was like more for me to like grab onto and wrestle with and be challenged by which I found and still find really exciting why I mean I can I can totally understand that feeling because you know as much as we try to act like they're these really bold clear borders separating all these really popular styles of music the fact of the matter is is that they all function on a lot of the same characteristics be they verses and choruses or really strong thematic melodies or like a really catchy lyrical hook or even like a constant repetition of certain rhythms whether they be like a guitar riff or sort of just like a backing melody or a drum beat and at least in my personal experience seeking out these genres all of them really accept the lowercase I'm not even gonna pretend that well-versed in that and I'm just not gonna act like it there's also there's not a whole lot of lowercase happening yeah I mean like it's like there's not a ton out there so it makes sense that like of the of the grouping like that's the one you're like no III know I know it's the more recent of the three genres and and and I know that a lot of the stuff that is out there tends to be mixed a bit with other genres too so you know it's so there are very few records that are just like purely yeah over case but still and I think it's and I think much like much like free jazz it's one of those labels that either some or all of the people who have been labeled lowercase or like you know little like I don't know about that yeah I mean I guess I guess I'm trying to say is I mean whenever I seeked out these three genres and when I started seeking out these genres it was it was mostly for the desire of adventure if there's any kind of advice I have for anybody going into these styles of music who like might listen to any of the records that we're recommending down at the description box do not go into it expecting to be thrilled in the same way you would a really good pop song with like an explosive catchy book I feel like people go into like a noise record assuming that they're gonna get the same kind of gratification and when they don't feel it that they're that they're thinking that oh I must not get it or something I think I think that that's yeah like at least at first that's a fair that's like a really fair thing to say because right like I like growing up you are just subjected to pop music like it's it's basically part of the landscape and it is a thing that you are trained culturally to understand right like this is this is like what a sad song is and makes you feel like this is what a triumphant or you know glorious song is and makes you feel like and there aren't as many of those shortcuts as there are in like more difficult genres of music or more you know more like experimental I guess genres of music but like you know that it that can also be a way to get in you know like ice I studied so when I studied music in college one of my one of the people in my composition program was this dude who used to play piano for Cecil Taylor and like you know had this really like intense playing style where he was like attacking the piano and it was like this really fast like really aggressive style of music and so lots of people found their way into what this guy John was playing because they were like yeah like that's brutal like that's like it's so aggressive and like you know there's so much emotion but he would always get really mad because to him that was not anger or aggressiveness that was not like like I'm like the punk rock style of like I'm fed up and so I play aggressively for him that was the way to make like interesting and different music and so you know once you can get past that aspect of it you start to figure out like oh it's not just you know like free jazz not just Angry sounding music like it's actually there's a sort of like what you said there's that that intellectual you know you can it repays thinking about and not just that visceral like body thing that we're used to with a lot of music well well speaking about just free jazz in general one of the things that I get out of listening to either jazz that is purely free or just more progressive styles of jazz that feature elements of that where there might be parts of the composition that are left completely up to chance you know rather than just sort of the simple sweet aggression or catharsis that that comes with a pop tune I'm getting more of like you said earlier kind of this mental challenge you're getting more to think about and and you're getting more to think about not necessarily because the artist might have put more thought into what they're doing versus what the pop artist did the reason that music like this tends to fridaya brain a little bit is because your brain is constantly trying to catch up with the music that it's listening to and figure out patterns I mean that's essentially what your brain is doing when you listen to music its deciphering patterns and every single set of sounds that is being played and when you listen to something as disorienting as free jazz or like a noise song where the noises tend to not really draw on and a really kind of elongated way but more like sort of jet and are sporadic and you know really difficult to predict that becomes something that people are either really drawn in by and have to like sort of zoom in on really hard just to kind of like make sense of what's going on or it's something that people like ultimately or just not ultimately but instantly disgusted by and you know that's the reaction you know this is a music sort of comes from yeah like the like did like the I read I've been reading over the last little while this guy I think if David Stubbs wrote fear of music which is basically all about why people will look at a Rothko or a Jackson Pollock painting and be like you know like I don't like it but I can understand the artistic value in it you know like sort of as a general attitude towards towards more challenging visual art but you play someone more challenging music from the same period and you know like stock housing or something and and the response is like this is just this is nonsense well you know that I've actually talked with friends about that before and the reason I think that something like that is is because just some of the demands I think there's higher demands higher mental demands when it comes to listening to music than looking at a painting and when I say that I mean more from like a layman's standpoint because I mean a song if it's an avant-garde experimental 20-minute song in order to be finished with it you've got to sit there the whole time and listen to it for the full 20 minutes whereas where the painting it can be the most experimental thing that's ever been created and somebody could just glance at and be like I looked at it right it's like you know what when looking at a painting I mean I'm sure somebody who is more visually attune than I am can look into a painting and get the same level of stimuli in their brain that I would from a really experimental piece of music but you know your average person if they're not attuned in that way then they're just going to look at the painting and kind of decide on their own pace when they're done yeah absolutely is a painter there are all these various subtleties in the execution of the painting that they'll notice and pick up on and sort of read into really deeply yeah I also think that you know like there's a fair amount of visual training that you know like our culture is a very very visual one even though you know music is everywhere and so I think you know like that also has a lot to do that we're like we're sort of our um our acceptance or at least familiarity with visual complexity I think it's fair to say is higher than our of familiarity or acceptance marketing and luck yeah totally like audio you know oral complexity yeah I mean that's that's a that's a definite that's a definite possibility so so you know do you personally like I just mentioned get anything emotionally or mentally from listening to music that is more difficult to predict or sort of more difficult to kind of see what it's going to be throwing at you down the road yeah I mean I think that's like that's kind of the thing that I'm that I'm like always that might be the reason that I listen to the music that I do because there was there was a moment for me where like like pop music almost stopped working like that feels like a really shitty thing to say but it's kind of like uh like I just I don't know maybe I just lost interest in the song form and it's not that I don't like it and it's not that I don't you know like I love Ryan Adams which is like for someone who listens to lots of like Noise music also loving Ryan Adams seems like a conflict of terms but you know like I do and so I and I can appreciate that but the thing you the thing that I'm always looking for when listening to like other other genres of music like these is like ways to get those emotions and ideas from like more complicated like sonic like you know experiments or sonic assemblages or whatever you want to call them the this that's interesting because I mean you know to to be completely honest most of the time with I mean pop music still very much works for me despite you know listening to a great deal of it a great deal of music that fits into that you know structure a lot of the time but when I listen to these other genres of music I don't really connect with them in the same way emotionally that I would a pop song even if I'm really trying to were looking for moments in it that that would normally I mean a lot of the time I mean I do find excitement in this kind of music but it's mostly the excitement of I mean with artists like this they're pushing sonic and compositional bound you know and to me listening to an artist that works so far outside of that normal pop music structure is kind of just like visiting a new place you know it's it's just like going someplace that you've never ever seen before you know I remember when I first started listening to Sun and a really good buddy of mine who initially like you know ruined in my life when he turned me on to punk music you know he was he was like asking me what the hell was the appeal and in any of this I was just like you know it's I said because who else is making the sound yeah like I mean and and you know I mean I feel like appreciating their music runs much deeper than that but when I first started getting into them that was like my first reaction right my brain identifies this as a thing that it has never experienced before yeah exactly sorry gonna jinx you no no you hang up close I'll go on I'll go on yeah you know I feel like the other side of this coin that we have to talk about is I mean we talked about the the styles of music that were mentioned in this email that are more sporadic and more predictable but there's another side to at least two other of the genres here especially drone and that is I mean this music isn't sporadic or unpredictable instead it's the exact opposite drone really thrives on sameness a lot of the time throughout an entire composition and as interesting as it is I imagine for you you may like it more or less than these other experimental styles of music but I'm sure it draws from a different place emotionally I wonder yeah I mean I think so like just a good to go back like a step or two maybe it's not maybe it's not that pop music stopped working but that I stopped being surprised yeah since like I stopped and like you know the things things that I find now where it's pop music that is surprising like those are things that I still love because you know like of course I don't to say of course I love pop music but like of course to a certain degree everyone it has a relationship with pop music you almost kind of have to and I think that your description of like it's like going to a new place is is really spot-on because for you know music like noise and drone and these other things you know it's I think that you can when you get out of the like four-piece band a song structure thing you you can start to create noises and sounds and like sonic landscapes and even places that are more surprising than you could ever get with right like the standard the standard band set up and thus the the like the pop song format and that and that in that sense I think you really can create like complex emotional content it's just really different from what we're used to getting from music like as like as most of us think of what music is yeah and I think you know and that's part of what that's part of what you know like John Cage wrote about like in silence right like it's all when you realize that every single sound is music then the world of music becomes much more complex and much more meaningful and so as far as drone is concerned you know for me those that genre is like spans all kinds of all kinds of reactions you know it's the thing I'm listening to a lot late right now which is um which I recommended so it's like it's probably in the description is it so it is is the total life radiator record which is like this awesome like sort of slow changing square and sawtooth wave drone that is like for any given 15-second chunk really straight for really simple but has this kind of glacial movement and progression to it and for me that's like that's like shutting out the world and just like living in this like living in this machine of thing and so the emotion for that is you know like that really makes me feel like I'm like I'm getting something done like I'm really doing something even if I am literally just sitting there listening to it but then there are things like like le on Rada gay or Radig and you know her work can at times just be like like heartbreaking like and it's you know and it's an hour and 17 minutes long drone and just for whatever reason there's this progression of resonances that she set up on her synthesizer that you're just like you know so evocative of the that's the thing I feel like on the surface and there is some drone that is like that people assume that the entire genre is just like OneNote continuing on or an eternity and there are some artists that you know that go down that road yeah there's some artists whose drones tend to be a little more thinner and Atmospheric there are some like I just mentioned like Sun who I recommend in the link down there as well as Earth whose approach to the style is much more aggressive and I mean uh really uh I want to say a a lot of drum music tends to run on a more ambient side of things whereas they are just like very forceful with presentation of the style and you know I would say just like any other style of doom I mean drone their music is like really numbing it's meditative and then they're artists like you just mentioned and I think in a sense Tim Hecker to where there are elements of drone in their music are really strong drone influence but there's like composition hidden in there really clear concise composition that's actually really beautiful yeah and like I think one of the other people that I recommended Herrmann niche like his like I really like him for like introduction to drown because he just he picked a beautiful instrument the harmonium and he picks really beautiful harmonies and then Joe holds them and it's like and it's kind of like saying hey like if this thing is beautiful which it is like why not just listen to it for a while and like see what happens see what kind of like musical understanding or personal experience or whatever you can get out of like this pretty thing happening for a pretty long time and I think that's also like a really great sort of like it's a great use of musical time yeah it's it's um I think you know the the more pretty like you know sonically beautiful more ear candy side of drone music like you were saying earlier some of these more avant-garde styles of music like okay you can catch similar emotions from them that you would from a pop song but in some instances these emotions are pushed to an extreme like with the you know to be completely honest last year I don't think I heard a record that I thought that was more sonically pretty to listen to than that Tim Hecker record version so good yeah it's it's very pretty to listen to it's very pretty record to listen to on a lot of those tracks and you know even though there's plenty of pretty music that that I think exists in the pop world the pop realm there's a there's something about just kind of stretching a lot of these sounds out and just allowing them to kind of grow on you and just build momentum and build tension with you you know that you get out of a drone so yeah I mean drone music just a much more laid-back meditative predictable but in all the in all the right ways and I think we should maybe dive a little bit into Noise music before we get out of this which I mean can be at times just as sporadic as as free jazz but is is not nearly as harsh compositionally because I mean a lot of these artists aren't necessarily working with tones and the chromatic scale instead they're compiz Asians are based around sound effects and textures and I mean I think that in itself as a brings a different kind of disorientation than something like purely improvisational music does right I was actually I was I was thinking about this earlier today and I didn't recommend it for noise music but I really should because it's not technically Noise music but I think it's a really great way to get into it which is um Pierre Schaeffer it's you know Pierre Schaeffer he was a he was like the forefront of this this type of music composition in Paris in the 20th century called music concret yeah basically like right yeah like when people realize that they could take a tape recorder out into the world and record sounds in the world and then go back to the studio and slow them down speed it up rerecord like splice the same section over and over again that this opened up a whole world of sound for in studio audio composition and that's how tape music right became a thing and it's so like us it's such awesome like proto noise ideas in the sense of you know it is right it's it's non musical sounds like classically non musical sounds treated as compositional elements yeah most definitely and and you know and I do realize that that was sort of the the I guess sort of the primer the primordial soup that Noise music kind of came out of but maybe what this dude might be talking about is more like I know you recommended merge though now your list and I recommended Korean you know both artists who tend to be on kind of the more harsh and just like grading side of things and I mean I don't know with with with me personally I mean sometimes with with Noise music like that I kinda after a long time will get the same reaction from like that I would from a drone song in a sense where I don't know it's like at least maybe with a free jazz song and hearing some of tones I feel like after a while with like a really intense noise song my brain just like completely just shuts down where's like when you like stop listening like you just don't hear it not if I stop listening I just feel like my brain just like I feel like maybe either my brain completely shuts off or my brain has either shut down every single part of my head outside of my auditory senses just to figure out what the hell is going on all right and there's something about reaching that kind of like mental plane that's almost like a really weird high like I don't feel like when I'm in that state I don't feel like anything else exists I could I can totally I can um I can identify with that when I was in college I used to actually put on the mirth I'll record that I recommended to take a nap in the afternoon like I would put that on in my room and my neighbors hated me in college and then like you know crank it and then yet would get to that point where it's just like my my brain maybe just shut out you know it was like okay I have in order to deal with this I have to turn off conscious acknowledgement of the arms and now also the legs and now the world and then obviously so I mean I I think I mean and that's the thing about this kind of music I don't think what makes it so great sometimes and and and this is also it makes it difficult for people to get into it I think I I feel I feel like with noise music and avant-garde styles of music there's an even less agreed-upon way to feel about it and enjoy it which is why it's so much more difficult to make the transition from pop music to Noise music right like when like when you go to a punk rock show and it's like a really aggressive punk rock show it's clear that like there is some sort of like like you know fuck the man and like you know like I I have like these you strap do it that you should be happy yeah like aggressive political ideas like there is like there's a sort of cannon of of reaction to the music whereas with noise music it's like somewhere maybe in the punk-rock realm but also maybe somewhere in the metal realm but also maybe somewhere in the art music realm you know no definitely okay I think you know I think I think so much of like you said earlier you know because how we are indoctrinated with with pop music into pop music into enjoying pop music you know we sort of learn without even understanding how to enjoy it you know like on other people's social cues and learning which parts are supposed to be more enjoyable than other parts and which are the parts that everybody sings along with and which are the parts that stick in your head after you're done listening to it whereas with Noise music I mean it doesn't play by any of these rules so people go into it assuming that they don't get it when maybe the intention is and get it more obvious than you think yeah it's just that you're you either haven't found out how to get the same emotional thrill out of it or you're just looking for the wrong emotional thrills out of it and you know I would say when listening to any of these styles of music I mean you're not going to no matter how many times you listen to Sun and Boris's alter you're never going to get the same you know kind of enjoyment out of it that you would like a good Rolling Stones record you know you have to kind of sit with it and then figure out you know how exactly you personally react emotionally to it and what I I don't know I feel like I'm I'm having a difficult time like saying this really clear idea of my head out of my mouth I don't know I don't like I don't know if I agree because I think you know the first time I ever listened to Boris like I had like a really strong reaction to it like mom you know like I had a really strong I mean you guess it was probably an emotional reaction cuz it was a reaction and that I've never had from like a good Rolling Stones record or like a really great Beatles Rock that's well that's what I'm saying it's like you could have a really strong emotional reaction it's just that I feel like some people go into this stuff looking for the same emotional reaction I see what you're saying that the act like one of their fever records in like classic rock or something and I think right and I think another part of that that a lot of a lot of times goes unsaid is that a lot of this music doesn't have lyrics and for a lot of people that is like the thing that they listen to and that's it and so that's yeah and so you are you are then on double on like sort of falter II ground because not only is it slightly difficult and different it also doesn't have a human voice saying recognizable words a lot of the time to your last point I have so I've seen like wolf eyes and Wolf's eyes related side projects of which there are men at this point maybe hundreds I've seen them live a bunch of times and the like audience like reaction or the audience like attitude has been has has run the gamut like I've been to Wolf Eyes performances where there was a mosh pit and then Wolf Eyes performances where everyone was like sitting very quietly like they're in a gallery actually it was in a gallery so maybe that had something to do with it so right that's I mean there it is like it was in a get like so there's one like in the basically the decider though because I've seen a mosh pit at an Andrew W K show in an art museum so there yeah but it was Andrew W K whereas any goes like more more to your point of like it's the way to enjoy this music is maybe not so clearly telegraphed from the music itself which might be part of its beauty right that it is it is sort of vexing and inscrutable in that sense I also think I tend to think of right if the thing that's impressive about about lots of free jazz is that you're listening to or like non idiomatic instrumental music whatever you want to call it is that like oh man like whoa they can do that with acoustic instruments yeah like like you know you know that this is a drummer and a guitar player but when you listen you're like well what are they doing like that's cool like I didn't know that you could get that sound from that thing and I didn't know when you put them together you get that kind of form a lot of noise music is I think you it's it's very fair to have the same reaction where you're like what even is that sound like how do you how do you get that and like how do you decide to put it in this compositional like frame or this format and like you know just sort of the the mystery of it is also I think really appealing and really exciting yeah again that plays into the whole visiting a new place thing I mean you know and and this is just purely my reason and maybe this will be somebody else's reason who watches this video who might go into some of these records that we recommend you know I seek this music out occasionally because you know sometimes I just want something that doesn't make sense yeah you know sometimes I want to break from things that like make sense the world is not an ordered and fair place so no no you know it's it's a it's it's like a friend of mine says Dominic who has a drawing channel on YouTube you know he's pretty passionate about talking about sort of the beginning of the impressionist movement okay where he talks about how you know things like this started because people were tired of drawing things is exactly how they looked you know and and and that's the thing that I like about more experimental music like we've been talking about sometimes I don't want an instrument to sound the way it's supposed to sound sometimes I want a sound that I can't you know after multiple listens I cannot figure out its origin and even if that origin a lot of the time ends up being a computer or something I would not even know what to do in order to make that sound come out of a computer in the first place yeah you know and not that a mystery you know is the the the best weapon that this stuff has to offer you know sometimes people who make this music you know understand its ins and outs but yet it still retains its entertainment value but that's also because it's also surprising and unpredictable as well and it's explorative and some people just like the idea of that you know go into this kind of music with the idea of exploring in your head and I think you're gonna get a lot more out of it than you would if you came into it expecting to Bob your head at it at some point right yeah and to be like oh like yeah exactly yeah it's I'm like I think it was Kandinsky wrote about how you know as a painter he was jealous of music because it was the only truly abstract art form and you know I think that that's you know we've come a long way from when that state when statement was made and so it might not be as true as it was then when painting was basically like you know you draw you draw people and forms and figures but uh but I think that that's you know that's part of it is that it's it exists in the air not in front of your eyes and a lot of this music is the like the furthest the furthest expression the like end point of that idea where it's like if music is the only truly abstract art form what is its most abstract like instance yeah and and and what is um you know and another interesting thing that I feel like we should mention before we before we head out is that you know a lot of these experimental styles of music for as long as they've been around and for as unpopular as they've been in the mainstream for pretty much all of their existence all of them a great deal have influenced very popular mainstream and underground records you know a lot of popular artists tend to be influenced by the more experimental sounds that they're hearing and find out ways to incorporate them into more accessible compositions you know whether that be in the psychedelic rock movement in the noise rock movement in shoegaze and all the experimental production that we're hearing coming out of hip-hop right now you know uh these styles of music sonically have influenced tons of records that are incredibly popular and critically acclaimed and influential across the board where I agree word word word all right I want to thank Mike Rugnetta for coming on again I want to thank you for having me on it's been a real pleasure and we need to do one of these hangout things face to face just in in real in real like meat zone in real meat zone yeah I need to I need to make you deliver on your promise to play me the disintegration loops first I can look if literally it's like five feet away yeah you know I feel like I'm so close and yet so far that's how I feel great that it's right there oh my god here's a copy that I told you about at my local record store it's still sitting there and it's still like 300 dollars you know get it from get it from discogs it'll be at least half price uh-huh here's the book here let's so we'll find there's a good picture in here somewhere oh my god a good picture picture of what you know like blurry London but of course of course there's a blur at here there's a really good picture of Basinski himself oh nice it's blurry though it's not that blurry it's okay there you go so close yet so far yes yes exactly all right I will again remember everybody I left links down there in the description box to where you can see the artists that mike has recommended some of the records that I have recommended and remember to subscribe to the idea channel and when you see Mike's latest video leave him a compliment ah leave him a compliment now leave you all the compliments thank you all right everybody Anthony Fantana Mike Rugnetta experimental music forever 
VbXaF5EmTFk,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new idols album idols idlest I don't see but I don't see it down a sure prayer for tureen these guys are a Brisbane metal outfit I first heard about them a few years ago through the release of their debut record farewell all joy a record that I found phenomenally intense and noisy however I did not really find this LP that memorable compositionally I do remember the incredible sonic beatdown that this record brought to the table and then how it smashed the table that it brought it to immediately after and even though I'm usually impressed by that sort of thing I really need a bit more in the way of a finesse and in detail if the fact that you sound like an atomic bomb is really going to a translate to me and I feel the band came through with exactly that a little bit of finesse and some experimentation on this latest record of there's longer more multi-faceted songs on this record that meld together elements of grindcore metalcore specifically the sounds of bands like converge straight punk-rock noise rock and now in a lot of the tracks on this LP there are all of these freakish saxophone solos screaming away creating an insane ruckus buying the huge pummeling walls of riffs on this LP you might liken it to a shining record except I think the riffs are a bit heavier and the sax doesn't play as strong of a roll or you might liken it to maybe like one of John's or pne's naked city records except this band is obviously bringing Horne instrumentation into its music from a metal and Punk standpoint whereas when John was working with Naked City he was toying with grindcore metal and punk rock from an avant-gardist point of view I wouldn't say the experiment so boldly that this record ever loses its momentum the band pretty much focuses nearly every moment on this LP on a strong heavy visceral pummeling experience just like their first record but I think they out of their comfort zone enough to make the 28 minutes that this record lasts a bit more colorful and and hellish to the performances on this LP guitars bass drums vocals are all incredibly dizzying they're dense they're compact everything on this record happened so fast it's really difficult to put your finger on exactly what is going on on a first or a second or even a third listen I mean the abuse the sonic abuse that is going on is very clear but how exactly it happens you don't know it's sort of like being blindfolded and then being beaten within an inch of your life by a group of masked assailants not that they need masks you are blindfolded and this band does not hesitate to make sure that that message is sent loud and clear right with the opening track here lied to the longest track on this entire LP - at six minutes or so and it seems like this song was composed simply to be the most soul-sucking piece of music that this entire album has to offer really just beats down all expectations that the music that you're about to listen to we'll be showing you any signs of sunlight or anything sweet or anything catchy and then with every track after this one they just dragged you further down and into that abyss this track goes careening right into another that feels like an extension of the opener with these elongated horn and guitar riffs just playing against one another it's slow it's heavy and immediately after this we have a trio of songs that are maybe the most abrasive on the entire LP blast beats heavy rips and freakish vocals galore the screams are throw searing the blast beats are just like bombshell volume like I said earlier it's clear that these guys have listened to a bit of converge however I do think they take these influences and bring a much more freakish sound into the mix which most definitely comes out on a track like PCP crazy which is a more of a weird yet slower and more straightforward centerpiece in the entire record where the band seems to be playing up a bit of straightforward Punk och sort of right at the beginning of the track it's got all these strung out guitars this really distorted grimy bassline these vocals that are really shouty and have a bouncy echo on them reminds me a little bit of VOCs for whatever reason and this marching snare drum it's like they're a beat or two away from segwaying right into a cow punk song but instead they go right into some blast beats right after these minor interval riffs that go done and it ended in it like a soundtrack the band makes all these surprised transitions all over this track something I wish they experimented with a bit more on other songs here but still it does make this song a real highlight on the entire LP if there's a spot on this record that shows a strong naked city influence it's it's most likely this one and this track actually marks a pretty noticeable change on the entire LP if you're hip to the very abrasive subtleties of this record pretty much all the songs after this are a bit slower a bit more brooding longer overall not quite the under one minute or around one minute mark like a few of the songs before this point are there are Punk riffs on steroids and some insane saxophones in the background on the track Concord Prison and the song pay with youth has these really detailed fast animalistic drums playing against a very steady grimy bassline with some really noisy guitars this track is sort of like listening to converge collaborate with the Jesus lizard or something like that a combination that I think is even clearer when listening to this track on a demo that this band put out just a year ago I think this record finishes really strong overall - I mean it finishes just as colorful and as noisy and as exceptionally performed as it started and even though every single musical detail of what this band does is not clear right from the get-go the intensity of their playing and just the layers man the layers of the riffs the drums the bass the horns the really just uh just blood-curdling vocals on this thing it's all just so overwhelming but excitingly so even though these guys occasionally do really where their influence is on their sleeves I'm loving this record this is just such an intense ride I love the blend the Mel the different genres that come together on this thing and just how incredibly extreme it is it's just so admirably extreme I'm feeling a decent of strong 8 on this thing transition if you've given this incredibly loud record to listen and you didn't die in the middle of it what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh Lola forever 
TSgrGqOIXGw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Girl Talk Freeway EP broken ankles Pennsylvania is really teaming up on this EP with mashup master girl talk coming through and providing all of the instrumentals for Philly MC freeway now some people might call girl talk style a little gimmicky like you know just mashing up really popular songs with more obscure ones occasionally or just like really popular dance it's something that a lot of other DJ's do but personally the dude has never disappointed me even though what Girl Talk was doing on records like feed the animals a sort of old hat at this point I still think that it set a precedent for a lot of what's going on right now with sampling and re mixing and I think it's interesting that he's been musically silent for about the past four years and now more than ever it seems like genre boundaries have been blurred really far in terms of what people want to listen to now that music discovery on the Internet is in full swing with this new young generation everybody's listening to whatever the hell they want so I'm glad to see a guy like Girl Talk still active now as far as freeway goes I've never really been a huge fan of him outside of the Jake one album that he did the stimulus package which actually came out the same year as girl talks last record and even though I've never really been an incredible fan of this guy he sounds just like revitalized on this EP I think freeway and Girl Talk together have found new purpose the lyrics are grimy they're forceful they're clever on the back end of this thing they become a little bit more personal especially on the final track here now does this kind of lyricism sound really good over girl talks incredibly sweet and punchy beats that are dance music inspired hip hop music inspired yes we already know the answer to this question because we've already heard this kind of lyricism over girl talks mix mash instrumentals it's just that now this time around we're hearing original verses on top of these beats even though there's nothing on this EP that's incredibly new everything here there's already been a precedent set for this stuff by all day and feed the animals however it's still fantastic to hear girl talk working so closely with a single artist for an entire project and every song on this thing is so freakin good I'm dying to hear what the leftovers were it's exciting to hear this EP come together and come together so well because it's projects like this that I think can do a lot to build girl talks rep and freeways as well and sort of break him into a new audience in the same way that killer Mike was able to when he started collaborating with LP now the beats on this thing has to be expected have a lot going for them even though Girl Talk is typically pretty maximal when it comes to samples and and that sort of thing he I wouldn't say he keeps it to a minimum but he keeps it pretty modest in comparison with his solo stuff but still in a lot of these tracks he works out these surprise beat change ups that sound amazing especially on the song I can hear sweat with the really fantastic string melodies on the back end or the sampled soul vocals on the track tell me yeah which instrumentally sounds like a beat that would have done really well in the club in like the earlier mid-2000s this is an instrumental I could hear like jay-z or mace on around this time and the features on this thing work out pretty well - I mean Jadakiss on the track I can hear sweat his verse is pretty typical I'm not that huge on the ditty revolt line but still I mean he came through with a really grimy ass verse like you'd expect from a guy like him young Chris while his voice wasn't that distinct I mean his flow was there I'm sort of wondering if that was his voice right on the front end of the track introducing freeway because whoever that was it sounded like a 1996 jay-z or something like that it sounded like a very young jay-z giving that vocals a up freeway surprisingly enough my favorite feature on this entire EP came from Waka Flocka Flame the dude just demands attention from the moment here into the instrumental ain't no tellin how fall imma go kinda karate choppers so watch how you approach I love the way his verses like overdubbed almost from begin and just so much presence on the microphone while yeah I know he's not like the most deeply racist above planet he's becoming a better rapper he's becoming a better rapper and this incredible energy that Walker brings to the table I mean this is a high level of just passion and aggression that I also get from freeway on most of these tracks - I mean on this very same track not only this freeways first verse just take the song off so well it's a bombastic just bangin hook and I love the way that he ends his first verse with this like freakish II also the really weird intro track off of this thing where he's saying he's gonna make you put the eater to your head and freakin kill yourself dude it's just over the top you know maybe freeways metaphors and similes aren't the most novel on the planet and there are some moments where he gets a little gratuitous with some references like the suicide suicide Kara Swan references on one of the tracks here or but I still think he's sounding better than ever the song suicide I mean such a dark grimy in-your-face badass song but the instrumental to this thing with just the airy keyboard leaves and the very cavernous reverb female vocals singing in the background it's a beautiful mismatch between just tense tooth gnashed aggression and threats and just a really beautiful pretty production and the closing track on this thing we're freeway just gives it gives a little bit of his personal history such a beautiful cinematic moving track there is an amazing flow to the intro and five songs on this little tiny baby EP the flow on this project is better than that of some rap albums that have like three times the songs and not only that but all the songs on this thing of course in a pure girl-talk fashion just segue right into one another just one track pops right into the next just quickly on to the next one this EP does not take too much time to make its statement and in that very short amount of time it's it comes off really bold it's catchy it's something that as soon as it's over I just want to replay the entire thing the only downsides are yeah a lyric here and there doesn't really grip me I wish there was more to this thing but outside of that this is easily one of the better EPS I've heard this year and hopefully this is not the end of them collaborating with each other I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this thing transition if you've given broken ankles a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana Girl Talk freeway forever 
SUXxktwbIqQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for me to just sort of get into a list of what's going on April 19th record store day record stores all

the release list on Record Store Day I will link to it down there in the description box and pick out which records interest me the most of course I will not be buying all of these records because I

interest to me okay and the nominees are on amount of gucci Scott Pilgrim vs. the world they did the soundtrack for the freakin video game and this is going to be the first time that it's ever out on

right you have any Fantana right attitude 
3ZZaCn51o-c,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update where I talk about a load of records that have recently made it into my record collection this month a lot of stuff but things that I either have traded with other people or were in some way donated to me by a fan or something like that yeah I mean uh but but still very cool stuff I actually did a several record trades over the past month or so and you know gave away some of the records that that I had in here that weren't as of interest to me as some of the records that I got in exchange and these aren't even all the records that I ended up getting my trade for the getting you know back so you know there are still some records down here that I haven't that I will not be talking about in this video because I haven't gotten around to listening to them yet I just have like a big fat cube of music sitting on the floor but this is the stuff I have gotten around to I don't want to forget I say all right first I want to mention mister record guy Omaha I will you know that's that's his name on Instagram where I will refer you to go check him out because it's not like he's on I mean there's it's not like there's anywhere else to follow him on the internet he's just a really passionate record collector from the Omaha area and he actually is buddies with the guy who I follow on YouTube Derek and who you know also talks about vinyl quite a bit you know his YouTube videos you know he has a massive collection so of course you know these two huge record nerds have found one another so let's get into a few records that he sent my way he was he was he was generous enough to send this my way thank you very much I freaking love this new Freddie Gibbs Madlib record fantastic very you know like very you know those crinkly crinkly sleeves I love it Madlib on the back I love the zebra print continuation on this side of the record this is also a double LP it's black vinyl the vinyl is the pressing seems fantastic everything looks like it's in great shape you know just a single sleeve double LP white sleeve on both I love the orange sort of bluish greenish sort of aqua blue labeling on the record just you know decent nice looking package for this album again thank you for sending this my way along with this next record over here I want to make sure I get through all of his records that he sent my way first I have not opened this yet but I have already listened to numerous times because it is my favorite del the funky homosapien record I wish my brother George was here I don't know if he saw in a video that this is my favorite Dell album and that this is one of my favorite hip-hop albums from this era of hip-hop but he just fucking hit the nail on the head he was right on the money give me the still album thank you very free canary flattered and moved that you know you would send that my way along with what else you have sent me but this is the last record that I will talk about in this video I sent the new cage record along kill the architect an artist who I wasn't all too familiar with outside of you know his association with LP and Aesop Rock and I know Eminem dissed him on his first album you know making a joke about how he bought a caged tape and dubbed over it beautiful red vinyl I have heard from fans that this is not his best record although listening to it I didn't really mind it I didn't think it was bad I mean honestly I have no plans on reviewing it I know this came out last year and you know some people did ask me but I didn't get around really diving too deep into it but I will say right now that if you're looking for some very stark bleak and dark hip-hop dude obviously very obviously suffers from some emotional problems and conveys them in a very very III would say disturbed way I mean I wouldn't say that the the the there's much that there's nothing much about this record that is catchy it's it's definitely a slow burner and yeah you know I think some of the the quality of some of the similes were like a little cheap like you know III think the some some of the humor at times or some of the dark references were like a little a little too lowbrow for me here and there but it's it was not a bad record at all cage killed the architect all right moving on to some other stuff that had gotten traded to me I want to make sure I don't uh I was reaching for that piece of paper there we go I want to make sure I don't forget anyone's name this one comes from Matt Matt just sent me this record because he says he had an extra of it goddamn Godspeed you black Emperor my favorite god speed record my favorite God speed record uh possibly my favorite post-rock record ever lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven I have always owned this record not always always like yeah since I was born I owned this record on CTV and you know I'm the kind of person that tends to sort of stick with a certain sort of packaging with a band like yeah I own this record on CDs so therefore except for their latest one I pretty much own every God speed record on CD I don't know why I'm that way oh no crashing I don't know why in that way but now I had this on vinyl thanks to the generosity of Matt thank you very much for sending that my way like I said he said yeah he said he had an extra copy and didn't want it no more well let's see James okay James James I sent James a few records and he sent me a few records back he was dying to get this Danny Brown 7-inch that I had so you know he showed me some of the stuff that he had willing to trade and I said sure you know what send me this cure kiss me really nice 80s rock new wave pop rock goth rock record this is definitely I mean I would say pretty far into the point where they are past the very tortured bleak sounds and strip back sounds and noisier sounds of their earlier records this record is so much more accessible the the production is pretty decked out too with lots of horns on it and very strong melodies and it's it's still a very good album it's a double LP lay that creepy eyeball and you know two colored sleeves that come with this thing I'm still actually in the middle of listening to it so you know I'm not going to show you the records right here but still it's a very great album from the Cure and I think it displays you know how great Robert Smith was it not only writing incredibly dark music but writing you know sweet accessible melodic music as well but also lyrically sort of had a dark edge I mean the dude was the dude is you know a hero in that style alright I also got treated Sam da-da-da-da-da-da let the boys record nice 12 inch from onyx there who if you have even the slightest smidge of respect for women you'll be horribly offended by the b-side of his record just saying just saying but still classic 90s boom Bop sing boom ba boom bap single from onyx slam it bought this one from the band online because I mean I I again I always come back to this record I always come back to this record I find myself listening to this record numerous times I found myself listening to his numerous times throughout last year this routine is hell how bought it from the band went on VanCamp bought that shit and this I believe is the I think they did a few pressings of it and this pressing is is uh avenue it's Avenue hmm it's a nice it's a nice it's a blue and it's a great sound of pressing really nice condition the record itself not the records with the UM the sleeve itself got a little beat up in the mail but you know whatever that's that's not the band's fault that's all the it's all the Postal Service's faults but um I do like sort of what they got going on here with this decorative sleeve that comes with the record sort of all these pictures what the band looks like they were taking photographs on tour is very cleanly placed into this grid and I don't know if this is something that is unique to my record maybe they do with every record but they actually put a photo in the record itself and it's it's like uh I think one of the band members or somebody like you know doing a cannonball into a lake so you know there you go that's that's that's what that is photo coming in the records fantastic alright next the new Silver Mount Zion EP it's here it's here I love this band's latest full-length album fuck off get free my dog is barking I have no clue why but we're just gonna run with it so right here beautiful ex I believe a song on each side of this thing you got to run it 45 rpm and this EP is surprisingly electronic the band goes down an electronic direction on this thing and I'm not gonna say that every fan is going to take to it well but it is it is interesting it is interesting I'm gonna I'm not gonna say it's not interesting alright and let's keep going you know I bet Jeremy's here I bet that's why the dogs are barking alright let's keep going Jeremy edits the videos sometimes you know like on the weekends he's gonna add this one although we don't really edit but you know what I mean next Portishead dummy classic trip-hop records boom backbeats on this thing fantastic hip-hop influence beats on this record moody baselines and sense and beautiful wonderful lead vocals and songwriting great freakin record solid song per song if you want to listen to portishead listen to this record okay I mean you're not gonna be disappointed by this record this is a beautiful freakin record it does sound a little bit dated but only because of the production styles but it is a wonderful album ok Portishead dummy loving the pictures come on the inner sleeve there's really nice packaging I love it you know we're getting the liner notes in here and everything it's nice just nice alright another few records that I traded let's go Andrew Jackson jihad can't maintain love this album if you're looking for full Punk with strong satirical lyrics and a really just snide nasty like I hate the freaking world vocals look this thing up not quite as ambitious and grandiose as their record knife man that I reviewed recently and loved the hell out of but still a great LP and you know a throw up colored splatter swirl vinyl just puke just puke but not the music itself and really wonderful thank yous and everything on the back of the record really great album with bold as hell lyrics I mean these are bold bold freakin lyrics on this thing I mean they're delivered with a very whiny vocal and you know that's not going to be everybody's thing but incredibly bold lyrics another record that I trade for Black Sabbath's paranoid adding to my Black Sabbath vinyl collection I mean you have to people ask me all the time and I'll say it again Anthony how do I get into metals listen to Black Sabbath listen to their first album listen to paranoid listen to masters of reality you really can't go wrong with like their first five LPS just listen to any of them classics such as Iron Man on this thing as well as electric funeral war pigs as well I mean you use n paranoid you most likely have heard these songs before you know it's just a matter of getting them on record and listening to the deeper and appreciating them you know people talk I'm not in the metal but you know it's yeah you can't like a Black Sabbath song you can't like not even not even just like a little come on alright and I will end off with a few seven inches that came by way of classic drug references records which you know they could be sent this a interesting little booklet along with it and this is an interesting collection of seven inches of weird collaborations or instrumentals from various producers and emcees on this thing are on this thing as well you know if any of this interests you do look into it I mean I'm one seven-inch we have blue and knowledge on one track on the other side we have mike chaff on another song we have Danny Brown and mine design with Sweeney song working on this seven-inch over here on the other side and this Danny Brown verse on here was really funny I was sort of wondering how old it was but then some people answered me on Twitter answered me on instagram told me we have a quantize with I believe is this Thea no that's not the song that I'm thinking of but we do have us quantize oh yes it is quality Chris and diabase they buy all device sorry sorry I'm fucking up names and then we young shit with a Roz G and zero so you know Roz G Danny Brown blue and you know quality Chris all in this 7-inch series three seven inches all together it's pretty cool collection of tracks there were some size of these seven inches that I wasn't too hot on but you know it is it is sort of a cool to have one off rarity sort of stuff like this and and that is this month's vinyl collection I'm going to be doing a video about possible Record Store Day pick up soon because that is coming up on the 19th of this month and

-yAzXtjPqR8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's most obnoxious music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cunning linguists album strange journey vol 3 releases in some linguists strange journey series have never been quite as pivotal as the main studio albums in their discography like a piece of strange or southern underground or 2011's incredibly conceptual or neurology however I will say that this new record of theirs really stands out from those albums in that natty Deacon and no really seem to have gone all out when it comes to bringing on features nearly every song on this album is jam-packed with guest rappers more than any other cunning linguist project like tone-deaf and zombie and del the funky homosapien itself titled an apathy blue psalm one grieves murrs Aesop Rock sadistic Jay live and masta ace and there are even more people on here that I could be listing and it's an array of different rappers people who are blasts from cunning linguist past people that they haven't worked with before up-and-comers seasoned underground vets and i don't think this endless gauntlet of features on this record actually waters the record down in the same way that it might on any other hip-hop album because kind of linguists do a really great job of weaving these guests into the theme or the concept of whatever the song is that they're gonna be rapping on instead of having an album where everybody coming out of the record is allowed to rap whatever they feel like rapping about we are given a really clear set of song concepts like with drunk-dial featuring Murs and grieves which just from the title of the song i'm sure you can figure out what it's about there's all these sad really love on the rocks verses from blue and Psalm one on the song of the morning someone actually has one of the best verses on the entire record with this track the song South California is about falling in love with a girl for whatever reason she's sort of in and out of your life for a certain period of time traveling there's also the song hot with brothers and arms self titled an apathy who I mean with this track must have come is like a package deal and together they drop some of the most braggadocious violent hilarious rhymes that I've heard in a verse this year and then the song the format goes incredibly meadow with masta ace and SOS literally rapping about hip hop's history with physical mediums whether that be with vinyl where you are sampling from the vinyl you're performing on turntables with the vinyl hip hop being printed on vinyl or cassettes making sort of bootleg tapes mixtapes for other people to sort of spread great songs singles demos lyrically and thematically cunning linguist don't really let me down on a single track here once again they live up to the reputation of just being really great rap artists who care about the content of their verses and they care about earning listeners who who want to read deeply into the things that they're saying and get some lyrical food for thought or just some kind of emotionally potent message on every track here natty and Deacon bring really solid flows but they focus more on their expressions than they do the the more technical side of what they're doing which is absolutely fine now even though this is sort of a loose collection of very good tracks kind of linguists try to distract them that little bit with these sketches that plop in and out throughout the album where we have like this robot computer voice talking who seems to be like running a spaceship and the the theme of this album is traveling to earth to find empathetic and intelligent life spoiler at the end we do not find it and the computers name is Miley 3000 in the middle of the album she ends up wanting to a party and Papa moly I don't know not the best sketches it just kind of seems like a really failed attempt to tie these songs together and make them feel like more of a package deal than they really do I guess kind of linguists other attempt at humor on this LP doesn't really stick with me either with a drunk-dial which is is probably one of the worst songs ever these guys put out in a while features this song sample from the band fickle pickle California calling it's an old little piece of piano pop from the 70s that sounds like Paul McCartney ripoff it's almost a novelty song with all these really weird like phone conversation pieces in the middle of the track it's like Marvin's room before there was Marvin's room but anyway just the sound of this sample with the dinky pianos as well as the very heavy horns playing over this beat to this beat basically transmits before the verses even start that there gonna be some wack bars on this thing especially with the singing song a rock villian chorus anyway natty is opening verse on this thing is absolutely hilarious I love the the word is bond I need bond to get out of jail sort of wordplay that's going on at the start of this thing but once Greaves verse kicks in and he starts rapping about sending dick pics while drunk and that he is kind of horny and these dick pics actually end up accidentally in Mirza's phone it just goes so overboard that I'm just like I'm just done I get that these guys weren't being that serious or anything like that but but it's not a song that I feel like subjecting myself to every time I listen to through the state but no other tracks on this LP really struck me as as being outright bad what sort of ended up not impressing me as much as their previous release is just the record itself in whole strange journey is is lacking in a little variety for me a little sonic variety there are way too many songs and and instrumentals on this thing that are sparklers and and I wish like the song hot or like the song Kings that I got a few more bangers it just feels like to me anyway that they're just too many tracks on here that are that are trying to be the most meaningful thing that I've heard today and you know don't get me wrong I love hip hop and I wish there was more hip hop that was a just a bit more deeply in touch with its emotional side but I just wish there were a few more exciting moments on this LP to balance out these incredibly mellow tracks yeah I know that kind of linguists and and and know are not known for having the most grimy production style actually I think as the group has progressed with each new record their production gets a little more Milotic lush still i guess i was just looking for a few more hard-hitting moments all that aside this is easily the most ambitious release that cunning linguist have put together so far in the strange journey series and i think it's a great project to hold things over until they come through with an album that's a little more conceptual and focuses a bit more on the individual talents of deacon natty and no I think this record is gonna end up being a little bit of a minor hit in cunning linguist discography but still the quality is so high that it could win over a newcomer most definitely I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana kind of linguists forever

xTnE5MpqHvI,hi everyone Blanc the knee blonde tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the latest LP its album time from todd Tertre a satyr a tarjay Turchi Tanjung Tarja turtle no it's definitely not turtle that's on your head no way yes way Todd here is a Norwegian DJ producer that's been pretty active for over a decade now performing and working with other artists to write produce and collaborate among some of these people being Robbie Williams Franz Ferdinand Lindstrom and this is a long time to be active and not have a major commercial full-length release out although todd has kept a somewhat steady stream of singles and EPS one of which came out last year and did receive a pretty warm reception but I think Todd is still acknowledging that it's been a long time just with the album title of this thing itself it's album time he's taken time to sit down and concentrate on his own stuff and in the process he produces an hour of it songs honest at ranging from jazz to synth funk new disco electro disco house it's a strong muscular dance music record that has a bit of a vintage Flair that I think you might find similar to the new Daft Punk LP random access memories but I don't know how you can look at this record and not expect at least some kind of a nod to the past just look at the cover of this thing just looking at this cover I feel like I'm in for a really cheesy lounge jazz album where somewhere in the tracklist there is a cover of luck be a lady however instrumental jazz with a lot of zazz is is on this record but we will kind of get into that later again like the new Daft Punk album a lot of what seems to be going on with this LP is reclamation reclamation of these styles of music that US has a younger generation have kind of looked back upon and decided our old and corny or maybe this whole revivalism thing for Todd is is is a bit more personal Todd could just simply be dabbling in these older music styles because they have a really strong scent to value to him I mean the song Johnny and Mary does feature Roxy music's Bryan Ferry and even though the tracks swing star parts 1 & 2 don't feature a biographical narrative from Giorgio I would say these songs are just about as indebted to him with their exotic sunny Ocean Spray electro disco grooves either that or like tangerine dream with all the bouncing since sequences layered over one another these new disco electro disco sounds have been seen quite a comeback lately but this genre has had a chair of singles and notable releases in the 2000s with artists like Sally Shapiro or Lindstrom or even chromeo kind of dabbling in this stuff on their earlier stuff I would say even Kylie Minogue and Madonna have put out records that dabbled in this stuff too but Ram really opened up the door for this kind of music to be taken more seriously from a critical perspective from a conceptual perspective and I would say that Todd has taken full advantage of every doorway Ram has opened he not only recreates these genres that he is emulating with an extreme attention to detail but he also approaches some of them with some really great compositional ambition too and while he does this for the most part he kind of sticks to what he knows producing fine tuning dance grooves like the DJ that he is not so much forming them into concise chart-topping pop tunes though this is a role that he doesn't really try to shove himself into until the Bryan Ferry track pops up on this thing well no I I wouldn't say he was trying to write like a get lucky on that track or anything like that but the song is of a different mood of a different style than any other track on here merely because it does kind of have a verse chorus verse thing going on it does feature vocals however despite this kind of exciting collaboration idea and a change of pace on this record this is an incredible snoozer of a song in the middle of this tracklist lyrically melodically and structurally this track is uninteresting from start to finish even Bryan ferries whisper-quiet vocals bring very little in the way of motion or captivating anything and you know what I used to think the best thing about living in 2014 is that I don't have to listen to songs anymore on the radio about people named Johnny or Mary or some other kind of musical Jane Doe that I'm instantly supposed to relate to merely because their name is so common but nope I was wrong and as long as I'm complaining I might as well talk about the intro to this LP not the introductory track which is actually stellar no but the song that comes right after at leisure super even which which seems like an intentionally cheesy piece of synth jazz that just merely imitates the elevator music model how is this song not just elevator music please explain yeah for sure in the second half it does all of a sudden evolved into a very tense synth Odyssey but even that isn't really enough to pick up the song and save it from what is just a really boring first half of all the things to emulate whoa why this I mean songs like this are the reason that people started to tune out of this kind of music and while a lot of other songs on this LP have really good groove some of them are tagged on to really mild jams where there isn't much in the way of a melody or a bassline that's all that sticky like delorean dynamite or swing star part 2 or even the closer on here inspector Norris which is a pretty quirky track it has a fun very playful groove really kind of calls back to novelty electronic music tracks like the popcorn song in a way with just how cutesy and herky and jerky the groove and the overall vibe of the music is but this track should have come much earlier in the tracklisting of this LP especially since the predecessor of the song oh joy would have made for a really climactic finish it feels like Todd wrote a really amazing ending for this record and then put a really kind of silly tongue-in-cheek epilogue right at the finish I know I'm mentioning a lot of things on this LP that I don't really care for but I do dig a majority of the tracks off this record that feature top-notch grooves with stellar bass lines and some great synth playing over whether it be some piano chords or a melody or even a soul like preman goes to al capone co or even the song strand bar which starts off like a really exotic piece of funk music but once the drums and the bass line hits it instantly becomes a really killer piece of house music with an extreme attention to detail with the instrumentation really taking care to make sure that everything sounds like it's live instrumentation or it's happening in the moment this is an amazingly well assembled track and I really get sucked into the momentum of the song and then maybe the two biggest surprises on this entire record Sims and Alfonso go Muslim to really speedy nimble fantastic pieces of Latin flavor jazz fusion if there is anything that Todd dabbles in on this record that I wish would make a comeback it's stuff like this these two songs stand out as being some of the most fun I've had on the entire record sticky melody is fast pace well-executed grooves and the drumming on the Alfonso track is amazing if you only listen to two songs from this entire record make it these and then there is the previously mentioned song oh joy which again would have made an amazing finisher for this record it's the most triumphant song on the entire LP it's constantly escalating in the first half and then once the drums kick in the track really just Rockets off with walls of synthesizer strings and some really well layered percussion you know I hate to make another comparison to random access memories but it really is like the contact of the record overall it's album time is not a bad LP it occasionally drowns in its influences it delivers a lot of tracks that pale in comparison to others and the record really drags on longer than it needs to because it just does not deliver I think 60 minutes worth of ideas but if you're really going to be into this particular nostalgia trip I could see this being one of your favorite records of the year I could see you're really getting into this LP I think this LP is worth checking out but me personally I'm feeling a decent two strong six transition if you give in this record to listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Todd forever 
97v_pftI5yM,yeah yeah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new scissor record Z kal what what do you what do you think of scissor I WA she gobbles and she look pretty as hell everything is the same nothing at all is different right nothing is completely different everything is as it should be that's right also before we go into this review I want to say that the views expressed in this review are are my own and not count Church Estes scissor recent TDE signee as well as a singer-songwriter you might have heard her make a few vocal appearances lately on her own stuff like the EPS that she's dropped one that came out last year as well as some appearances on the latest Isaiah Rashad project or on schoolboy Q's latest LP but personally I wasn't really excited for whatever she was going to come out with this year until I heard one of the lead tracks from it babylon before a kendrick lamar feature was thrown on top of it which is actually pretty unfortunate I feel weird saying this but the song was perfectly fine without Kendrick Lamar and with how he dominates the track on this new version and it's almost like the track is a Kendrick Lamar song that says is merely just featured on but the original version of this track was wonderful atmospheric it was sensual it was a really pretty piece of reverb dand cavernous R&B and neo soul it was a track that seemed like it was as indebted to Badu as it was to Bjork scissors vocals felt dramatic they felt weary on this track I loved some of the lyrics on this thing to like bring the thorny crown crucify me I also love the way the lumbering beat on this track moved felt trap influenced but yet some of the heavy grooves felt like they could have come out of a dubstep track or something but at least that influence felt very very very subtle didn't overtake the track or anything like that it was just a great song the last thing it needed was a wrap verse even from a good rapper so with my favorite track on this LP before I even listen to this LP being completely gutted and mortally wounded I was kind of worried as to how I would manage to enjoy the rest of this record I was wondering how the rest of this LP would fare and not well I don't think in my opinion siz it was totally bold on the song Babylon and and I think it's the opposite on the rest of this thing the opener you are maybe the the sleepiest start to a record I've heard this year a song is way too hypnotized by its own slow pace an atmosphere to come together with a memorable tune this song to me isn't really much more than than a vibe or a feeling or the the semblance of a song but I don't even really think it does a good job of holding its serene feelings since the really heavy rough jutting baseline bouncing all over this track makes sure that that doesn't happen then there's the song child's play which uses a really stale old xx YY xxp which is good for him but a lot of people have already heard this beat up until this point Milo rapped on it a few years ago and Sousa doesn't even really make sure that this instrumental gets altered before it hops onto this record just to give it kind of a new Flair or even structure it to the point where the song goes over well I mean cezzah is singing in the middle of this track and then all of a sudden chants the rapper's verse just starts without so much as an interlude or a break or an introduction he just simply starts rapping over her as if she hadn't been singing the entire time it's like he just steps on her verse the only guest vocalist on this entire LP that actually complements what's going on in the song is Isaiah Rashad and even though the track he appears on is off to kind of a shaky start once it settles in to the moment where he is featured it really smoothes out into a very pretty breathy voice duet I love the chilly synthesizers on this track I love the Forrest Gump reference that runs through as they are singing together and the beat on this thing and the bassline on this thing it feels like I'm listening to Portishead track or something but with a much stronger aren't be influenced and I think this track this song this emulation goes over really well however there are other spots on here that sounds similar to other things but aren't quite as interesting there's the song Giulio which is an 80s tinged piece of synthesizer pop where scissors vocals and the melody of the track are incredibly nondescript the nostalgic tone of the instrumentation is really the most memorable thing about it and then there's the song sweet November where I don't really mind the vocals but the instrumental on this thing is is is so shoddy and so badly pulled together it's it's nearly unlistenable at least to me it's just a really bad piece of recreated soul nostalgia where the guitars are just irritatingly loose and amateurish I mean listening to the guitars on this track actually reminded me of an old MF DOOM line don't touch the mic like there's aids on it like don't be afraid to handle the mic wrap on the mic to me the guitar playing on this track is essentially playing the guitar like there's aids on it there are a few tracks on this thing that really stand out to me is being likable though like the song hijack which to me has a lot of the characteristics that the original version of Babylon used to the emotive vocals the atmospheric production it feels like an R&B slow jam but it's so much more futuristic there's a lovely chorus I love the way since pop in toward the end of the track and really change up the mood and the vibe of the song it's not the most original track I've heard in this more modern shade of R&B music but it does reach a level of quality that I wish the low points of this record did but outside of that I just feel either underwhelmed or just incredibly displeased by nearly every other song on this thing I mean the song shattered ring what is going on with the instrumental on this track with the twangy guitar and the heavy beat it feels like it would have been a better fit for like a lot of delray song and with all the massive walls of synths in this track I feel like scissors very breathy vocals don't go over too well and she is just merely buried under all of it sometimes I feel like there's more focus on the bells and the whistles and the perceived epicness of the instrumental then there is on just coming out with a good song which I thought is what I was going to get given how great the track Babylon was originally but I just don't know I just stare at this album and I just think what happened with the guests and the TDE affiliation and the good songs that I heard previously the fact that I know that she can sing and on top of all of that the quality of production this project could have had I really feel like Z should have been a layup but instead it was just like a massive brick outside of a few songs a vast majority of this project is just uninteresting from the tracks where scissors vocal performances really lack conviction and emotion to a lot of the moments where the songs are just underwhelming and just not that distinct to the other moments where the instrumentals are incredibly lacking in terms of good sounds or just fresh ideas I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana scissor forever 
u8_m_s9NhLk,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Rat King album rat so it goes this is the full-length debut record from new york-based hip-hop outfit Rat King wrecking I have been on to their exploits ever since a few years ago when they dropped their wiki 93 EP through XL Recordings I also remember being recommended them by some viewers of the show who had seen them or heard of them through like some live dates with deaf grips and I I didn't love the EP I thought it was kind of hit or miss a lot of young man aggression on this EP a real emphasis on noise and raw delivery over lyrical intelligibility much in the same way Death Grips does but personally I was hearing potential for Rat King elsewhere and I think they found that sound that I was hoping they would discover on recent singles like 100 and this latest LP - this is a record that embraces the grimy hard-as-nails tradition of new york hip hop and combines it with really psychedelic experimental sound play in the instrumentals it's the kind of room that I've heard through rat King's contemporaries like Flatbush zombies or blues no York or all the cloud rappers out there maybe even Shabazz Palaces but in comparison I will say that Rat King does not get nearly as hazy or lethargic or atmospheric even at their trippy 'us the sounds the beats the deliveries the lyrics all of it is pretty solid and tangible the sounds on these beats are colorful they're surreal they're incredibly layered that they are enjoyably hectic take the intro to the track snow beach which kind of sounds like the result of forcing panda bear to sit down and make a trap B when you consider how difficult it is to pull apart the individual pieces of sound in rat Kings music it really isn't surprising to hear these guys collaborated late last year with black dices Eric copeland on a one-off track there's also tracks on this record like protein where Wicky and hack are rapping over this really jittery footwork be instrumentally these guys are by a lot more than just the American side of hip-hop there's quite a bit of influence pouring in from the recent strands of electronic music coming out of London right now as well as grime music which I actually think catches hacks here the most when it comes to his flow and delivery there's also lead singles off of this thing like Canal which I believe to be incredibly original with wiki's constantly shifting flow is really expressive inflections the booming sub bass backing this really hectic wall of samples also the very thin twittering high hats and snares I just love the sonic palette of this song not only that but wiki and hack bring an incredible amount of energy to their performances Rat King really has progressed past the boom-bap sounds and the really aggressive ultra distorted sounds of their earlier releases and have settled into something that is simultaneously smooth yet grimy it's really sharp and it's nutty it's cluttered and yet all of this chaos seems so well organized and above all it's it's really kind of difficult to make heads or tails of at first listen with this record I feel like I've reached down into a storm drain and pulled out some kind of ugly mutant rat dog hybrid that's dripping with sewage and most likely has some kind of rabies it's animalistic but progressive and composed to the intro to this record and the first song here is a vocal cut it's a narrative of someone talking about discussing music with a friend and his buddy is saying that all new music is crap meanwhile this guy's arguing that all the MCS that are new and out there today I've lived completely different lives than the greats like Biggie and Pok so there really is no comparison and while yeah this is not really an argument I buy into personally however this is the kind of argument that someone who makes terrible music will put forward in order to distract them the fact that their music is terrible however Rat King really does come through with the sound that is so off the traditionalist map that it is really hard to compare at least to Tupac and Biggie anyway as I've mentioned before with Rat King there are elements of Wicky floo that reminds me of an incredibly young Talib Kweli or Zack de la Rocha so I do feel that his style is at least rooted in some kind of tradition or sound or at least some obvious MCS from the past who have made great records and if these guys are influences wiki pulls directly from their really aggressive visceral and revolutionary characteristics and I think magnifies them especially on the completely unexpected shouts of day it's almost like they're doing this instead of a hook which is something that Rat King couldn't give a shit about half the time however this doesn't necessarily mean that Rat King doesn't value a memorable chorus or lyrics or a story in a track like for one the opener of this LP is kind of telling the tale of the inception of this record Rat King kind of at this post-graduation point in their lives and should they pursue college or music they advanced then got in advance they bought a couple of amps and now they're enhanced one of my favorite sets of bars from this LP these guys come out strong right out of the gate with some really great flows and a fantastic energy there's also the song remove you which is kind of an anti cop anthem about being harassed by the police for really just kind of fitting the profile of someone who the police feel like they should harass there's also bars that stick out to me on tracks like eat because they may tell a personal story like how Wicky is rapping about how his life might have gone down a different path had he not been exposed to a certain song or a certain image when he was in bust digits there's the song snow Beach which right after a really psychedelic intro one of the basest heaviest beats on this entire LP drops and man I love the jazzy saxophone playing throughout this thing too and lyrically Wiki kind of goes into the grimy underbelly of New York connecting emotionally more with places that have drug dealers than tourist attractions or NYU and tracks like Canal on here are sort of an exercise and flow and the intimidation especially with Wicky throwing out all these internal rhymes and a beat that is essentially a sauna jungle I listen to this thing and I hear weird wailing since or at least what I think are since horns what I think are our Birds you know sometimes I really can't tell with this record these guys are like almost bomb squad level when it comes to mashing sounds together into just a really cacophonous mesh but racking does manage to deliver some really easygoing moments through all of this density there's the song so six stories which is one of the more nocturnal tracks on the cell P and features a very wordy deep voiced hook from kink rule and even though it is one of the more weak links in the chain on this LP there is the song Puerto Rican judo which is a bit of a surprise love song featuring some bars from wavy Spice her and wiki trade lions sort of about this initial attraction that they have going on but the really redundant be in the culo line on on this thing really kind of wrecks the vibe of the track just a little bit there also is really tiring drawn-out singing vocal on the back end of the song eat that just goes on a little too long but most of the time this LP is dishing out really grimy catchy energetic captivating progressive futuristic New York hip hop ear candy this is especially true of the title track where I love the wordplay on the chorus six million ways to die six million trains to ride song protein as well and bug fights which has one of the heavier grooves on this entire LP n hack that was absolutely insane with just this over-the-top energy level when he's delivering his lyrics on this track then there's the closer take which has a pretty shaky first half but then the song goes completely silent and then there is a second half with some bars from Salomon Fey and he's actually pretty awesome I wish he came on earlier in the record I'm not saying he stole the show but his verses on this thing are really some of the better bars in this entire LP not really sure as to why it just seems to be in the I don't know a secret track is the same track I really can't figure out either way it's still a really enjoyable moment Rat King is sounding way more compose used original intelligible on this record and and I think interesting too there is an element of looseness of intentional chaos to their songs that does add a bit of excitement to these tracks I think this record is really noisy colorful repeatable and really perplexing hip hop record and and I think will definitely be one of my favorites of this year I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh Rat King forever 
Fex6mMwSN3c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Sisyphus record self-titled this is the self-titled debut album from what I assume will be kind of a one-off collaborative project from three musicians who you may be familiar with one being Sufjan Stevens to Serengeti and three Sun looks all of whom have collaborated before under the name s / s / s and if you're familiar with the respective output of each of these artists you know that each of them brings a different artistic expertise to the table we have singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist composer Sufjan Stevens who is known for some of the most infamous pop records of the art indie folk and chamber variety Sun Lux is no stranger to art pop as well but he is primarily an electronic music producer and I know su fan has dabbled in this as well on records like enjoy your rabbit and age of odds but admittedly these are not my favorite albums in his discography and then we have singer and rapper Serengeti a guy who occasionally releases music under a hilarious alter-ego by the name of Kenny Dennis and while his lyrical style does run pretty eccentric sometimes I've never really been a huge fan of his output so for whatever reason the stars have aligned and put these three on a collaborative trajectory that not only had very little of a chance of appealing to me but I think also had a massive chance of going horribly wrong however I was pleasantly surprised to hear that a lot of the time this record goes horribly right this album is spontaneous its enjoyably absurd a few of the tracks on here are kind of muddled and maybe one should expect that given how wide of a musical spectrum these three guys are covering together and of course this record as a whole isn't too cohesive but the highlights the good parts of this album alone make this project worth listening to for one the song calm it down that opens this LP up it has a really bear hip hop beat booming bass on this thing and Serengeti rapping over this rhythm urging listeners to calm it down when they feel like up or burning stuff or hurting themselves or someone else I love the somber keyboards on the cores of this track and the explosive halfway point of this song and the really beautiful vocal bridge that Sufjan Stevens rings to the table it's a very wonderful change of pace for this song and a really fantastic way of finding common ground between these two very different styles of music or at least what we perceive to be different styles of music it songs on here where I see very clear contributions from each of these three musicians and and when I say clear contributions I mean pieces of music that very clearly play to the strengths of each individual person it's these tracks that I think go over the best on this LP like rhythm of devotion which has this fantastic lovely robot voiced chorus that sound a little DAC Punk esque I love the absurd and energetic bars from Serengeti and the huge vocal harmonies on the finish of this track are wonderful I love the linear structure of this song it just progresses through one idea after another the song lion's share is stellar - which oddly enough is a little rap tune that's very funky very danceable and is about to bank robbers I love the soft voice chorus from soufiane and the sort of ridiculous refrain the Serengeti brings to the table about dance dance at the booty in your pants booty money money money money for as ridiculous as this song is sometimes it's a really thoughtful and well assembled track it's a great hip-hop and pop blend it's a song that while lyrically and flow wise kind of reminds me of an old-school hip-hop song sonically it just feels so progressive and and futuristic then there's the song alcohol that closes this LP out it's a weird off-kilter kind of dark track with these twisted industrially tinged keyboards and beats that build toward a really epic finish it seems like the more abstract and reckless Sisyphus gets the less it cares about genre boundaries the better the record gets even though I do think a lot of the on this LP are good fun there are more serious and somber tracks on this release that go over pretty well as well like the song take me which is a synthetically colored and very atmospheric ballad from soufiane it drags on a little longer than it needs to but it's still very pretty and I think adds a very essential piece of counterpoint to the more upbeat and sort of tongue-in-cheek tracks on this thing because the self-titled debut is a 50-minute long album and then there's the song flying ace which is just as lyrically abstract as many other tracks on here but the song is uplifted with these beautiful orchestrations orchestrations that give the music and in serengeti x' lyrics kind of a somber tone I just wish it didn't end so abruptly but its tracks like this that really highlight the quality of Serengeti poetry and then there's the song dishes in the sink which lyrically Serengeti goes into a lot of imagery dealing with kind of a broken home a divorce separation both parents but especially the father kind of neglecting their child it has one of the weirder endings on this LP with the rap lyrics slowly just kind of fading out into nothingness but it's still very powerful emotionally powerful highlight on the album overall I really liked this thing this was really creative fun and in risky album for some luck Serengeti and and soufiane I don't love it but I'm incredibly glad it exists I'm glad it exists too to show how all of the genres that get melded together on this record could potentially work and push one another into new expressions and appeal and in context and power I am feeling a light two decent seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Sisyphus forever 
dXDCTqOPNqs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Cloud Nothings record something something something else hahaha here are nowhere else this is the latest full-length LP from Cleveland singer-songwriter Dylan Baldy who I believe might be transitioning to another location at this point could totally be wrong could totally be wrong either way Dylan Baldy and his band Cloud Nothings latest full-length LP and album that is following up their breakout album attack on memory and healthy that was an incredible change of pace for the band transitioning them from lo-fi hazy pop rock to post hardcore old-school indie rock kinda noisy with just a smidge of pop punk mixed in this LP was also a huge improvement in the recording quality of Cloud Nothings music as well as they worked with legendary producer Steve Albini now this new record of theirs while I was excited for it given how much I did enjoy their last full-length LP it does come with some changes for one the loss of guitarist Joe Boyer from the lineup of the band and now instead of working with Steve Albini the band has produced this latest LP with producer John Congleton who actually has a pretty impressive rap sheet as well with yen's Lachman swans Modest Mouse explosions in the sky Baroness mountain goats and many more I was simultaneously excited and afraid to see how these changes would play out into a new Cloud Nothings record but for the most part I was looking forward to seeing how they would progress past this breakout LP of theirs on which they wore their influences pretty clearly on their sleeves now of course I'm not doing this review on my own I have invited the one and only Sammi Jerusha of the rocket out blog and consequence of sound to talk with me about this new Cloud Nothings record transition alright like I said through the magic of the Internet here we are with Sami Jerusha of the rocket out blog and consequence of sound Sami doing this new I'm just what you think oh my god what are your feelings on this new clouds nothing record new Cloud Nothings record um well I'll say this my history with Cloud Nothings is a sorted one no not at all um nobody actually got into them from the last album attack on memory and uh yeah and like most people yeah pretty much and um we've here and nowhere else I'm not gonna say that they topped attack on memory I don't think they did that with this record I will say that they hit pretty much the same level as attack on memory with here in no worlds what I admire about this record is that it's not a long record it's only 31 minutes and 24 seconds and it just it it it's good it's it's it's really good the thing that worries me most about this record as far as um you know year-end accolades when people start compiling their top 10 top whatever year-end lists like you and I will do is is that the album came out too early in the year so by the time the end of the Year card I don't know if that's a little time out I don't know if that's really going to affect it because attack on memory came out even earlier than this record and that didn't really seem to affect the popularity of the album later into the year that it was released true there wasn't as much it was competing with at that time but now I mean it came out that this album came out around a time when everyone's still talking about albums from like the war on drugs and earlier albums that have come out this year that have captured the imagination like stuff from against me so while this record is good and while this record deserves to be lauded at the end of the year I'm just I'm a little worried that it's just going to get lost in the mix is all with other records I think that there is a chance for this record to potentially be lost in the haze of albums that came out earlier in 2014 um for sure but I think that it has more to do with it just not being that great of a record versus what other records it has to compete with I mean you may feel personally that Cloud Nothings came just short of topping their last full-length LP but I think they came up incredibly short you know um for a handful of reasons I mean one with Joe not being there on this record to provide some counterpoint to the rhythm guitars there's just not as much flash or melody or color coming from the guitars and it's III think it's a loss in accessibility it's a loss in enjoyability in these tracks and not only that but I think John Congleton working on the production on this record just not as impressive as Steve Albini I think this record is just a needlessly cacophonous steve albini x' drums his bass on attack on memory was pummeling it was heavy but is that really a fair comparison though putting John Congleton up against Steve Albini cuz I mean we know I mean it's not a fair comparison but it's still a comparison that you have to make because we have one producer and then another producer working with the sames and your most humblest of opinions do you feel that for this record that cloud know they should have just gone back to Albini I you know I think if I I think they should have yes okay we've gone back to albini you know to be completely honest light and and and you know not to like dis John's abilities because the thing is he's worked with plenty of artists who I think are fantastic and has turned out great records with them and I don't think that what happened on this record can necessarily 100% be attributed to him I mean you know it maybe if there were more melodies coming from lead guitars on this LP would be a lot more enjoyable but I think Mick's wise and just sonically and maybe this is something that Dylan wanted to go for this record to me just sounds a little more hectic and and needlessly so because I think the hooks translate a lot less I think as a result of the chaos in the mix I will agree that the the hooks really just aren't memorable like with a tack on memory I feel like there are a few songs that you can listen to and maybe just after a couple spins you'll be able to like have that hook have that melody have those words just embedded in your brain and you could just sing them with no problem this one I mean I listened to the album about three or four times and like I'm now I'm just trying to come up with like at least one chorus or one hook to like be able to say hello to I can't think of one and you know not only that but I think that the more ambitious moments off of attack on memory were fantastic as well like you know these more long drawn-out post-hardcore tracks that that had these riffs that moved really slow and the instrumentation of the track grew with intensity as it moved along um the the slow burner that we have off this record pattern walks uh just not as impressive as the longer moments off of attack on memory well I mean I understand the old adage is if it ain't broke don't fix it but I don't think that really works in music for most bands so maybe in this in this instance he wanted to go for a longer song on pattern walks but then why replicate what you've done before because in that case the criticism might have been oh he's just you know doing what he's done before there's not there's no real there's no real sense of risk or adventure being taken with this track so maybe he wanted to just like flip it around and try something different I don't even think what Cloud Nothings is doing on this record is significantly different than what's happening on their past record you know to be completely honest I think a lot of the formulas are essentially the same but with less impressive production and guitars I mean here's what I'll say about clone I think with this record at least I know and I look back on these I listen to these records and I always try to envision in my head for some reasons like what would this sound like if I'm seeing these guys live and if I don't manage it didn't reach out like grab me as much think about I haven't seen these guys play live this year and I might be a hundred percent wrong but basing it off of what I've heard on the record it's not it yet it doesn't like really great and that says the music is terrible but doesn't grab me as much as attack on memory I don't know why with the mixing on this LP and just the really weird hectic sound it's almost as if the sound of this record is trapped in a glass box or something and it's just kind of echoing off of itself in a really unpleasant way as opposed to just translating through the speakers really nicely and connecting directly you know with me the listener and creating a visceral response this album to me in in summation just kind of sounds like I'm listening to a bootleg of a like a decent live show yeah I mean like yeah I mean that's I think yeah I'd have to agree on that it's not that it's a terrible record I mean it gives it sounds like they're putting a lot of work into it it sounds like they're like you said they're playing the hell out of their instruments and stuff but like you said that energy just seems to be trapped within wherever it was they were recording and doesn't really seem to just jump off the record to the listener to me personally and I have friends that absolutely love the salvadore this album they're like cloud know things is the most important band right now and okay I mean I guess maybe I don't know I mean you could look at other punk bands right now that are doing stuff like diary of planets so so blows Fidler when they released their last record last year those to me jumped off the page a lot quicker because it just had that element ultimately if you're going to make a punk record I mean if you want to be serious about it if you don't want to be serious about it at the end of the day it's got to have just that little element of fun to it you got to walk away from that record and you've got to save yourself that was just I'm it was fun to listen to yeah you know it's it's that element of catharsis yes in punk music you know and and that and unfortunately this LP while when I do try to listen hard past the hectic sound of the guitars and the drums you know I get some of that melody I get some of the hooks I get in my head what this record would have sounded like had it been recorded better and again you know that energy is there but you know again instead of just enjoying it I feel like I'm spending most of my time just trying to imagine in my head what it would sound like if I were to actually enjoy it you know overall I'm just feeling like a strong five to a light six on this LP I don't know if you're feeling any stronger on it I mean uh here's what I'll say I'll give it maybe is like a six to maybe a light seven just because I mean I don't have apparently as much hatred towards John as you do so I mean uh hey terrific ouch you're using the I'll give it a 6 so maybe a light 7 just because I mean I appreciate the work that to this record I appreciate the enthusiasm behind the record on their part I just wish that it had just that more of like kick in the ass kind of feel so like when I listen to it I could get just I don't have to be as I don't want to feel all the energy that they felt I just wanted a little sample just one little taste of it is all okay I'll throw some links down there in the description box and probably somewhere here in this video somewhere where you can find Sammy stuff subscribe to him watch his stuff and we're gonna leave it at that Anthony Fantan Oh Sammy Jerusha Cloud Nothings here and nowhere else forever 
dpO20mTsOpQ,the new wagon hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new a V tear slasher flicks record enter the slasher house this is the latest full-length LP from this newly formed band fronted by multi-instrumentalist singer and songwriter AV tare aka David Porter who with this is dropping the umpteenth record that he's ever been affiliated with if you somehow been a hardcore fan of music for the past 10 years but you're now first hearing of this guy well he is most known for being a pivotal member of the pioneering neo psychedelic music outfit Animal Collective and over the years with them has taken part in creating some of the most mind-bending music of the 2000s with records like some tongs feels strawberry jam and Merriweather Post Pavilion music that's melodic sweet fun but incredibly energetic over-the-top and eccentric with its use of sound effects sound manipulations electronics it's music that is incredibly colorful it's overwhelming it's freakish but also a really good time and the tracks the AV fronts on Animal Collective records tend to be a little more volatile explosive and topped with his trademark boyish yelps and screams now AV tear dropped a solo record back in 2010 titled down there an album that I was not a huge fan of a record that I commended for its experimentation but I did not find many of the songs or the vocals but I did not find many of the songs or the vocals on this thing to be all that interesting for me it's really an unapologetically indulgent release and in the space of time between down there and this new AV tear record right here Animal Collective of course but out there said to beat hurts album which I admit does not really rank all that high for me in the overall animal collective discography I was happy to see AV Terra playing a larger role on this record in terms of songs and vocals especially after an album as poppy as Merriweather Post Pavilion but this record was so overblown with effects for me it's an album that unfortunately doesn't really feel enhanced by the experimentation the animal collective embarks upon which is sad because that's typically one of the major highlights of any animal collective album and I'm glad that some people really sat with this record since it got released and eventually the songs really started to translate and click for them but that has never been and I think never should be the objective in enjoying a record from these guys the way the animal collected distorts and experiments with sound has always been a highlight in their records not something to listen through now even though a V songs tend to be the more wild and experimental in animal collectives discography I was sort of hoping that I would get more enjoyable solo LP from him this time around for a few reasons one this thing is not simply a solo record he's bringing on the help of other musicians notably angel Dara Dorian you might know her from the Dirty Projectors and drummer Jeremy Hyman reason number two the song little thing which is a fantastic lead single for this record an awesome little pop tune it feels so nocturnal with its deep funky heavy bass line it's jangly guitars it's sort of eerie watery keyboard leads the instrumentation sounds like something out of a Halloween special for a cartoon but but in a good way I love the infectious background vocals on a chorus the groove on this thing is stellar and most importantly I think the song showed off a pop sensibility that I thought really only panda bear was bringing to the table when it came to the Animal Collective dynamic really proved me wrong with this track however once I started to hear more tracks from this LP I began to realize how misleading that lead single kind of was like with the song strange Caloris a song that has this freakish groove with all these heavy drums of dissonant keyboards syncopated the track also features all these layered cycling vocal harmonies that reach that animal collective level of oddity but much in the way centipede Hertz was this song to me is just like a little much obviously this song and others on here feature a stronger pop sensibility than any of the tracks on down there and many other AV affiliated collaborative projects but this track and many on here are so heavily layered with sounds that are so heavily treated with goofy sounding effects nearly everything on this record is springy or its watery or it's kind of distorted I would say sonically this album is really over done it's burnt to a crisp the sound of the instrumentation on this LP is twisted and tortured to the point where they are sapped of any likable characteristics they either become outright obnoxious to listen to or just generally unenjoyable or uninteresting while the song little Fang really seemed to turn some heads when it first got released I think the UH apparent appeal of that song was how accessible and how traditional it was a characteristic that feels even more clear as this track is put up against ten other songs on this record and what's even more disheartening is that the songwriting the tune writing the chord progressions on this LP aren't even as unorthodox as you might assume given the really zany sound set on this thing I wouldn't say AV is too far outside of what he has already done solo or done with Animal Collective on this record there are a few likeable tracks on this LP but for the most part the songs the tunes on here range from being incredibly underwhelming and just sort of breezing by like on the song duplex trip or the tracks on this record are attention-grabbing for all the wrong reasons like the song catchy was contagious a track where I actually don't mind the melody of the song but every sound is it is so heavily treated with effects that the track just becomes a tacky puddle of slop some of the songs on this LP are just relentlessly loud and loopy like the track the outlaw which has one of the most redundant hooks on this LP as well with AV screaming over and over that the outlaw is the future I mean I'm sorry I just don't get anything out of that because I really do think Amy's vocals get kind of tiring by the end of the LP and that's because of a handful of reasons it's because of just how obscure they are occasionally by the facts how the effects worsen the more unlikable characteristics of his voice really make his voice more pitchy more ear piercing overall I didn't really get anything out of this album that appealed to me outside of a few likeable Tunes and just a really bizarre aesthetic I really don't think a lot of the songs a lot of the tunes on this record or that interesting and the sounds are just so beyond repair because of how abused they are with this very liberal use of effects again it's just overcooked it's it's just burnt to a crisp it's it's jerky at this point it's like impossible to to chew through a lot of the sonic mishmash that has been assembled on this LP in my opinion I'm feeling a strong for tool like five on this record transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana AV tear forever
