nyQfrJRTYSo,uh.this chainsmokers album it's not a good the chainsmokers the game-changing music duo that's been dominating the papa sphere over the past few years with some huge chart climbing singles fusing modern EDM with some very moody pop balladry but still even though I'm not a chainsmokers fan I still give the duo all the credit in the world they have dominated a corner in the music market that few other artists are because most producers were kind of too busy giving dance music fans like you know this endless flow of formulaic hedonistic bangers to realize that hey you know maybe these people have feelings too that we could be appealing to and yeah they certainly do but chainsmokers writes music for them as if their emotions run about as deep as a kiddie pool and that's pretty much how this new album feels over here like wading through an emotional kiddie pool the album mostly consists of all these immature saccharine dance pop anthems about relationships and going to your friends party and it all projects this really self-centered idyllic view of the world that just sounds like a big fat lie listening with this record is kind of like looking at the world through the eyes of that soldier character in that in that one episode of Black Mirror where he's kind of got that implant in his head that makes things look like really sunny and perfect and nice and there's nothing to worry about and it's not that I don't like happy music and it's not like there aren't problems that exist in the chainsmokers universe it's just that the problems are there are barely even problems a lot of what is cause for concern on these chain-smoker songs adds up to just romantic melodrama all these allusions to things not working out or working out I miss you doing drugs learning the love sneaking out to the bar not being able to go to your friend's party even when I was a teenager I didn't care about this shit and I don't really think what this album deals with is the quintessential teenage experience I mean I'm sure there are some teenagers that would love for life to be this easy but for the most part this album just kind of seems like it's trying to emotionally pander to teens who are just trying to fit you're out what life's all about by providing them a fainting couch of pillowy dance-pop that feeds into their heightened emotional state and it's not the teenagers don't have legitimate feelings or that they don't deserve music that's geared to them they do the thing is though I feel like I have a higher opinion of the chainsmokers audience than the chainsmokers do because I think teenagers deserve music that engages them on a maturity level that they're capable of functioning on not just feeding them some Kidz Bop quality PAP with better production value and original lyrics I mean seriously the track breakup every night look at these lyrics there's only one condition under which you release a song like this and that's when you think your audience is stupid and not to say that there isn't anything real behind the chain-smoker songs the band released this massive Facebook post where they kind of explain the inspirations and the feelings that kind of went into each track one of the most compelling stories behind one of these songs is the song Karis the problem is the song Paris lyrically is very different than the story behind Paris at some point during the writing process what inspired Paris was just kind of sculpted into yet another melodramatic teenage situation where you know you have this boy and this girl and they're escaping from her parents because they don't approve the relationship and it's just young love and they want to be together all this bullshit about hanging out on the terrace and taking selfies for the Internet is just made up it's just general escapism and pop-culture references to hook in the lowest common denominator I'm not sure if there's any more evidence that you need to know that if you are a teenager all this album is trying to do is pander to you emotionally and musically because speaking of the music the chainsmokers were way more fun when they were just writing these dumb dance tunes that kind of regurgitated pop culture memes with the silly bangers that they used to release and I think the closest they come to doing that over here is a it won't kill you or when Kelley I like that track quite a bit I do like the beat a lot it feels like you know the most carefree and drama-free song in the entire record and the instrumental is actually kind of fun to listen to now it seems like the chainsmokers are more concerned with coming through with this faux touching intimate keyboard pop that occasionally incorporates some elements of dance music but it's not this album sound as much as what it sounds like that makes it so terrible to my ears because this album sounds like a fake Polaroid this album sounds like nothing bad ever happened to you this album sounds like you had at least two friends with trust funds this album sounds like your mom paid for your concert tickets this album sounds like your only concern in life is when Kylie Jenner is posting the snapchat again this album sounds like you spend too much time on your phone yeah this new chainsmokers album it's not good 
IZxa8FaUYOw,hi everyone so Anthony sure-tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new arc album itself titled London via Caracas producer and singer-songwriter ARCA is back with the third full-length commercial album highly anticipated at least for me because I thought that this new record over here would bring a big change and sound and style Arcas music has always intrigued me but hasn't really been able to hold my attention keep my attention I've never been floored by an arc album even though there are some really special and amazing things about Marquez music for one the sound the way he treats sound on his two previous records is fantastic his approach to sound craft is incredibly creative it's so vivid it's so textured the auditory world he creates with his music is incredible it sounds like his ideas come from another dimension or something but when it comes to progression or structuring a track Arcas songs leave a lot to be desired a lot of tracks on Zen and a lot of tracks on mutant just kind of feel like disconnected avant-garde auditory vignettes I don't really do all that well when it comes to reinforcing one another sure on an arc album there's tons of awesome musical and auditory ideas but when it comes to again building a track there's just something kind of missing now that kind of seems to be changing on this new album over here a little bit and that change comes at the hand of the incorporation of vocals on this album yes now ARCA is singing over his own instrumentals on this record and it's done almost entirely in this really eerie nasal falsetto that haunts my nightmares along with the visuals in the music videos that have been released in promotion of this album but if the vocals do anything on this record it's that they give the experimental production on this album a stronger sense of direction in my opinion the singing on this album also brings out of a wry interesting influences that I hadn't thought of before with artists previous records for one bjork bjork is most definitely an influence on our cannot all that surprising to hear given that archit has produced four york's previous record or her latest record at least as of now Szolnok kira he's also done production for fka twigs and lo and behold there are some elements in my opinion of a kind of alternative contemporary R&B on this thing i also think there are some ideas on this album for those fans of moody trip-hop music maybe a Portishead fan or people who are into really whimsical strange experimental baroque pod maybe an Antony and the Johnsons fan just kind of imagine a lot of that baroque instrumentation a lot of that classical whimsical instrumentation being transformed into more synthetic sound instead and also there are moments on this album where I feel like I'm listening to some kind of strange digital avant-garde opera especially on cuts like anoche the dissonance and the harshness of our commute is still here but the vocals just add a totally different dynamic to that it's a beautiful element a human element to a degree I've always appreciated how alien Arcas music sounds but you know I'm kind of liking what this lonely strange very sad singing is bringing to a lot of these tracks now not saying the vocals on this thing sound great in the traditional sense I most definitely don't think that but I think for what this record is I think for the context that's brought with the instrumentals the vocals do work they do serve a purpose for example I can't really imagine myself enjoying the breathy monie singing on the track fugue essays in any other context other than that track with all these heavenly warped rushes of synthetic tones and the operatic singing on the tracks in window is chilling sending tingles down my spine as the vocals are singing over what sounds like I don't know that this attempt at making some kind of synthetic symphony or pit orchestra but a lot of simple tones kind of come together into this sort of smudgy chaotic way now unfortunately I still have my reservations with our chasm music and this album it is not a perfect record in Arcis first foray into writing more structured tracks does not go off without a hitch there's still a handful of tracks on here that I think go pretty stale pretty quickly either because of a lack of progression or uninteresting progressions there are a number of tracks on here that I think lack any semblance of a solid ending or any kind of finality the tracks sauntering I love this song or at least what it sounds like for the moments that it exists in because the interesting and beautiful scent progression that brings us to this really weird and odd vocal passage toward the very end of the track and then it just kind of cuts off almost immediately at about the two-minute mark there has to be this is one of the most compelling moments on the entire record how is there only two minutes of this especially when you're ending the song in a moment where it feels like wow it sounds like this is going somewhere else obviously it's going to end it's ending the song virgin is a somewhat odd instrumental but it just kind of sounds like a cut that could have been on the last arca album I sort of feel the same way about the strange keyboard piece child that finishes the entire album off the mix on this track is particularly weird all of these synth tones kind of layered on top of each other in such a way where there's just kind of this big rush this push of sound whenever they pop up it kind of sounds like ARCA is almost just like smashing his hands town on his keyboard but obviously this sounds like there's a lot of composition to this track so he's not literally doing that but just again the the sound the mix of it is kind of strange to me the song width is actually in a way another favorite of mine on this album but again amazing idea with literally sampling a wimp and it sounds so great like the sound of the whip is so vivid and crisp and clear and the way that the sound of this whip whipping is sort of chopped up and made to be really jittery really sporadic it's really overwhelming and strange and I actually again think is one of the best ideas that this album has to offer and yet it only lasts a minute you would think that it would be almost necess to extend this idea out into something just more fleshed out given that it sounds unlike anything else on the album the fact that it is so short only makes it feel like even more of a random nonsensical detour and you know while I do appreciate and enjoy the inclusion of the singing on this album not every vocal part on this record is perfect or amazing on the track reverie the vocal effects that be singing on this track is smothered in kind of distracts away from the humanity the rawness the intimacy of the vocals that I enjoyed so much on nearly every other track here meanwhile the track Cora is maybe a bit too raw at least in the sense of there's a moment where the singing just kind of devolves into well a lot of the background instrumentation is just coming off a really vague not really sure where it thinks it's going you know I will give a shout out to castration even though this is just another instrumental track it's one of the best instrumental tracks that I've heard on NER Cal b'm thus far the rhythms are so hard and in-your-face and crispy and punchy it's really one of the most aggressive songs that I've ever heard ARCA put together I mean it's in a way a banger it's a mean and sort of distorted and aggressive and kind of industrial flavor - and I don't know I mean I feel like I've addressed the bulk of what this album has to offer you know again while I enjoyed the inclusion of vocals on this album I came away from this ARCA record feeling like the same way I have with pretty much every arc album thus far I mean the tracks don't really seem like they connect all that well flow all that well from the beginning to the end of the album don't reinforce each other all that well a lot of tracks with abrupt endings fantastic ideas abandoned way too early other moments where ideas are extended to the point where they just grow stale and uninteresting due to a lack of significant progression I mean going into this I thought man this could Arcas best album but in a way it's um even more of a inconsistent record when compared with the two previous efforts uh oh man I don't know I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this one and I'm just going to leave it at that transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best do the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't please don't cry I don't want you to cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry that's all other videos next to my head I think you should check out

u2B3Dzu5pa0,and it's time to review the new Joey badass album all-american badass New York rapper Joey badass he is back with his second full-length commercial album he's an artist so I've been following for a while now uh since his breakout 1999 mixtape where the the dude the dude wasn't even 20 when he dropped that tape I thought his commercial debut before the money was really good but still I came away from that album wondering where would Joey go next because as good as salad as that album was he couldn't stay on this boom bap sort of vintage 90's hardcore hip hop jazz rap sound forever he doesn't strike me as a purist or rapper who's stuck in the past more one who will continue to evolve as he sees fit and Joey hinted toward the evolution that would be on this record with one of the lead single the song devastated which dropped very far in advance of this album it's a track that given everything we've heard from Joey up until this point you just would not expect it is a triumphant sing song II melodic and smooth trap ballad with an atmospheric very grand feel it's very positive it's very uplifting and even though this is not a style this is not a sound that's usually in Joey's wheelhouse the track has turned out to be one of his biggest singles ever definitely his most successful attempt a pop crossover in his music even if it does piss off some of his fans who would love to just kind of see him stick to that hardcore hip-hop sound you know but the thing is on before the money Joey had some crazy moments to escape 120 most notably and while a lot of the releases he put out when he was younger were very full of piss and vinegar over the years that he's been in the public eye I think his music has mellowed out quite a bit and has grown a little bit more introspective and thoughtful so going into this new record over here I was really expecting a mix of sounds maybe some new stuff some experimental stuff some more modern stuff stuff with a pop flavor of course jazz rap you know but like maybe an updated approach I was expecting at least a couple of tracks that would have a more hardcore aggressive in-your-face sound like be fantastic rockabyebaby single that dropped in advance of this record featuring schoolboy q cues versus really interesting on this album I love how the beat really strips back at the start of his verse and it really kind of opens up gives him a lot of room to say what he's saying love the line on here where he's talking about you know he's at that stop sign and the other people who is comparing himself to they're sort of a in an area where there's Wi-Fi the beat on this thing is amazing it's heavy its rumbling the basses monstrous the beat just knocks so hard I love the choppy piano samples on this thing and Joey's chorus vocals getting layered with this demonic chorus is a really nice touch too there are a lot of musical emotional stylistic bases covered on this thing and again I anticipated that I was looking forward to that what I did not expect though was just how conceptual this album would end up being maybe not conceptual maybe conceptual is the wrong word but for the bulk of this record one thing is on Joey's mind and that is the state of black people in America in 2017 yes the title of this album isn't just some you know edgy Oh America KKK sort of thing he's actually trying to make a political statement and I like that Joey took things in this direction I like that he gave this album this amount of focus especially on a topic that while it has been mentioned by a myriad of rappers over the course of the past few years it hasn't been tackled for the entirety of an album at least not on this grand of a scale at least not on an album that I think has this much mainstream appeal sure you know Kendrick Lamar took them of a butterfly I get it I love that album too but a lot of that record comes down to Kendricks personal experience as an artist and as a black man sort of struggling in the music industry especially with the temptations to give in to materialism and lose touch with his roots and his friends and his family Joey isn't so much talking about things from a personal perspective he's really trying to attack a myriad of problems on this record whether it be drugs police the judicial system the prison system religion politicians Trump Obama self-improvement black on black crime it's a lot it's a lot to digest Joey goes into so many topics he doesn't necessarily come out of this album having solved any of them and not that I would expect an album to sort of have the silver bullet to these very complex issues but Joey does really effectively a service by highlighting these issues venting on them in a very cathartic way reframing these things so that they seem really personal they seem really important they have some urgency to them they're not just statistics it's not just a news article it's one man as passionate thoughts on all these compounding problems and Joey's thoughts on these things come from a myriad of places sometimes he's dabbling in a bit of extremity and hyperbole an exaggeration to sort of highlight an issue that he's talking about sometimes he sounds like and feels like a frustrated revolutionary other times he's very measured very thoughtful other spots on album he comes off really peaceful other spots he's tired he's being down he's worn down he's tired of the prejudice he's tired of a grudge holding he's tired of just this endless cycle of pain and suffering and equality constantly getting the short end of the stick now match these messages with some of the easygoing jazzy instrumentals on this record you kind of have an equation that most likely you're going to have a lot of impatient listeners sort of tuning out who are looking for something to sort of go wild to or turn up to this is more of a thinking man's rap record and hopefully with this album Joey is able to reach out to some of those people who wouldn't normally contemplate these topics who wouldn't normally want to hear about this stuff on an album but for the most part I am afraid that while this album is very good it is very enjoyable and it is very tasteful I think Joey is going to be sort of preaching to the choir on this thing in terms of the bulk of the audience for this record still though there are a lot of great tracks on this thing a lot of smart tracks the song why you know love me one of my favorites on here essentially a love song or at least it's framed like a love song but instead of Joey kind of having this relationship that's on the rocks with another woman the other person is literally the country that he lives in you know another thing I want to about this record is don't go into this thing expecting some spotty jazzy and consistent sleepy conscious j.cole flavored album even if J Cole is featured on one of the tracks on this record and he provides a good feature but honestly all American Badass reminds me of something that J Cole would put out if only he were just like you know a little bit more interesting or engaging or was just kind of popping out of the mix a bit more had some better hooks and when he was kind of railing on these topics came at it in a way where he just brought a bit more urgency to what he was saying because well tracks like legendary and Babylon and land of the free fleas tracks do have jazzy instrumentals and they're very smooth and sort of laid-back Joey's tone on these tracks is anything but he's over the top he's trying to shout to anybody who will listen the the importance and the significance of these issues that he's so upset by whether it be media portrayals of black people or the death of Eric garner to specifically mention the track land of the free even though the song has a very kind of cool scent funk ballad that sort of blissful sort of heavenly Joey's delivery on this track he really feels every bar that he's spinning as if he's having a conversation almost giving a speech in a way and another thing I will say that Joey is doing really well on this album he does a lot more some hooks on this record that I anticipated that he would and he really hold his own whether it be a full amount people I like that track quite a bit a very sticky very Airy very pretty hook the song temptation too or Joey's just really kind of given one of those passionate performances on the hook really get denken Nommo and the horns on this track too there's something about the chorus on this song that reminds me of like an old soul tune like he's pulling from Marvin Gaye a little bit on this cut now I'm not going to say Joey should give up a rap hear anything or should become a full time singer that he's a more talented singer than he is a rapper but he really came through with the the chorus is on this thing and I'm pretty proud of him for that I will say though there are some moments on this record where Joey is singing or rapping in a higher register voice comes off kind of light sort of dainty doesn't really have the impact of his mid-range or especially like when he goes low when he goes low man it's it sounds great and that's only gotten better as he's gotten older but I do appreciate the dynamics that Joey is trying to bring with his voice for sure because it makes the moments when Joey is really digging in emotionally or going into his lower register all that more cathartic and speaking of cathartic the other major banger on this thing is the song ring me alarm which is a really odd instrumental for a rap track has this digit engine like driving throbbing bassline sort of has a bit of a dance track flavor to it as far as the rhythm goes sounds like something a pop rapper Kanye would even be on top of but Joey does a good job on this B and actually brings in some features from Nick caution we have Kirk Knight on this thing as well as me Qi Darko from Flatbush zombies love that dudes voice wish he'd do more features and the track just has so much going on because there are a couple beat changes on here and with all the features on this thing it's just so many changes it's so many shifts most of it ends up working out I do think the track in the end does sound like a little bit of a mess structurally like there's not a whole lot about the song that's all that consistent because there's always something different just around the corner but it is a very visceral very explosive very exciting track now I do have a few reservations about the record I do think the intro as good as I think Joey's verse is there and it does definitely set the political the social tone of the album I think he could have gone a little harder I think he could have been a little bit more explosive right out of the gate because you know the first chunk of the record is very smooth is very easygoing I think it would have provided a nice high at the start of the album to kind of you know just kind of get people's mouths watering for what was about to come some of the smooth jazzy instrumentals on this thing while I loved Joey's performances on all of them and I do think each performance does have a distinct lyrical and emotional tone instrumentally though the album does bleed together a little bit does melt into itself a little bit and there are a few tracks on here specifically the song super-predator where Joey clearly goes into his verse and into the track with kind of a concept of topic here specifically trying to demystify or attack some of the media stereotypes of black youths and I think he could have done a better job of fleshing this idea out untangling a little bit more it does sort of lose steam when Stiles pees verse comes in though I do think he does a very good job over there I especially loved the line where he's talking about not being a chicken he doesn't watch fox news so many different ways you can interpret that line the way that I took it was sort of uh Fox News being the aggressor the chickens kind of being the victim sort of like a fox in the hen house sort of situation but still this is not the kind of album that I think is the solution to all of our problems or anything like that even Joey himself comes away from this record with questions of his own but I guess Joey does the best that he can as a musician to I guess at least get people thinking about these problems and just be a little bit more mindful and try to do what they can to either improve their life around them to make better choices or fix or fight the system that's preventing them from succeeding as Joey posits on the very last track of this album American Idol I think this album serve serves as an opportunity to rethink how we've been dealing with all these issues over the past several years because they need to be fixed sooner or later and while I feel like we're more conscious of the the inequalities of class and race right now in America maybe more than we've been in a while it seems like the the solution to these problems is still so far in the distance but you know I will say musically artistically this album is very much an improvement on what Joey had presented on his last album not only as you know they're very strong concepts and themes on this album I thought instrumentally it was definitely a notch up I thought his performances emotionally lyrically were really captivating the flow the tracklist was really good the feature list on this thing I thought was great this album has so many great things going for it it makes me so happy to see an artist to I thought had big things going for him or big thing is destined for him when I heard some of his early mixtapes to sort of see that confirmed now with this new album over here and I'm feeling a strong eight on this record trick trick for transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and you know please dig on this Joey album because I think it's good I think it's good love ya videos and stuff you

4NzqALD8oCk,okay it's not really that impressive hi everyone and one the fan bond here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new future islands album the far-field these guys are a North Carolina sent pop trio I've been listening to their stuff since about like 2010 now and while I have enjoyed their music up until this point they've never dropped a record in my opinion that that was mind-blowing oh my god I mean even their last album with the title seemed to be an admission that this is just kind of like you know a collection kind of cool catchy catchy tracks we did but you know so I'm kind of holding on to this hope that one day future islands will come through with some sort of musical masterpiece and the reason I feel that way is I think that they have the talent to make that happen despite the band's shortcomings in the past on every future islands record that I've heard I hear a great sense of melody an appreciation for groove some good hooks passionate songwriting and some amazing lead vocals from the band's frontman Sam Harry now my issues previously with future Islands music have been that their records are a little one-dimensional or the recording is kind of rough around the edges muddy and flat but much of that seems to be a thing of the past on this new record over here because this is future islands best recorded and mixed album hands down the since the drums the bass the vocals it all shines through on this record very vibrantly and now that the production on this record is better I feel like the band's influences are shining through much more as well people who are into artists like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark the Human League you know there's definitely a New Romantics vibe on this album that now that I kind of pick it up here it seems like it's always been present some kind of way shape or form on future islands previous records - there's even a track on this record that features vocals from Blondie's Debbie Harry which is that's not an admission of what what inspires future Islands music I don't know what is and it's actually a pretty decent performance between say and Debbie considering how awkward I thought some of the vocals came off like with the recent material blondie has been putting out and I'm song candles of feature Islands kinda kinda like it vertically wrote a reggae track here the one thing that's missing is that guitar that's you know just kind of ching ching ching emphasizing the upbeat just imagine that guitar in your head as you're listening to numerous parts of this song and you'll hear you'll hear that reggae vibe coming through its I won't I won't say I like it it's certainly different the band does take a couple tiny risks on this album here and there the pretty good string sections on the song Aladdin at the opening of the album very faint but you know they add a little bit of color the second track on the record has some faint horns that are sort of thrown in there for just a little bit of extra sound it was a track on here that sort of hit me with a disco flavored beat future islands have never really quite gone that hard sort of on that sound before in my opinion and on the tracks through the Roses this track has a really kind of linear building intense climax at the very finish that I like quite a bit but the bulk of this album and even some of these tracks I just mentioned in a lot of ways is just kind of future islands as usual and really to a fault in a way and it's not just that future islands have delivered yet another synth pop album because there's absolutely nothing wrong with that synth pop there's quite a bit of room in that genre for growth and progression and invention reinvention there are numerous artists in the genre that have multiple classics under their belts a new order for example you know almost reinvented themselves with every record my issue with future islands on the far field though is that they are totally intent on writing songs with the same very tight narrow formula again and again and again and again it's very rare on this album that the band veers away from the driving bass lines and the dancing synth arpeggios and the steady drum machines that back almost every track they write I have a sneaking suspicion that some of the drum beats on this record are only slight variations of ones that the band has worked with in the past or maybe even recycled versions of ones that the band has worked with in the past top all of this with Sam herrings very raspy fiery vocal delivery and you have future Islands trademark formula now it's here in high definition for all to hear but I guess for me personally the impact doesn't seem that significant because at this point the band has already shown all of their cards in the case of Sam herring I know that he is way more versatile vocally than you would guess just by listening to a future islands album because he pretty much approaches nearly every song with the same singing style for sure in some ways this album feels like a minor adjustment and an improvement on future islands have done on their past several records but clearly the band is not taking full advantage of the fact that not only had they explored these sounds nearly to death by now but also the new refreshing recording quality that they have at their disposal they're not really taking full advantage of it even in the moments that you do your some extra instrumentation worked into the mix it's so quiet it's almost barely there it just feels like an afterthought again it's just really distracting at this point you know sure you know I have moments where I review albums where yeah the artists is kind of repeating themselves a little bit they're treading some water you know they're refusing to kind of evolve or try something different or take any risks but man it's just so oh they're just an immovable object I'm feeling Ally season six on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just be pissed at me in the comments if you're you're pissed at my thoughts on this album links and other stuff in my head I think you should check out and that's that's the review guys future Islands the far field forever 
nO89Wos0Hv0,hi everyone it's your boy yo yo yo yo yo here mr. Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new father John misty album pure comedy singer/songwriter Josh Tillman aka father John misty aka farmer John misery aka Papa John lunch me aka feather Jam ministries aka fucking jerk missed me aka faster wan whiskey aka fava-bean Pepsi he is on his third full-length album under this moniker he has released a myriad of albums under the Jay Tillman name years ago peer comedy over here follows Josh Tillman's second father John misty album the excellently lovey dovey I love you honey bear wish that record is a beautiful record of self dissection of affection of commitment it's an album that is as smart as it is moving to your Josh Tillman I think really honed his talents for writing these grand musical gestures that are laced with these very blunt sharp witty pieces of lyrical satire so blunt in fact that his sense of humor has a bit of a grim tone to it you know it's kind of like getting hit with a baseball bat on fire wrapped in barbed wire that's a bar and it's that wits that satire it's that drive to sort of critique the world at large that had me pretty excited to listen to this new album over here because judging from everything I heard from this record up to this album seemed like Joshua's just going to be doing that on a much bigger scale to the point where he's kind of getting down to the Nitty Gritty of what's ailing the human race itself whether it be politically socially philosophically religiously now just the length alone of this record I would say makes it a grander statement on these issues I mean this thing is 80 minutes long and I would say on this record that Tillman's statements are generally bolder stronger more pointed he really kind of gives off this attitude of not givin a fuck at least not about who his opinions alienate or what bridges he may be burning with a track like leaving LA a ruthless 13 minute takedown of the entertainment industry here's just one verse from that which I thought was sort of brutal and even on this very track Tillman doesn't escape from his own criticisms recognising the fact that he's become this cliche of the super self-serious white singer-songwriter who's going to preach the listener about you know what's so shitty about the world they live in and for sure there are moments on this record where Tillman plays the role of the verbose sad sobering folk stir or piano man but there are moments where he plays with that role to kind of lampooning it a little bit or at least being self-aware enough to comment on his status and his abilities as a singer-songwriter and dissect his image as far as a public figure - one of my favorite tracks on this record Ballad of the dying man a song that's essentially about somebody who's so in love with his own ideas and opinions that when he's on his deathbed when he's at the threshold of passing away his number one worry is who's going to critique all the thumb of those in the one-percenters the guy is even portrayed is like checking his newsfeed before he passes on so that he sees what he's a about to miss and I can see this track as Tillman kind of lighting an effigy of themselves on fire a little bit but simultaneously taking shots at people who are culture writers in the internet age and you know take themselves a little too seriously this record brings my favorite kind of negative viewpoint of the world it's the sort of pessimism that while it acknowledges that that everything around it is shitty it just can't help but laugh at it you know let's just make a joke out of mankind's endless cycle of self-inflicted wounds and while deep down Josh most likely wishes he had the fix for a lot of the problems that he's singing about on this record I think he's just as content to be you know riding the a bomb that ends all of our lives within a cowboy hat and air like major Kong and dr. Strangelove some of the issues Josh sings about on this record seem like dough why are we still dealing with this others seem a little more inherent at least according to him that pretty much seems to be the concept of the title track on this thing itself Josh sees these issues of mankind prevailing right at the very start of our lives is through the birthing process in this opening verse well it turns out nature's design has some flaws Josh I think also explores human nature a little bit on the track when the God of love returns there'll be hell to pay sort of portraying I think what looks like this a rapture esque scenario where God comes back and is discussed by the world we've sort of created for ourselves but then that criticism that judgment is thrown right back in the face of that God like well you know you left us with this really unjust world like what was it a thing was going to happen bro also when my favorite lines on the entire record turns up on this track to where Josh refers to human beings as earth's most soulful predator and their moments on this record where we're very much in the past very much at the root of what he sees as mankind's problems other moments he's pushing things toward the future like on total entertainment forever where he gives us this scenario where mankind's obsession with keeping itself entertained puts us in a world where you know we're having sex with Taylor Swift through virtual reality it's this matrix like world where it doesn't really matter everybody's kind of plugged into the same thing rich or poor the channels are all the same they're tons of celebratory pianos and horns all over this track that make it really peppy grandiose and beautiful in fact the instrumentation sounds so pretty it's almost a sales pitch for this soul sapped dystopia that Josh Tillman has spun out sort of like you know good piece of sci-fi also kind of the case on the track things it would have been helpful to know before the Revolution where we get this image of a society that seems to have overthrown the government overthrown the the world of industry too and now we've kind of gone back to this hunter-gatherer sort of economy in this post-apocalyptic Mad Max Ian kind of world Tillman tries to escape the world's problems though on the song birdie or at least kind of portray this bird as a form of escapism because this bird sort of flies through the sky high above and far away from us trying to perfectly engineer our world our societies and Tilghman portrays it as impossible perfection to scenario where it seems like the cure is even worse than the cancer itself I get a sense of escapism off of the track a bigger paper bag to where it seems like Tillman is using alcohol drugs and ego to kind of shield himself or build up his status build up his image build up his self-worth but then pairs this with some really self dissecting refrains of what a fraud what a con this could also be a critique being lobbed to him by his own audience or kind of the the music writer public pretty much everything Josh touches and talks about on this record he goes through very methodically very thoroughly really thinks about what he wants to say and then says a lot about it however this a really fantastic quality about the album does falter a bit toward the end on tracks like a smoochie for example a song that sounds like it's about his wife encouraging him through these really dark depressive spells which you you would have to figure a guy like Josh would would go through given that he is so concerned and I guess so aware of just how shit the world is but he doesn't really give these potentially intense throws of depression much more than a lyrical footnote on this record it's not really something that he goes into what the depth that he does many other things on this album same for the track two wildly different perspectives while I do appreciate the observation that yes politically and socially things do seem really polarized right now Josh's observations here are not much more than surface level he does go pretty deep into the topic of age though on the track growing old on Magic Mountain a grand ballad about what seems like a man's last night of raising hell and living without regrets and just kind of burning the barn down this guy is watching his youth slip away but he's trying to take advantage of this last moment he has with it the track eventually builds up to this very droney heavy epic instrumental climax that I like a lot gives the album a real touch that's a sense of finality feels like a grand finish for the record but this is not the end of the album if anything this is kind of like maybe the the finish or the credits rolling or something because the last last track in 20 years or so is like a bit of an epilogue and essentially this track comes down to one simple statement that this doesn't matter it's not really going to matter in a few decades it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things of the universe because really all we are is a speck on a speck on a speck which you know I get that that's fine with me all the more reasons say fuck it bring on the Taylor Swift oculus rifts bitch as far as the production of the sound the instrumentation on this thing it's immaculate it's very well recorded it's very well mixed just like the last album you know that there's obviously still kind of an instrumental a sonic similarity here between what Josh Tillman is doing on this father John misty record and like maybe the last Fleet Foxes album it's very very Airy it's very open it's very pretty Josh brings a lot of different sounds on this thing whether it be some lavishly arranged piano ballads that are very tender very refined some exciting fiery passionate piano rock some acoustic ballads a track or two that has more of a gospel tone a couple that take on more of a country tone the weird distorted experimental vocals on the track the memo which is one of the most conceptual of the entire album especially as you're getting like the weird sort of talking background vocals kind of adding this very funny tongue-in-cheek context with these little stupid vapid statements behind what Josh Tillman is trying to say in his music it's sort of like hey you know I'm here trying to make this statement here and tell you guys something but people who are listening to the record don't really get it they're just fucking morons or at least that's what I took away from it there's thoughts were they're heavy instrumental interludes that are just again really grand really reaching just oh so ambitious and powerful this thing is so dramatic it's so theatrical it's so intimate it's so well thought out a lot of the time too then there's what is just the personality of the album and there's a lot of that this album is immensely funny immensely depressing it's heartfelt it's sincere but also has incredible moments of cynicism too it's the soundtrack to the world going to hell in a handbasket and that's great because honestly like it sounds so good I don't really mind I'm going to say I'm feeling a light too decent 9 album and leave it at that thank you for watching transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to the like if you like please

BhWoelsGLcI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week you should know this pretty regular segment right now okay before we get into those tracks make sure down there in the description box and I know you're doing this because I am seeing the effect of it and I want to say thank you to everybody who does take part in this but our amazon associates link if you hit that link down there in the description if you live in the US we get kickback from whatever you purchase and believe me it's showing it's helping out the segment I appreciate you guys using that link and also make sure to use the link down there to our good friends ever the can't talk today our good friends over at turntable lab on that website or on that link you will find a page where there's some vinyl and some turntable equipment and all sorts of stuff you know for the beginning record collector to sort of start their record collecting journey their record collecting dreams and yeah we get kickback from that as well any purchase you make over at that website once you've hit that link - cool cool all right so having gotten that out of the way let's get into the best and worst tracks of the week oh this has been a good week um this episode is going to be pretty back loaded because I found so many great tracks that I liked a lot this week you know only a handful of songs that they thought were so purely awful that they needed to land in the worst tracks of the week list I mean I probably could load these segments with just track after track after track from like the new Fast and the Furious soundtrack but you know eh I kind of feel like I just be just beating the life out of a child at that point it's just kind of unfair you know it's not it's not fair for me to beat up on the The Fast and the Furious soundtrack you know it does it doesn't know it's bad you know it didn't ask to be created you know it's it's really just kind of like a Frankenstein monster of all the horrors that modern popular music has to offer so you know but still still though still getting into outside of that soundtrack what I felt were the worst tracks of the week designer yes our good friend designer an artist whose new English project was so bad it spurred our not good series so he has two new tracks out I believe one of his recent singles I did enjoy I thought was pretty good but these new trees two new tracks God there I want to say not up to snuff but that would imply that there was like some kind of quality standard there to begin with the song up one of these two songs up to me just sounds like a future ripoff it just seems like designer is completely content and does not care that he sounds just like future on this track and many other tracks I thought as he kind of progressed and would continue to drop more material he would kind of maybe try to form a style or a sound of his own but he just does not care that he has a deep kind of singsong a rap voice with auto-tune on it and he's storing that on top of a trap beat and it just sounds like a future song it's it's so disgustingly close to a future song to what future does on a song it's really just a disappointment you know that that he doesn't care to be anything else other than future shadow the track that he dropped thank God I got it this this one's a bit of a different animal over here not that it doesn't sound similar in tone but at least up has just a smidge of structure or rhyme or reason to it thank God I got it is just literally verbal diarrhea and this kind of just goes to show that designer is one of those rappers and there are many more of them out there that would not sound even half as listenable I'm not even going to say good listenable as they are if it weren't for the fact that they have really talented producers and really talented co songwriters kind of they're making sure that the random you know bullshit that they say into the microphone actually kind of like sounds like it was intentional this track sounds like they just gave him a beat and he did whatever he felt like over it because the chorus is barely a chorus there's almost no rhythm or mirror to a lot of the verses at least no consistent rhythm or meter and not in a way where it sounds like he's being super experimental or anything like that it just kind of sounds like he's doing everything off the top of his head but it's like he has no style he has no Direction is no sense of rhythm I really have no idea what he thinks he's doing on this track it just sounds like again I'll say verbal diarrhea he's just kind of doing whatever and it's it does not sound good and we'll leave it there so those are those are two terrible tracks and the other track that sort of made it into this segment that I was kind of surprised that I didn't end up caring for as much as I did is the new timber timber track drifting unfortunately while timber timber is a project that I've been following for a long time a project to sound and do songs I've really enjoyed these two new tracks really had me worried about this new record because it sounds like they're throwing everything that made them appealing in the first place out the window their last track had kind of a very cold sparse almost electronic feel to it at some points this new track over here is almost like them trying to make a sparse depressing funky southern rock I don't know what's going on it does not make sense to me and not necessarily in the sense that they're kind of hitting upon something entirely new it just sounds like an overt clash of styles and moods coming together in this track here and I don't know I'm just kind of anticipating this new record because maybe he'll click with me and hit me as being this fantastically genius piece of musical expression or it may end up being one of the most significantly disappointing records I've heard this year either way something to talk about and that you know that's going to do it for our worst tracks this week literally literally that's that's going to be it let's move on to the tracks that it was kind of met on sort of on the sense with but you know certainly worth mentioning I want to give the mention to the new Beth Ditto track fire fire sort of like a bit of a soulful rock very epic grand anthem not a huge fan of Beth's voice you know I bet it's never really been the case but I do think that this was kind of an interesting and somewhat mature direction direction for her and her music so um you know maybe it'll resonate with some people and her career will get another wind off of what she's doing with this new forthcoming record certainly sounds like she's you know trying to do something a little bit more accessible and again I'll say mature on this new track over here and you know that's always cause or I guess opens the door for potential you know to kind of get a you know a new opportunity going so that tracks pretty decent thought the new drums track blood under my belt was okay although it does kind of sound like a bit of a throwback to their older somewhat in the somewhat surf rocks somewhat dream pop sound nothing really all together new or special for them but you know certainly the band sounds like they're holding their own and sticking to their guns in a somewhat decent way from there from that drums track we have this new Jack White track titled battle cry it's just kind of a weird short rock instrumental it's super aggressive sounds like something Jack had recorded to send over to baseball stadiums to be like hey man play this during the game get everybody amped up during the bow-wow wait in the window that way turn it just sounds like really novelty not really sure how to categorize the track I heard it once and I'm just like okay I don't need to hear this again I mean it really it sounds like a novelty song and I don't know what Jack is trying to do with this single over here moving on from their evidence with throw it all away the West Coast rapper is coming through the very moody somewhat introspective new single over here new album on the way give it a shot it's decent advance to come off of Leinster records as a new track out titled dead chambers and just like the last song that I heard from these guys that really kind of blew me away excuse me it is a really interesting mix of hardcore punk post hardcore black metal like a little bit of death metal in there too excuse me again but we're really kind of disappointed me about this tracker sort of let me down about this track a little bit is that the vocals felt so distant didn't really bring as much in terms of power or intensity as they did on what I'd heard from them pre easily hopefully this is not so much the case for the rest of the cuts on the album hopefully you know the the rest of the cuts are a little more electrifying than what I heard here but still you know the bandits have a unique sound and mishmash of extreme and sort of loud rock styles going for them that I don't think a lot of other bands do so you know that reason alone isn't you know enough to a warrant taking some time out to check them out if you are into the genres moving on from there ASAP ferg has a new cut out titled East Coast featuring Remy Ma and while it is a banger ASAP ferg does bring great energy on this track I do like Remy's feature on this thing too this to me sounds like something that should have been on his last record this to me sounds like what should have been the trap Lord follow up instead I'm trap on trap Lords the excuse me always strive and prosper that was the record after trap Lord duh instead on always Drive and prosper we just got ASAP ferg making the worst sounding attempts to pull together some kind of badly conceived pop crossover and it fell flat on its face it was a terrible record I I don't know I I don't even know if I could pay people to like that album like if I if I went down to New York I would really struggle to find some people who liked that record and again while it does sound like he's going back to his roots a little bit he's going back to that kind of eerie atmosphere production that shouty kind of junkyard dog you know I'm really angry but I'm also like kind of a bit of a goofy voice going for me delivery the ASAP ferg has that he does so well you know he's going back to basics a little bit but it just seems like for me I'll you know too little too late while this is a decent single it's worth shouting out it's worth turning you guys onto it but I'm not going to be convinced until he pulls together a cohesive album where he you know conceives the sound and sticks to it and says you know this is who I am as an artist I'm not going to give you some focus group record that sounds like oh I need some hard tracks oh I need some tracks to the ladies oh I need some tracks for this setting oh I need some tracks for that setting I need some tracks for this group I need some tracks for that I want to hear an album that's you and for you an album that you made for yourself because you were like goddamn this is me this is what I got to express I you know this is just like what's inside of me and I have to put this together for me and for my audience and for nobody else and that's the kind of record that's going to win people over because that's the kind of record that like trap lured people gravitated toward that record you know while some people didn't like it in and understand well it's not a deep album but a lot of people like that record because ASAP ferg at the time brought a hot and an interesting and a somewhat unique sound and he totally drifted away from that I'm ranting at this point I digress I'm sorry but you know as decent as this track is I think its effort needs to push it a little further you know and and that's all I'm saying that's all I'm saying moving on from there Mount Kim B has an OK track out title that we go home together featuring James Blake I like the emotion of this track the vocals are great the very moody instrumental is fantastic too I just wish the track had more structure to speak of because once it eventually finishes it just feels like it kind of fizzles out and just drops off the face of the earth and its like what did I just listen to I felt like I kind of listened to a I'm a very long motif or something I felt like I hadn't progressed or sort of you know traveled through any song or anything it was just kind of like this very unorganized but very pretty idea that Kim B had going for themselves but it just like again just flatlined toward the end and it was like okay I mean I guess that was a thing and finally I want to mention the new at the drive-in song hostage stamps which I thought was a decent cut you know the band is not sounding quite as ferocious as they used to that's to kind of be expected but certainly you know I think I think they're I think they're living up to at least as standard the at the drive-in has set and you know I don't know if I'm really going to have too much more to say about this track or any other song the band drops until I hear everything on the record you know then and only then it's going to be the best way to assess whether or not the band is like really come back with a vengeance and finally actually I know I said finally but I mean it this time the new Alex G song proud of you seems to be one of Alex Gees more memorable song that I've come across seems that's a very personal and introspective lyrics to that I really like seems like he comes across as very solid sort of fluid idea on this one too as far as like the topic of the lyrics you know I'm not really crazy about the delivery or the the sound of the track is when we jump out at me it's kind of a very laid-back very glazed-over kind of ballad but you know at least I guess the track is fine while it's on you know and whenever his record drops I'm going to give it a listen and maybe these somewhat low-key songs will hit me a little bit harder once I'm kind of listening to an entire record that might maintain that mood now finally let's get into the best tracks of the week a lot of tracks here like I said a lot of tracks that I wanted to mention the new Harry Styles track sign of the times I'm not going to get too deeply into that track here I thought it was really good surprisingly good not a perfect song but surprisingly good I talked about in a tracker view that is linked down there in the description please check that out moving on from there Willie Nelson has a new track out titled he won't ever be gone which is a lovely and amazing a touching tribute to the late and great Merle Haggard a really good dollar from Willy and you know probably one of his most heartfelt songs in a long time and you know he goes into a I would say somewhat intimate detail about his musical relationship with Merle and for any hardcore any fan of country who to sort of knows you know at least a little bit of the history of the genre you know you'll certainly be able to appreciate what Willie's trying to get across here Frank Ocean biking featuring Jay Z and Tyler the Creator I will say this track is a little it's a little messy you know I the track does not work by traditional structure by any means you know sort of the very watery and dreamy acoustic intro Frank singing jay-z kind of pops in for a very unorthodox verse Frank comes back and then it's Tyler and Tyler's verses also like really low-key and odd it's an interesting way to sort of mix pop and acoustic ballad jury and hip hop and a lot of other things you know Frank Ocean is really kind of becoming this cross section of so many modern interesting ideas and popular music and he just melds them in you know really passionate very beautiful ways and um you know I don't think this song like really kind of had the full impact that it could have I think the song is bigger in name that it is in execution because you know the jay-z feature tag the Tata crater feature tag excuse me but I do think the track for the most part worked and you know came across as a successful effort certainly uh the fact that it doesn't you know hit really hard isn't necessarily the worst thing because I do think kind of a sadness the moodiness of the track is very potent and the length of it as well I do think makes it very satisfying moving on from there the new Feist tracks century I'm just going to say because this albums I'm really anticipating reviewing this album this track is kind of just as raw and as wild as the previous track that Feist had dropped in promotion of her forthcoming record but this one it doesn't really take a long time to get going or anything like that this one's kind of like it hits you somewhat hard pretty soon but it does kind of have that rough wild very dirty edges and corners sort of quality to it so it's not like you know it doesn't have a clean or punchy sound or anything like that to it but I will say it is it is quite feisty that's a good one it's feisty I'll leave it at that pop can track stray dog over here this is some lowdown and dirty dancehall man this is some lowdown and dirty dancehall I will just leave it at that give this thing a listen it does have a grime eNOS - and I'm not talking about the genre grind I'm talking about like you know the textural quality of the track leave me alone we're moving on from there as a new actress track dancing in the smoke goddamn this new actor song it is so textured god man I love the sound of this track the sound play in this track is excellent it's excellent it is a cut above what you're usually fucking hear in electronic music right now it is a kind of buff I tell you it is a kind of buff I'm telling you that I promise you is a cut above I promise you textures on this they're gorgeous they are gorgeous no really I just love how he produced this track like the sounds on this track are amazing they're so vivid like I can feel my eardrums touching them and rubbing up against them the sounds that you crafted on this song and of course you know the groove and the progression of the track is very good too you know it's not just this kind of weird alternative noise piece or anything like that actress does a really great job of sort of taking some very alternative sounds and you know sort of putting them into a you know somewhat experimental but digestible sort of quality and and you know I like that I love an artist who can kind of find that balance between okay this is experimental this is wild this is out there but here's something you know I'm making it a little accessible I'm kind of organizing a little bit I'm making it sort of make sense and I love that you know he finds a way orchestrate these sounds in an intriguing way but sort of I want to say an intuitive way a logical way moving on from there I want to give a shout out to the new gorillaz track let me out featuring push a tee and Mavis Staples s is the first Gorillaz track from the store coming record that like legit front to back excited about and I think it's one of the best compartmentalized tracks they've dropped so far like the way the push t feature plays off against the Mavis hook and then Damon Albarn's vocals on the track I mean it's all organized and it all plays out really well the beat is great everybody brings a great energy Damon's you know kind of drew who you know attitude is a good cool down from Pusha T's very passionate performances on the track I like it a lot I like it a lot I think this is again the first track I'm hearing from this so far where they're complimenting their guests the production is great and I'm getting an equal balance of okay here's Damon's input and here's the input from the guests and it's like you know it's kind of like it just works you know it just works you know there's a good like sense of collaboration and cohesion between everybody and I'm liking that and I'm liking it so I don't know hopefully there are tracks on the record that are just as great this one those other tracks that I was underwhelmed by click with me a little bit more and just crossing my fingers that I like this gorillas record describes a high figures caused by figures that I like humans I want to give a shout out to Karen Jay Kalinin Callan an Australian singer-songwriter this dude has a new amazing song out titled bravado this guy's last record embraces him I believe it's titled I was really raw really wild had some elements of synth pop post-punk art rock like a lot of things this thing is kind of like this very grand very grand like New Wave inspired ballad that is just so over the top and his vocals have so much power behind them they did on the last record too but I feel like he used that power a lot of the time to express some very dark and tortured emotions this new record over here and while it may be slightly tongue-in-cheek or maybe like he's kind of making a bit of an ironic statement here I haven't read that deeply into the track yet but this track is far more uplifting than anything I heard on his last record certainly lives up to that title of bravado it is a great ballad it is very I would say a great pulling at the heartstrings very inspiring if I hadn't said that already and we're moving on I want to give a shout out to the new machine drum track you betta which is a very glitchy interesting piece of production I love all of the very strange and kind of very sporadic since sequences and pieces throughout this track the beat is great and just has a really great groove to it you know I like machine drum when you can pull together some aggressive track of punchy track it really comes through with flying colors literally on this song so colorful really comes through with flying colors and I'm just kind of hoping to hear more of that moving forward especially this track is like the first taster of the upcoming record or some kind of EP or something or just you know the sign of things to come as far as like a different direction and finally I want to shout out the new NOx fortune track help myself this very interesting song in my opinion because it mixes so many different elements together you know sounds like some weird home production beat music definitely influences this thing definitely sounds like some low five pop influences this thing definitely sounds like some weird downtrodden sad singer-songwriter indie rock influences this thing it's a lot of different weird flavors all coming together on this one track and actually like kind of the sad tone and the wit of the lyrics I guess I would say on the song too again a lot of very intriguing fusions of styles and you know different genre ideas kind of coming together on this thing which you know you're seeing more and more and more than the internet age and you know I try to take the opportunity to celebrate any artist - I think it's kind of bringing those ideas or bringing some different ideas that wouldn't normally be connected together in sort of a surprising in a creative way and this is definitely an example of that and that's going to be it for this episode of the best and worst tracks of the week everybody thank you for watching hope I got you some good recommendations out of this thing sorry the worst tracks segment was so close and those I want to say not clothes short in this one I know some of you like that but I was actually happier to bring you a bunch of songs that I did enjoy quite a bit this week or a lot of songs I enjoyed this week but uh again we're gonna leave it there you're the best remember that Amazon link remember that turntable lab link down there in the description hit those up and I will see you guys in the next video you're my favorite forever 
sL64D1lm60I,ah ah hi everyone its it's your boy Antoine Phan Tuan here the Internet's busiest music nerd coming at you to talk about this new Harry style song sign of the times and someone who I never thought I'd be talking about on this channel I review mostly like you know like underground stuff and hip hop stuff and pop stuff and rock stuff and you know not not so much stuff that's connected to boy bands although I did review the last the the last of the debuts a in record so I know what I'm talking about but overall a lot of the stuff all the stuff thus far from the One Direction solo camps since you know the boy band had demised has been really underwhelming to me felt like nothing special at all um however that really changed with this Harry style track I oh I am I am amazed that this song came out as good as it did and not to say that you know Harry isn't a talented guy I just didn't know I just didn't know I didn't know he was capable of coming together with a track of this magnitude um what makes this song stand out to me what made it so special to me is that it's just a well-written well-structured piano ballad with grand strings great tension building verses the way the music kind of grows and grows and grows and reaches an amazing climax at the finish is great it's just a mark of classy just good songwriting fundamentals Harry's voice on the track is awesome and certainly you know all the boys in one direction they're good singers I mean you know that that's a part of the calling card of you know sort of being in the type of group that they were but goddamn you know the emotional passion the conviction the delivery that Harry brought to this track it's not anything I've heard from any of the music that I've heard thus far in you know like Zane's record for example which I thought was very emotionally flat I was trying to sound really Spacey and Atmospheric and sexy in the way that a lot of pop records were last year in the year before where it seems like the the less you do the better the the quieter you are the better the more dreary and kind of Moody your album is the better Harry did not go in that direction at all you know he was going in the direction of he wanted grandiose he wanted big he wanted powerful he wanted over the top and this ballot is certainly all that and more if I do have some critiques of the track if I can pull this track back a little bit because you know I do think there is room for improvement and the only reason I say this is because I think Harry is so close to doing something great on this song that like you know just a few tweaks could not only help this track but any track that he comes through within the future you know one critique I will say is that while I do appreciate the sentiment of this track I think it's almost serendipitous that the song was released like write of the night that that the the US through all those Tomahawk missiles at that airbase in Syria and a lot of people are just like wondering like holy you know war like all this crazy up you know I think it's kind of serendipitous that Harry would drop a track like this the night that that happened because again the sentiments of the track the message of you know we got to get out of here the world's crazy you know what are we gonna do you know this this feeling of hopelessness and feeling lost and just so many questions and what does the future hold for us culturally and economically and socially all of those feelings come through in this track in a really potent way I just wish he had more to say in lyrics because while again I do feel those feelings they're the the details of the lyrics they're super general and maybe in a way that kind of works because the moment you sort of put in any detail you kind of inadvertently people are gonna you're going to state a position of some sort and people are going to kind of pull pull that apart and maybe that's not you know ultimately ultimately maybe at the end of the day he wants to stay a pop artist you know maybe he's kind of making a slight statement here but sort of you know accidentally on your debut single the sort of bridge into hey I'm coming out with a political song you know I'm hitting you with a political song first might not be the best move but still you know I wish the lyrics were more specific because the fact that he doesn't really get into the specifics of what makes him feel this way of kind of what's driving these feelings it does make the song feel kind of redundant and repetitive because he does he repeats himself a lot throughout the track you know it's like okay I get the feeling and I feel it there but what's driving it you know tell it like tell me tell me how you really feel Harry tell me how you really feel and the only other critique I would have for it is that the bridge doesn't really feel like a bridge you know the bridge really kind of just feels like an extension of the chords and the melody that we've already been hearing on the verse and the chorus but just with like some grand background vocals which are very beautiful you know kind of filling out the the space behind Harry and his piano very vibrant very gorgeous again very grand I like the sound that they bring to the mix I just wish the bridge changed it up a little bit you know so more detail in the lyrics make a bridge that's actually a bridge and this would have been like a near-perfect song and again that's not to say that this track falls that short of greatness as it is you know I was again floored by how good this was how entertaining this was of a song how relatable and how emotional and how human of a song this was you know because a lot of artists who kind of reached the the echelon of the top 40 once they kind of hit that spot they're just going as formulaic as possible they're moving through the motion they're just kind of going through the motions they're playing by the numbers and that's it you know I think Harry really kind of took a risk with the song with a track that you know isn't going to kind of just hold your hand through it it does kind of bring some somewhat complicated emotions you know it is very dramatic it is very emotional track it's not coming through as kind of a poppy dance beat or anything like that in a lot of ways it is kind of a sad and a somber song again the emotions kind of complicated not a feel-good track at all but a powerful track and I don't know I'm just kind of hoping that he comes through is the member of One Direction who actually does something mature you know not this fake mature that we see in the case of Zayn where I'm still going to give you the same drivel as far as you know lyrics I'm still going to give you the same drivel as far as instrumentals but it's going to feel mature because now I'm giving you sexy music and I'm you know saying some bad words here and there you know Harry's music feels more mature right off the first single not because he's saying some naughty words or you know talking to you about how much he wants to do little pillow talk no he feels more mature because he's dealing with some seriously adult feelings on this track and I find that interesting and I find that interesting and you know hopefully there's more to come hopefully there's more to come that is as intriguing is what he's presented here it'd just be just could be more detailed you know as far as the lyrics as far as the structure but so far what's here I'm liking it 
6ez_UWgmoh0,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd what up my Epis I'm jumping on here doing a quick review over the weekend to sort of cover an album very quickly that I overlooked and I apologize for overlooking I'm trying to make it up a little bit here with this raw review of course I'm talking about the new jid album the never story JIT being a young up-and-coming Atlanta rapper a new voice on Jay Cole's dreamville label I listened to the record several times when it initially came out I couldn't really get past his voice it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way a little bit but when I saw that my boys on dead and hip hop loving this record I was like okay you know maybe I got maybe I got to give it another shot maybe I got to give it another shot because you know sure Mike was really into it but FIFA was really into it too and sometimes a little I'm a little Mike and sometimes I'm a little fifo and when and when they come together and they're like this this is good when they agree on something like super hard and it's it's hard for me personally to be like okay you know maybe I gotta give it another shot but anyway so now that I've given the album more lessons and if kind of you know sort of had this influence on me from people whose opinions I take very seriously you know case in point why I avoid most reviews Brill actually pretty much all reviews when I'm writing a review myself you know but still I thought these guys made some good points and I kind of came out with my own views on this record after I kind of gave it a bunch more lessons so anyway I have kind of gotten past Jude's voice he does have a very kind of high-pitched voice kind of a bit of a nasally inflection but as they pointed out in their review it does have very much like an Anderson Pak kind of Tambor to a sort of quality to it maybe not so much when he sings maybe he doesn't really kind of have the the the like all the way to 11 charisma and swagger of an Anderson Pak he's not very animated and colorful like an Anderson Pak I would say he has more of a stone-cold charisma to him sort of like a you know a bit of a he has like the tone of like a cold-blooded dude you know not so much like a an Anderson Packer he comes through he's kind of like this very vibrant entertainer not so much that again cold blooded I would actually take it another step further and make a pretty bold comparison to Vince staples as far as the tone of his voice it's very it's very high it's very young it's very yell P um you know which makes me think while you know maybe some elements of his voice don't really vibe with me right now and there are some elements of his voice I do like some of this may be subject to change as he gets older and continues to drop more projects you know could be could not be not entirely sure but I'm just kind of guessing there um so let them kind of past the voice and I do think vocally that there's definitely something here that Kendrick fans can appreciate - I think I've been able to you know dive a bit more deeply into the album and there are certainly some highlights on here some of my favorites being never and division and Ed Edd and Eddy these tracks and many other cuts on the record are produced really creatively I mean if there's one major selling point of this record I think it's the production the beats have elements of contemporary trap they have elements of like some boom bap stuff to some hardcore hip-hop stuff but there's always something kind of weird or experimental about it like the atmosphere may be a little off or there might be some really weird synthesizers worked in there there's always something odd about the production I'm not sure if you know these are elements of the beats that jid is driving himself either the recommendation or you know he's just doing his best to find really eclectic producers but either way you know the consistently even though there's a variety of different beats and sort of hip-hop contemporary hip hop styles on this record the the production is really creative you know he seems to have a deep appreciation of really out there production you know people who love Neptune's type stuff you know like experimental hip-hop of production you know you'll you'll definitely find some stuff to get into here um so uh I guess from there you know I'll definitely compliment JIT on his bars you know he has some some good bars some witty one-liners some decent wordplay what kind of holds me back though from you know really kind of falling in love with a lot of his tracks though is that not too many of them are all that topical I mean he can hop on a track and spit a verse and it'll be a hot verse and what is especially great about his rapping is he's got a great flow not to say that it's super fast or super flashy or anything like that he just knows how to grab a flow that has a really catchy element to it get your head bobbing right away sure the great production helps but his voice really enhances the beat as far as the rhythm of his rapping quite a bit um I will say the love songs on here I do have more lyrical focus than a bulk of the other tracks and the song somebody which was another kind of change of pace on the record because of a sort of a uplifting very bright kind of almost sunny a very positive of track where I think he's you know trying to influence people to be what they want to be go after their goals that sort of thing that's kind of a track on the record that I think like maybe chance the rapper fans could sort of vibe with and that's the thing I feel like jid he in a lot of ways is a little bit of an amalgamation of a lot of his contemporaries and he's a bit of a jack-of-all-trades and I feel like this is sort of a pressure that a lot of hip-hop artists are feeling right now because you can't just be a rapper you've also got to be a singer you've got to be a producer you've got to be this you got to be that you got to be doing everything or at least got to have you know wearing many hats you know your hands and many different pies or however the hell that phrase works I feel like he's kind of giving into that a little bit and not everything he attempts to do on this very scattered album pans out you know I don't think the love songs or the relationship songs on this record are all that great not necessarily because they're badly written or anything like that it's mostly because I think those are the most anonymous and least memorable moments on the record you know he doesn't really bring anything lyrically or even vocally you know he certainly is a decent singer he's not a terrible singer I mean there are a lot of rappers who attempt to sing that I would much rather not sing at all jid certainly can can hold his own as far as singing but uh you know it doesn't really stun me in the way that his flow does when he's rapping I think you know there's certainly potential there if he works on his singing or you know maybe find some more I guess memorable topics to sing about but again not the more memorable moments on not one of the more memorable moments on the record from there it's really kind of a lack of or just kind of some really underwhelming hooks which is another thing it kind of just kind of leaves me hanging dry with the record which isn't necessarily terrible because his rapping is so great you know he can come on a track and just spit verse after verse after verse and it's not really that big of a deal the track with earth gang I love the the chemistry that they're bringing on this track I love that I'm just kind of non-stop here on all these verses all these flows it's really great the energy that they bring but the thing is you know there are some tracks on here that you know you have a you have a track like underwear whose hook is terrible not only because the the entire thing is pinned under a very corny joke that by the third time I heard it on the track I'm just like okay I'm done I'm just done with this track underway underwear haha I got just say underwear yeah I was I was just not feeling that that that joke unfortunately um you know and also the track 8701 I believe real with a that black I believe is how you say that artist name that was just kind of another example to me of a track that just felt like an extended interlude or something you know not really flesh out or structured all that well and there's a lot of tracks out here again that I think could have used some more structure some more hooks to either really kind of justify their length or make them a little bit more memorable or not just kind of leave them feeling like you know again while he is a talented rapper you know just like some some word salad you know I'll make one more comparison before I finish the review out and that is that he reminds me a lot of logic not stylistically but again in the sense that he feels like he's pulling so much from his contemporaries and that's not to say that he's not talented in his own right I think the fact that you know he does remind me of an Anderson Pak he does remind me of event staples is a testament to how talented he is too because because to be rapping on that level even to copy it you have to have talent you know even to come close to it in style you have to have talent but right now it just kind of seems like in terms of his voice in terms of his delivery and also in terms of you know where he takes his records because there's a play on this record where he says kind of in a conversational way rapping he says you know what's your sound and he says nothing in particular and that's very much how this album feels you know it's very unfocused it's nothing really in particular as far as the sound and the style of it it's all over the place and maybe he's just kind of testing out a lot of different things and kind of seeing what sticks and then maybe on his next record going a bit more focused going a bit more topical and going a bit more mature - I would hope because even though there are spots on this thing where he'll spit some ignorant lyrics one line that stuck out to me was a guess I'm talking belligerent head off I'm so ignorant you know while I think there's some truth to that he's not always spitting on that level you know in fact a lot of the time he's not spitting on that level I mean sure he makes a reference to being ignorant but that's not the the the bar that he's really set himself in terms of writing and his flow and making sure that the beats are interesting you know it's really kind of like a more of a self-aware jab himself at that point but the thing is like I feel like he's punching under his weight a little bit on this record there's a lot of raw talent on this thing it's not necessarily channeled 100% well you know but there is a lot of raw talent on this thing and I could see now why so many people are excited by this project maybe not necessarily because of what it is but because of what JIT could become off of this album and I think I'm gonna leave it at that you know I'm not like in love with this thing by any means it's not going to be one of my favorite records of the year but there is certainly enough great ideas and good performances on this thing to leave you remembering this kid's name and sort of curious sort of wondering what he's going to do next time he has a mixtape er an album you know waiting to be launched out through dreamville hopefully again because it would be good for him to continue to get that level of exposure on what he's doing because he's doing some good stuff and I'll leave it there you know let me know down in the comments what you thought of this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and I will catch you guys in the next review you're the best forever 
J8CtI2Xcwqs,hey everybody its Fandango and shuang go here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kodak Black Album painting pictures kodak black as a florida rapper who doesn't who doesn't just paint pictures he picked your paints basically that this is new record which he named after one of the most perplexing lines off his last project little big pock a tape I don't really like I won't go too deeply into why I could waste this entire video talking about why you could just find the review and watch that I will say this though painting pictures is Kodak blacks most well-groomed and produced and recorded album so far to the point where I no longer feel like I'm listening to a bad demo of a guy who can't pronounce words all that well I feel like I'm getting a better picture of who Kodak Black is as an artist where his influences and his reference points lie now that's not to say he's wow me or blowing me away or you know channeling those influences although well I mean they're elements of his style and of his delivery that reminds me of a very seedy young gritty gucci mane but he doesn't have the swagger or the charisma to really pop out of the mix any chance of that is smothered by the release squeaky awkward tone of his voice which is hardest to listen to when he insists on singing on a track or when he slurs his word so hard that he's just mowing over consonants with his vowels and there are other moments on this album where the vulgarity of his lyrics reminds me of little wayne but he doesn't have the ability to write a punch line or a joke and the way that wayne does so his vulgarity doesn't really have a you know a bit of humor at the end of it to kind of soften the blow you know he just kind of says these really raw weird and somewhat gross statements about for example over this album it just kind of lets it hang out there which brings me to a little segment I want to do in this review the worst bars on this Kodak black album this one's good where he says he gets stupid to the point where I guess he's autistic here's one where he says he makes the feel like mac and cheese and a few more other amazing comparisons where he says he gets that  wetter than chicken noodle noodle soup the sounds like ramen noodle soup and the also sounded like Jesus stir up some gumbo damn here's a classic i'm swaggin i got flavor i got sauce called me ragu i love my baby  i'm swaggin i got flavor i got sauce call me ragu i love my baby girl  ball call her caillou this one particular track title reminiscing has a feature from boogie with a hoodie and the kodak drops the line saying got a booger in my nose a boogie on the chorus here is Jim Jimmy Neutron with the rocket actually that line is kind of kind of dope but on the fourth bar of this hook over here Kodak black makes mention of Medicaid but I guess to kind of remind us that the United States the only industrialized nation without a single-payer universal healthcare system come on guys stop up even Kodak black knows this shit's and I do you want to go into the logic of this final line but it's it's a love song where Kodak black says to the the love interest of the track I'm here to stay I love you like you're my kid like you my kid he loves them like they're his kid and by the way I want you to have my kid this person you love them like they're your offspring but then you want to have offspring with with that sadly most of the bars on this record are not as gut-busting ly hilarious we just kind of have a lot of violent druggie hyper sexual gangster isms that you might have heard on other artists records or other Kodak black records and as I think I said my last review I do not doubt Kodak blacks legitimacy I am 100% sure he is with the but in a way he's his own worst advocate because on this album and on his previous projects too he repeatedly says things that would make the average listener take him less seriously I feel almost bad in a way because it just seems like Kodak black blatantly lacks the lyrics and the voice to really express and get across his true grit every once in a while he does Spit a bar and he does make a statement in a line that I think accurately and vividly portrays the very hard upbringing that he had how dark and soul-crushing and how awful his surroundings were when he was young but these moments just kind of feel like you know little flickers little glimmers like little itty bitty flashes in the pan so I mean I'm kind of left just not knowing what exactly the context is in which I would enjoy or I could foresee a Kodak black song or project working I mean I am aware of the fact that he is very popular he does have a lot of fans but there's nothing really about his music that makes me want to listen to it in the forefront of my mind I mean his vocals really kind of turned me off not only that but I can't really dive into his lyrics without either being bored or laughing and in my opinion it doesn't really kind of have the mood of party music it doesn't really have the mood of vibe music we're just kind of merely lays there in the background I mean this is easily his most well produced project yet as I said earlier and the beats are certainly Pleasant they're good on the ears but Kodak blacks voice is just so odd that it just kind of ruins any chance of this being a listen we're just like yeah this is just like you know feel-good vibin I'm just like smoked out I'm just high out of my mind I'm just having a good time I'm just setting the mood type of music his voice is just too clumsy and uneasy to facilitate that feel outside of the better structured songs outside of the better production and the lyrics being more intelligible there aren't too many silver linings to this cloud I mean even the young thug feature on this thing is easily one of the most squawky and terrible young thug features I've ever heard on a project while I can acknowledge that this project is better than most of a kodak black has released in the past if not better than everything he has released in the past it's still not for me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this Kodak black a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comment if you're angry make sure that you continue to be a healthy boy keep on smoking that broccoli and yeah that's going to be at

Ni258ri7U3o,"[Music] hey everyone if any Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another episode of the needle drop podcast my guest mr. Dominic labrum hey down hiding hi are you doing up there people you're in on that mic man I felt like it was in your throat there dude yeah I'm trying to be like MC right boy boy anyway yes the dumb already spoiled at hell I mean even the title of this video spoil that we're going to be talking about Death Grips and kind of trying to give a general overview of the band and give some I guess general sort of entry level observations and explanations what we feel are proper explanations of their appeal their aesthetic their style because I get so many questions every month and this happens especially around a time when Death Grips has a release out or around the corner Anthony what's the point of Death Grips I can't get into Death Grips how do you listen to Death Grips why does this sound like this why does that sound like that we're going to try to get into all of that as deeply as we can here and just kind of get give a bit of a primer here and I think I just get these questions so often because not only have I covered a bulk of what these guys have released over the years but also I'm not sure if there's another website out there that has reviewed them as positively as I have or at least you know to the to the tune of the many views that I've received over the years as a result of my Death Grips a review so in a way some people like look at me like I I know them personally or if I'm like in on the gag or if I like I'm fully aware you know in full understanding of every single thing that they're doing or like I'm their official fucking spokesman or something and it's just not the case you know truth be told domina you know we're super fans of the group uh but you know that that's that's not to say that that means we know everything we're just going to try to deliver unto you what we feel is probably just the best explanation for Death Grips and and try to advocate for them a little bit too and explain why you know they are a group that maybe you've listened to them before and they haven't really clicked with you maybe sort of go into their music again with a different mindset or at least kind of try to appreciate where they're coming from even if you don't love their records at the end of the day because lord knows I'm not here trying to force albums down your throat I'm not telling you what you should listen to I'm not telling you what you'd like but all that being said let's just get straight into the conversation with kind of the question of the idea dum tell me in you know general terms what you feel is the appeal of Death Grips you know what makes them appeal as a music earth to you hmm actually one controversial thing first sure okay right out of the gate do it yes all right there's this thing going on especially in this internet era where in where people feel like they need to like things sometimes maybe with the guy we're talking to all of his friends like set like Death Grips and he doesn't you don't have to like these guys that's that they don't force it you mean like you should have the force they like I feel like you either I think there are ways I will talk to you guys about ways to sort of take Death Grips into your heart much like Christ but like uh if you don't feel it and you're like bleeding from the ears and you're stabbing yourself in the head trying to get like maybe should just take a little break okay but but here's the thing I think what I love most about these guys is I'll liken them to uh when you talk about visual art in the digress for just a quick second this this will this will work though we talk about visual art which is a field that I'm in there stuff that is very sort of concrete and traditional painting a portrait of someone you know what a man looks like you know what a portrait of a man looks like stuff that weird stuff happened in what we call modern art in the 50s I love a lot people making rear desks are to the point where now you can do whatever kind of weird paintings you want and maybe you guys have seen weird shit in museums before you're like oh what the fuck is that that what death-grip says to me Death Grips is to me is like looking at what's traditional and basically kicking that shit in the dick and pushing into the trash you're still in the same realm it's obviously still music but these guys are extremely experimental they are basically to need the spirit of pushing oneself to try and create something new that is also at like trying to stay super catchy and stuff that's recognizable but make it new and somewhat abrasive it it's challenging it's challenging to me while also being enjoyable at best at worst I mean some of the stuff I can't listen to it's too Yeley and it's I feel like it's pushing me away but I still accept it before I sort of answer your point there give me a quick example of like some of the stuff in Death Grips discography that you feel like just takes it too far ah a really good question I mean like these are the songs that I skip alright people are going to hate me for this I think there were um you know what ah shit shit this is a really tough one I think like hothead this hothead take it too far you know what the yes the departure you Baba bah bah blah blah yes yes perfect example yes yeah okay face one just wanted to get an example out there you know so okay I fully agree with you on a lot of what you just kind of assess there one thing that I definitely want to kind of tease out a little bit is the fact that yes there are blatantly experimental and left-field things and abrasive things happening in Death Grips music but also like you noted you know there are really clear catchy song structures there you know Death Grips are very much a slave to the chorus you know what I mean like there are too many tracks in their discography that don't have like a strong hook you know or at least try to completely avoid that formula you know there are tracks of theirs or maybe a hook Falls kind of flat a lot of their tracks at least try to have a hook so you know when you go into Death Grips please you know don't think of them as like the most experimental thing under the Sun it's so whacked out and it's so inaccessible you know you could be listening to avant-garde minimalist drones of like you know weird repurposed field recordings pitch down to like sub base level frequencies like complement with like really weird free improvisation heart playing or something you know there's some sexy yeah there's plenty of like completely whacked-out music that absolutely has no concern whatsoever with like appealing to people or being even the slightest bit accessible Death Grips for as abrasive and is in-your-face and as nihilistic and as Dom said the that kind of attitude you get off of them that they're pushing you away you know please understand that underneath that you know there is like some sort of attention paid song structure you know there's an appreciation of verses and choruses and builds and tension you know so it's not like they're the most wacked-out group in the world so uh you know and and and that's sort of one of the appeals of Death Grips for me because you know there is wildly original and experimental music out there that sounds like nothing else you've ever heard but the thing is it's gone so far out into the weed so far out into the marsh that it's like there's no reference point for anything and it just doesn't really sound all that listenable and you know even for me like I could listen to it but I probably would not enjoy it even if I did enjoy it sort of in the way that I would traditionally a pop song or something like that you know and that's the thing you know Death Grips while they are super aggressive and I do get some emotional vibes off of them that I don't get off of many other artists there are some lyrical messages I get from them that I don't get off many other artists in a lot of ways I still do enjoy their music in the way that I do a pop song or a rock song with verse a chorus and a verse yeah yeah today and and that's what I think is you know something that's even harder to do then making something that is just kind of groomed for being in the top 40 or something that's so whacked out that it doesn't sound like anything you've ever heard you know Death Grips is sort of performing really well in fact in my opinion this balancing act of coming off wildly experimental to the point where it's disorienting and you don't sort of see these reference points from the start where it's like okay they're clearly influenced by this person and this person and you know clearly they're writing these well-structured songs you know the fact that there is structure and accessibility there their sound and their style and a lot of things about them just kind of throws you off of that trail and it just kind of leads you to believe that you know you're listening something way weirder than you actually are and you know there are a lot of groups that sort of do that in my opinion Animal Collective is definitely one I love you know their group that like Death Grips they do this amazing again I'll say balancing act of sort of mixing the accessible with the experimental you know they sort of take these weird wild totally whacked out ideas and they fit them very snugly and very effectively into these kind of predetermined and tried and true kind of fundamentals of songwriting and and that's kind of hard to do it's kind of hard to knowingly as an artist apply yourself and what you're trying to do as something that has been done thousands and thousands and thousands of others over and then somehow make it sound new and make it sound fresh and make it sound interesting again you know right I think this one thing that we're sort of honing in on is that these guys do deserve a lot of respect so if you look at these guys and you just see this album with a dick on it yes it's an album with a dick on it but yeah don't don't be intimidated and like don't try not like they are really experimental to me and like they're doing a lot of new crazy things but also just realize that these are these are musicians like really talented musicians who deserve so don't don't go into it like taking it lightly it's sort of like if you like wow how would you say they should like they should approach the music it's like should they be uh what should they be expecting you know I think you should expect something that is super angry I mean potently angry enraged something that is brittle distorted something that is really aggressive it's in your face and yet it's not going to come to you as far as like giving you the answers to why you should understand it or why you should like it you have to kind of come to it and you sort of come up with your own sort of you know answers come up with your own reasons what makes Death Grips such an appealing group it's not just going to you know for as in-your-face as they are it's not just going to bop you over the head you know it's it's funny because even though they are this group that is really so raw and really so angry and just kind of like unadulterated unfiltered in terms of like their emotions in terms of their feelings there's a really strong element of mystery to the band that that they continue to maintain on purpose you know because the thing is like it not only is that rage factor there and I think that rage factor is really important but I think also there's kind of an element of confusion that they want to be present as well I think to to fully understand Death Grips would be to almost in a way destroy your enjoyment of Death Grips because I think I think the least you wonder I think the less you understand the less you really know about them the better off you are because I think I'm you know there are a lot of elements of the bands lyrics that deal in internet culture and right I think anonymity is a big part of that you know kind of this like this kind of shadowy quality to it the fact of the Internet some some levels of it being like the wild wild west you know the fact that they named one of their records no love deep web all right I think is evidence of them kind of taking influence of that influence from that from something as like you know as kind of wicked and as as you know as seedy as the Deep Web you know that they're they're trying to find the dark sort of underbelly of internet culture and I think they found it you know I think they've hit upon it I think they've um and in some ways I think I'm kind of fostered it a little bit too with the art that they're making I think a lot of artists unfortunately kind of avoid the internet you know or kind of avoid overtly referencing the internet or Internet culture or social media merger in their music because they just kind of see it as really alien or inauthentic or really fake or is just like not really having anything you know real about it whereas I think Death Grips you know with not only an imagery in their music and in the lyrics with the album titling like I just told you but also the visuals that show up in their music videos the fact that they have interacted with fans on you know in really weird out there ways on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook and you know also a message board sites such as 4chan I don't know if they've done any reddit stuff you know maybe some redditors believe that I know there's a healthy Death Grips community on reddit but I don't know the full extent of any stuff that they've done on reddit the fact that kind of embraced these internet communities and sort of you know found kindred spirits there and if kind of like you know created art that reflects and kind of depicts the world the way that a lot of these people in these internet communities kind of see it I think I think says something you know because they definitely hit upon something that I think a lot of other artists out there don't see or a lot of artists out there just don't want to touch because they don't know how to make sense of it you know they'd rather write a song about their girlfriend leaving them or something which I guess you know just on a quick tangent I guess yeah the deafness doesn't really talk that much about people leaving it's usually like like get the fuck away from me woman it's like I fucked you now get the hell out of you're kind of kind of thing where it's like I don't care about you you can go that type of thing not like lamenting things that were lost but in terms of in terms of describing the Internet and what it feels like to be on the internet I think you're right these guys are really on the forefront of that it's almost like if you wanted if you were just separate from American or modern culture completely and you were like I want to know how artists musically describe the the Vietnam War or something like that you you would be like okay Marvin Gaye check this out so this is sort of like a musical expression of that feeling of being in in a Vietnam being in a culture being in that exactly exactly so now I think that's something that you really hit on that it's it speaks to the internet kids and I think it speaks to me because like they're they're describing I think what it feels like to be on the Internet at 1:00 a.m. going to places you shouldn't be I've seen footage you know like live like you're looking at shit of people's heads blowing up I don't I don't like seeing that shit but I've seen footage it sounds like you're scrolling you're scrolling through the internet like consuming shit you shouldn't be doing but you're just you're doing you're doing you're going over and over again it's a yeah it's directly about that right right it's a great musical expression of those weird feelings of being an Internet person also another thing about Death Grips kind of making music for the Internet age music that reflects the Internet age there's a lot in their music about privacy about paranoia about being spying on about being watched and that's certainly a topic that I think needs to be thought of addressed and just be conscious of in an age of NSA spying and data mining and gathering and you know all of our phone calls being collected you know to be stored and some kind of a you know multibillion-dollar server and the Midwest somewhere you know these are things that a lot of other artists aren't really touching on you know what I mean and and these are things that I think that a lot of people probably you know we hear about them and we think we should take them seriously but maybe we don't because I think this internet stuff this internet privacy stuff it's all so new to us that I feel like once it's gone or once things have changed for the worse in a really permanent way it won't be until then that we've really kind of realized what we lost and I feel like in some ways Death Grips is sort of like the canary in the coal mine in that sense you know they're kind of like making this statement that you know once you kind of get beyond the aggression and get beyond you know a lot of the weird standoffish sort of vibes that their music overtly puts out it's almost like counterintuitive that they'd be making this kind of like almost in a way a political and a social statement but then simultaneously like you know creating a sound that purposefully makes people not to not want to listen to it or sort of more rather dares people to listen to it you know and the thing about Death Grips that sort of makes them stand out to me especial at least in this day and age I feel like with just how volatile the music industry is right now you don't see as many groups as you used to who have that kind of attitude you know usually most groups that you run across these days are super accessible in terms of their attitude very warm very friendly very approachable hey guys just me I'm just you know just a regular guy you know in Death Grips in a lot of ways they sort of have the pageantry of a rock star of the 90s the 80s or the 70s you know it's just they're kind of doing it in this weird whacked-out industrial you know Internet age aesthetic you know it's community we repurposed yeah they actually don't give a fuck you know you get that vibe from how they handle themselves you know there are a lot of artists out there that you get that vibe off of armed these days you know and you know there's maybe just a couple that I could think of um you know like nails would probably be one you know I I don't know what it is exactly that fuels that that sort of quality about Death Grips music I mean in the case of some groups that I do know today that have that a sort of attitude about them what I know is that they probably have something else going on for themselves to like you know their music is really just like it's it's kind of their their hobby it's not so much their day job so you know they can afford to be like hey you know seriously like we're not joking fuck everything everything every everything needs to burn down now I don't I don't know if everybody in Death Grips you know if they just made some good investments in the housing market or something and now they're just like sitting on like millions of dollars in the bank and they're just like haleyss which is the most fucked up shit we ever could and that that's just a joke I don't think that that's probably your case right but uh you know they just have an attitude about them that used to be present in rock music you know used to be present in underground music like throughout it was almost like a rule you know as a baseline and now I feel like with the indie era that's kind of melted away and the closest thing you can get to that these days is just kind of what's going on in in the rap community you know or entrap music right now you know like there are plenty of artists they're kind of don't give that you know don't don't give a fuck at all and in a lot of ways I think that's kind of what has created this sea change from from rock music - hip hop because I think rock music no longer kind of carries that I don't give a fuck rebellious services beer as much as it used to I think I think rap music actually represent represents it better then then rock currently does in a lot of ways you know and it's funny that Death Grips I think brings it in in in in so much potency that really there's nobody else competing with them and in a lot of ways they're kind of a a hybrid a blend of well not only rock and rap but a bunch of other things too yeah and I think there it really seems like they're keeping their clock card so close to their chest like not doing interviews not coming out and talking to people not saying who their influences are being interested in talking about that sort of thing I think that's what makes them so fresh and they're they're sort of pushing away all this idea that they should be like anyone else is it's part of the mystique it's part of what makes you what makes them sound so different all of it like even the way even though the writing the lyrics are just it's it sounds like the thoughts you have in your head before you go to sleep it's a bunch of stuff it's like brain shit but it rhymes sometimes it arrives with its but it's to me it's it's beautiful the imagery in these lyrics but it's very unique and and strange something that you just kind of mentioned there is that that I would love to go off of and and this has you know this this is going out directly to the people who you know just kind of sit there and maybe you've listened to a few Death Grips songs maybe an entire Death Grips project and are just kind of like still like I don't get it you know like I don't I don't see the point of this you know you said that some of the lyrics that you read or you know hear directly in a death grip song like you think oh this is like crazy shit that you think in your head I mean there are certainly some people who who don't think these things both probably probably live probably live they're very and you know listen when you said that like I was nodding my head because like you know sometimes I like thought crazy things and like holy shit this is just like this is just like some really fucking crazy wacked action that that dribbles around in my head when I'm 3 a.m. and I should be going to sleep or you know I can't sleep or you know like I've just seen some crazy shit on the internet or something like that sure you know but surely there are some people who they don't think these things and they will most likely see their grave without ever having thought any of these things that's okay I guess what I'm saying is you know is the craziness that you see in Death Grips music and their live performances in their music videos do you have to have some of that craziness in you personally yeah and and do you have to have that in order to enjoy Death Grips is that the price of admission you know or can you you know because I feel like I feel if I put I feel like even if I I think I think that's a good metaphor for it right yeah I'm great I think um because I think even if you do so happen to be like this clean-cut accountant dude who you know has a really strict bedtime and uh you know I spent nine PM yeah you know whatever like you know who just leads this very clean-cut life like if you hunt if you somehow stumbled upon Death Grips music and I don't know it did appeal to you like even if you didn't kind of have that fire in you before like I think it would kind of ignite that fire in you if you didn't have it before so still even at that point like even if you do kind of consider yourself a very clean-cut person who leads a very normal life and thinks normal happy thoughts you know Death Grips might like kind of you know change that in a way so again you know my question is is is that the price of admission do you think you know sort of having those crazy thoughts like do you have a little bit of Death Grips in you before you actually enjoy Death Grips I think so I think so that's that's what my gut tells me but on the other hand there's a there's a thing there's like uh like codependency like this this idea that like you you're in a relationship with a girl like you really love this girl you're you have this crush on this this weird goth chick who cuts herself and you think she's so cute and she keeps pushing you away and her name is Evelyn I'm joking no but like you you want to be with this girl but she keeps pushing you away you're like well why why don't she like me what I think that person is also a little crazy - he's not having the crazy thought she having but they are attracted to the craziness I think there are a lot of normals out there a lot of people who don't have these Scots who just did they see the flame and they're like I could never create the flame but I'm I'm drawn to it they sort of maybe they even wish they could do that hmm you know I think I'm you know I love your I love your analogy back with the goth chick however you ever yeah which I mean I don't think that I don't think that's the individual experience of every Death Grips fan or sort of you know what Death Grips fans you know I don't think you did I don't think you could apply that to Death Grips pans across the board but I think if you sort of talk about Death Grips fans as a collective is like a kind of a conscious collective on the Internet that that's very much how the relationship is because you know you see all the time right fans are you know on various social media sites and they're desperate to like piece together the fucking Death Grips Da Vinci Code yeah the gameplay world oh you play you come you be more like what does this mean what does this mean what does this mean I feel like I'm on the verge of getting it her sort of like fully understanding like all this fucked-up shit that you guys do and say and you know all this cryptic all these cryptic things that you're kind of putting together like you know and each way Death Grips is just like pushing them back and pushing them back and pushing them back and I mean there was even that one song on their latest record where they were making a reference to that tweet on their Twitter account where they said it won't lit and every you know and we read those lyrics when we did that video together sort of reading all the lyrics to the to the album and now that you know I've had time to kind of digest the record it was kind of obvious that the band was making a statement about like hey we do these crazy things there's not necessarily any kind of deep moon or anything behind it but yet every single time we just kind of put out some kind of cryptic message or whatever like it's instant reaction of like what is this like explain this now and it's it's so funny because like I feel like while that sort of drive to know and that drive to understand is you know there are so many things I could say about it I feel like there's kind of maybe a heightened obsession with it because so many groups are willing to be as cryptic as Death Grips now you know whereas before that kind of mystery that sort of you know Rockstar mystique used to be the standard it used to be the norm you know you guys you had guys like David Bowie parading out onto the stage and putting out records and almost every other record he put out he'd reinvent himself into a new character or new vision or a new personality you know like who's really the man behind the mask you know what I mean and you know still to this day you know you have guys who people are equally obsessed with like MF DOOM you know who for a long time this is kind of lid you know behind the mask and and led this very kind of low-key life outside of his musical persona Death Grips I think also kind of feeds into that and you know in some really new and refreshing ways and you know I find it funny that you know the fans love them so much and they're just dying to know like the ins and outs of every single thing that they do and say you know clearly you're in love with the group but it's it's somehow slit by you that maybe getting everything and having it all explained to you we're just wreck it yeah part of it is a self flagellation it's part of it is like we're torturing ourselves trying to piece together when jenni death is going to happen you know from like piecing together numbers of like the length of the album and then minutes like that's that's a part of it it's like that is the admission you you enter this cult of people where it's like varying degrees of I'm not the guy who's counting the numbers of jenni death I'm not that guy but yeah even Jenni death when I mean like Fashion Week I mean like these guys are fully aware of the fact that we're like like if you if you walk through the Death Grips fear I think guys are just like combing combing these layers combing the ground looking for stuff it's like just give us anything a bit like archaeologists yeah and and to anybody who again has new to Death Grips this is certainly a trend this is certainly um you know a sort of reaction that that DOM and I and probably other deaths occur fans as well have had sort of observed in the community of people who enjoy their music but it's not a requirement you know so it's like right exactly for you people who are kind of just dipping your toes into this stuff um don't feel that you know the moment you're into the band and it clicks you're just going to be like Jenni death when you know not not not just because Jenni death has already come out but you know I think you can kind of just like it you know in a grander sense sort of understand and you know just casually enjoy the group's music without kind of getting involved in the online community mayhem to take it more back to a to a musical point and you know less of kind of the abstracts that we've been talking about and then we can get back into more of those later what do you feel having having listened to you know God how many how many solid projects at Death Grips dropped at this point I mean you have ex-military the money store no love deep web the art economy I love use well I was I was going to say part 1 and part 2 of the powers-that-be and you know the early EP that they came out with a you know fashion week the new kind of double EP that they put out the interview 2016 or whatever it was and you know finally the power finally the new record bottomless pit what out of all these projects would you say would work for you know an introduction to the the band you know like what what is the best intro project in your opinion tried-and-true man money store it's the money store that's it I mean like it's got the most bangers per capita on that shit dude like I really judge these albums based on how many songs on there that I feel like I think every every death Chris project has Titans on it it's like um more powerful than a single even like that the idea like some of these songs on these albums it'll like each album has about three of them I got average but the money story I think has like five or six maybe seven which are really really strong and I um in terms of it like you were saying it's it's good the hook the two Coreys that just blast your brain open that's what the money store has I think no I I do agree with you that I do think the money store has the most bangers for your buck you know I I guess it sorta died I would recommend three projects depending on how you're feeling you know depending on some of my descriptions here I mean I think ex-military their original mixtape is certainly a good introduction because I think that that's probably the project where Death Grips most boldly where their influences on their sleeve so I think for somebody who might listen to a record like the Money Store and know loved Deep Web and have no idea where any of this came from have no idea but like it's you know it sounds like it's from another world it might be easier to sort of digest ex-military because you know sort of the rock and punk and hip hop influences I think are a little more bold and a little more apparent on that record um you know if you're willing to sort of take the deep dive um you know I would just go straight into the money store like Dom said and if you know the fact the band is kind of you know out there and super experimental on that record doesn't bother you then you know you're going to hear tracks like get got and the fever and fucking Punk weight and system blower and I've seen huge and you know bitch please a track that I remember like it's pretty funny like I feel differently about that album depending on when like what year it is you know would like to shame recently that's been one of my favorite tracks on the record bitch please whereas like originally it was one of my least favorites like I always thought like the whole refrain of bitch please you must be smokin rocks woozi is like that's so so clean but then it's like I kind of like I kind of like the bluntness of it and just kinda like it's it's the equivalent of just like just jamming your hand down your pants and just grabbing your dick and just like wiggling it in front of everybody to see but but part of that track that really kind of that kind of like won me over and maybe just like really kind of with it again or you know really probably more than I ever have is the moment when you kind of hear that sense of descending in the track and like you and MC Wright is like I'm that darkness creeping through your system like that whip snapping every bitch into position it's that moment that not only won me over on the track but that's like such a mission statement for Death Grips like that that one lyric mmm-hmm the idea that you know there's sort of this infection this virus this darkness that like you can't get rid of it's either in your system and drunk like the internet you know your personal system your emotional justum or you know kind of like the system out there the weather view the social system or like internet system or something like that it's just kind of there it's lurking it's in the shadows but also it's you know it's a whip it's you know something that commands attention it's something that dominates people it's something that makes people do things that the control it's a tool of control all right all right right in the hacker after the so oh yeah absolutely which is one my favorite death-grip songs hands fucking down and in my opinion probably the best closing track of any Death Grips album artificial death in the West dude dude I love how chilling that track is I love that tracks I love that track it's it's no other Death Grips track sounds like that song yeah I saw also no other Death Grips track sounds like hacker mm-hm yeah I guess the reason I love hacker is is not only it's so unique with its dance beat I love how intelligible and sort of direct and straightforward ride is on that track like his lyrics are really upfront in your face and you know that they're not obscured by the yelling or screaming or any weird effects or anything and I just love that on that track in a lot of ways I think they kind of Lampoon sort of how overwhelming and sort of I guess kind of a oversaturated kind of internet culture is I think that was definitely there their first biggest statement on that topic I mean obviously they kind of talked about that again on the track trash on their latest record um but you know to me that was kind of like their first weird statement on that you know it was also kind of like a statement on I think kind of like he says in the track being the freak you want to see and obviously with the title of the track hacker I mean they're making a reference to internet culture and internet subculture they're you know because again like in the Internet age like people who are hackers like people who sort of you know do experimental and do like black-market things with this thing that we know is the Internet like those people are the new like you know outlaws you know what I mean and I think Death Grips is kind of like you know more conscious of that and more directly addressing that facet of our subculture that than any other artist is right now but you know I will give you artificial death it's a great track and and finally I guess I would recommend their new record bottomless pit you know for a first-time intro if you're interested really do that yeah because to me that record is it's also got loads of bangers on it it's the wreck it's the only other album in their discography that reminds me as much as of the money store you know it's probably the most similar to the money store of any other track in their discography of any other record in their discography and I think it's there I think it's their best recorded album because I would love to hear your opinion on this thing that I'm about to say controversial opinion here guys okay Death Grips for as much as I love them I feel like in some ways they kind of fall to the trap they fall into the trappings of a lot of groups who I've seen over the years in in the extreme music world in that I feel like even though I can still to this day say that I do think the money stores kind of like their their crown jewel record I do think it's a you know still think it's a tenant and saluton you know there are elements of their subsequent records that I do enjoy a little bit more than the money store because I feel like as Death Grips progressed they honed their recording abilities better and they found new ways to work different details into their music make their music louder heavier more extreme more abrasive and in in a way I feel like their older records are kind of like a victim of that progress in a way because whatever whatever the newest staff groups record is that's the hardest heaviest fucking most mind-blowing record that they had out because it's just because they're always trying to find more way to add just like a little bit more volume to it when they wait to it a little bit more girth to it they're always finding new ways just make it a tad more extreme and you know and for a while as a result of that when I would go back and listen to the money store as much as I could just like you know look at my review and just feel like yeah I pretty much agree with all that you know I still wasn't getting the same kind of um performant because I was like this isn't the this is the heaviest thing the band is done you know they've done heavier shit now it's almost like you're on a harder drug now exactly and and that's another thing about it you know I kind of feel like the extremity that the band brings to the table it does have an addictive quality to it you know and I feel like if you do go into Death Grips you know not that I think you need to be some kind of expert in punk or expert in metal or expert in grindcore or whatever but I feel like you at least have you you at least have to have some kind of appreciation for like music that's loud and heavy and aggressive you know I mean a lot of people who I am around who are maybe older older than me and you know they may hear me playing some Death Grips or something you know sometimes that their first reaction is like is this is this metal is this like metal is this like metal music I'm listening to or is this like punk or something and you know and the reason they make that comparison is because that that's the only other genre of music that they could think of that sounds this angry you know what I mean and I feel like if you if you can't at least enjoy your vibe with or appreciate music that has come out with that is that has come out over the past several decades that kind of brings that same attitude it's going to be hard getting into Death Grips for sure it's going to be an uphill battle yeah but it was for real I had to come out and say that I'm really not into death metal and I mean I've I'm trying to sort of understand that stuff a little more but like really abrasive sounds like hard punk hard rock all that sort of stuff like um I'm it's honestly hard for me to listen to usually but like Death Grips won me over so I am I am sort of in that in that group of people who had to kind of have an uphill battle it wasn't Death Grips didn't hit me hard like the first time it took a while it took a while for me it was slow I mean when I first heard ex-military I didn't know what to make of it either like I thought it was kind of I thought it was kind of ridiculous I remember posting I remember posting like in April of that year when they dropped the mixtape on the website saying like hey check out this mixtape it's kind of interesting it I'm not completely sure if I'm into it yet you know it is like it is or it is really odd to me you know and like I said the first few tracks that I heard like off their debut EP I I thought were laughable or just like you know like really really weird you know just just like like really weird dumb failed idea that like should know sort of explore it again but uh but yeah you were saying you're you you've had trouble sort of getting into Death Grips of like I got into that process take you like when when exactly did it click and how much effort did you put in there like listening to their music you know and and once you had decided that you didn't like it like what made you go back and listen to it that's a great question you would it was guillotined was the one guillotine was the first song I heard by them I got into them through you way back just hearing that you how much you loved him and I was like what that was this shit I listened to guillotine the first time and seeing is weird dude MC rider with a seat belt on the video I was like this is weird shit I think it was maybe five six months before I listen to guillotine again and then I was like holy shit like I was bobbing my head and I was like I was moving like him and this is something I find I do now I mean like having seen him live and do all that stuff like I find that in a weird way mimicking his movement sort of makes me enjoy it more and like that was part of its like after that I've listened to guillotine listen to ex-military and then like I was like Oh be shy and I remember double helix double helix made me um really get into them and then get guy and like from that it was done okay so basically you just kind of saw people in your circle whether it be your personal circle or the circle of sort of outlets and sort of online media that you consume yeah like sort of circling the wagons around Death Grips and you were like and maybe there's more than maybe there's something more to it than I thought originally she yet but I rejected guillotine remember like I rejected it and then it just it was in my head one day I was like what to put that dude in the car with that weird video I was watching it was it wasn't the sound of it that was in your head or was just the visual of him in the car that was in your head whoa both cuz I mean for me like visuals are important visuals are all worked into why I like why I like music and like like the imagery that Death Grips conjures for me is it's all a part of it so like the gritty like pixelated nature that video like it it honestly it helped me understand them more I'm even like and all the visuals are there songs I think these guys are visually brilliant like the eye I can we call it branding and the style and um that they they sort of attach to their their name all their work all of it is beautiful to me and I love it visually like even if the music wasn't present I love the visuals of all their projects okay I mean I have other things I want to get to in this conversation but since you just kind of brought it up let's talk about visuals for a little bit you know I don't think we can get to all of it in this podcast it seems like Death Grips really approaches their music videos differently depending on what album that they've put out you know it kind of means like they almost have a different visual concept with each album and object that they release and but but we've kind of already talked about maybe lyrically and a little bit musically what makes them a special group what visually sort of makes them stand out more than any other group or just make them a special group in your opinion in sort of this contemporary age they are so brave visually and I'm this is my realm I'm talking about like making visual art like if if you have one side of the spectrum where people are making photorealistic shitty art that looks like everything else you've seen on Instagram these guys are there as abrasive as they are with our music they are trying to make stuff that no one is made before and sure enough I mean if you watch their videos I mean like even even on GP something simple like that it's like no one's doing stuff like that it's like very very much like toned down just like it is what it is to a supply can animate sensation like that music video it's insane like this stuff for the dad really like these guys are really a digital artist so they're they're taking a lot of risks that's what I that's what I think is the best thing about them because because as much as I love all their visuals some of it doesn't work and some of it is just I think it falls a little flat but that's but that's a part of the risk you guys are taking risks because I mean what's that video where they were just cleaning up all the the packing peanuts or whatever the I think of a sand alright and their sand off out of a bead bag off of land like a hotel room yeah so I mean their visuals I think they take so many risk and I think when it works it's just above and beyond which is most of the time and whenever that one video from the the intro to government plates you know I he loves you for your pillbox a turd also we're inside when it's just MC ride crying and laughing Serena yeah I'm exactly that into the camera and I mean some of it can consume kind of silly but I fully fully respect what these guys are trying to do visually changing things up every time and working hard to create stuff that you've never seen before because even if it's flat and you think it doesn't work you haven't seen this ship before yeah I mean I think visually a lot of what they do is very much in line with what you know they're sort of doing lyrically and sonically - I think they're sort of taking just a lot of this modern Internet technology and culture and you know to me like the the visual setup of a video like guillotine in my opinion it is a lot like you know like the the visual is it - um like what you would see as far as like the blueprint of it of like maybe somebody shooting a GoPro vlog in their car while they're driving or something you know I mean but instead of about it but instead of like that kind of familiar content being there instead you're getting like a really weird filter on it so you're just kind of seeing them static in the background like TV static or something and then this dude just like yelling with all these weird jump cut like jump cuts in the seat of the car with with his belt oh yeah you know probably one Death Grips video that sticks out to me the most it's a couple that were released in the money store era the one that was shot entirely on the rear view rear view camera of the car yeah that's double helix yeah yeah a double really like something it wasn't free ideas or some Prius I might be wrong but is it good yeah whatever so yes the entirety of this music video got a shot on the rear view camera of a car and it's parked by a road and ride the the band's frontman is just thrusting into the camera he's screaming into the camera saying the lyrics are in the camera their various points of the day where the video was shot so some of the footage is during the day some of its at night um they just kind of this really these have all these really weird strange cryptic and completely fucked like DIY concepts that I could other artists wouldn't do because they're just too self-conscious that it would make them look dumb or they just don't really have that I don't give a attitude and not that not giving a fuck is you know some kind of like gold standard for how you should conduct yourself or however you should be as an artist you know that's I mean you know that's not necessarily the case you know a lot of great artists out there who you know are somewhat self-conscious and wouldn't do what Death Grips does but you know if you're looking for an artist to is really just like you know doing it without a safety net like Death Grips is it you know like the the like leg Dom said you know they do things and sometimes it just like falls flat on its face you know but sometimes sort of like in the case of government plates I mean I didn't really love that album it's one of my least favorites in there here I mean the fact that they kind of attached every song to a weird gif or just kind of like cyclical visual on their YouTube channel I thought was really really interesting you know I thought that that you know was potentially a statement on the way that they made the music itself and just kind of like you know just a bit of an interesting statement on just sort of the visual era of their music at that time I guess I also loved that other music video that they did shortly after I think they cancelled one of their tours and a lot of their fans are really pissed off the one where they clearly like threw a GoPro in a dryer with about fatigue I think that's hustle yeah yeah it was hustle bones so like a GoPro in a dryer with a bunch of weed and money and like this we get a forty years like forget a forty yeah he's like he's like do you drink it afford your just a beer and and it yeah it's a you know it's just this it's just so amazingly raw and you know I mean a lot of it comes down to the fact that I think ride is such an intriguing presence you know you you couldn't pull these music videos off with some kind of sort of standoffish like my hands are in my pockets I don't want to look him directly in the eye kind of dude you know what I mean um you know because the thing is like rot ride is like the the way he engages with the camera in a music video the way he looks into the camera in the music video is like the way that like a Doberman looks at you before they're about to kill you you know like the way that he looked under the camera he looks into the camera like he's an attack dog or something you know orissa really he's just like a madman who's like about to go on a killing spree you know not not everybody could pull that off and you know you can't you can't exactly go into a music video like that you can't exactly go at the camera like that unless you're ready to bring that attitude but much you're ready to bring that performance like 5,000 percent you know I think it works I think I think they wear it or he specifically wears it on his sleeve up his sleeves if he wears it up in front and it's like that risk that crying in front of the camera that ability to just say this is fucking me right now I don't give a fuck what you think about it it shows through and when you watch them you'll feel that energy whether or not you whether or not you like it you'll feel it Oh most definitely and what is that music video there's I think it came out and it was attached to a track off of um uh off of no love deep web where it's sort of like they're in a performance space and as they're performing that like Zach Hills drum sets pretty much being dismantled and then every once in a while like this text files up out of the screen that says I used to give a fuck a thousand percent oh that's definitely um just definitely cook and always what's this home that goes chaos madness some in my brain make my blood flow big might make my blood flow so you may or may not gather which I think it's I think it's no love I think it's just no love it might be I know I know that I think it's um I think it's world of dogs that might have been the music video that they shot it South by Southwest that I'm in the music video for that for like a strict second because they sort of shot the music video on these visors that they were wearing during the performance and they kind of obscured the video so it's like you know really weird and being psychedelic and you sort of see the faces of the crowd like you know in weird sort of disorienting shots and that's another thing you know it's not always just about you know rides presence on the camera you know sometimes they do sort of find a way to even though the footage that they shoot for a music video might not be like anywhere near professional grade like when they go and they edit that stuff and they put it in post like refine some really interesting creative ways to manipulate it so that it's it's like nothing you've ever seen I mean it's really proof that like like the best artists you can give them a big pen and they're going to blow your balls off the Death Grips embodies this I mean like you can give them a cellphone and they'll make some shit that's better than like a million dollar music video to me they'll get on that cellphone it's a way to shoot videos they'll find some crazy apps online where you can make music with them and they'll put a little make a whole fuckin album on that phone you know like and that's the thing it's like you you give them like in that and that's the thing that they just kind of in a lot of ways and and I'm not an expert on their process or anything and they certainly wouldn't want anyone to be because it seems like they try to you know kick as many people off the trail as they can you know not let kind of people know and you know fully understand how exactly they go about creating the music but there is certainly a DIY kind of aesthetic to it you know there's certainly a rawness to it that I think you know a lot of artists in the internet age a lot of artists who are clearly creating music on programs like logic or you know like kind of these you know all in one sort of digital audio workstation programs you know a lot of people working in that in that field kind of creating music through that they're usually creating something either kind of sterile or kind of poppy or you know really accessible it definitely doesn't come off as like wild and is uncontrolled as Death Grips music does like even though it's clearly made on a fucking computer like it doesn't have it doesn't have that sterile kind of quality a lot of computer music does you know it sounds wild and free and in the moment like a rock band does even though you know they're clearly not a rock band and these albums aren't just being you know uh at least every single little detail of them aren't being recorded like you know in one take and sort of like some kind of live performance format yeah I to that point I briefly wanted to mention I think fashion week is not you overlooked I think the instrumentals in that album are great and it's also I mean in some ways for the uninitiated fashion week is a really cool album to listen to just so you know that these guys they they aren't coming out of nowhere like I'm gonna match my hat like they they know how to make a song they know how to make like like a few guys who don't know Fashion Week is just instrumental there's the MC rise not singing on it or rapping or whatever so you can hear the sounds that have these talking about it's like it's it's really well produced to try it like really catchy - so these are the bones of like what Death Grips works with like a really good production yeah and I think that's that's probably part of the reason that that why Death Grips is able to sort of maintain that kind of wild aggressive tone and vibe even though they're making music sort of you know producing sort of a computerized atmosphere you know I think that has a lot to do not only with um you know flatlander being such a great producer but also the fact that Zach Hill is in the band you know and a lot of people Zach Hill is really the musical vet of the group you know I mean I know for as far back as people have been able to research you know a flatlander and ride have been making music themselves or been involved in other musical projects but you know Zach Hill is the one that has been in the industry the longest has been the one that has had a successful career for the longest and he's just this amazing drummer percussionist extraordinaire who you know if you go back and listen to you know his earlier days in the band hella which is a pretty off-the-wall and very difficult and experimental math rock group so experimental that I mean you know even some of their best records were not like widely positive we reviewed because they're just such a difficult group to get into you know it's a there's something you know really hard about their music and really kind of challenging about their music in the same way that there's something really challenging about Death Grips music to um you know but the thing is if you take it down the road a little further to some of sac Hills solo records because after hella was foundering a little bit and you know he was kind of itching to do other things he came out with a few solo records one being faced at and one being astrological straits and you know and if you're a Death Grips fan and you hadn't listened to these records please do and if you you know are having a hard time getting into Death Grips and you have not heard these records and you're still kind of curious you're still interested I would recommend these albums too because I don't think there's a better indicator of sort of the sounds that would come to be on these early Death Grips albums as what Zach Hill is doing on these solo records because there's a lot of crazy whacked-out stuff on these albums that honestly at least a handful of tracks on each of them sound like fucking Death Grips songs but it's just Zach Hill singing on them you know it's not like writing on them or anything like the way that they're produced the brittleness of it the beats of them kind of the density of the production you know it's it sounds very much like like something you would hear Death Grips put together but it's it's more of an indulgent kind of Zach Hill thing you know if there's anything that kind of keeps it from fully going in that direction it's that you know ride is clearly not there there's not as present a hip hop influence I would say Zach Hill as far as structure is a bit more unpredictable a bit more of a wild man you know he's very much more willing to just kind of say fuck it and just like throw caution to the wind there you know maybe not do something that is as I would say um I guess a kind of sturdy and you know well-oiled a machine you know he'll just kind of like you know let the chips kind of fall where they may sometimes on some of his experiments you know but again sonically like as far as like some of the sound craft that goes into Death Grips records especially their early stuff because right now they're deaf on a totally another planet that's that's even farther remember from these early Zach Hill records but but still you know if you listen to those it's a really good indicator and to go off from this I mean Don I mean I don't know what kind of actually live does this question you know given that you told me that you had a hard time kind of getting in the Death Grips in the first place but um you know what kind of music do you think people could listen to to kind of prime themselves for this stuff and maybe give themselves a bit of a reference point for what they're about to listen to or ready themselves what they're about to listen to if they're still kind of like running into Death Grips music and having this issue of like you know I hear it but it like I'm just having a hard time deciphering it or putting it together because it doesn't sound like anything else I've ever heard okay I have a one can I have a conventional answer that I don't think is too great because like my again my metal and punk knowledge isn't great I'll like but I also have an unconventional answer that I'm really happy with my conventional answer listen to Jesus all right Jesus got it all so swans everything I've heard from swans I think I it sort of occupies that same realm for me um also like some of the Hellfire Club stuff bus driver like - I think he's he's okay bus driver I think will prepare you for emcee rides rapping because bus driver is like she's really good he'd be more traditional in riders but like his cadence is like it's hitting you kind of from different places and you kind of don't see it coming since I meet sometimes even daveed Diggs from clipping I think clipping as well um yeah my unconventional answer look at some Basquiat paintings and paintings from Dave McKean very brilliant artists but I think those guys visually to me are like Death Grips hmm so I think you could almost you can almost tie the visuals - it looks like I said the visuals to me are so important in integral to understanding them that I'm going to say Basquiat Jesus Swans uh and view both other people I mentioned but I forgot what I think I think those are good answers you know because I think I was going to go in a completely different place with my answer and I'm glad you said what you said because when you said it dawned on me like what better way is there to prepare sort of a young music listener for death grips and sort of the industrial hip-hop sound in general than to introduce them to basically their contemporaries who or maybe not as whacked out as they are but certainly have their own like unique sound you know experimental hip-hop artists like bus driver most certainly other industrial hip-hop artists like clipping who you know as abrasive in as noisy as their music is like in a lot of ways that still fits the hip-hop archetype in some ways better than Death Grips music does you know um and you know then Kanye's easiest to I mean as much as I'm not like a huge fan of that record you know he is trying to hop on that industrial hip-hop bandwagon a little bit on that album so yeah you know it's it may be kind of in some ways maybe down the road like the the entry level record for that whole that whole kind of resurgence and that sound um you know down the road could be my answer personally would be I would seek out the weird and and this and and I like Dom's answer because probably the easier answer I don't like I I guess you know my answer is going to cut is going to cost you way more fucking like work and that would be to maybe just go back to the musical movements of the 80s and the 90s and just try to acclimate yourself a little bit to just whatever the most hardcore or extreme or aggressive artists we're doing at that time whether it be like you know hardcore hip-hop from New York or gangster rapper and West Coast or whether that be you know a little bit of hardcore punk or death metal or grindcore or whether that be like you're listening to some weird underground super hyper fast drum and bass or jungle or drilling bass from the UK you know maybe even like some digital hardcore Atari Teenage Riot who I believe you know III heard in red were like big fans of Death Grips Trent Reznor - like the early ninth US triol rock stuff you know most certainly a reference point and and another thing that I think kind of gets consistently overlooked as a reference point I did not like this album when I first heard it is a mi A's Maya record oh that's that like that record was not well-received at all when it first came out but in retrospect it's definitely like an industrial rap album like there's so many weird abrasive just kooky sounds all over that record that like Death Grips definitely like toys with a lot of the same ideas you know I think they execute them better but I think you know in some ways m.i.a was sort of like the weird experimental hip-hop to come with that album and it's an album that I've been meaning to like kind of re-acclimate myself to and listen to again you know and and in a lot of ways on that record she was kind of embracing what was the cutting edge of internet culture at that point - because there are a lot of weird electronic internet influenced sounds all over that album and even the cover itself like um you know for a lot of people who may be younger and are not as aware like all over the front cover of that album there's kind of like a weird gray play bar that's like copied and pasted like a hundred times over that's not how the YouTube play bar used to look like in the early early earliest days of YouTube like that's just a fuckin YouTube play bar like copied over and over and over again on top of itself so a lot of weird things about that album too that I would definitely say makes her a reference point you know I mean I think ride vocally is is certainly influenced or at least it came off on ex-military by a rapper like RZA you know obviously wu-tang producer as well you know but uh especially uh you know some of those horror core stuff like their elements of his vocals that remind me of rides vocals you know I would also again tear yourself I would listen to as much as AK Hill solo and his hella stuff as you can because I do think there's a lot of stuff about what he does that that ends up on those Death Grips records and you know to sort of build off a little bit more to the jungle and base the drillin base the Atari Teenage Riot stuff that I said I would also just kind of seek out some experimental some out there electronic music - some IBM as well you know even though that stuff is like really toned down Death Grips to me as as they kind of have progressed that very much become a very electronic group you know there are a lot of elements of their sound that are super synthetic you know and and if you listen to a lot of very texturally interesting electronic music I think you're probably more likely to get what Death Grips are trying to do but but that would be my sort of very long-winded explanation to that question again it's more like a I'm giving you a laundry list when Dom is just like yeah just just check out some other new artists too who are pretty cool good you and I like I like your answer it's what I'll throw and now you were talking about the 80s and stuff honestly talking heads man okay explain yourself I love talking head but nah I'm not even thinking it but please explain it okay David Byrne man that guy's brain in terms of total package musically visually performance-wise controlling the brand strongly controlling what you're hearing stuff being abrasive and weird even for now you look at you look at back at some of the that shit um I think a total package I see similarities there in terms of stuff beat sounding not necessarily so super abrasive but sort of like it wants you to work a little bit to get it yeah you know the thing is I I think I'm I mean I think that's a good reference point but but only for the fact that that's you know the the fact that you're talking about an artist who like you said controls the brand controls visuals you know it's sort of this total package they wear many hats you know that are just a level of talent that even though the internet makes it easier to do everything you're just not seeing it as often and maybe not because the internet makes it easier to do everything you know what I mean maybe maybe the maybe the the bar for for entry is set a little bit lower but the thing is like you know artists who had that kind of ability you know not that like you know the they were there were crops and crops of them you know decades ago but I feel like you know you at least could count on more than a couple hands you know during a certain you know in a certain year you know another group who I would sort of cite as an example of that is definitely Devo you know Devo had that had that sound they had that look you know they had that vibe they had a really kind of creative you know sort of personality to him certainly they had to end their influence points you know but when they came out was like whoa where the fuck did this come you know this is just like again from another planet or something like that you know and there are plenty of other groups too you know who you know I would to bring it to bring it back to Wu Tang - I would say wu-tang is an example of that as well you know a group who came through you know their clique their group everybody has their own voice their own personality I mean you know unfortunately it was kind of hard for them to kind of keep that close mitten as' up as each of them kind of got their own levels of fame and record contracts and so on and so forth you know but for a while you know they were sir certainly an example of that - an example of that total package and and I would agree with what dom is saying in the general sense here you know trying to seek out and listen to and maybe maybe already are listening to but trying to appreciate groups who bring that total package and sort of trying to appreciate Death Grips from that perspective - makes sense you know in death doom or a Daft Punk - you know a group that not only do they come through the record that's super well groomed it's conceptual there's a theme to it from beginning ehn but they're also bringing you a visual idea as well a visual component a story you know something with your eyes to kind of aid what you're hearing with your ears along trying to sort of maybe think a little bit more deeply about what artists are in your iTunes that are already doing that you know gorillas are another example um you know artists in your in your catalog and your favorite records are already doing that stuff and then trying to observe Death Grips from that standpoint could could definitely kind of get you to that to that threshold where you're kind of like better appreciating what they're doing you know for sure and um I guess the one thing that I guess we can sort of round it out with and and you mentioned this before the conversation that you wanted to mention it um and we can talk about this as people who have both had this experience but what what what is Death Grips live show like for you for a little getting into that oh my god and and somebody who does enjoy them is that an essential part of the experience is something that when the opportunity to see Death Grips live comes around do you drop everything and just make sure that it happens you prioritize that that sort of be an experience in your life yes Prince to your nearest computer terminal and buy ticket uh what it's like is basic and and this is again coming from a guy who's not from super Moscow I mean Radiohead and beach house are my favorite band so just take the understand and like this is how much I like I disbanded sort of changed my perceptions of music but like going to their their live show it's it's like being in hell that's as close as you can get to being in Hell obviously you're not in pain but it's hot as fuck it's red it's just this deep foreboding feeling everyone is just the energy in the room you can't just stand still people are like the whole crowd is moving in a wave MC right is like a maestro controlling the air you're breathing he's pulling you into them this guy's electrified like I've seen no other performer maybe Kanye on his users tour may be caught in having this love love control over the audience and stage presence just like you're not on your phone you're not texting people you're not talking to your friends your your suck into the experience it's brilliant did you know them you saw them during the the the powers-that-be tour right that was the guys we saw after they came out with Jenny deaf yeah if you have ever okay yeah I saw a date on that same tour and um and everything Dom said is totally the truth like it's red it's hot it's insane like everybody's going absolutely wild like the you know if if you don't want to be near anybody like hitting or shoving into people like I would opt for a balcony position yeah and that's personally what I did at the time I was in the balcony because and you know and and from what I could observe from the balcony it was very much like hell you know and the ride is like you know the Pied Piper kind of just like driving everybody insane you know and and what's funny is like what's even more hilarious is like you know but I went to go see them a lot of white kids and like you know just very average looking white teenagers who you know probably lead like you know the just very regular teenage lives and are probably very mild-mannered when they're not at a desk show yeah like I remember see in this like this night he wasn't sat but he was kind of chubby he was like slightly chubby white kid who was clearly in the mosh pit and sort of like had long ish almost like Justin Bieber he kind of hair in his face and um he had torn off his shirt like in Wow and he was probably going crazy and when I spotted him was when he was clearly done moshing and his like shirt was off his back and in his hand of his life walking up the stairs to go to the bathroom and he was he looked really satisfied with himself like he he looked like he he felt like he was the shit like I'm so in it and that's the thing about death curse music there's definitely kind of like a charging kind of empowering kind of feel to it like you know I no there are people who and I know listen to like an artist like future for example and they're like I listen to this and you know I feel like I am the guy who's selling the lien and I feel like the guy who I'm doing all of it I do that and that's fine so some people want to listen to a song and feel that way you know like Death Grips is more like I feel like I have the power to crush the fucking planet in my palm and just like grind the dust down into like you know ash and just piss in it like this I get an answer that just visually like the feeling I get when I listen to these guys I feel like in an insane computer god if any of you have listened I've read the story I had no mouth and I am a scream by Harlan Ellison perfect example just a godlike immortal computer being that is insane and all-powerful and destroying everything in its path basically so I read I very much agree with Dawn's assessment of that of that tour that those to my knowledge Death Grips first huge tour where they pretty much played it straight forward and just like get all their dates and just did their professors you know they weren't skipping out on shit they weren't answers on people I've copied to other times one time at South by Southwest obviously where they shot that one music video with the visors on and that that was the show that made me go into the balcony for the next show because I was against the stage for that show there's a stage diving over my fucking head and and there were so many people pushing against my back that like my ribs were being crushed by the the-the-the like the banister in front of me like the gate in front of me and I'm a big guy I don't just get pushed around but there's just so many like five nine teenage white boys behind me all pushing with their 5:19 aged white boy force at once that was just like that it was just too much for me to bear you know so it was like it was becoming hard to breathe and I had my camera there I was trying to take as many pictures into much of video as possible and like you know sort of like keep myself from like and keep my girlfriend at the time we were just dating now at now we're married from being crushed to death too but yeah that was crazy and but then I caught them I think last year at another festival date and it was just kind of like your average festival stage show there wasn't really anything all too intimate or like crazy about it you could tell they were just kind of there doing their thing they were so much controlling the entire atmosphere like they were during the powers-that-be do that during the powers-that-be - or more even at the South by Southwest show that I saw because you could tell that I mean they were they were at a peak of popularity at that time because they just come out with no love deep web writer and you could tell that that the people who put the show on Raven they were like letting them do a lot of crazy shit they were letting them get away with a lot of weird shit because not only did Zach Hill was there but he was not on stage they had him wearing a GoPro on his head and he called in the computers that they had behind him so you heard his drums in the mix but he's like in another room on skype in the venue and he's like playing the beats and everything it's being played out of the loudspeakers and on top of that like you know flatlander had recently come back because I guess they were playing some live shows and flatlander wasn't there at all that was the first show public show that he had returned for and there were like some camera guys on the stage ride just grabbed one of them and fucking shoved him his heart he could off the stage and like five people back into the crowd and you know why the people working the venue didn't like stop that right there really hey you you can't do that man I I don't know it was a lot even powers man he just fucking did in from that point on the crowd like you know like crowd surfed the guy back to the stage and then he just kind of stayed in the corner and kept the might and kept the camera on and did not approach did not leave the corner yeah because I guess they were trying to livestream the the performance oh those are my three Death Grips live experiences and the best ones have always been the ones where it seems like they have the like the utmost control of every single little detail that goes on as far as the stage show as far as like how it's presented to everybody you know if you if you see them at some average festival date it may be decent if that's the only opportunity that you have but like it's probably not going to be as crazy as like a headline show or is like some kind of weird one-off experience that I had who knows if they'll ever do anything that fucking crazy again and special was a really special experience it definitely is I mean it's it's the craziest thing I had ever been to since I was in high school and I was just kind of regularly going to metal shows and punk shows you know where you'd see insane mosh pits you know but at the time it's like you know you aren't seeing a lot of huge headline punk shows and metal shows coming through where I was at least you know that had as crowds as big as the Death Grips one and and were moshing and going as fucking crazy you know as the Death Grips one was I guess the other one that I could think of a more recent memory that cell almost as intense was a converged show that I saw like in 2012 so you know believe me there's like not a lot of groups out there right now that are whipping people up into as much as if much of a frenzy as Death Grips does when when they play live here for sure alright I think um we can leave it there I mean this has been a pretty thorough conversation I think I mean we feel great I found their lyrics everything my friends don't listen to death grip so I mean it's great and this is I guess as part of it I mean like we're might be fight you might be by yourself yeah it can just somewhere and your friends know that your real-life friends don't listen to it so like you're this community online like me Anantha you're doing just talking about like geeking out over this shit doing great you know honestly I think I think my friends don't listen to Death Grips is a phrase that most def drips fans could probably attest cucumber ii back but my friends don't like with the death grips and you try and put them on dude listen the guillotine just listen to this one song they're like what is wrong with you oh [Music] god yeah my friends don't listen to Death Grips every Death Grips dad ever yes basically the calling card but but hopefully this conversation has been enlightening and has given you guys better scope of the band and a better explanation for the band I thought it was definitely worth doing a bit of an overview because you know just popping into one of my later Death Grips reviews without having seen my previous ones and even some of my previous ones aren't a full understanding of what they're doing because you know ex-military as much as I love that record and the money stores as much as I love that record I feel like I know and I get so much more about the band now than I did then you know because I've had so much more of an opportunity to listen to those albums over and over listen to more of their latest records and kind of piece the lyrical themes together see the sonic progression get more of the influences and hopefully this kind of lays it out in a I mean in a long-winded but ineffective way so now maybe you guys can sort of go to some of those recommendations we made earlier and maybe approach these Death Grips albums with a bit of a new perspective even if you're someone who's actually been a fan of the group which I'm sure a lot of people listening are yeah alright my guest again has been Dominic Raburn his YouTube channel where he does many fantastic sort of art series and drawing series and interview series - that's great that I hope he's still keeping up absolutely check out you can check out down there in the description box and you know is their website - that we can link people to as well because I know that you're doing things off of YouTube as well you know is there a place where people can go to sort of see some of your some of your off youtube stuff yeah my Instagram is C Blacula CB la kul a at my portfolio professionally is Dom Rabb run comm I'll give you those links and stuff you should look at my drawings and shit Instagram is probably best cool alright I appreciate you coming on and talk on me about this stuff because you and you and I both know we have no friends that listen to Death Grips yeah I just never been period thank you and and hopefully you guys enjoyed this because you guys none of your friends with some the Death Grips either and you know so we all kind of feel a little bit more one with each other asked after this 90 minutes of blabbing on and on and on about about death grip so hopefully we see another Death Grips record in in the near future do you think they're going to drop an album this year there hasn't been a year yet where they haven't dropped something yeah I've been writing no love deep web of my dick just over and over again and I think it's happening because I'm not just charming I'm charming the spirits of the world is please please what do I need to do to make this happen it's going to happen I'm hoping to happen soon to man I'm hoping to happen soon too okay all right thanks again everybody for listening this is again been another episode of the needle drop podcast more links below or you can find our itunes link and all that stuff in the description and i will catch you guys in the next podcast the next review the next whatever forever [Music] "
bbS0PRslyJs,hi everyone the enemy poo tan appear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mastodon album emperor of sand Georgia progressive sludge metal outfit Mastodon they're back which is always a reason to celebrate because these guys are easily one of the most entertaining and cutting-edge metal bands of the 2000s their sound inspired so many metal musicians and metal fans to seek out this heavy epic ambitious style to the point where it really just kind of grew beyond Mastodon itself now that's not to say that Mastodon invented sludge metal or were the first band to go progressive with it certainly the band had their predecessors and contemporaries like The Melvins and neurosis Isis but Mastodon definitely helped make sludge metal the trend that it was this last decade and you know even even today I mean converge was was taking notes with some of the sludge ear tracks off their last album all we love we leave behind it's just disappointing because Mastodon had so many bands playing catch up ten years ago it's kind of hard to believe that in 2011 still even though that's it's six years in the past at this point and and I've already listened to and reviewed this record but it's it's still hard to swallow the bitter pill that they came out with an album like the hunter a record that sounded like Mastodon wanted to be anything but a metal band so desperate on this record to like water down their sound and their edge to make every concession that they possibly could to a poppier more accessible sound without stepping over the boundary that would you know get their metal cred taken away Opeth you are a progressive rock band now there's no going back just stay over there to this day I still cannot enjoy the Hunter thankfully the band's follow-up album once more around the Sun was a bit more of a compromise they went back to their roots a bit if the band's mission in this decade is to find a way to make their sound a little bit more direct a little bit more accessible while still maintaining their original qualities as a metal band I can see this album as being so much closer to succeeding at that and given that this album was pretty good did seem to get some positive reviews all around I thought that you know maybe they would just kind of just let sleeping dogs lie not try to fix what's not broken but on this latest record over here the band is still Restless they are still trying to alter their sound and unfortunately they're still trying to find new and creative ways to soften the blow make it blander make it more unimaginative make it so that people who are not really metal fans can digest it and appreciate it maybe this is some kind of attempted at grasping at like a Metallica sized crossover appeal even if Mastodon somehow had the talent and the stars had a line to the point where they could write and record and release such an album would it really be worth it because all I'm hearing with this new stuff is the band coming through with their most tepid material yet and what's the trade-off you know I mean so far the band's older stuff is what seems to be most widely celebrated by fans and critics alike so what continues to push Mastodon into the this part pop part prog direction I'm just not sure because this time around it's like they're trying to infuse their heavy guitars and there's somewhat speedy kind of flashy leads and licks that they throw in between these riffs with vocals and choruses that could have been lifted out of just bad radio rock songs from the 90s it's like the band listened to a whole lot of Soundgarden or Stone Temple Pilots a little bit of Alice in Chains and they're just doing a real bad impression of a lot of that I mean just take a look at the song precious stones don't waste your time I'm gonna slip away did I mention the some of their worst lyrics are on this record too I said it before I'll say it again the song show yourself sounds like Foo Fighters doing a goddamn Queens of the Stone Age cover with these Dave Grohl vocals and sort of thick Josh Homme egit are riffs I appreciate that the band tries to give the track a little bit of edge toward the end with some heavy riffs and a flashy arena rock sized guitar solo that just wails away but at this point the band has already sold the the edginess of the song up the river you can't redeem it now and I'm not saying this album that there's nothing metal about this album whatsoever you know there are certainly a few riffs a few drum beats here and there some vocals too that certainly give off that vibe of an older Mastodon release the issue is is that there's nothing on this album as far as the metal tone side of this record that isn't something the band hasn't done already on either their previous material or maybe some ideas that you might have heard on the latest records from their contemporaries be a Baroness or high on fire or neurosis or some band like that I mean listen to the song Sultan's curse the opener to this album tell me this is not the most inconspicuous opener to any Mastodon album ever tell me that this is not Mastodon by-the-numbers because in the grander scheme of the the mastodon songbook there's absolutely nothing special about this track listening to this album is like listening to Mastodon blatantly and almost knowingly blow their lead in the sludge metal game and it just is really disappointing especially when you consider that some of the worst vocals on any Mastodon album land on this record the cheese factor has increased tenfold with all of these soaring vocals that again sound like a combination between some bad 90s commercial radio alt rock and maybe a little bit of power metal in there too and I have I have no idea what the band is trying to do on the track word to the wise dumb and in the Wishing Well falling underneath the spell save me from the wicked ways not only does it sound like the Macho Man Randy Savage himself has come back from the the dead to sing on this track but he's on some fantasy metal too I could not make it through the first verse of this track without without laughing at least a little bit and there are other tracks on this album that are almost as bad as this the song clan destiny for example and and also how the title of this song made it to the final cut of the album I do not know but it made it here along with the weird and completely unexpected and and very badly executed synth odyssey that appears in the in the second half of this track complete with robot vocals of course as you do the song ancient kingdom which i've listened to again and again and again no matter how much i try to enjoy this song because I do think the blissful hook is one of the most beautiful Mastodon has ever written it just doesn't fit all that snugly into the track it feels like it clashes with almost everything else the track has to offer from the chaotic drums to the raucous riffs and the wailing vocals and it's weird because Mastodon is usually pretty great at assembling a grand track assembling a progressive track assembling a progressive stretcher assembling an epic album but almost everything the band presents on this record is a weird mix of we've done this before here is bad like commercial rock music singing from a bygone decade and this kind of clashes with everything else that we're offering in the song or just our our usual sound itself again it's like the band isn't really assembling or building out tracks all that well on this record case in point the song Andromeda which just kind of fizzles out right after a very strange vocal passage that sounds like I'm listening to a bunch of screams off of a Mudvayne record and the the phrase total mess is basically the song Jaguar God in a nutshell this eight-minute closing track has multiple phases to it the first two minutes I'm positive the band is convinced that they are writing their answer to nothing those matters but eventually they give up on this task because the vocals are bad and their balladry is not really up to snuff so they just kind of bring it in to the heavy guitars again but they go back to that theme melody at the very end with some of the guitar solos and leads I appreciated that but it is a very rough ride to that point oh no man that this is such an underwhelming album for me from Mastodon and I know I don't really have a super positive Mastodon review on my channel outside of their their previous record once more around the Sun and that's because I mean every amazing record the band has dropped is is like eight years in the past at least I mean if I was reviewing crack the sky this this would be a very different review because on this thing I think Mastodon puts out a few of their worst tracks a few of their most anonymous tracks you know again to go back to show yourself that is a track that I would not have even known it was a mastodon song had I not been told and had I not been told that a lot of the songs off this new record over here were a new Mastodon album I would assume that bulk of this material is just like old b-sides stuff that didn't make an album because it's not all that well written or groomed or just features some bad vocal performances I think artistic evolution and trying new things are certainly one thing and then there's the matter of what I'm hearing here is material that I think a mastodon of ten years ago would not have let onto an album would have just maybe gone back to the drawing board with it and I'm just still getting the sense on this album that they would rather be doing something else than what they're doing and and I get it you don't want to repeat the same ideas over and over and over for the rest of your career you want to continue to progress our statistically you want to try new stuff but a lot of the time on this album it's like they would rather be the next 90s copycat than the first Mastodon because they just continue to play it safe with a bunch of tired rehash sounds a lot of which they've gotten from other places and they're just kind of settling on that rather than doing something refreshing maybe taking a risk I will say that album ends perfectly with a kind of this maniacal laughter in the distance which is exactly how I felt when the album ended I was just kind of laughing and I was like man I cannot believe what what what I just heard and also that I mean it seems like people generally like the album and and I don't know I I just did not come away from this record with that experience I feel like I'm taking crazy pills but you know I'm just I'm just gonna leave it that this this record I kind of see the hype behind it you know I mean it is loud it is produced okay I just don't really think a lot of the singing and a lot of the writing is up to snuff for this band you know considering the amazingly high bar that they've set in the past this is just not really where I would like it to be me personally I'm feeling a decent strong four on this thing treacherous transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry

ZgT57CPrmFI,hi everyone Caillou here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Freddie Gibbs album You Only Live Twice Gary Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs he is back with his first studio commercial album in a few years when we last heard from Freddie we were listening to his shadow of a doubt album that he dropped just a year after his legendary landmark collaboration album with mad lib pinata back in 2014 shadow of the doubt was an interesting direction for freddie sound way more dark nocturnal moody gritty definitely complimented his many gritty tales of drug dealing and vivid descriptions of a seedy lifestyle as well as some of the more introspective moments on this album too but Freddie's progression was unfortunately put on hold shortly after the release of shadow of a doubt after he got arrested in France off of a rape case that brought him back to Austria he made bail but still went to court and was eventually released with him being cleared being not guilty charges dropped in September of 2016 which is a long time for someone's life to be put on hold and even longer time for someone's music career to be put on hold in the Internet age but Freddie seems to be doing his best to bounce back from all of this with this new project over here released in less than a year since he's been back and this album seems directly influenced by this recent experience in a myriad of ways one there are some introspective moments on this record like homesick where Freddie directly reflects on the pain suffering he sort of went through as he was in prison in another country their themes on this track as well as the entire album where he'll catch Freddie rapping about returning home wanting to emphasize living for his family and his daughter more than his friends and the music industry and sort of the the seedy lifestyle that he's been living there also plenty of lyrics on this album like this one where he's directly addressing the topic of this case of being in prison the title and the cover of this project is directly referencing him coming back as if he's being reincarnated or something and this project is just a very short 32 minutes long it's almost in a way like a glorified EP or something because this is most likely the best material that Freddie could string together in the short amount of time between now and September and in a way I can't appreciate that because freddie is not just one of these prolific artists who releases anything and everything that he records he's not going to throw out a project that's overly long and packed with filler that perfectionist in Freddie has certainly kept this project from being awful but does it live up to some of his best stuff some of his larger and more ambitious projects I don't think so because there's really not enough material on this thing it kind of flows like a compilation some of the tracks on this thing really could have used a stronger hook crushed glass and Maria specifically because dropping in after a verse with these area cereal choruses with some female singer like Howlin away in the distance it's not very memorable doesn't really leave much of an impact it just kind of feels like a placeholder where a stronger chorus should be some of Freddie's performances on this project I think could have been better there are moments where he's rapping really fast just kind of rattling off all these bars no one moment feels more emphasized than another but he's continually spitting with this crack voice which is fine it's it's one of his more distinct vocal deliveries but it's definitely not as memorable as some of the other moments on this record where freddie is being more impassioned and direct and to-the-point the way that he's performing the way that he's rapping you can feel every word that is coming out of his mouth you can feel that every bar has a distinct idea and feeling behind it and you sort of vibe with his emotional intensity changing as he's going from bar to bar making different statements different observations expressing different ideas I think Freddie definitely does that on the track Alexis performance wise I think this is one of the best tracks on the entire album but there are a few moments on here where Freddie packs some of his bars with maybe two three too many syllables and then his rapping kind of falls off tempo a little bit comes off a little sloppy this is one of the better tracks on the album I will give it that and as far as its subject matter and Freddie coming through with just some some really personal ideas on this track I like it a lot but as far as the flow goes on this track and the cleanliness of the rhyme scheme this is just not up to the standard that Freddie usually delivers on a track and with this project I think Freddie is starting to exhaust this atmospheric very Spacey trap instrumental sound that was so prominent on his last record on here it doesn't come off quite as dark or gritty a lot of the time it's really sort of neutral and somewhat generic and tone and I don't think Freddie has completely tweaked or fine-tuned his talents when it comes to delivering these some hooks that he does every once in a while which led to some of the worst moments on shadow of a doubt I would say Andrea is one of his more successful attempts at this but phone lit is easily the worst track on this album not only because Freddie singing voice just does not sound all that good but the trap instrumental on this thing is really bustling it's super busy throwing there the down pitched vocals that are kind of going around in the background occasionally I think trying to add a little bit more density to the track but the song really just kind of sounds like a mess never mind the fact that it doesn't really complement much of the rest of the track sonically or thematic aliy the jazzier and more soulful instrumentals on this record I think fit Freddie's voice a little bit better not only that but kind of fit the sad sort of nostalgic homesick and sentimental tone of a lot of the stuff that Freddie is saying on this record again to reference the song Andrea the second half of the song 20 kara Jesus which I appreciated the appearance of the actor who plays black Jesus on that Adult Swim show that I think is hilarious but the Kanye ish instrumental over here is is easily one of the most inspired moments on the entire album it's like Freddie's voice just picks up on this beat and you know really kind of bring this home a lot of what he's trying to say on this record in regards to his recent experiences unfortunately this record is just really inconsistent it's really short it's kind of all over the place the best thing this album has going for it is Freddie reflecting very introspective Lee these recent experiences that he went through being away from home being away from his friends being away from his family things changing now that he's gotten back home being away from his daughter being in prison the unfairness of the situation he was put in and then after leaving prison having to kind of refocus his efforts and refocus his life wanting to live more for his family his daughter not so much these dudes who are kind of maybe leaching off of him or are jealous of his fame and his success and all of these themes all these ideas are really big important personal ideas and decisions so big and so important you could easily make an entire record out of these things an album that is much longer than the one we have here and I think Freddy could have easily done that had he just kind of sat and ruminated on what he was trying to say with this album a little bit more instead of doing that I think what we got was a little rushed and unfortunately what I think made that happen is that again Freddy was sort of out of the picture unfortunately for too long a time for way longer than he wanted to be obviously and he just kind of came back and just cobbled this together I can appreciate this record from the standpoint of Freddy is trying to keep his career on track but I don't think it resulted in one of his better albums but now hopefully with all this turbulence behind him I hope he can come through with something that is a little bit more coherent a little bit more cohesive a little bit more thoughtful a little bit more consistent well structured and lengthier - I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this album transmission have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if

aHZz2A2Wrj8,hey what's up everybody Anthony Fantana and that's a busy Assam musican oh yeah and it's time for our monthly y-you know review segment where I go over a series of albums that I did not formally review over the past month but I talk about them in brief in a series of videos that originally land on my Twitter account shoutout to my twitter account follow me over there i'm beefing with everybody on the internet all of the album's i talk about in this segment are listed down there in the description box and as some people were asking me to review the called-- album some people asked me to view the storm z album of the cement thus Minow albums minnow album those are all here and many more so without further ado it's the latest episode of the you know review you know there might not be anything entirely new about this louis campesinos album but this record goes back to the very raw and youthful sound that made a lot of their early records so compelling gone is the slickness and the overproduction of their last few records so you know maybe if you're not that into the band or you haven't gotten into them yet this could be a good introduction to them I think even though it's it's not really that exciting and refreshing of an album there are a lot of good things about it there's a decent tunes on it too and I guess if you're looking for a peak as to what made a lot of the indie rock and indie pop and sort of the twee flavored stuff in that genre so great in the 2000s this is certainly an example of that it's just that you know they've just kind of done it before that's all bombad yeah this is just kind of like overblown overproduced very thick and bombastic generic psych pop with totally forgettable vocal yeah this is just kind of like overblown overproduced very thick and bombastic generic psych pop with totally forgettable vocals [Music] okay uh follow me on this one but the blindfold is symbolic because I do not see the hype here I don't see it Jing Jing Jing Jing Jing one thing is certainly for sure global thing is certainly for sure climate change and Beadon emit change can be denied no longer oh whoa hey wow I found this whole box here of of indie rocks ideas it would seem it's all out of ideas I thought I was going to be disappointed by this album but I ended up being pleasantly surprised I will kind of recommend this thing I will say that it's good but I think that part of us can me say that is that my implicit square pusher bias I am a square pusher fan and this is a square pusher project shoba leader one being the the band that he kind of assembled and now masterminds on occasion I guess in between square pusher albums if you don't need a square pusher is he is a fantastic electronic music producer and he kind of just appears in this band every once in a while and what shoba leader one has done with this new album over here is gone back into the square pusher back catalog and they are doing full band renditions of songs from a myriad of different square pusher albums now Square pusher if you didn't know his compositions his productions typically have a pretty jazzy quality to them not all of them but a great deal of them so bring them into a full band context has resulted in this not being an electronic music record or anything like that this is just pretty much a straight jazz rock record it's a jazz fusion album so you know I could actually see not just square pusher fans but people who are jazz fans who are jazz rock fans who maybe hadn't heard of square pushers music before maybe listening to it in this context could just be like you know something entirely new and exciting for you guys now this is a live recording you know you do hear the applause and the crowd cheering in between tracks and the recording is a little rough around the edges as a result but I still thought that this is a really fun entertaining album could potentially get some people who are into jazz into square pushers music that sort of made me cross over into electronic music sort of hearing this bridge between jazz music and the electronica world was actually kind of cool but I digress give this thing a listen if you're a jazz fan Square pusher fans don't miss out on this thing it is a good record it is an entertaining record and yeah there you go now I really do like chance to rappers music but not so much that I just want to hear his brother sound like him and I get it there are a few highlights on this thing but the production for the most part is not that good the vocals seem like they weren't recorded or mixed that well it's kind of muddy sounding and nor do I think that Taylor comes off as bright vibrant fun exciting exuberant and I don't know I guess as a envelope-pushing a rapper I mean I guess if you want to hear more of the same that's totally cool but that this isn't this isn't really for me though I do appreciate that he is bringing sort of a you know a brighter more positive vibe in his hip-hop music holy complacency Batman this holy complacency Batman this record is holy complacency Batman throw this record onto the forget will comeback albums pile unfortunately I kind of get the same vibe off this album that I did Pharma cons last album while there are some really heavy noisy industrial abrasive sounds on here vocal performances are really animalistic there's almost nothing to speak of in terms of song structure on this record pretty much every track starts off real Arminius little Spacey the sounds and the noises and the volume sort of slowly escalates we reach a point of peak intensity we hang there for a little bit and then it's just over it's just done it just kind of fizzles out it's good and everything lasts just long enough for it to get stale and then it just disappears uh yeah uh you know there may be some tracks on this thing that are basically auditory wallpaper but there are quite a few moments on here where John Talbots very groovy tropical rhythms which he's kind of known for seep their way into the mix and and it makes for some kind of interesting techno fusions so you know if you're into that give this thing a listen even though I was pretty excited going into this thing because I wanted to hear another great grime record you know that Wiley record that came out this year amazing album but I was looking forward to hearing more great grime in 2017 and while the bangers on this album are as good as any number of which I've heard on grime records over the past couple of years this kind of seems like Grimes answer to the focus-grouped hip hop album that we typically get in the US where of course you have your harder tracks of course you have your your your aggressive tracks where the artist plays to their bass plays to the sound that got them where they are but then of course these tracks have to be balanced out with all these ritzy glitzy buttery smooth R&B tinge pop rap songs that really don't play to storm Z strengths and and really after they stack on top of each other because they make up a good bulk of the album they're actually kind of gross and and annoying yeah but kind of let down by this one budwood what are you gonna do what is that it is it's like James just found out about a Montreal it's like they've been there the whole time then he's like wow this this of Montreal and this there's something to what they're doing here there's something to it I said well it's like you just listen to everything from satanic panic in the Attic to skeletal lamping it was like okay let's make an album now am I the only one who feels like this is just a little unnecessary to take all of the acoustic tracks from Conor Oberst last record and try to flesh them out into a bunch of swanky country rock renditions which are pretty much what what Connor ubers last record was such a great breath of fresh air from to kind of learn that ruminations was just a bunch of acoustic demos to be laid out so that they could end up on this album over here almost cheapens that record despite the fact that I enjoyed it so much last year oh no guys I mean it's it there's some cool moments here don't get me wrong there's some cool moments like the the vocal work on this album I think is particularly good but overall it just kind of sounds like more sing-songy rap straight out of Chicago that that's trying to just just hop into that chance the rapper spotlight position have you given any of these albums listen what did you think of them that you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and other links and related videos next to my head subscribe to the

D8gFVOA9JLU,hey everyone Antwon but dan duan dodongo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a great albums video where I remind you of the albums that stuck out to me is being particularly good over the past month since marches dead and gone by by March 2017 you are a good month you're pretty fruitful actually this year so far has been pretty fruitful for me and honestly I haven't had too many negative reviews this year so far I don't know if it's because I'm sort of diverting a lot of stuff into the y-you know review but the typically the why you know reviews already had a lot of albums in them I'm just not getting all that disappointed lately you know there's there's a lot of good records out a lot of good albums a lot of music worth celebrating and I'm happy about that all that being said two albums they talked about in this video are linked down there in the description along with some links where you can hear the albums to check out the review check out the music and let's let's get into those recommendations one of the new bibby o sound machine these guys are a UK music group fusing elements of West African funk electro synth pop a little bit of a post-punk in there and disco dance dance dance there's so much energy and high-octane instrumentation on this thing frontwoman Eno Williams is a sight to behold but you're hearing her so it's a sight for your ears it says here in it it sounds good definitely the band's most energetic and well produced and mature album yet they try to put on some slow burners here some of them go over pretty well it's a pretty dynamic record elements of like I said earlier you know disco stuff and West African stuff one track kind of sounds like a Nigerian bands take on like a like Unknown Pleasures from Joy Division it's pretty insane a really good album solid record definitely gonna be one of my favorites of the year having a lot of fun with this one moving on from there an album that I'm not having very much fun with it all but is still a very strong still very incredible record I'm talking about the new Mount Erie album a crow looked at me this was definitely one of the most intense and soul-crushing listening sessions series of sessions that I've had with a record that I had to review definitely a landmark album when it comes to records about death when it comes to records that loss when it comes to particularly sad albums on this record not only this Phil sort of go into the details of him losing his wife to cancer not too long ago because this record does come out shortly after the passing of his wife but also he sort of goes back to a very strict back kind of minimal and linear sound and songwriting style from one of my favorite records in his in his discography gone so as am a very fan really loved in this album I think there's a lot of great things about this record still you know it is kind of hard to separate the art from the tragedy that it's attached to I'm sure maybe eventually down the road it will be easier to do that I know it is a little distracting for me personally because just the emotional intensity of this record is really strong it is really potent it's hard not to at least be incredibly depressed while listening this album because again just the graphic details that come up in the lyrics it's really heartbreaking you know it's it's really heartbreaking I can appreciate and understand if somebody you know hears this record or hears me describe this record and they're like you know what not not for me at least not right now because you know there is sad music and then there's music that like I said about this album in my review it is great but it barely even qualifies as entertainment I wouldn't even call it entertainment you know it's certainly art it's certainly an emotional expression it's certainly music but it's not something that you would put on to be entertained at all but you know I'll leave it there great record again my review and music from this record down there in the description the new Paul Bearer album heartless is a record that I want to shout out Paul beare a group that I did not anticipate would come out with their best album so far this year a kind of stoner metal doom traditional doom metal outfit from Arkansas whose previous material I thought was pretty decent you know certainly stood out in some respects but kind of one-dimensional on this new record over here not only are the band kind of taking that ultra melodic approach that they do to do metal to new heights new emotional Heights but the production's a little better on here the vocal performances are more passionate more varied there are more elements of what I heard of being like psychedelic rock progressive rock so the songs are definitely more dynamic than they used to be in the past Paul beare I wish they were kind of doing this stuff earlier I wish like I wish their sophomore record was what they were doing here you know it's taking them a little while to get to this point but they're finally here they're writing much more varied songs and you know much more varied and well flowing album over here too and finally I want to give a shout out to another one a my very very very very much a favorite for me this year that's going to be the new shoo-shoo album for get shoo shoo kind of goes back to a slightly grimy er cent poppier slightly post-punk e'er sound a little more industrial on this record over here with some very dark dark lyrics on this thing I will you know leave it to the review to kind of explain what I thought about some of the lyrics but I'm letting the bands approach the sound and texture on this one this is definitely more straightforward and accessible than some of the material that they've been dropping as of late so if you're not really a shoo-shoo fan haven't gotten into the band there are at least a couple tracks on here that are very sharp and sweet and to the point especially the song wondering you know of course Shu Shu is very much an idiosyncratic band still but for those who are less acquainted with the band this could be a good entry point again you know there are elements of pop in here there are elements of experimental rock and art rock there are a lot of great things a lot of great ideas on this record a lot of dark tracks a lot of interesting textures great and very colourful production on this thing - yeah don't really have much more to say about it loving this record as well and I also want to give a shout out to a couple others not on my love list but but certainly records that were of note this month's new spoon record was decent new year old Droog record was pretty decent as well I wanna give a shout out to the boys and Remo Drive a pop punk band an emo band from Minnesota who came out with a very good debut album turning a lot of heads in the underground rock world right now all the emo kids love it it may likely be the emo record of the year for all the emo kids a lot of good solid songs on here solid lyrics I'm hoping the bank and springboard off of this into you know maybe a good studio on this next record that they do because there are a lot of great ideas on this album even if the band isn't like the most an inventive group on the planet when it comes to you know pop punk and emo right now I think whatever they come out with in the future would be so much more well complemented by a better recording moving on from there I wanna give a shout out to the new havoc album as well the denver thrash metal band is back with a record called conformist ID and the first half of this record is a monster man and they do a really great job of kind of taking the dystopia and the political tone of the lyrics in thrash metal typically and sort of applying them to the 2016-2017 social landscape a lot of slap bass and a great mix on this record a lot of good things about it there are some moments where I think they kind of fall prey to the usual thrash blueprint and they stop kind of getting ambitious and trying new things but if you're looking for a standard kind of standard thrash record with a few surprises here and there you know and then some some lyrics that kind of reflect the temporary the contemporary tone of politics and kind of you know the social landscape right now then definitely give this record to listen and that is going to be it for this segment recommending those albums to you guys again everything all that info linked down there in the description you're the best hope none of these albums slipped through the cracks for you guys but if they did here they are and you have a nice day transition have you given any of these albums listen what did you think of them that

head subscribe to the channel official website - I love you I'll see you in the next video forever

that's all that's all alright let's get into the tracks raw real rugged and raw getting into these tracks as usual worst tracks of the week first there will be a few interesting ones in here I think that you guys the you guys will find surprising landed in this section and unfortunately there were so many tracks in here that I wanted to like and I just didn't care for starting with this new yg track pop it shake it DJ mustard on the beat and god it is one of YG's worst tracks in a long time not only is this hook trash but there are some of his worst lyrics in a while on here though I did appreciate the bar about her being vegan but she's still thick I appreciated that I appreciated that as a thick vegan myself I appreciated that you know there were a few bars here and there that I thought were kind of funny but this is just like yg punching way below his weight in my opinion especially with there being so many great memorable and personal bangers on his last record again just punching under his weight with this one also kind of felt the same way about the new slow dive song sugar for the pill no longer does the band sound as interesting or hazy or as heavenly as they used to this just sounds like a really bland sparse indie rock song with way too much reverb on it there's like absolutely nothing special about the sound of this track absolutely nothing special about songwriting of this track the vocals bored me to tears I'm not really sure if I'm going to be looking forward to this slow dive record based off of you know what I've heard so far the last track I thought was okay I mean I could be wrong on that maybe I thought it was fucking amazing and I can't remember but I don't really recall it leaving that much of an impression on me but having said that next even though this is a full track I I do confidently feel like I can place it in the worst track of the worst tracks of the week section that would be this new single a preview single it's preview it's not the full track preview I heard a preview of this track this new a Calvin Harris song heat stroke featuring young thug in Pharrell and Ariana Grande young thug sounds way to sober on this song way to sober sounds like he was actually sober for three days and then recorded this song because when he was singing and rapping on this track there was like no slurring in his voice he was like super clean and straightforward it's almost like what like what he usually does on a track is just to put on and this is what he sounds like when he's just talking normally um it was it was actually kind of like a really weird moment it was sort of like um I don't know seeing a picture of one of your favorite celebrities pooping or something just kind of reminds you that that they're just kind of like probably a regular person at the end of the day and not just like a weird lanky Wylie stoner man but yeah that was just not not a good not a good look not a good sound and I'm just going to leave it at that I again it's just a preview but based off of the 1 minute and 40 seconds I heard of this track not interested in hearing the rest of it um dan auerbach of Black Keys Fame has a new solo album on the way and the lead single attached to a sickeningly cutesy music video of the track shine on me dan dan dan Edie Frick from the perspective of someone who deeply loves a lot of the Black Keys early work let me just say please leave the the sickeningly cute grocery store urban outfitters indie pop crossovers for em ward he has that market cornered he's already doing it as well as you can do it which is not well at all you know mind you but as but as well as you can do it yeah I don't I don't want to hear this while I'm in the cereal aisle and that's where it's going to end up we all know we all know that's where this leads that that is where this leads because that's where I hear em Wars music playing in the cereal aisle and that's where this is going to go and we don't want to go there so I'm jet I'm just saying it that's where that's where it's going moving on G easy and carnage they have a new EP out and G easy sounds hilariously bad on this new track I think it was a line about her like putting his dick on someone's face it was so he sounds like a McLemore who who is trying to be naughty trying to be so naughty you naughty McLemore who says more bad words you're such a naughty McLemore who swears more you said did not it'll back the word swears and not more you little too Macklin words there's a lot more art you yeah that's uh that's that's basically the gist I'm getting off of this track the the hook is pretty grimy but a a G easy verse is a verse I do not want to sit through but finally what I felt was the the worst track of the week most obnoxious track of the week is this new huge collaborative cut a song basing it straight off of the people involved in it I I thought I would have loved it but this new track from Sufjan Stevens Bryce Dessner Nico Muhly and James McAlister a lot of big names there a lot of big names I know I've enjoyed a lot of Sufi ins music I know I've enjoyed a lot of Nico's music I do like some of the Nationals earlier stuff but goddamn this is a really maxximum maximalist weird experimental electronic piece with terrible auto-tune lead vocals that I just cannot stand to listen to it makes a Dan Deakins music sound reserved I guess I guess I'll say that much it makes makes Dan Deacon sound like he plays it a little too safe in terms of like you know just pushing it a little too far and just just being generally annoying it sounds kind of experimental I get that they're trying to be sort of adventurous on this one but it did not sit with me very well at all and I am NOT looking forward to listening to this thing again on a full-length album to be completely honest but you know that's the worst tracks of the week for me let's let's just move out of the tracks I felt like are worth mentioning but I'm not like insane about Freddie Gibbs Alexis now keep in mind I'm not saying this track is terrible production from Bad bad not good in catch or not on this one it's not a bad track you know I'm just sort of anticipating maybe it'll hit me a little bit harder in the context of the record the beat did not go quite as hard as I anticipated it to though it does have a nice jazzy flavor to it and Freddie he just his performance seemed a little off on this track not only topically does it seem kind of run-of-the-mill for him but there are a few moments on here were the Beast rips back and he tries like rapping faster just like really putting a spotlight on his flow and there are a few moments where not that he can't rap on beat or on tempo but it seems like he packed one two or three too many syllables in a line or two so then his bar goes like a little longer than it obviously should have I'm not exactly sure why but the performance just seemed off on this one seemed like it could have come out of this track with a better take a better rewrite and it would have been a more solid track the underachievers have a new track out titled head right which is pretty grimy pretty loaf I didn't blow me away or anything like that but if you're you know looking for more material from them and hopefully maybe an album or something around the corner look that up mary j blige has a new single out featuring Kanye West which is not only a very good performance for Mary Jay one of the better ones I've heard in a while but also this beam has a bit of a you know like a kind of 2000s you know hip-hop R&B quality to it which of course Kanye like fits on like a glove you know this is very much like the old Kanye on this beat even though you know he is making reference to contemporary or sort of newer things going on in his life but you know it does very much have that old-school flavor to it if you want to sort of get a bit of a time machine to go back to college dropout or late registration Kanye this is definitely track to do it because Kanye's verse is pretty good and again Mary Jays performances is fine as well don't know if I'm going to be blown away by whatever record she comes out with in the future but you know take notice seems like they're putting out some good quality stuff here Broken Social Scene has a new track out titled halfway home it's not a bad cut though it does seem like Broken Social Scene as usual in a lot of ways you know it's kind of that straightforward slick sweet indie rock with a lot of instrumentation behind it has that grand sort of presentation to it that's pretty nice on the ears forests words has a new album out around the corner arms out is sort of a very new somewhat lush experimental and very strange instrumental to come out of this forthcoming record that doesn't sound too bad anthrax has a new cover of Kansas's carry on my wayward son out that is very true to the original so true to the point where it's like why why'd you even record this I mean you know aside from the slightly newer and punchier and more modern slicker production there's like not much to this song that kind of differentiates it from the original you'd think they'd go fucking a full-on thrash with it you know but they really just kind of pulled it back a little bit and just kind of stuck - stuck to the original blueprint and you know if you're a if you're morbidly curious and an anthrax fan and you're looking forward to this looks like it's going to be on some kind of like leftovers b-sides album could potentially land on give this thing a lot give this thing a shot rather messing up still and finally in this segment I want to mention the new amber Kaufman track no coffee I know a lot of people have sort of been anticipating amber released something in the wake of the latest Dirty Projectors record considering sort of how personal that was a record for David and how that sort of went into the relationship that you know sort of crumbled between him and amber and while there are some notes of love and you know kind of a relationship on the rocks kind of thing going on on this track you know people could relate it to that could be another relationship I didn't read that deeply into the lyrics you know could potentially be it's all I'm saying you know if you're looking for that sort of thing you may in fact find it but what sort of struck me the most about this track is that amber really goes into like a 60s 70s vocal like a not vocal 60 70s vintage vocal pop thing you know it's got a bit a bit of a pop soul sound to it that the instrumentation is little rickety but I think her vocals like really lend themselves to this sound like if the instrumentation were a bit more lush I think it really could have made the song pop but her vocal performance on the track is very good and I didn't know you know her vocal versatility could go in that direction it is a decent song you know it's a decent ballad definitely give it a shot give it a listen it's a pretty tune and finally I want to get into what I thought were the best tracks of the week just a handful over here songs that really wowed me I want to give a shout out to this new naked naked nathan fake song small city lights this is a really like hyper texturally overwhelming and somewhat kind of glitchy electronic piece that definitely has me interested in what nathan is doing on this new record of his it's very exciting it's very again hyper it's very I would say futuristic and it's a lot going on on this track I love sort of the experimental nature of it but there's a sort of sweetness to the sim pastures that that kind of make it like candy nice sweet experimental strange candy that I like quite a bit Joey badass new track out raga Baraka by rockabyebaby featuring schoolboy q that track banger extraordinaire I do think the Rockabye repetition on the hook is a little obnoxious not not one of joeys best written hooks though it has stuck in my head a little bit but still Joey's performance on the verse monstrous he's in your face you just come through like he's hungry and schoolboy q I like his approach to this verse I mean not only did he have some good clever wordplay at the very start of his verse but I love how the beat kind of just fell back a little bit and he did like a semi acapella thing right at the start really kind of gave the track a lot of dynamics because you know you are kind of progressing through a lot of changes on this song they could have easily just kind of played it straight forward and had schoolboy huge go just as hard as Joey did on the track but instead you know he kind of like built up to the aggression at the very end of his verse which I thought was really kind of creative move on this track so really looking forward to Joey's records coming out very soon people are telling me a leaked and I'm hoping that you know all the hype around whatever Kendrick is doing in at the end of the week you know his record doesn't get smothered and all that because Joey certainly a talented artist so you don't want it overlooked even when an artist like Kendrick is releasing like on the same day I want to give a shout out to the new alt-j track in cold blood which I thought was one of the best tracks of the week awesome to hear alt-j coming through with material that's a little more lively given just how low-key their last album was it was pretty I did appreciate how cerebral it was much of that album but I'm liking that they're coming through with something a little bit more lively a little bit more dense a little bit more energetic reminds me of some of the tunes of some of the material from their debut album but a little more mature and finally I got a shout out a track I didn't think I was going to be shouting out at all but that is the new logic track everybody a song that and finally I want to shout out a track that I did not think I was going to be shouting out and that is the new logic song everybody now logic you know I've seen the talent I appreciated his music I've always thought that he was pretty decent I have seen the hype but he has never stuck out that much to me I never thought he was terribly special this song however did kind of stick out to me not only because I thought the beat was really unique I love the groove of this beat I love how heavy the bass was I thought how the vocals samples on this thing were chopped we're really interesting but logic really hones in on a topic here and that is sort of race and racial identity sort of honing in on everybody you know it's kind of kind of unifying people beyond race on the hook and then sort of diving into sort of how people see him as being either black or white because he's mixed so he sort of comes at this with an interesting perspective sort of painting himself as you know not being black enough for the black people are being too white for the black people being too black for the white people sort of seeing discrimination from both sides in a way and I think the way he explores that but also kind of tells off people who just cannot get off the identity politics bandwagon on this track was pretty bold it's not a message a lot of people want to hear but I think it's a truthful message it's especially his truth I think and I loved hearing especially hearing it uh put so bluntly and put so passionately on this track that's going to be guys all of those songs linked down there in the description along with our amazon link our turntable add link hope you got some good recommendations out of this video I will see you in the next one and the next best worst tracks video will be in the normal spot I hope so see you later forever 
9Bm2mwJVvsg,Anthony otoño here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the new goldlink album at what cost goldlink is a DC rapper singer songwriter his latest full-length album record that I was kind of curious about but also had my reservations with getting into because his last album made it on my worst records of the year list could not stand that record not going to go too deeply into it now I could waste this entire review rehashing what I dislike about that album but this new album over here I am NOT embarking on this review on my own I'm going to be talking with a fellow YouTube reviewer fellow music critic music reactor mr. Sean C check out his YouTube channel down there in the description he makes a lot of great videos and brings some some interesting insights to his reactions to ok ok ok alright let's get into this thing transition and here we are through the magic of the Internet I'm sitting here with mr. Sean C and we're going to talk about this new golden link album over here to kick us off can you kind of give me your general thoughts on the album thought it was an improvement on the last record thought it was better thought it was worse what did you think um well basically from hearing his last record I listened to that one pretty early on in 2016 is this and this is lat his previous one yeah the oh and then we didn't speak anymore or something like that I think he does and I was you know kind of mixed on that one because I thought it was a little bit too much singing and it gave me like the impression that maybe he just should stick more so with rapping because his singing voice doesn't really hold that much weight for me but going into this record I thought he's got a pretty pretty general idea where he wants to go like he wants to represent his city he wants to put you know DC on the map maybe it's like a forgotten town or maybe he feels like he isn't the hero that DC deserves but maybe the one that they need in a way because he really references out a lot here with a couple of tracks or he mentioned there are a few things that are indigenous to the DC lifestyle but I feel like he also like kind of goes into discussing a lot about his own personal life more than the DC aspect of the record and lobbying a lot of end up stuff yeah like some like track number I believe it's like three almost he mentions it like a lot throughout the album but there's a point where it's just like back-to-back relationship songs and since I already feel like his singing voice in or harmonizing it just doesn't hold that much weight for me it just comes across like he's this motionless lifeless being on a track sometimes and that can really like suck the life out of a song for me and I experience I don't like her side story and I think the other one was a what was that one have you seen that girl yeah that was about being that girl yeah that was like the what was one of the worst ones for me because I would imagine myself like if I were a girl and there was somebody talking to me like that yeah I would be so annoyed the whole time you get sounds like he's in your ear and he won't stop there's like good things I like about that track but yeah none of it has anything to do with his rapping you know or his lyrics you know I think the beat kind of cute and I like the hook I think like a more kind of happy-go-lucky more positive rapper could you know someone with like a bit more of like a I don't know maybe not exactly chance the rapper but someone more of his shade someone with more like a you know kind of a bright sort of uplifting attitude would have done a lot with that track but like he doesn't strike me as a particularly sunny rapper so that that track kind of does stick out is a little awkward yeah it's extremely awkward for me because um it just it's not it's not like he his lyrics are bad or like anything like that because he's definitely like a really I wouldn't say like he's this amazing rapper but he's definitely somebody who I would like set a bar for and he reaches that at the very least for what I would consider like it what you need to have to be a good or a decent rapper and I think you know like there are tracks on here where he goes off more so he doesn't like a darker side like you said he fits better on I would say beats that are a little bit more dark and chilling like on the second track it opens up you know pretty strong with him I would say rapping again decent nothing too crazy with the lyrics but he knows how to flow and I feel like he you know how knows the direction where he wants to take a song seem like in general their way grittier tracks toward the end of the record than there were at the start I mean yeah the Kokomo freestyle hit me as easily one of my favorites on the entire record and we will never die with little dude I thought was a really gritty track too and little dude was like you know rapping about drink and lean and all this other stuff like yet he had we probably the grittiest vibe of anybody who was featured on the record though I do give it to you on the second track what sort of struck me about that is like Cicero kicks that that track off and again yeah and and it was good but it's just like you know it's it just struck me as weird that this is your album and I'm waiting such a long time to like even kind of see that you're around you know what I mean you did have that intro track that last a little while and sort of set a weird kind of eerie tone and then the track kicks and is just like okay this is like pretty good like what are you know where are you and like you know what I feel like this track I mean it could have been deeper into the tracklist you know and and it wouldn't have made any difference to me you know that it wasn't really anything about this song that said to me this is like this is the start you know especially since this doesn't exactly come off as like a story album you know what I mean I think I'm what that tret I think again he's just trying to like go with emotions I guess was what it's like to be him or you know maybe he's trying to just say maybe this is what it's like for you know life in DC maybe that's what he's trying to say in the very beginning but I thought on that track specifically like she worked so much better because at one point I think where his part ends in the hook or the chorus she comes in and it almost seems like he's singing background to his own song because her voice is just so I guess prevalent on the track in my opinion like she really really dominates on that track for me and I don't think it would work at all if she wasn't one there for me yeah but then there are other tracks on here that are like even though I feel like he's good and he's a really good capable rapper there's some tracks on her that just strike me as like why would you do that like on her side story it sounded like it opens out and I'm you know I'm okay with it at first and then he just this one feature I forgot who would put his name less he comes in and he's giving me just like a strong partynextdoor vibe almost and hmm it seems like almost like he went and woke up and said you know what I'm gonna brush my teeth I'm going to put you know a whole shitload of Listerine in my mouth and I'm gonna gargle it and then I'm gonna hop on a track and just start singing and it seems like he didn't even like put that much vocal performance in it it was just seemed like really off to me like and then there was two versions of the song they released one in November I believe in a realist is the one yeah the gold link is on this one I actually preferred the one that they released in November even though I didn't like a song it was still I didn't think it was that great because gold link again click some of the life out of the track I mean that is one of the tracks that stuck out to me as like this could have been much better if you just gave a slightly more impassioned performance yeah because I mean for a track that's so obviously a love song it's not so much one of the tracks that as far as relationship songs on this album and there are a lot it seems like they're kind of bogged down in a lot of drama this track seemed a lot more upbeat and a lot more kind of like you know more genuine feelings of love and kind of attraction but like that just didn't really come through in his voice you know and that's the thing it's like he constantly wants to kind of come in this direction but there's like nothing all that warm or inviting about his voice or his tone or his inflection you know it was almost like something kind of monotone about it like you were saying earlier you know like you kind of hangs in the back of his throat and he stays here an entire time again there's nothing like all that attract to the sound of it like you know considering the the nature and kind of the subject-matter of these songs like you would think just based on concept alone you would be able to like put this on if your girl was around right but like this isn't exactly an alpha album I put on to set the mood or anything or you going to put on a mixtape like hey girl this an instantly make it like ruins the mood and kills the vibe and you hear somebody that's supposed to be I guess making this song so passionate and sexy and just I want to rip the clothes off again you hear ideas just leo many lines like that he's just like no yeah just like he gets on you just like let me suck all the life out of this track as humanly possible and that was a the one on meditation the one I didn't know and I'm being one ever since serious when I say this I never knew there was such a thing as boring dry at lives I did not know that could be possible that's funny because what as you say that and I'm thinking of the track I can't even remember there being an ad-lib there goes like I remember I remember the point of the performance but like I can't even remember an ad-lib like when I think about the track don't even recall an ad-lib happening yeah he started it and I'm like what are you doing this this makes the song like unbearable for me you get your flow your delivery none of us changing and then you want to throw these two dry you know redundant ad-libs in here that don't make the song any better they don't improve the flow they don't do anything for me or for your track and just doing it I don't know why um that just ruined it for me I thought that the message of the song was like it was going in one direction for me hmm and I get like some of the love songs on here again with a DC vibe that he's trying to paint a picture like if you're in DC if you want to be in a relationship you might come across that situation where you want to be with a girl but she's from a different part of DC and we're gonna have issues kind of communicating and being with each other because of you know our C's kind of separating us but that's where it stops like his voice doesn't you know have any it doesn't invoke any emotion or any thought in the listener is just it's just there you know it doesn't work on majority of these relationship tracks you know I I will probably go in a little harder on this record as we get deeper in the review and and I really disliked this last album but before I do I do want to commend him on a couple things I want to commend him on the fact that he is not singing as much on this album he sang so much on his last record and it was terrible he's leaving a bulk of the singing to his guest singers on this on this album and his and his features and a lot of his features are good a lot of his featured rappers and a lot of his featured singers are great I think Maya on role cat on roll call is really good it was amazing and he was really good she was really kind of made that song I think the guest singing on the song summertime was really good that track not only did I kind of like I'm laid-back darkbeat but I kind of liked how that that R&B flavored hook kind of took me back to it sounded like like an old-school West Coast kind of like California yeah like it sounds like an old-school West Coast song that would come out of the 90s that would've been like a great Radiohead like in the summertime and I actually liked his flow on that track too I did you feel about him wild lays verse on there I you know wale I thought was fine you know the thing is I think I think I liked his performance but it was just kind of more of the fact that the expectations for performance on this album were set so low to begin with because there's so many underwhelming performances from goldlink himself you know so when wall-e comes so when wale comes in you're just like oh well you know this this is like this is a change of pace and that's what if they like what I was saying earlier um summertime is an example of you know at least a handful of tracks that I really like a lot of things about it but none of it had to do with gold links verse on the track you know what I mean like his flow is pretty decent but like I'm not like totally enamored with his lyrics I'm not like blown away by what you know he's saying you know their spots of his flow like I said that get a little melodic that I thought were good but then you know their spots or there's the one spot the parable of the rich man where he insists on and right from the get-go it sounds awful and it's just like yeah it's just like you're squeezing an auto-tuned cat to death on top of that it sounds like he's rapping over what is just like a it sounds like a beat Tyler the Creator would have made if he knew so little about music theory that all the keys and everything in the chords were so dissonant and just like kind of mismatching and like a really on an unpleasant way now for that track do you think that that could have been a point because I did I listened to that sure I probably like four or five times and the minute I heard it I was like oh this is a little nasty this will you know it's either you're gonna scream it at one point on the track when he's like kind of it sounds like he's arguing with his girlfriend and he's like I don't know what you're doing she's like you know what you're doing and you know I kind of went after her I I don't remember if she if he says or if the I guess voice actress or whatever I actually says that her name is does he say that her name is Lucy I can't recall um but in the very beginning like in the whole opening of the track I'm like this is really twisted this is dark yeah this is uh you know kind of weird in the mood it sounded like it's coming from like a really awful mindset and I'm listening for the track and so you know the female voice I guess whatever comes in and she's like uh you know I know you and he's like I don't know you from anywhere we've never met and basically she's recalling all these events that she was never actually there for and I actually find out like a little bit of research that he's you know trying to portray this woman as the devil and that's why the track is so like dark and twisted I would really love to see like a music video for this because um it is really dark it is really you know really discombobulated kind of all over the place like you said he's like a cat screeching at some points it could be like um you know really really bad but I think in a way that's the point to show like the instability within himself and you know to show kind of an outward definition of what's going on inside as he's talking to this demon or this devil because at one point her voice gets like really really low-pitched and as when I'm like that doesn't really sound like a girlfriend being angry that sounds like somebody's trying to like kill you almost and they want you to like really pay for what you did um and what this track I just think she's going into or whoever he's talking to this demon or this devil is talking to him and he's for calling all these events and now they're showing up at the very end of the stage and his lacquering saying like you owe me and you know he's not willing to pay obviously but I thought the narrative of the song I think it's only really good for like one or two lessons I don't think it's like it doesn't have much replay value but I would really like to see a music video for this what do you think about the fact that I mean at least to me and I'm glad that you brought that whole kind of narrative thing and concept of about that track because it kind of leads me into this question that I had about this album for you I mean just kind of judging from some of the lyrics judging from some of the song titles here and especially the cover I mean it seems like going into this album he wanted to say something and sort of put an album out that was really profound and making some kind of statement and I feel like even though I've listened to the record numerous times I didn't really come away with it come away from it with like some kind of moral or some kind of message that kind of wraps the entire album up or something you know what I mean I mean if there is you know some kind of message to be had and certainly you know that song does deliver one he doesn't kind of consistently stick to it throughout the entire record there's so many tours that you're kind of left wondering like whew like what's what's the point you're trying to make here you know and not just from a message standpoint but from a you know just the sound of the album - I mean the song hands on your knees is such a weird detour where you got kind of this weird throwback funky disco style rap beat and this dude shouting over it like a hype man on a Kurtis Blow song you know I'm just like waiting for him to go somebody screwed and it's just like such a weird moment it just last two minutes and then it's just out of there and it's like I don't know you know like just from listening to what surrounds that track I'm just like what like where did that bring me what are you trying to tell me what moment you know and there was another spot where they were like you know gunshots that you know sort of like ended a moment on the record that I was like okay is this like the beginning of a story or something or is this like you know you're trying to like tell me something about what you were just saying here you know it seems like there are moments where II references a narrative or like at least a loose narrative that's in his head but it doesn't play out on the record all that clearly yeah like like one that song with the DJ as you said um me feeling like um and I never mentioned the album cover to ever like album cover but um me feeling like he's trying to give a strong vibe over strong reference to DC with this track that DJ track I didn't feel like it really gave me anything he's trying to paint a picture as if some of this stuff it's indigenous to DC and it's not and so when you hear a track like the one where it features the DJ I'm just kind of put off like I could literally go to any party when I was 17 years old hear some something like that and I'm like why does this deserve to be on the album you know what does this give me what story does it add has it had any narrative to the life of DC and I didn't feel like it did so I didn't feel like it needed to be on the tracklisting there are some other parts on here where he slowly kind of inches into um you know referencing life in DC like um the track that features low dude and you know instance is a verse on there was pretty good I think even though I know he couldn't have got him I think low dude didn't really do anything for me uh honestly if he really could have is the first and only time I would prefer somebody like Gucci Mane on the intro of that song and then you know goldlink come in and he do his thing and you know again he's given more some references to DC but it's not strong enough to be like oh this whole album is like really cohesive and you really met the mark when you were trying to let people know about your hometown I didn't feel like that at all with this album you just just put a bunch of tracks together and I guess maybe you wanted to have a concept but at the end of the day you didn't really deliver any message yeah and I mean I pretty much feel the same way you know although again even though I'm pretty indifferent toward this record I don't dislike it as much as his previous one I do think in a lot of ways it's an improvement I think on this record he clearly has a better ear for production there's better song structure on here you know even when their mums were he underwhelm as me there's a decent beat a good hook or in appearance from another person comes in and it's like you know it's at least listenable and yeah another thing that I want to give him something that sort of makes me continue to hope that maybe in the future he he improves on this stuff that actually comes through the great record is that he's one of the few artists out there who is really trying to go the distance with this hip house sound you know because there's so many beats on this record that you know maybe they're a little jazzy or something like that or you know different musical influences but they a lot of them had that driving forward of the floor kick drum and that's just not something you catch a lot of rappers on unless they're trying to like overtly make some kind of chart-topping party track you know and he's like trying to make this low-key somewhat thoughtful somewhat profound mostly personal hip-hop music but with those clear house influences in his instrumentals and again that's just not something a lot of rappers are doing right now yeah I got to give him a lot of credit for that because um as far as sound is concerned this thing does stick to I guess what he wanted it to he definitely did like have a lot of cohesive sounds in this project I thought like there was an inference because so cohesive I thought that there was nothing on here that really reminded me of any of the previous tracks um I don't really think about anything one here again after I heard it you know later on down the line uh but again like it just leads me to question what he's really trying to do because are you trying to get me you know like you said the hip House vibe or are you trying to give me the sound of DC like it's a sound of DC that you're trying to give me or is this you know your own personal thing that you want to do yeah and I just don't come away from it like clearly understanding the concept of 100% getting where he wanted to go because sound or any of the project even though I thought it was decent I thought it was pretty you know it's it's good for repeat lessons I would say but I just didn't see on it being very cohesive when it comes to the message and the sound again it's good it's like you said it's very unique and he's probably one of the only ones especially him being from DC I don't really know of any prominent figures from DC you know right now doing anything but especially him being from there I think you know he's definitely doing a good thing with that sound okay um I think we'll leave it there I personally am feeling a light disease at 5:00 on this thing pretty indifferent toward it but again I sort of come out of this a little more hopeful than I did his last album what were you feeling on the project um you know originally before I came into this I would have given it a four but you know going back and forth with you I think I would give it a five as well alright uh we're going to leave it there Sean's YouTube channel is down

JxVBmNpYtYM,hi everyone comedy bad you know here's the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's uh no time for review from your boy of the new video sound machine album who you who you video sound machine are a musical outfit that I've been following since their days on sound way records a label that uh when I heard they sign these guys I was really happy because they were a contemporary group some new fresh blood sound we records love them to death but much of their discography is compilations of older records from long-lost artists from across the world Panamanian Calypso High Life from Ghana even music from Thailand and that's just the tip of the iceberg now there are newer groups on there to own the trope because one of them just reviewed their new record check that out Meridian Brothers as well that's just the tip of the iceberg to a video sound machine was not just an exciting group to me on the label because they were a new group but also they presented an interesting fusion of West African funk and electro and disco and synth pop I love their debut single let's dance but thought the debut album that followed this single was a little lacking the grooves were there the performances of frontwoman Eno Williams were certainly enthusiastic and very entertaining I just wish the album had been a bit more instrumentally dense wish there was more of a structure to it a little bit more girth this new album though this sophomore album this is that album this is the record the band has jumped from sound records to merge records on this one and that they have released this record god it's huge there's awesome synth textures and sound effects on this thing plenty of guitar and bass awesome rhythm section hallelujah this is the album I wanted from these guys it's my groove dream the chemistry between the band members I can handle it and the way the live instrumentation melds with the electronics on this thing it's like a grilled cheese sandwich all melty delicious and it's been years since I've had a grilled cheese I'm vegan thank you as I'm listening to this record I'm catching elements of Fela Kuti or Tony Allen with Afrika 70 or even like William Moni bore his records had all kind of crazy sense all over it but but there's definitely a bit of a Western flavour to the way that they arranged the instrumentation to certainly elements of synth pop on this thing as I said earlier caching influences from groups such as Talking Heads I think even LCD Soundsystem fans would get a lot out of what's presented here so many of my favorite things in one place and I'm so happy about it of course this album is loaded with these high-octane dancefloor dominators that feature endless rhythms and kick manipulating bass lines a kaleidoscopic array of synthetic sounds flying at you from every direction fiery horn sections slick rhythm guitars some sweet synth leads that pop in to add a nice awesome memorable theme melody - and otherwise just very kind of linear groovy track give me a reason the opener to this thing is the most fun I've had with four minutes of music at the start of a record this year hands down you know he know does a really great job of coming through with the hook evoke refrains all over this thing whether she sing them in English or in the video language which what I read on the band's previous record is what she sings a lot of her lyrics in and you know this record isn't just all completely about the grooves about the instrumentation you know there is some storytelling to these tracks you know specifically on the song the chant where inna was singing about this girl who it seems like she's going through a time of stress and she remembers this phrase from where she comes from her sort of this phrase that reminds her of her cultural roots that kind of keeps her going empowers her and as she kind of makes reference of you know oh she remembers the chants she has in her head then they go into the chant this amin amin i and it's really a catching moment in the track this long the pot is on fire also really energetic this track is filled with so much crazy wooden and metallic clinking clanking tinkering percussion it's so overwhelming and of course this is driven by these throbbing gurgling bass that the cisors that are just different continue to contribute to could top that with some tom fills god these songs are so Nicole and again to go back to eNOS vocals I just love what she's doing on this record not only is she performing better when it comes to just straight singing but a lot of these tracks where the instrumentation is so intense it's almost like she's kind of playing this role of not just singer but also bandleader and her energy through her vocals is kind of whipping the band up into a frenzy get him to play crazier I think her vocals have more of a pop appeal this time around and there are moments where there's almost like an amateurish Punk enos to it especially on the song Julie where the band essentially throws an instrumental left hook here with this driving milky bass line these kind of distant roaring guitars and some kind of cavernous drums it sounds like something off of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures but then with some of the trippy synthesizers that have been playing throughout the record he knows a bit via language some bright horns and a bass solo I was not anticipating the band effectively kind of seeps in these West African music influences these electro influences into a sound that I had never would have associated with these with these genres ever and there's something about eNOS singing and even the bands playing on the track sunray it kind of reminds me of little dragon especially a lot of the synthetic dancey kind of chill linear stuff on their last record admittedly I do like it a little better over here because the instrumentation is a bit more dense and lively I was underwhelmed by so many tracks on that latest little dragon record sadly the intro on the track the power of three features these tight little bass features and these funky horn sections that are totally worthy of like the introduction to a James Brown song again there's so many great high-energy moments on this album but a video sound machine did to care to work some more subtle and low-key tracks in the tracklisting here they didn't want this to be a somewhat one-dimensional affair like their debut album was however this is where some of the issues on the album turn up for me the song cries kind of a dreamy vocal piece set to a gentle drum machine very pleasant very easy and sweet on the ears and it's kind of short it works as an interlude but it feels kind of odd sandwiched between two of the most intense tracks on the entire record especially with it being the second to last song doesn't really add a whole lot to the flow in my opinion on the song one that lights up while I love the groove on this track and I think this also features one of innos best vocal performances with her trying to go in more of a pop direction a little bit the band doesn't really escalate the groove or kind of bring the intensity of the performance here anywhere they just kind of stay at this one level of intensity through the duration of the whole track so it doesn't really move up doesn't really move down so the band is left with no other choice other than just kind of let the tracks fizzle out at the very end I kind of feel the same way about the song quiet as pretty as that song is and as interesting as a moment that song is as it's really one of the most atmospheric tracks on the entire record with these very sad kind of lonely guitar Peggy's of setting the stage for you know singing out of all the quiet tracks it's really the song lullaby that hit me the hardest the song has eerily quiet intro like sensual whispers all over the mix some chilly synthesizers a very gentle gentle dance beat eventually the rhythms pick up the instrumentation gets a little more dense but it still remains very subtle and when the track is a full volume it's kind of like I'm listening to some modern contemporary Nigerian bands take on synth pop from the 80s because the finished project is so glossy and so pretty kind of has a sheen on it like a lot of the music from the 80s did but that rhythm section is so funky this is the abyss aound machine album that I wanted this would be a video sound machine album that I knew the band had the potential to make when I first heard them this is the abyss aound machine record that fuses together so many exciting Jean is in a really electrifying creative and almost mind-blowing way they tried some new things on here too sure every single one of them didn't go over amazing but overall I still think this is a really great record easily going to be one of my favorites of the year feeling a strong strong eight on this album transition is a biggie of the sound machine album some West African banger put for the via the UK they're from the UK technically but whatever you guys are the best what do you think of this record did you you know love it did you hate it would you think now what would you think videos next to my head that I think should check out subscribe to the channel official website - love you love you love you catch in a new video catch a nice video forever 
HCSMKDtaZ10,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm going to do a quick track review a quick thought or two on this new Kendrick Lamar song humble that just dropped really enjoying it Kendrick Lamar Compton rapper hopefully he doesn't need much of an introduction at this point he's recently dropped what could potentially be the best rap record of the decade - bit of a butterfly shortly after that he proved even as b-sides are gold with untitled unmastered and just about a week or so ago he had released that the heart part 4 track clearly a track that was not an album track more of a promotional track more of a track to get people hyped up but something that people were also kind of theorizing over not just because it was a great song and a good performance good verses on that track an interesting couple of different sounds on that song too because it does kind of transition and three into three different parts but I digress also some of the lyrics on that were kind of aggressive kind of confrontational seemed like he had a certain someone in mind many people theorized Big Sean could completely be the case people think that there's like a drake beef around the corner - potentially as a result of this track maybe I don't know I'm not going to get too deep into that I'm just going to talk about this track over here so this song drops and instantly what hits me is I'm getting the sense that it's it's like every time Kendrick has dropped a track you know taster track for a major album before now this new track over here humble it's very simple very straightforward track it's got kind of a minor key gritty little piano riff a bouncy the skeletal simple beat and the hook doesn't really have too much to it either you know it's just a repeated line there's a seem to be any kind of added depth to what he's saying in his verses by the hook though I do think you know the song in a way is kind of a statement on bragging and hip hop music Kendrick bragging as an artist kind of choosing to brag at this point in his career where he's had so much success astonished people so many times so many great releases and potentially also continuing to build on that narrative from the heart part four you know not just talking about rap music in general being braggadocious talking about himself being braggadocious but also telling this person who he has in mind to be humble sit down be quiet you know I'm telling you what to do I'm the captain now you know that kind of situation the verses themselves I've read through them again and again I've listened to the song over and over and there doesn't seem to be anything in terms of like super deep we need to interpret this again and again and again super crazy subterranean subtext here you know again it's a pretty straightforward direct track again to talk about the point I was trying to make earlier with the tracks that Kendrick released before an album backseat freestyle people heard that track and thought oh he sold out he's making it dumb down sell out track that doesn't mean anything and then you listen to it in the context of the album it's like BAM it means a lot and it's in the context of the record one of the deeper and more meaningful tracks on the entire album same thing with the song I a lot of people saw that is this really dumb sunny peppy pop rap soul fusion Kendrick sellin is sound up the river but then again when the album came out we got this raw gritty live version of the track and it means something to you know it's all about self-esteem and building yourself up and you know loving yourself in the context of this record that's all about kind of going through this personal evolution you know and then finally coming to that final conclusion of self-esteem so I don't want to project too much onto this new track over here because who the hell knows what the it's going to mean in the context of this new record you know it could mean nothing whatsoever this could be Kendricks pop record this could be Kendricks baggers record a lot of artists often when they come out with their most conceptual smartest deepest record you know they go a little straightforward they go a little direct and even if Kendrick doesn't do that on this new album he's certainly done that on this track you know whether or not it adds the narrative of the record I don't know but it seems like he wanted to come through the track that was direct it was catchy he was going to turn heads I was going to snap people into position and get their attention and I think it's certainly done that not only with the song itself being so simple and straightforward and our hitting but the music video is a mine it's just all over the place with the the shot with all the flaming heads it was probably the weirdest thing I had ever seen and even though it wasn't one of the odder shots like it didn't it didn't like what was going on wasn't all that strange but that one cut where he was sort of in the black top or the black turtleneck and turning his head as the camera was kind of zooming around him and he was lip-syncing to the to the vocal track was like really weird just the way the camera was kind of moving it made me kind of woozy and it was just an odd moment the one spot musically that kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the moment when he was getting shot on that bicycle getting footage of him shot on a bicycle and you kind of had like the the super fish eye lens effect going on Flatbush zombies and trash talked to that in a really great music video and I feel like in Kendricks video didn't really add anything to the flavor or the the story of the video I guess you could say but I digress you know I'm just talking about the video at this point and that's because the track again it's pretty straight forward I mean he's super braggadocious on the verse there's a lot of great wordplay and I think I'm you know some good double entendre is here and there in the first verse and the second verse he gets a little more meaningful in the sense that he's talking about beauty standards going natural Photoshop amongst other things so it does seem like he's getting a little bit more socially conscious at the moment in the second verse there but other than that you know again there's not a whole lot to you know kind of a savor on this song it's really just kind of a track that you put on sounds great kind of gets a the energy going and everything and just a good listen you know it's not one of these tracks that you just like pontificate and again I think that's a little refreshing here from Kendrick Lamar usually his stuff is so dense usually his stuff is so thoughtful not that I look forward to him or I encouraged him to dumb his music down or anything like that but it's nice to kind of hear him put at least a couple of songs on each record where it's like this is the hit this is a straightforward song this is the banger and you know that's one of the best things about Kendrick you know he's so great at making music that has accessibility to it but there is a deeper meaning to it you know the thing is like to make meaningful music to make thoughtful music it doesn't necessarily need to be this super experimental off the wall thing you know if you do in an authentic and a relatable way people will listen and as long as you also prioritize the music you know like you may have a message you may have a meaning you may have something you want to say but the music's gotta sound good the sounds got to come first you can't just like you know say some you think mean something and put it over any instrumental put it with any hook you know not everybody's going to want to listen to that you know you got to make a sound that people want to hear first and you know I will leave it there you know get a lot of good things about this song thought it was a catchy track got me hyped for the album not only do I think the song sounds great but I'm looking forward to how it's going to sound and what it's going to mean a shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the tracks on this forthcoming record so I'm going to leave it there thank you for watching you're the best full or ever 
1GRf65B6-Qw,hi everyone welcome to a new zyk review of the latest album from own betrayal pika the record by lai Bucanero buck and arrow with anyway this is the second full-length album from this Colombian music supergroup and amazing undertaking spearheaded by will Holland producer and bandleader Mario Galliano Toro both of them are multi-instrumentalists who play in the band itself whose first record in 2012 featured upwards of 40 musicians on the album 26 complete tracks on the deluxe expanded edition of this record this project is huge it is gigantic so many songs so much material so many musicians and not only is this album and amazing tribute to the history the sound the roots of Latin music but also this is a really modern record in a lot of respects too there are tons of tracks on this thing where the band fuses cumbia or various shades of South American folk music with rock music with funk with jazz some hip hop some ska little reggae now I love this record I loved this record when it came out one of my favorites of the year but how could such greatness be repeated again because the sessions that went into this album were so huge against so many musicians from different cultural backgrounds from different musical backgrounds different ages to getting the stars to align so perfectly on the second album here in my opinion could be like winning the lottery twice though it does seem like will and Mario did their best to make the same magic happen again the bands approach on this album is clearly more measured than it was on the debut this album by comparison is just 15 tracks just an hour of material 35 musicians on the record and for the most part I think the band sticks pretty closely to the cultural roots of whatever style of Latin music they're playing on any given song on this record now that's not to say this record feels limited I mean there's a ton of variety across the landscape of South American music so many folk music and dance music styles and there are moments on here where they're fusing that with funk and with jazz but there are as many surprising or weird or out there genre fusions on this record in my opinion outside of some of the material that they recorded in one of the two locations featured on this record old Providence island which from what I read actually is a pretty thriving reggae and dancehall scene so you do have a couple tracks on here trust in and come back again where you have this Latin music that's Latin instrumentation mixing with the sounds of reggae and dancehall which makes her two of the most stone-cold and kind of laid-back and somewhat grey tracks on the entire record especially with the vocalists especially with the rapping but overall I'm just not hearing as many risks on this album I don't feel the production or the instrumentation is quite as vibrant either the heaviness and the denseness of the instrumentation on the debut just does not feel like it turns up on this new record very often there are a few exceptions campesino is certainly one with its bright horns it's great accordions the dreary little background choral vocals that are kind of a little dusty there's some punchy rhythms on this track and a really dramatic top-notch wee vocal the kind of guide listeners through the song I'm equally enamored with the song Dame Adama which is way more straight back in comparison but still colorful still bright a very funky ballad I'll be plucking Metallica lead melodies all over this track as well as the very bright warm soulful passionate chorus harmonies on this track too the vocals and lyrics also take a center stage on the tracks commotion and hummingbird and what makes these songs stand out in the tracklist is that we actually have English lyrics on the song here the simmering sensuality of the song commotion kicks the entire album off really well the song hummingbird is quite sad quite dreary but easily one of the most beautiful cuts on the entire record compare any one of these cuts to a song like estar contigo where the band is kind of locked into a single groove they're jamming on it a little bit the track is taking a slightly funkier jazzier approach it's very linear there's not a whole lot to speak of in terms of structure it's really more about just kind of creating a groove creating a vibe but it's just the way the band goes about doing that that really rubs me the wrong way with this galloping beat set against these kind of tired old man vocals you know I hate to sort of you know throw them under the bus like that but they're not very good I think they would have sounded better had they been wrapped up in some brighter more interesting instrumentation but for the most part aside from the drums the other sort of focal point on this track are these kind of skipping glassy semi ambient keyboard chords that last for almost the duration of the entire song the track feels really hollow really empty there's there's not really a whole lot exciting about it because these keyboards just kind of sound like I'm listening to some sort of completely unrelated ambient piece playing simultaneously against just a Latin rhythm section and weary old vocalist the vibe gets really old really fast and for whatever reason this is one of the longest songs on the entire record there are some other cuts that are equally linear and they do a little bit better of a job of keeping the heat up keeping the intensity up keeping the energy up but not by much the song has a lip so for example while this does start off like a very solid piece of Latin jazz with some shouting passionate vocals kind of guiding us through the track by the time the solos come and we start you know getting some solo trade offs going back and forth I think the I don't know the momentum of the song really kind of suffers especially since some of the horns especially the guitars on the track are not mixed all that well they sound a little muddy I'm not sure if this more rough punky kind of on the fly and lightning in a bottle direction complimented tracks like this in the in the track listing all that much it's kind of forgivable on the song caldo perreo where the performance actually is intense actually is fiery the rhythm section on this track is insane there are these twang ii kind of dirty dusty guitar leads flying in every direction all over the cut and there are these wild kind of squawky woodwinds that play throughout much of the track to that I love the performance is just fire I wish the recording and the mixing was a little bit better a little brighter a little more vibrant but the performance is awesome it's just that the the other cuts that sound you know just as kind of dusty but are played a little bit more laid-back a little more reserved they really kind of fall into the background for me even with some touches of dubby weird experimental effects or some quirky guitar synthesizers or some kind of rhythmic gimmick to give the song a little bit of character or personality like on the song bogota where many of the lead vocals and the background vocals to sort of get washed out in these echoey effects that make the track sound like some kind of you know latin music dream scaped almost in a creepy way unfortunately this album while there are some really good things about it it's not the modern sleek bright and almost overwhelming sound that I loved so much on the band's debut several years ago and I don't really think there's quite as much chemistry between the band members on this record as there was in the past I can't say how much personnel got swapped in how much got swapped out maybe not many if any at all but there were certainly more cuts on this record where it just felt like the playing came off really kind of mild there are a few more exceptions that I could mention like a cumbia Bucanero the second half of this track is super fast super intense really great playing the closing track on here just a moment while it is not one of the more intense songs it is a very sad lonely guitar piece played very dramatically to end the album off in a tasteful way the horns do quite a bit to enhance the the power the grandiosity of this moment on the record and the track malaria is an awesome trumpet accordion jam you know it's moments like this that are so it just feels like there's such an intense trade off back and forth between each musician on the record when they're soloing and the rhythm section is just blazing it's just moving in such a hot fast click it spots like this that I just can't get enough of on this record and just don't understand why there weren't more of the performances just don't feel as consistently muscular as they were on the debut and you know for sure there were a few tracks on that record that we're kind of goofy were detour ish we're one offs but you know they definitely provided some quirk and some character to a really long massive track listing of tracks that were just so incredibly produced so incredibly written and performed these weird one-off tracks just did a great job of padding out the more central cuts on the record it just doesn't feel like there's as many central cuts on this new album over here there's just less this time around and that's not to say that this record is a total disappointment or anything like that far from the case onda trophy came out with such an amazing immense album from right out of the gate even though I was looking forward to this album I was still sitting here thinking how can they possibly live up to it how could you follow up an album like that it's I would be afraid to I would be afraid to and that's not to say that they can't come out with another great record in the future it's just that with this new album over here they're clearly trying to make an album that's a little bit more manageable a little more straightforward a little more concise and maybe in a way appealing to a wider audience with some of the songs here being played in a somewhat more conventional way and then you have those couple of tracks that incorporate dancehall and rap music I appreciate the band trying to do something a little bit more direct on this record I personally prefer the grandiosity of the previous project hopefully the band can return to that but even if they don't I hope this new direction kind of works out for them because ultimately at the end of the day I would love to hear more music from these guys regardless I think what they have going here is such a special thing and they're one of the few notable and sizable projects out there right now that are really starting to scratch away at a lot of North America's own interest and lack of knowledge when it comes to this style of music if you're unfamiliar with these guys please check this album out regardless of what I've said about it and definitely give a listen

B6Pyfe5yrtc,renovate an O here the Internet's busiest musing nerd and it's time for review of the new Paul Bearer album heartless Arkansas metal band Paul bear is back with their third full-length album it's out now on profound lore records I caught on to these guys back in 2012 with the release of their debut full-length album sorrow and extinction I like to sob them a lot I didn't think it was amazing at the time though the band was to a degree providing a breath of fresh air to the growing trend of doom metal at the time taking a more traditional approach but still sounding every bit as heavy as their contemporaries but Paul bear was way more melodic by comparison the band took special care on a lot of the tracks on this record to lace them with these epic really soaring and inspiring guitar solos often harmonized with another guitar it was just really colorful beautiful nice nice on ears very pretty however it was kind of one-dimensional though it seemed like while the band's bag of tricks were good there were only like a few tricks sitting in there not only that but I found the vocals on this record to be kind of lacking not all that much character to them and they were buried behind the guitars a lot of the time on their sophomore record Paul Bearer came through with pretty much a sequel to their debut album you know that this this album is very much like its predecessor in every way shape or form I just kind of took this record as Paul beare refusing to take those few very tiny but necessary steps to actually come through with a distinct sound a distinct record heartless though is Paul bearer's most varied and ambitious album yet finally the band is taking some risks they're bringing some other sounds and influences into the fold of course as usual you still have the band's monstrous riffs good chord progressions soaring singing guitar solos that are that are playing on top of all that but the progressive rock influenced the band's music is always showcased to a degree I think turns up in a big way on Harless for example before the huge gigantic monolith the guitar come in to smother the mix on the song dancing in madness the pristine guitar solo passage that kicks the entire track off for two minutes sounds like something out of the Pink Floyd playbook and there's some other very nice subtle moments on this album spots where the huge riffs kind of melt away and give way to some prettier guitars some spotlighted vocals but also there are spots on this record where Paul beare has never had so much bite the chugging riffs and shouted vocals on the track cruel road are absolutely visceral and menacing same goes for the devilish shouts on the song dancing and madness which is the track I referenced earlier it's really a multi-faceted song numerous passages to this track not only the shouted spots with very raspy vocals but there are spots where the vocals sort of reach these really expressive soaring passionate highs like I'm listening to a power ballad or something I kind of get that same vibe off of the opening track of the record - maybe not one of the most bold songs and the track listing here but I certainly do again get that vibe I get a prog rock vibe off the track live survival as well while the lead vocals kind of sing this old archaic somewhat funky melody seems like another nod and the band's discography to Jethro Tull it really feels like the band is so focused on writing these directional consequential songs they're not just getting lost in the riffs and kind of kicking back and letting the melodic lead guitars do most of the work case in point the song plea for understanding one of the most epic tracks on the entire record has this beautiful really toned down moment where the vocals are spotlighted like I was saying earlier set against a very beautiful shimmering guitars from here from this very bare-bones moment in the track the band eventually turns up the heat brings the track to a boiling point with these climactic rushing almost crescendo like dumi riffs I've never heard sort of dumi guitars kind of grow and blossom in the way that they do on this track it ends up being a really epic grand gorgeous finish there are a few spots where I feel like the band is kind of falling back into their old ways a little bit as I said earlier the song I see no end doesn't exactly reflect the more ambitious and colorful approach that the band is taking on this record feels like Paul beare by-the-numbers in a lot of ways with the exception of the vocals and the song thorns while it does kick off with some of the most badass riffs that have ever been on any pallbearer song ever as soon as these melts away it kind of feels like the band mellows out a little bit too much and the song loses its momentum a bit the vocal performance is one of the most memorable on the entire record either and they just kind of fall back behind the heavy guitars once again but despite those couple of complaints I do think this is Paul bearer's best album yet again their most ambitious and varied album their longest album to the most epically structured tracks of any Paul beare album so far the production on this thing is certainly better than anything the band is released thus far the vocals have improved greatly in terms of their sound their variety the emotional sort of quality of the vocals this thing is for the doom fan this thing is for the progressive rock fans is for the psyche rock fans too if you're looking for something heavy and monolithic but also melodic inspiring something righteous something really powerful then I would definitely recommend giving this thing a listen I'm feeling a light eight on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next take a look if you like please subscribe and please don't die just keep on watching the reviews stay alive stay hydrated stay healthy all sorts of videos and links next to my head I think you should check out official website you know subscribe to the channel all that stuff forever 
NjbWyn-h-Oc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you review of the new Mount Airy album a crow looked at me this is the latest full-length LP from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and home producer extraordinaire mr. Phil elrom who has recorded tons of music not only under the Mount Erie label but also the microphones at one point he has been involved in other projects as well and I'm not going to mince words or waste time I was not looking forward to reviewing this album and not just because it was going to be a tough review but because it would most likely be an even tougher listen and that is not due to some kind of artistic change of direction that I didn't care for on his last couple of records or something like that no instead it had everything to do with what I knew this album was going to be about I'm talking about the very recent death of Phil's wife Jen viev and incredibly personal loss that was made very public when Phil and Jen Viet sought out fan donations to help pay for cancer treatments last year and after that GoFundMe had successfully surpassed its goal by thousands and thousands of dollars the news came of her passing and that was incredibly heartbreaking but that death that traumatic event in Phil's life that was not my reality even though I felt bad for him I felt sad for him I had donated to the GoFundMe page my life went on as it did Phil's was forever changed I didn't really know what to expect from Phil from there on out what I definitely did not see coming was that in a very short amount of time he would have an album ready and also make it very clear what the album is about with the first teaser track from it real death I guess on the surface it shouldn't be that scary to review or listen to an album that seems to face death in a really personal or head-on way there are plenty of records in the past that I've touched on that have done the same David Bowie's black star to che amore Stage four or even the latest Sufjan Stevens record Carey and Lowell but I guess a few things make this Mount Erie album really special at least for me person only I been a fan of Phil's music for a long time I interviewed him once that seen him live on numerous occasions a lot of his music has a very personal place in my life I own much of his discography I'm aware of how silly it is to feel like you know an artist because you listen to a ton of their music but you know I I still can't help but feel that way at least a little it does feel upsetting to know that he's been so deeply hurt by what he's singing about on this album which he you know gives us every graphic detail of his pain and suffering and anguish right down to the proximity of this death to him in terms of time because there are numerous spots on this record where Phil says you know it's been a few days since you passed away it's been a few months since you passed away it's been this many days in this many weeks since you passed away and you know what if another thing about this album separates it from really any other record about death about passing away about mortality that I've ever heard it's that you couldn't really argue that the album's in question weren't meant for entertainment entertainment is not a word that I would put onto this album at all I've heard a couple people trying to put the album down and critique it as not even being music I don't know if I would sort of lob that critique at it it's most certainly music what I think this album is not is entertainment and while sometimes Phil does have a very nice interesting well-written poetic turn of phrase on this album there's not very much about what he's saying on the Trekker that's metaphorical there are songs on this record where he's literally reflecting on his wife dying and withering away in his arms or before his very eyes he is taking out the trash in the bathroom months after she's passed away and it's full of bloody end-of-life tissues as he puts a Albums of this emotional magnitude typically have a track or two that you get an emotional gut punch because you've been listening to the narrative you're listening with the storyline it's kind of building up to this really intense emotional climax and it's like man you really built it up and then you just just I just hit me with that really poignant or sobering statement on death by contrast every single track on a crow looked at me is an emotional gut punch in fact it's multiple gut punches within a gut punch I think it's about as close as you can come using music to literally living through someone else's emotional trauma now musically this record is very stripped back it's very slow it's a very skeletal album it's very acoustic a lot of the time there are a whole lot of layers to speak of on these tracks and you know that's not to say that you know maybe this debt sort of pushed fill in this direction to the super stark direction not necessarily the case because this album reminds me of a record that had come out previously in mount Airy's discography dawn a very underrated and underappreciated record in the Mount Airy back catalogue a record where Phil had holed up in some kind of remote Norwegian cabin for the winter and just kind of strung all these songs together many of which were based on these very abstract poems you could tell that the way the songs were constructed the words very much came first and the music and this really linear but also kind of repetitive fashion just works as a simple skeletal acoustic foundation for these words it's very much the same here phil is getting really poetic he's kind of lyrically strolling his way through all of these very subtle simple instrumentals now by comparison a crow looked at me musically is a little more dense occasionally you do get an electric guitar a drum machine some bass or a piano there are some overdubs but usually when another piece of instrumentation gets added in it's so quiet and I will say one more thing about this Don comparison on the second-last track here Soria Moria Phil makes direct reference to being in that Norwegian cabin and leaving it with a letter from gen via and the way he framed this it almost sounded like this is where their relationship either started or got really serious and it's just I don't know for me as a fan just really crazy that her death caused him to kind of go back to the sound either because her memory sort of pushed him there or her passing away is so isolating for him and so life-changing for him it's like the emotional equivalent of being sort of in that lonely desolate winter cabin I will say though you know musically I do think the instrumentals here are beautifully assembled they're very gentle like many microphones and map theory releases they have a very kind of rickety and very natural characteristic to them I don't want to get too deep into the lyrics because god they are hard to listen to though I feel like I be doing this record in this review a disservice if I didn't at least try to talk about some of them even when Phil is saying something that I think is really beautiful really moving it does feel intense like this one moment here where he's talking about spreading her ashes I brought a chair from home I'm leaving it on the hill facing west and north and I poured your ashes on it I guess you can watch the sunset but the truth is I don't think of that dust as you you are the sunset now the pacing of this verse is much slower than I just said it so the way these words pour in you can really think about and digest each line as he's moving through the tract as he's strumming his guitar and the moment when he says I don't think of that dust as you is a really significant point for me on the record because it just makes me think of what why do we think of this kind of cremation dust as people you know it seems like you know for people who we love for people who we cherish it's a really weird way to kind of consolidate them or boil them down into this thing that just doesn't really have all that significance and the grander scheme of things you know comparing someone more to a sunset or something like that seems so much more fitting for the people who we loved so much in our lives and it's another moment on this record that really reminds me of that dawn record because Phil leaves the song off with this really strong poetic phrase and a single kind of sour off chord that's kind of outside of the progression or feels like a weird change in the chord progression also the case on the song my chasm which also has a very abrupt ending where Phil finishes the song off with some of the most intense lines the entire record the loss in my wife is a chasm I take into town and I don't want to close it look at me death is real of course when he says that final line Phil kind of kicks himself out of the very even somewhat monotone vocal delivery that he delivers much of the album in he kind of goes up a few pitches and cracks his voice to go death is real which I don't think I need to explain it's pretty heart-wrenching the way this album is written and performed it sort of forces you to mourn with Phil through his strange but very understandable coping mechanisms through this really terrible time in his life as he makes references to pictures of his wife or reflections on what could have been had she lived or a very sad moment on this record where his daughter is asking him if mommy is swimming now and some kind of imagined afterlife or talking about being unable to stop talking about her with other people a moment where Phil asks himself blatantly to the people around me want to keep hearing about my dead wife at one point Phil mentions that a counselor that he and his wife used to visit died two months after his wife had died out of context I would have assumed that this was just some kind of tasteless twist in the plot of some sort of dark comedy but no it's the insane and unfair reality that Phil is living on this record now being that this is a mount eerie album of course they're going to be numerous references to nature throughout this thing we have Ravens and crows and trees and various plant life and dimension of a fly as well all these things serve as symbols or just kind of background painting to set the mood of the situation or maybe even a memory trigger for something that had happened in the past the song forest fire does this better than any song on the record in my opinion a track where Phil directly compares this forest fire happening on the edge of town to the situation he's going through currently saying that the forest fire is a natural cleansing devastation burning the understory erasing trails making parallels between the devastation of deaths and devastation of nature you know I don't think I need to tell you that there is not a glimmer of hope there's not a ray of sunshine on this entire album at least in my opinion and not that you can't learn from death or losses that are incredibly personal but the thing is Phil wrote and recorded this album so near to this very tragic event that he hasn't even had the opportunity to work through all of it to come to terms with it to move through what I guess you might call the five stages of grief because on this record he's still very much in the throes of depression he's still very much in the throes of frustration with the situation that he's going through and there are many moments on this record where I kind of feel like he's dealing in denial - not in denial of a reality he's clearly understood what has happened in his life but there are moments where he still thinks she's there or at least it kind of feels like that that feeling of loneliness hasn't quite set in and there are other spots on this album where he openly sort of rejects wanting had anything to do with what he's going through right now he doesn't want to learn from this he doesn't want to understand this he doesn't want to deal with this and as the listener I very much felt like that - you know which is part of why listening to this record is so hard now if I were to try to analyze this album from a very cold and calculated perspective I think it succeeds by every metric that I usually judge other albums by in terms of it being cohesive and conceptual and well-written and interestingly mixed or produced but I feel like simply coming on here and being excited and telling you guys hey this is a good album this is a great album is kind of like a lie because there's nothing good or great about what this album is about and just to add something here that very much seems to be the takeaway that Phil wants audiences to have on this record that he wants them to learn on this record that death is not this thing that like on most albums and most art is not something to get triumph out of get glory out of simply is some kind of growing or learning experience Phil is trying to reframe it as the dark depressing scary isolating a life ruining thing that it is and you're going to feel that pain with them if you decide to sit through this record you will maybe it would be easier if this is the first time I was ever listening to a Mount Erie album or Phil's music or something or maybe it wouldn't be I'm not entirely sure all I know is that I can't get away from the feeling that when I put this album on in some kind of weird way whether I'm doing it intentionally or not I'm kind of basking in his pain or something and I get that Phil recorded and willingly released this album you know it's not like listening to this record is voyeuristic I mean Phil is obviously telling his audience what he wants them to know about this situation what he wants them to know about his feelings but again I have a hard time sort of listening to this record and the way that I would any other album because for me it just does not qualify as entertainment in the way that 99% of the music I review on this channel does because as I listen to this album I don't feel like I'm listening to an album I don't feel like I'm enjoying music I don't feel like I'm just kind of sitting here and indulging in some kind of artistic experience I feel like I'm working through a really horrible thing that happened to somebody you know I don't listen to this album and again really enjoy at least in the traditional sense what I'm hearing all I can think is that I just want Phil to be okay I just want him to be better I just wanted to be able to work through this I just hope he's all right at the end of all this you know I just listen to this and I don't want this album I just don't want it not because you know there wasn't anything good about the record artistically it's because I just don't want what the album is about I just don't want it to be real and maybe in that sense Phil succeeded with this record because that's very much sort of the perspective and the tone that he takes with the song wheel which is not only probably his real feelings on the matter but also in a way a moment of atonement for him because phil has had his share of songs in the past where he's singing about death where he's singing about being in this void where he's singing about mortality and you know even though it was really dark in the past when he would reflect on these matters now it feels even more grim it feels even more real because it is real this time and it's scary and that's all I really want to say about the record while the album I think is very difficult and it is very inaccessible listen and again if you do enjoy this you will not enjoy in the way that you normally enjoy other albums the fact that this record put me in a different emotional place for many other records that in and of itself makes it an interesting listen makes it a significant listen makes it a really important album at least from my perspective you know that's one of the great things about art in my opinion that it can kind of create these new mental avenues or it could kind of push the envelope of experiences that you feel like you've had emotionally that's one of the great things about art in my opinion that it can kind of create these new avenues of emotion and thought even if the direction those avenues go in aren't necessarily comfortable if there are any spare critiques that I could throw at this record I mean there are a few spots that maybe instrumentally are a little bland are a little redundant and with the fact that Phil recorded and just sort of put this record together so close to the moment of trauma that this album centers around I feel like we don't really get a full picture Phil didn't really give himself an opportunity to organize much of what has happened process much as what has happened it makes for a really intense listening experience but I still feel like I come away from this record with less than a full understanding of everything that's gone on everything that Phil's going through and how this experience is going to impact Phil's life going forward I'm feeling a decent too strong nine on this album transition have you given this album a listen what did you think of it did it sort of hit you emotionally in the way that it did me let me know down in the comments and there are all sorts of links and other videos

GnLciv6GeXE,"hi everyone its Anthony Fantan out here the Internet's greenest music nerd does this shirt make it really hard to green-screen properly for this video I don't care if it's messing up a little bit that's totally fine by me it's sort of a weird one-off video where I'm listing off my picks for Record Store Day 2017 yes Record Store Day the day when we are mercilessly price gouged for rare exclusive reissues and limited editions of records that US record collector types really want to get our hands on god I can't wait to see the flipper prices this year on eBay you if you flip this you're trash there is a link to the Record Store Day website down there in the description box where you can find a list of participating stores if you want to you know sort of get up really early wait in line just so you can get a copy of the new Corey Feldman 7-inch yes I will most likely be participating something might come up but if it doesn't then I am going to be on the lookout for these things right here that I'm going to list in this video also of course you know there are many more releases than this one I'm talking about here on Record Store Day down there in the link below you can find a full complete list of everything that's going to be coming out released and featured in a lot of the participating stores this year first we have a cover of all together now by the Beatles performed by Andre 3000 none other than Andre 3000 being released on a 7-inch I believe he recorded this a long time ago for a commercial so that will be pretty cool animal collectives meeting of the waters eep which is a sort of live recording that the band tracked in the rainforest that would be nice to get your hands on there's also a self-titled reissue of Moondogs Moondog big L's Devil's son EP this is an EP centered around a track that's kind of a bit of a horrorcore precursor a song that was deemed too controversial and edgy for his lifestyles album that he released so that will be pretty interesting big release for Big L fans David Bowie the bow promo little split record is getting released something that was put out to kind of get David Bowie's music out there a label mate as well they are sort of doing a recreation of repressing of this sort of whites Lee white label record that is a piece of very early David Bowie history also a David Bowie cracked actor live in Los Angeles in 1974 album is getting a release the Kerr greatest hits and greatest hits acoustic are getting a release that will be pretty interesting a Dillinger Escape Plan 7-inch that is an instrumental cut of the song disassociation or dissociation rather from the band's last full-length LP check out that album if you haven't already it's the band's final album we are also getting a reissue of the germs 7-inch single a lexicon devil excellent Punk song if you have not heard it Sharon Jones with the e L Fields gospel Wonders heaven-bound single yes they are dropping a 7-inch here rest in peace Sharon Jones releasing a bit of gospel music which will be nice big release for the DAP tones records fans Sharon Jones fans a Motorhead live album clean your clock is getting released MUNGO JERRY a reissue of his legendary in the summit Dom where to where there is not a single is getting released Mungo and a lot of the people from the UK were cut from a similar artistic cloth I think are a bit of an underrepresented part of UK music history because we used to have all of these skiffle bands yes look into skiffle music before the Beatles were playing rock music they were playing some skiffle and you know it's kind of I mean I can't accurately describe the music myself I'm not an expert in it but I do know some of the groups some of the artists that recorded in this style of music and it's not very you know well talked about you know when the British Invasion happened with you know rock and roll from the UK that was really kind of like the big selling point that was the UK's big contribution to music in that era but prior to that and around that same time too there were a lot of these skiffle groups that don't get quite as much credit I think Stevie Nicks has a rarities collection coming out also a reissue of notorious b.i.g s 1999 posthumous release born again and prints with little red Corvette in 1999 that's getting a single reissue and there are actually an assload of prints album reissues coming out this year sign of the times Purple Rain all that stuff a lot of his biggest releases from that era are getting a reissue there's also a nice Ramones 76 to 79 singles box set that I'm kind of interested in Slick Rick's the great adventures of is getting a reissue as well if you are hip-hop completest or if you if you have not heard this album ever you consider yourself a hip hop fan please do yourself a goddamn favor and listen to that album Patti Smith's 7-inch for the song hey Joe is getting a reissue which will be pretty nice a son raw rarities compilation under the name Janis is coming out I'll be on the lookout for that Talking Heads is doing one of those seven inches where you have a big hit from the band and then on the b-side you have another group covering that song in this case it is the band Wilding and the song that's getting covered here is this must be the place Toto has a single for the song Africa getting reissued love that song and it's a reissue of the songs picture disc so it's like the whole continent of Africa like lodged right next to sort of the disc of the single which is actually like really awesome and aesthetically pleasing I would really love to get my hands on that as I stated earlier there is a 7-inch for the song go for it featuring Snoop Dogg Cory Feldman's big awesome hit from his latest album angelic to the core I I will tear off heads to get a copy of this on Record Store Day don't get my way don't get in my way of that goddamn corey feldman single all that's all I'm sayin if I come away with anything this Record Store Day it's going to be that Corey Feldman various artists Space Jam music and inspired by the film I believe I can fly and all the other major hits you remember from that space stamp stamp track on vinyl the the black lips are coming out with a cassette box set of all of the album's they dropped on Vice records so the for Vice Records albums that they have released are coming out in a fun little box with all the cassettes in there I already own all of them on CD and vinyl so and I don't know if I'm going to spring for the box set but I guess it is an interesting thing to know exists and you know there are a lot of cassette heads out there and the black lips are just rather black lips they've come out with a lot of Records on Vice so you know look out for that dark throne has a picture disc coming out of their last album that just came out last year Arctic Thunder I don't know what the I was thinking why I didn't end up covering that I'm stupid Klaus dinger and pre Japan Dorf have a collaborative album that is a previously unreleased stuff Klaus if you didn't know is one of the masterminds behind Noi one of the great German krautrock groups that should definitely be appreciated and checked out if you have not gotten to their stuff already we have a group that I was unfamiliar with but I'm going to try to get into a called noise addict these guys are a bit of a like from what I read in the description over here like an Australian punk history it's there there are kids band they're all young kids but as of losing their stuff they have all this like demo quality Daniel Johnston kind of stuff and they have all these punk tunes and all these grungy tunes where it sounds like they were listening to a lot of Nirvana too you know every every decade or so there's at least a couple of these like you know bands where everybody in the group is like aged 10 to 12 or something and it's looked at as kind of a gimmick or a novelty but these kids like had some serious like songs and collaborated and you know worked with some notable artists in the punk scene and sort of a you know ours who are making some good stuff during the 90s and I don't know just over here in the u.s. we don't really hear them I'm talking about the band noise addict in the release in question here is 10,000 kids with guitars what I heard so far on it again sounded pretty good keep an eye out for this thing because you know it could be a bit of you know a gem a bit of an undiscovered thing for a lot of people over here in the US that are looking for a you know cool rock obscurity The Flaming Lips on board the Internet they have what is described to be here as a live ish sort of project over here of tracks from their latest record being reimagined as a fictional fantastical live Flaming Lips performance on the International International Space Station pressed on orange vinyl don't know what that's going to entail I didn't really care for their latest record so what a live version of it as imagined on the International Space Station would be I don't know but I'm sure those hardcore Flaming Lips fans are going to find out and finally a Frank Zappa is doing or rather the people who own the rights to his music are doing a ten-inch reissue for the song Rollo and on the b-side there is a the Portland improvisation as it is labeled on there and those are basically all the releases I'm going to be looking out for again there are many more many more Record Store Day releases to be had and mentioned some of which were mildly in you know appealing to me but I you know couldn't just list out everything on this on this list also a shout out to blow fly one of the dirtiest rappers ever to exist in the history of music has a next LP coming out that depending on how raunchy and disgusting it looks I may or may not pick it up and and and from what I see in the description here it's also double grooved on the side that has the grooves on it so the needle could land on one song on one groove or it could land on another song on the groove that is etched into the record parallel to it so you have two grooves running side by side throughout the whole side of the record not sure if you guys understand what I'm saying but a lot of different artists have done this a lot of groups of you know sort of experimented with groups over the years and you don't really I think a lot of people don't fully understand it until they like own one or see a record that does that and sort of you know kind of see it in action but you know if you do get an opportunity to get your hands on that and you don't know who blowfly is definitely look him up because he's a madman and that's that's everything I wanted to mention in this video you guys are the best I hope you have a good record store day I hope you guys get your hands on some of the stuff that you're looking out for and save me a goddamn copy that Corey Feldman save me a copy of that Corey Feldman please please for the love of God that oh that's it record Seward a transition let me know down in the comments what your record store day list pics

qoSOmF_PWw4,ha hi everyone the affordable care act here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new remo drive album greatest hits minnesota emo upstarts remo drive they are here with their debut full-length album I've been excited to see what these guys would do as far as an album goes ever since I heard their song you're killing me which was attached to an awesome music video on YouTube that I hyped up during one of my best worst tracks segments a lot of people in my audience took to the song took to the band was really happy to see that especially since it felt like what the band was doing on that track it felt like they had something special and I'm just going to come out and say this for the emo kids out there this is most likely going to be your album of the year I'm just saying it most likely your album of the year if you're one of those damn emo kids and it's because of what I've been saying all along in a lot of my recent emo reviews if these new bands that are trying to keep the torch lit want to come out with a great record want to keep the genre alive it's going to take more than some messily play generic guitar chords and some noodling math rock weeds and you moaning your way through whatever poetic word salad you've written up you need a song you need a structure you need a memorable refrain you need moments where not everybody is just you know trying to play as hard and as emotionally as they can at all moments from the start to the end of the song if all you want to do is vent get a diary you're recording an album you're recording music act like it Remo Drive made a good emo record here because they came into this record with good fundamentals as evidenced on numerous tracks on this album backed with quality memorable hooks relatable verses with smart lyrics that you can actually hear and you know some like really fun explosive performances not just on the song you're killing me which is a fantastic indie rock barnburner definitely one of the best singles of the year driving guitar chords on this thing climactic chorus which is build up to with really dramatic verses that are densely packed with hilariously self-destructive lyrics and at the 1:20 point in the song from then on we kind of get this really cool fun instrumental so the track is well-structured but we get kind of a surprise too I'm so I'm trying to fool you we have some in-utero ish heavy grungy distorted guitar chords it's a bit of a cool 90s throwback but the band takes the edge off of that with some pop punk vocal and guitar melodies and some what was me lyrics about feeling like an asshole and saying goodbye on the song I'm my own doctor we have some kind of weird neurotic hypochondriac type lyrics maybe it's metaphorical not totally sure all I know is it's not the typical lyrical affair that you get out of an emo tune maybe if you read deeper into what's being said here you can pick up messages about feeling imperfect or wanting to fix problems about yourself that you're imagining the song art school is a good opener to love the lyrics on this track and the rowdy verses transition awesomely into these ascending and descending guitar riffs and the song summertime has this loud soft kind of hmm quality to it that reminds me of some American football and God is there a lot of get up kids influence on this album and the band may have also heard of a little record called Pinkerton just to guess they might have might have heard it in passing like maybe a friend of it theirs was like playing it at a party and for whatever reason the lead vocal melody on the song eat kind of read to me is like musical theater I am singing like this brother doing five boy you know this is a good rock album it's a good debut album for the band it's been turning heads and I think it will continue to with underground rock fans throughout the year and since it seems like the band is getting quite a bit of attention off of this record hopefully they can springboard off of this into something even better because if I am being honest with myself I do think greatest hits while it is good is far from perfect the band does drown in their influences quite a bit on this record I feel and while they are true to the emo sound do I think they reinvigorate it do I think they carve out a distinct sound within it not consistently at least the production on this album I feel is somewhat lackluster the guitars and vocals are especially brittle and that gets really grating as album draws on and I think there are some performances on this record that could have been re-recorded or edited to sound a bit smoother where the drums and the guitars don't quite line up when you can tell they're trying to do some kind of syncopated hit to build up some energy but it falls a little flat namely on the song crash test rating which is kind of a shame because that's one of my favorite songs on the entire record kind of the same thing with the track name brand where a lot of the build ups and drum feels just feel kind to off I mean the drums especially on that track sound like they were captured on a single microphone on the other side of the room from the drummer instead of like being properly miked with every single drum you know while it would be nice if Remo Drive did do something a little more musically adventurous and a little more refreshing I think this album and whatever the band comes out with in the future would be greatly improved if just the recording and the mixing was better and cleaner and the band had actually you know made sure that once they left the studio they had their best and tightest performances that they could do because again I think there were at least a few tracks here that could have used maybe a different take but having said all that I'm feeling a life 7 on this record really excited for what the band is coming out with in the future and doing from here seems like they're off to a great start and hope you guys feel the same toran mission let me know down in the comments what your record store day list picks are looking like what are you going to be looking out for this Record Store Day and I will manage to put some related videos I think you should check out next to my head striction official website too and eat your fruits and veggies on on Record Store Day stay hydrated so you don't get stuck in the line and then you get thirsty and then you got to leave the line to get a drink and then you lose your spot do you know bring a bottle of water you know make sure you stay warm and toasty and that you know you're good take care of yourself take care of each other I love you forever

sent out a lot of these things people love them believe me believe me and that does it for all the in this video let's get into the music Kendrick Lamar the heart part for Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar out with a new single it's hot it's polarizing people are talking about it it's controversial it's a song in three parts really kind of with this smooth awesome neo-soul flavored intro something that could have been on to pimp a butterfly but the lyrics here are really telling awesomely set the stage for the song as Kendrick sorta repeats this refrain about don't tell lie on me or I won't tell the truth on you so he's coming through the threat with someone in mind someone who's been lying about him someone who's been talking trash about him haven't quite figured out why but then in the second part of the song where the beat gets a little harder we get some light guitar kind of twinkling away in the background Kendrick gets super aggressive and really starts kind of calling this person out saying directly that my fans can't wait for me to like you know really like step all over you and like destroy you want to track and I'm not sure 100% who's talking to a lot of people have been saying Big Sean and while there is a bar later in the track where he kind of very snarkily mentions jay-z I think it's Drake I think he's talking about Drake I mean I can only imagine that he would be calling out somebody who he hasn't sort of gone head-to-head with or proven that he's better than on a track although you know he has done a song with Drake before I thought him and Drake you know everything was good with them I'm not entirely sure you know all this rap beef stuff it's so subliminal at this point unfortunately you know but if it did end up being Drake that'd be pretty entertaining some people are citing that it could be Drake because of the the list line on here Kendrick Lamar saying that he doesn't care about being on a list he's on some other shit or he doesn't care about a list rather and I thought that meant like you know like a best of albums list or top albums of the year like you know like a list of like who did the most numbers on Spotify or something like that that's something I thought he was sort of reflecting on with the awesome line on this track when he says you know there's accomplishments and then there's astonishment and that's totally something that to me boils down whoo Kendrick is as a modern hip-hop artist you know there are all these rappers out there who do these numbers and you know they fill the seats and they get the Spotify strainers but then there's astonishment and can't say that to pimp a butterfly was anything less than astonishing and that astonishing continues to be sort of a bar that Kendricks sets for himself with everything he releases and that's no exception with this track I love the many points in the song where it seems like Kendrick is spinning bars but then overdubbing lines raised like second-guessing himself and you hear a paper crumpling like he's destroying what he just wrote and trying to spit out another line to replace that line like just another moment where he kind of using sound paints a picture to go along with what he's rapping about or the emotions that he's feeling at a particular moment in a track there are a lot of great memorable bars on this track but the sad thing about this song though is that it does not sound like an album track you know just kind of sounds like a hype up track to tease toward either a new album or whatever Kendrick is going to be doing on April 7th because for the end of the track he specifically mentions April 7th as a date where either this person he has in mind has to get their shit together or his listeners his fans have to get their shit together to pay attention to or get ready for whatever he's going to release whether it be some kind of direct call-out to this person or a full-length album and if it does end up being like a full-length studio like completely finished front to back record it that's going to be fucking amazing I can't even handle that like it's untitled and master just came out to the butterfly just came out like give me a second to breathe if he ended up dropping another incredible record and I think it's totally within his ability to do so that it would just so solidify him as one of the most significant rappers to do it period not just of this decade but like ever in the in the genres history and I'm going to leave it at that I love the track excited about the track and whatever Kendricks going to be doing on April 7th you know I hope it happens I hope it pans out and just looking forward to what this ominous warning me now as far as these Gorillaz songs damon albarn saw fit to drop four new tracks from this upcoming Gorillaz album now if you guys remember that song hallelujah money I thought it was okay you know it was decent I wasn't so sure if instrumentally Damon had complimented his guests benjamin clementine all that well though I did love Benjamin once on the song I was looking forward to hearing more cuts from the record because you know I wasn't blown away by that one necessarily and these four tracks over here I'm glad that he sort of gave us a bigger picture of the album rather than just another song because this is a long record it's like 26 songs or so interludes full tracks and all so you know even though we are getting a slightly bigger picture it may not be an adequate picture because maybe the whole album flows together in a really you know awesome epic way or something you know but if we're to sort of just take these four tracks as they've been delivered to us and sort of analyze them for what they are at least at least me from my perspective I think for the most part they're not good I do not think these tracks are good to be completely honest with you and let's take it from what I thought was the weakest of the tracks and that's we got the power featuring Jenny Beth of the post-punk band savages now this track to me has one of the worst hooks that Damon has ever strung into a gorilla's track the big overblown chorus vocals singing that corny ass whine about having the power to love everyone and dadadada and not only that the song is just like really colorful it's really fruity it's really over-the-top um Jenny Beth was the voice who you wanted to have on this track like her weird freaky vibrato does not really complement the bright really kind of almost blissful vibe of this song at all you know not that I think that Jenny Beth did a bad job I think what Damon did was a was a bad job of incorporating her finding a point on this album where she could really kind of play to her strengths instead of shoving her into this position where she has to kind of contour or apply her voice to something that doesn't necessarily sound all that great with her vocal tone or her vocal style you know maybe it's just because I've heard her over so many savage's tracks that is kind of weird to recontextualize her here I'm open to that potentially being the the case here but still the the hook is really cheesy and uh just just not a very good look now the pop cans song over here Saturn's bars I thought it was okay you know but it didn't really feel like a gorilla to me at all I felt more like a pop can track you know because he really dominates the entire song the instrumental to me isn't really anything to write home about and again while I did like his performance on this track there was anything specifically about it that to me red is like oh man this is a gorilla's song this is a gorilla's track this is sort of where that ability for Damon to work with anybody and sort of you know collaborate with somebody on a track you know really kind of comes to life you know to me it's one of the more lackluster collaborations here because there's no chemistry to speak of because it just feels like pop can dominates the track now the the track ascension which I thought was a little better featuring DRAM was really excited to hear on this track dran presence on the song in contrast to popkins is so subtle I would have almost never guessed he was on the track had I not been told you know sure his sort of bright eccentric vocal harmonies do come in and do play a factor toward the end of the track but almost everything up to that point it just kind of feels like I'm listening to a slightly more electronic version of the sad kind of underwhelming tracks that Damon was laying into his past couple of solo records so this another song I was underwhelmed by unfortunately the only track I really out of the store that I liked that I really enjoyed was the vince staples one ascension then sounded great on the track the instrumental itself had a lot of character to it I thought the supported Vince really well and had kind of a quirky eclectic vibe to it that enhanced Vince's personality because he is kind of a unique rapper he does have kind of a left-field vibe to his flow into his delivery he's definitely the kind of rapper who I could see flourishing and really benefiting from a gorilla's song because you know they're instrumental typically are really unique and Damon does do a great job of finding sort of those weird rappers that have some strengths mainstream appeal but also can get a little experimental get a little weird that's why vince staples again I think is perfect for a project like this and you know not to see that pop can dream and Jenny Beth aren't I think they most certainly are I just think Damon didn't really do that great of a job of incorporating them into these tracks I think DRAM could have had an entire like verse a larger feature on this thing I think pop-can would have been served best on this track if he had dominated a hook or something and Jenny Beth could have done with something a little space here a little a little weirder a little more I don't know eerie or dark again I don't really think the instrumental of the song here fit her vocal style so you know to me right out of the gate gorillas are kind of really failing it what up until this point they've done so well and that's work with a plethora of different artists work to their strengths and incorporate them into your music in a really effective and amazing way hopefully that ends up being the case on some of the other cuts on this record because there are so many great names on this album if you look at the tracklist of us so far between these tracks and the benjamin clementine track the only song that i think went off without any hitches whatsoever is this vince staples song so again unfortunately you know i have to tell you guys how I really feel about this stuff and I just got a report that I'm not really that into these tracks you know I'm not going to count the album out or anything because there's so many songs on it you know you can't really count it out just based off of five tracks that's just a fifth of the album there are there 20 other songs and interludes to listen to so I don't know hopefully these songs just kind of end up being minor moments on the album and the rest of its incredible the rest of its incredible that's all I'm crossing my fingers for moving on from these tracks I want to shout out the new show me the body mixtape give that a listen link is down there below it's free gave their a album body war review not too long ago these guys fuse Punk and hip hop and metal and Noise music they fuse so many different things together and they do such a good job it's so creative it's so off the wall and I want to review this mixtape pretty soon so give it a listen get your ears on and get familiar with it before I'm talking about it and moving on from there I want to talk about the worst tracks for the week my least favorite tracks of the week I did list a couple over here I want to give a shout out to the new David Guetta song over here light my body up featuring Nicki Minaj and little Wayne you could expect it's just a really trashy hip-hop EDM fusion with some corny ass bars from Nicki Minaj and little Wayne throw it in the recycle bin please I'm sure it has millions of views on YouTube I'm talking right now the new blondie song long time is just another track off of this forthcoming album that to me I don't know it's Blondie's vocals and it's the instrumental production on here something just feels off it feels awkward it feels kind of flabby it doesn't feel all that toned like a good dance song should be it doesn't feel all that groovy or energized like a good dance song should be it just feels kinda like something's missing like something is missing I can't quite put my finger on it maybe it'll become a little more obvious to me when I hear the new full-length album but something just feels missing but easily the worst track of the week and surprisingly want one of the most ignored tracks the week I mean it did get some attention amongst her fans but it's just got so little traction in comparison with all the singles she dropped from her last album and that is the new Iggy Azalea song Moe bounce now at first you know I was listening to the track and I was like you know this isn't do bad you know at one that when the track first started the grimy loud banging beat the mounts refrain that kind of was getting chopped and looped a little bit throughout the song her verse was okay you know she sounded fine on the mic I'm not praising her lyrics or anything like that but the thing is this song gets so annoying so fast it's it's like you know these days when you hear a good visceral banger you're like hell yeah fuck you know this is this is good you know it's loud if I could just kind of ignore who's responsible for the banger it's it's listenable but the more that Iggy started rapping and the more that I heard that Moe bounce refrain repeated again and again and again and the less I heard the instrumental like progressing or doing anything significant in terms of change as it went along the more I was like okay wait no this is just annoying and that's what makes it the worst track the week in my opinion so there you go Iggy Azalea Moe bounce in the tracks that I thought were you know meh but certainly worth shouting out I talk about the new Chuck Berry song big boys featuring Tom Morello of all people I guess Tom Morello is on this track playing a little bit minute you know a little old school rock and roll shit a Chuck Berry rest in peace he died like last week a lot of people didn't talk about it or at least I missed it completely I was just not online that day I guess sure I was doing something else I mean I'm sure you probably could go back and see that I was online but forever reason just didn't come to my attention you know typically when big stars like this pass away you know you hear about it for a little while but Chuck Berry I guess it just didn't end up being the case probably a lot of people these days don't only listen to Chuck Berry and I know he had you know some drama and legal stuff in the past with the camera in the bathroom thing that probably sullied is a reputation little bit with a lot of people so you know not going to get into it now we'll leave it at that but this new song over here big boys sounded like Chuck Berry planned to you know his old school rock and roll sound it's not bad and I'm going to give a shot to his a new album you know I'm just going to give a little listen give it I'm just going to give it a listen excuse me and just see what's going on moving on from there Marissa Nadler has a new track out titled rosemary from that of our first 100 days compilation the Donald Trump first 100 days comp and it's a cool little funky very stripped back her vocals acoustic guitar ballad that's a very beautiful very pretty very easy on the ears moving on from there big walnuts yonder this is kind of a weird experimental indie rock psych Rock a little proggy kind of track featuring Neil's Klein Greg song yay of Deerhoof Mike Watt of Minutemen this is like a cool little supergroup going on here you know just wanted to shout out those names over there if you're a fan of any of those artists any of those names you want to give this thing a listen the good people over at Stereogum I saw did a premiere of that track so shout out to them and I want to give a shout out to the new waves track animal thought it was okay you know wasn't as in love with it as the two previous tracks waves had just dropped but still it still moves along those same lines that the previous two tracks did in terms of like it's taken modern rock it's taking punk rock and it's kind of giving it a punch here modern slightly more electronic edge but still kind of keeping that rock spirit I think he's doing a good job of kind of progressing the song forward a little bit or at least modernizing in such a way where a younger audience will get into it it doesn't sound like just some old tired 90's revivalism or whatever so I'm definitely liking that he's moving in that direction he's taking some more risks and he's doing something a little more contemporary and those are the tracks that was kind of on the fence with that I thought were at least mentioning the songs that really kind of hit me this week future islands cave sure it sounds a lot like the two previous songs that have been released from this future islands album but it's still great that those driving bass lines the amazing passionate lead vocals the cynthy leads that are super catchy super sweet on the ears it's so like you know emotionally I get I guess I want to say I'm the word I'm looking for you know it's it's so it just kind of gets you whipped up into an emotional frenzy and just like you know use that to justify your emotional frenzy is like yeah you know like feel passionate feel fiery feel fucking amazing that to me is sort of what makes this and the you know a lot of future Islands tracks great moving on from there foxes in has a new song out that they've released along with a new series it's going to be on Amazon's and you know like many of the tracks from their previous record hang it has a lot of kooky kind of schmaltzy instrumentation on it it's very fun it's very tongue-in-cheek very silly I want to give a shout out to the new Tim Heidecker song mar-a-lago Tim Heidecker you know TV producer comedy man extraordinaire I've never cared for his solo music at all I just find it so boring I find it so uninspired a lot of the time but this new song over here is a bit of a jab at Trump and is absolutely fucking hilarious and he pretty much writes it from the standpoint of Trump being really stressed out about the presidency and all the stuff that's going on around him politically but then he uses Mauro Lago as a kind of a vacation destination a place where he can get away from it all it kind of sounds like an old-school not an old-school but like a Beach Boys song like from that Kokomo era or something like that like when you're coming out with some of their worst stuff but the way Tim does it over here it's tongue-in-cheek and funny and obviously the lyrics are hilarious so it's actually a really good song so shout out to Tim on this a good-ass track over here mar-a-lago black lips have a new song out called can't hold on sounds like they're throwing it back a little bit to some of the fuzzier more low-five stuff like on 200 million thousand I think that's there's a thousand million I can't fucking remember at this point but that's a very good underrated blacklists album but it kind of sounds like they're taking it back to their fuzzier stuff as opposed to the albums they did with Mark Ronson not too long ago way cleaner in comparison to a lot of their material but I do like this track I do like how abrasive it is how off the wall it is they still bring that fusion of punk and garage and psych and you know they kind of still had the kind of a sweaty energy to them that's a really awesome and finally want to give a shout out to the new perfume genius song slip away and it's this epic simply like heavy and passionate song that God the instrumental is so immense I just can't get my fucking head around it there's something about Mike's vocals on this track that it reminds me of something else like something just something so familiar I can't totally put my finger on it but I love his performance I love the tune I feel like he's taking a lot of the instrumental risks he did on his last record and building on those and you know just making more fleshed out songs just getting a little more ambitious if I didn't say that word already and I'm going to leave it at that those are my favorite tracks of the week everything that I just talked about in this segment is linked down there in the description again along with the slip mats that are back on sale hit that up the amazon associates link and a link over to the good people over at Dollar Shave Club hit them up again with a link down there your first month of Dollar Shave Club is just a dollar and that's it for this video guys hope you got turned on to some good tunes some good music this week hope you thought my takes on the Kendrick Lamar and gorillas tracks were not to angering but that's going to be it for this best and worst track segment I love you and I'll see you in the next video forever 
vhhhIykGjRU,yeah hi everyone its Bosch the wrist arrow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new havoc album conform aside havoc is a denver metal outfit this is their latest album I believe their fourth full-length record I caught on to them back in 2011 a time when you you couldn't spit without hitting a band that was trying to revive thrash metal and since this time you could actually count the number of groups that came out of that era that were actually actually good actually worth listening to on on one hand and I would actually count havoc as one of those groups their album times up was one of my favorites of that year and despite the record being pretty unoriginal from a thrash metal perspective the writing and the performances were really good and the album could at least serve as a reminder of what makes thrash metal so great in the first place now I was let down but not really surprised with the band's next LP unnatural selection because they were treading water so hard on this album it was like just a complete refusal to experiment or try anything new I get that the bands stick is mostly about carrying a torch for the past but that's no excuse for not trying anything new not attempting to separate yourselves from the artists that obviously influenced you especially Megadeth Havoc's seem to be big Megadeth fans conform aside though is had it finally delivering some of that maturity and some of that ambition that the last record was lacking they're trying so many things on this album I'm so happy about that and what made the band so appealing and so entertaining in the first place all that seems like it's turned up to 11 in some regards like the vocals on this album are insane they're just so intense they're not the usual talking growling that I listen to a lot of Dave Mustaine there's a lot of shrieks like almost falsetto Hite shrieks on this thing reminds me quite a bit of vector in a way and of course some of the growls some of the talking some of the narrating is there it's really campy it's really cheesy just like I like it also I find some of the guitar solos on here to be more colorful the mixing on this thing is better the bass has way more presence not only that but there is a lot of slap bass on this record on numerous tracks and so much character to what the band is doing it's not often you hear a lot of flat bass and your thrash and there's more interesting song structures on this thing to the band is written a longer record here and they have padded some of these songs out with epic intros and cool instrumental bridges the tracks are definitely multifaceted multi-phase but they don't get bogged down in just a bunch of you know progressive technical BS that isn't that interesting because pretty much every track here circles around to a good solid chorus sometimes including some some gang vocals where you got everybody layered on top of each other everybody shouting ah if there's one hit I think you can make on the production it's the sound of the drums on this thing they had that really flat plastic generic like modern metal band tone to them that is not that interesting to me I would have much rather listen to drums that just have a bit of a more natural tone even if they didn't sound perfect it would have certainly had more character in flavor now the lyrics though on this album I like them but I I could see them turning a lot of people off to make the case for the lyrics on this album have it took the typically apocalyptic depiction of the modern world and just kind of updated it for 2017 the war the death the famine the genocide of course those things show up on this record but they're also singing about the media which seems like pretty hot-button topic in this age of fake news we have politicians and corporations as a threat to democracy and there's even a nod to George Orwell on this thing on the track in Sochi and the entire album kicks off with a flip to the bird to political correctness on the song FPC in the grander scheme of things these are probably not entirely new topics in the world of thrash metal but at least what havoc is doing here seems like a little updated you know it seems like a little new it seems reflective of the decade that they're recording this album and what I sort of worry about is people either openly rejecting or just embracing this album based simply on the lyrics just casting the band off as some group that's saying some kind of  conspiratorial ultra libertarian Infowars red pill type or seeing the miraculously appeal too much people who just like you know spam peppe's every we're and want to make America great again shut up and I just pray that some music writer doesn't like you know write some overzealous article where they label them as alright or something stupid like that but for everybody who falls outside of all that BS you know there are moments on here like the proclamation of the United States or on the song dog maniacal where the band is singing about somebody who's not really moral but just merely following the rules written in their holy book where it's like you know the observations they're making they're a little corny and again this is something that I expect with this style of metal this to me is stuff that comes with the territory I kind of like it I like the bluntness and I think that havoc are a band that's very self-aware but not self-conscious and that's the thing in thrash metal it's all about just being straightforward saying your piece and not being self-conscious two things you know the thrash metal self-consciousness it's like oil and water for me this record it's really about the first half of the album the song topics are sharp and focused they're straightforward they're in your face the slap bass sounds great the new ideas sound great the mix sounds fantastic the songs are multifaceted as I said earlier 's have a lot of phases a lot of sections to them they're dynamic they're kind of progressive on the song intent to see if I do want to bring this up I don't know if this is intentional but this is the track where they're kind of making fun of the media and at the very start of the song the band opens up with this really generic bad stock like piece of like ooh newscast or music that is the same exact music that keemstar uses part of his videos if they did that on purpose that would that would be amazing but the thing is this is Havoc's longest record almost an hour long and I don't think the band brings enough new ideas and takes enough risks to justify that length because we do have tracks like master plan claiming uncertainty two tracks that are lyrically general way more general than the songs that the band was hitting us with at the start of the record the vocals are not as varied on this track the various guitar passages not as dynamic and the song wake up is maybe the most basic and formulaic on the entire album this the band repeats over and over and over again features this annoying whammy right which really should have been some seasoning not the main course of the song the 7-minute closure is certainly structurally ambitious but from what the band is doing from a lyrical standpoint instrumental standpoint it's not really all that refreshing either you know I do like this album I think havoc has put together some of their best material in a couple years on this record and I think the first half of this album is electrifying it's just that when we get to that middle point it just starts to trail off a little bit not the band does anything that sounds overtly awful but you know they kind of just go back to these old patterns they fall into their old ways and they stop innovating they stop progressing we stop trying new things and they just kind of start delivering thrash by the numbers again which is what was my main problem with their last record still though I do think this album is an improvement on that at least I am feeling a light two decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best do the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and please don't die just you know just you know keep watching the videos links next to my head

VXlghM-qUq0,hi everyone bad boy can oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new spoon album hot thoughts Austin Texas rock band spoon are back with a new album with their ninth album in fact spoon has never been one of my favorite rock bands of all time but yet I've also never hated one of their records either because I think they're easily one of the most consistent bands working today there might not be anything terribly original about spoons sound sure but I usually come away from a spoon album relatively impressed with the band's exuberant performances and emphasis on quality grooves good songwriting fundamentals and that's mostly the case on this new album over here - the group continues to dish out what has made them one of the longest running groups in indie but there are a few massive surprising and kind of experimental exceptions and the track listing here the song pink up I'm not really crazy about but the very laid-back chilled out super low-key vibe of this song was kind of unexpected this track is very moody it's very nocturnal there are loads of strange vocal harmonies on this thing some distant pianos what sounds like vibraphone - a subtle beat some w effect I never expected the band to go this quiet or this groovy especially for six minutes straight and the song I'm the one is this very skeletal strip back ballad that's built mostly off of these really bright shrill electric piano chords and then brick daniels vocals eventually the song fills out with some drum machine beats and some larger instrumentation I think the climax could have been a little more visceral but I still think it's a decent tune and a good attempt at spoon trying something different but the closing track us on this thing really takes the cake for surprises because it's it's essentially this droney ambient jazz piece not sure there's really no verse or chorus or vocals on this track to speak of it's mostly horn and probably the most abstract thing the band is ever laid to record doesn't necessarily mean it's good or compelling moment on the album but you know definitely unexpected did it's like suddenly being teleported into this space a psychedelic Sun Rogers Jam hope you brought your father led maybe this track would have made more sense next to whisper I'll listen to hear it or do I have to talk you into it which are a little more synth driven and similarly Spacey but maybe not as Spacey as us I appreciate the band is trying some new stuff but it doesn't always go over well I guess but for the rest of this record spoon is given us that sharp catchy first-class part rugged part slick pop rock that they're so good at recording the song hot thoughts I love this track the slowly building tension on this track the sad descending chord progression are great but don't take away from just how snappy and awesome and visceral the rhythm section is I also love the subtle bits of instrumentation thrown into the mix that aren't all that clear right from the get-go like jingle jangle chimes that kind of ring along with the guitars the song is so depressing but it's also so danceable can I sit next day yo you know is going to be a great spoon track right from the moment you hear that slick little guitar lick and the handclaps bouncing off of it the grand string section thrown later into the track to help it out is really great and the song shotgun is the most driving gritty snappy track on the entire record the bass line drum combo on this thing is killer says let's have an epic dance battle but then the roaring guitar riff over this says let's drive 90 miles an hour down route 66 at high noon with the top down I also appreciate the cool down moment on this track where you have like some weird trippy dueling guitars and since for a little instrumental bridge actually I would say this is one of the moments on this album where spoon are taking some of the more experimental aspects of this LP and they are incorporating them tastefully into their usual sound their usual repertoire they're not just going off and to Spaceland the only straightforward spot on this record that really underwhelmed me was the track first caress sadly not a response to the beloved misfit song last caress it just kind of had a really bland forgettable disco beat to it and brit daniels was really not at his lyrical best on this song either you know from spoon it's a good album it's a very good album as usual but it's not like an amazing album not mind-blowing you know it's just relatively solid those core catchy indie rock singles on this track over really well they sound fantastic but the Achilles heel of this album is not like past spoon records it's not a lack of ideas redundant tracks a lack of ambition no it's actually spoon taking some risks and getting experimental and getting kind of weird the problem is is that not every experiment goes over well or fits into the flow of the album complements the band's usual sound and not to say that I think the band should abandon completely what they're doing on this record completely the opposite because there are at least a couple tracks on here where I think it goes over really well I'm just kind of waiting for the album where spoon actually channels these experimental desires a little more tastefully a little more cohesively in a way that's a bit more gratifying but that's all you know I think this is a good album perfectly good album no reason to completely ignore this album a lot of great things about it feeling a decent 7 on this thing true transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't die just stay alive so you can keep watching sub review you're the best Anthony Santana spoon hot sauce other videos next to my head you should check out subscribe to the channel official website forever 
X_uhiacU1k4,hi everyone you know who it is it's Antoine Antoine here Internet's busiest music nerd the real estate review is coming but just want to come on here to remind you that the 24th which is tomorrow at the time of posting this video we are doing an AMA on the symbol app the link to get the app is down there we're going to be doing on the front page pictured right here so you can't miss it much you log on there it is the couchy chester song the thread in there we're going to be talking I'm going to be answering your questions and yeah and while you're over there on that app follow your boy because I not only act cringy like I did just now but I also do a lot of good music recommendations songs that I like a lot things I'm reviewing things I'm not reviewing personal pics and stuff so yeah so I'll see you soon over I Mac will do the AMA and here's the review well hi everyone it's hot set equity animating Eliminator the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new real estate album in mind real estate is a New Jersey band who in my opinion has consistently proven themselves to be one of the sleepiest and blandest groups recording music today as far as pop and rock music goes for this decade I'm not sure if it gets more pastel breezy and flavorless than their album days or their previous record Atlas but I still tried my best to go into this new album over here with an open mind with no expectations or at least with positive expectations and that actually was not hard to do given that I thought some of the singles leading up to the release of this album we're pretty good namely the song darling sure you know real estate on this track isn't really offering much vocally like they typically do but the pristine twangy guitar leads on this track sound way nicer than they have in the past there's like a colorful ringing high-definition clarity to them that's really pleasing the bass sounds great the drums sound really natural and crisp the synthesizers have a blissfully Airy quality to them as well it's really nice definitely the best production and mixing on any real estate album thus far I also the angular Tarr work all over the track and the weird groove on this song to which I haven't counted out but I'm pretty sure at one point is or just kind of slips into an odd time signature if real estate could record an album that's consistently this euphoric and compositionally intriguing and rich and warm with sound then you know what why couldn't they put out a good album it would be their best yet and in some ways I think they kind of achieved that on in mind I definitely give the band props for coming together with their most versatile tracklist yet there are lots of very peppy but gentle rockin singles on this thing some dreamy ballads and the song diamond dies one of my favorite tracks from the track listing here is a folk rock tune with the kind of social political urgency to the lyrics telling listeners not to go silently during this moment of uncertainty and there also a variety of guitar tones on this thing - it's not just the same dreamy twangy jangly guitar tone you usually catch on a real estate album there are some fuzz's and distortions and echoes on here that provide you know some nice color maybe a little bite as well but the issue with this album the underlying issue with this album is not really all that different from the underlying issue on Real Estate's past records and that's beyond the shiny surface there's not all that much going on I mean sure it does sound better on this album than it has in the past but with some of the songwriting here there's not much to write home about darling serve the song and stained glass are actually an excellent trio of tracks to kick the album off some of the best tunes some of the most passionate vocals some of the most interesting guitar lines all turn up on these songs but with after the moon and two arrows I think the album begins to lose steam with the band mixing their jangle pop sound with a little bit of Psych pop pastiche that turns up mostly in the songwriting the tracks don't really have much to them nor are they anymore blissful or sound rich than the tracks that preceded them in fact a little bit less so I think the song holding pattern is maybe the most aggravating track on the whole album with this stuttering start/stop groove that just feels like I'm waiting for something to get going and the slick guitar leads on this thing kind of remind me of Mack DeMarco it's it's like I'm listening to a Mack DeMarco song that just won't get started and the song time is maybe the most viscous and flaccid track on the entire album I mean I get the band is trying to sound a serial and Atmospheric and again very dreamy on this thing and having a strong rhythmic backbone makes that hard to do but the vague bass and very polite drum machine on this track do very little to contain the cascading guitar lines and blase vocals it's at this point the band starts delivering tracks that pick up the pace a little bit but the song same son for example the guitar work and the chord progressions here are nowhere near as interesting as what was delivered on the first three tracks for the record and I feel the same way about the very uninspired finishing cut on this album - a track that sounds like it could have been placed at any moment in the tracklisting and it would have sounded just the same this this track doesn't do much to bring any closure to this record again I appreciate the variety the band is brought to the table on this record but there's not much of a sense of flow in this tracklist but like with the band's previous records I just get that same vibe that same feeling of what I'm listening to is just fantastically amazingly ok it's offensively inoffensive more often than not I'm just sitting here waiting for something interesting or exciting to happen for sure it's better than the band's last album Atlas but for me personally someone who wasn't a big fan of Atlas at all that might not be saying all that much but you know maybe to somebody who's a big fan of real estate sound will at least hear and get the increase in sound quality and occasionally songwriting quality that the band is delivering on this one still though I'm feeling a like a decent 5 on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it did you hate it what would you write here the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die just keep on Linden so you can keep watching reviews dog links next to my head other videos that you should check out subscribe to the channel official website -

dqZywmtj3yc,hi everyone path a mini twat can oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Drake playlist more life Drake rapper singer-songwriter entertainer champagne papi himself is back with a new playlist yes not an album not a mixtape it's a playlist but what seems to be provided here is all original material 22 tracks why not at album why not a mixtape I'm not entirely sure I mean after listening to this thing and looking at some of the marketing behind this project it seems like Drake and his label are resorting to semantic cheap PR tactics to get people talking about an otherwise nondescript collection of tracks that sound like leftovers from Drake's last album views sorry for just coming out with my opinion right there and not really giving a deep introduction or some context to the review here but that's just how I feel now if I look at more life though with a little less cynicism I could kind of see what Drake was going for on this one you have a bunch of tracks that feel like less goobers or at least like they were created within the same mindset that many of the tracks on views were some loose ideas here and there tracks the sound barely finished but still there's some decent ideas at the core of some of these tracks but they're too short and they're too rough around the edges to just release them as an album so just kind of fill them out with some half-hearted verses and just copy and paste a couple courses and some instrumental loops just Pat out the song until you reach at least the 2 or the 3 minute mark then after that you just string it all together and make sure all the tracks you're featuring have a kind of moody nocturnal vibe to them alternating here and there between kind of very cold skeletal trap flavored hip-hop to the sort of whitewashed dancehall that Drake has popularized over the past few years what Drake is done here is seamless enough to create this consistent coherent vibe but it's also varied enough to feel like you're not listening to this thing over and over it away Drake I think is doing something really smart on Moore life he's noticing the way his fans the way mainstream pop and hip-hop listeners consume music a lot of listeners out there looking more for a feeling than they are something concrete or engaging in their music something enjoyable but disposable you know it's entertaining enough and sweet on the ears enough to create a nice ambience but there's nothing really about it that sort of grabs your attention forces you to focus on it and again I think it's really smart Drake is answering this silent demand for more passive music the demand is already there I think there are a lot of artists who are already serving it I mean what most people would call mumble rappers these days but I think most mainstream artists wouldn't at least admit to pursuing this because you know their ego might get in the way they don't want to publicly say hey this this project is just you know disposable nonsense no most people are more focused on creating their next hit creating the next classic they want to be that guy they want to be successful and that's why I think that even though Drake is releasing more life over here I don't think he's like putting all of his chips on this you know he's not hedging his bets on this thing I mean that is evidenced in that he named this a playlist and not an album that alone is going to make periodicals and music fans put less of an emphasis on what he's doing here and since there's nothing really essential about what's going on on more life fans will either enjoy it while it's on and just kind of move on to something else when something better replaces it or they just won't hold it against Drake if some of the material on this thing is mediocre because at the end of the day more life is just kind of a glorified b-sides collection whether listeners realize it or not there's some decent moments on this thing but typically it boils down to a single verse from Drake or one of the beats are okay or maybe the hook is kind of alright tracks like free smoke and yo just can't have everything KMT I love SAMHSA's performance on the track 4422 also I like skepta Sapir insomnia skeptic interlude these are more of the hard-hitting tracks from the track listing here more of the hip hop centric tracks and the track listing here of course on this album even though he is about as Jamaican as a box of kraft dinner Drake continues to deliver that you know dancehall sound this boring whitewash Toronto dancehall that doesn't really sound much at all like real regular dancehall and now that Drake is piling around with all these rappers from the UK he seems comfortable in rapping now in an English accent which happens on the song no long talk where he's kind of putting in a little bit of that English twang on some of his valves on his bars here and then he mixes that with this fake patois and then it's just an unholy matrimony of horror you know Drake rapping about his Tings so while there are some highlights on this thing there are also moments that even though this record overall is very much smooth sonic wallpaper but when you pay deeper attention to it there are some baffling moments like the song teenage fever most of this track is just a son rendition of the hook from J Lo's if you had my love like how Drake could take credit for this I don't know on the song glow Kanye's feature is really eccentric it's loud it's in-your-face his singing and Drake's singing intertwine in a really ugly way while I appreciate that Kanye kind of gave it his all on this track I feel like his performance here doesn't really fit with the overall vibe of the playlist the song ice melts is a reggae flip with a pretty good instrumental an interesting young thug feature but I was kind of floored by just how demo quality and flat the mix sounded on this thing and the song get it together features all of these bad driving dance rhythms that I could only expect to hear in like the dumbest drunkest bar in in the downtown area of some random city that has nothing else interesting going on other than this really crappy DJ night that this beat came from not only that but Drake barely feels like a feature or a major presence on this track and this is actually one of the handful of moments on this record where Drake is is almost like a nonentity on his own playlist I keep wanting to say album but play list and I think the track fake loves still sounds like Drake trying to write a second hotline bling' but failing miserably you know I mean Drake and his team can call this whatever the hell they want but in my opinion what this is is how not to do a b-sides collection you know I can sort of appreciate the concept of what is attempted here and maybe releasing this thing might end up making sense in terms of dollars and cents when all of the profits and losses are added up and the bottom line is there but what Drake has done here on more life makes for really uninspired art and just shows the Drake doesn't think twice about trying to make a profit off of his cutting room floor or at least just a relative lack of effort you know they're really nothing special about these tracks on an individual level but that's kind of the point nothing really supposed to steal the show steal your attention it's supposed to be this long uniform experience every track is supposed to reinforce the next and I appreciate the vibe I like this project as a vibe but it's only really so good at that overall I'm pretty indifferent to this thing and while I do think more life is a better listening experience than views it's only by virtue of it just being less offensive less crappy having less

whose instrumental is one of my favorites on the album as well very jazzy very glamorous I love the electric piano keys all over this thing the chimes the bright horn samples the the female vocal samples as well it's all pretty gorgeous that's that was me being cringy but then the most interesting track and the first leg of this record has to be the song idols become your rivals a 3 verse takedown of Birdman Cash Money label head who had a recent falling out with little wayne and many artists on the Cash Money and Young Money Records label I don't really know personally how much Rick Ross is involved with any of it he could just be on the outside kind of playing the angles and commenting on it but given what he says on this song he does seem to give a lot of weight to the growing rumors that Birdman is two-faced that he is a backstabber that he's not to be trusted and he's been ripping off the artists especially the biggest artists who he's had under his wing now after this comes a trio of just hard-nosed relentless bangers it is Rick Ross that is to be expected the song trap trap trap goes over better than expected despite its annoying title and it's kind of repetitive hook that wild rattling and banging instrumental I just can't resist young thug's appearance on the track is melodic it's kind of spastic and even wale is is pretty entertaining on this track the last few moments on his verse where he goes kind of acapella is pretty awesome the following two tracks dead presidents did two dead presidents and she's on she's on my dick these tracks kind of take it back to the sound of Rick Ross's Teflon Don but they actually kind of sound new and improved a little bit with the instrumentals just being way way more dense way heavier and rick ross' performance on these tracks I mean god he's a wild man did I ate a must sound around he's turned up to 11 all the cylinders are fired I think I'm dead presidents he talks about coming into the courtroom with a beverage and he knows the judge so he has a lot of leverage and then all like the ad-lib that comes right after it's like so high energy futures feature on this track I thought was great as well as Jeezy's like these are not people who usually floor me with their energy on a track and yet here they did she's on my dick you know what while it is a in one respect to put a pretty gross track but I did also find the song hilariously raunchy and you got to give her a cross a break on this stuff you know for for boiling sexual attraction down to money I mean how else is he gonna get laid with his personality now after this point on the album I think the record really starts to lose some steam the beats turn the heat down they take on a more luxurious tone and Rick Ross starts recycling flow after flow after flow to keep the tracklist going he really just starts falling back into his old patterns the song powers-that-be despite a decent nas feature is just really smooth and forgettable same thing with I think she likes me and Ty dolla sign's performance on this track is just oh it's one of the more generic features I've heard him lay down in the past year which is kind of unfortunate because I know he has way more to offer vocally than what he's delivered on this track oh and so in some of the Chris Rock features on this thing or the Chris Rock intros on this record you know I get that he's a comedian but I hope the stuff he's saying is a joke because for him to be on the same album that a NAS features housed on and be saying Rick Ross he's the best MC and and Lord is my witness he tells the truth nobody lies when they say Lord is my witness you know I get that there's a lot of fabrication in mainstream hip-hop whether it be in the lyrics or the music videos or the drama that we see in the zoo on social media these days but this is one of many small but annoying examples of moments where Rick Rosco's that extra step to remind you to tell you to make sure that you know what I'm doing here is 100% real what I'm saying is so so so true like rick ross has never exaggerated anything on a song how ross continues to ignore this but also spits one of the realest lines that he's ever recorded in his entire career on this album I don't know and here it is never was a gangster I just wanted in no longer could I deny that I wanted to Ben's there are other moments on this album where Rick Ross isn't really lying or anything but because it's Rick Ross what what he's saying what comes out of his mouth is just especially an example would be this one line where he's rapping about a pretty chick who resembles Stacy - whoo whoo he's getting with but he says in in the next line that if it was her she'd have to kiss my feet and lick my ass you know I get it the insult the the disrespect but the idea of Rick Ross's ass getting licked it gives me nightmares though or the intro on the song Lamborghini doors where he's talking about going to prison to visit Meek Mill and all the prisoners there they're banging on the glass and they're kicking the doors and and they say he's not allowed in I guess because everybody's going crazy but then two weeks later he's got access maybe because everybody's calmed down nobody's going at him and he seems to kind of imply that that's because Meek Mill is now kind of running the place right now because he's wearing yellow designer shoes and maybe everybody's just kind of like chilled out listening to him rap now this story I'm not totally sure if it's true but Rick Ross seems to overlook that maybe the prisoners were were angry with his appearance because he used to be a CEO sadly the rest of this same track is is filled with the same kingpin gangster isms that are so cliched at this point in Rick Ross's discography that you just throw this song on the pile of all the other tracks that they're read exactly like this I guess you know I get that Rick Ross's songs are supposed to sound like you're just taking a really big luxurious bath in an incredibly expensive bath but you know it's it's all still pretty wash rinse and repeat then we have filler features in the last third of this thing with dish LOF and and scrilla that are really forgettable I mean loafs feature on the track may Bach five make for two of the sleepiest minutes on the entire record and some are 17 while it is a loud angry epic banger there's nothing really about this song that brings any sense of closure to this album it's just kind of you know another loud track that could have fit shoulder-to-shoulder with trap trap trap and dead presidents you know this album probably kicks off better than most of the records and Ross's discography and if you assembled all the great tracks on this thing I think this is most likely the best thing he's released since Teflon Don but still around the middle point of this record things fall apart with one lackluster track after another in the same lack of imagination that keeps Rick Ross from making incredible albums you know overall it's decent but you know nothing nothing more than that in my opinion I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you're ready to hear the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die just stay alive and keep watching the reviews you're the best Rick Ross rather you than me other links and videos next to my head you should check out subscribe to the channel official website to forever 
iFE1bkuBotk,hi everyone Knuth in New York tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new your old Droog record packs new york lyricist extraordinaire and producer to your old Droog he's back with a new album following up a self-titled album back in 2014 that in my opinion did not quite live up to the height of his breakthrough EP that had a lot of people thinking that that your old Droog was in fact nas in disguise releasing music under some kind of obscure pseudonym since then drew has stepped out of the shadows and built a following of his own and released some pretty nice EPS my favorite of which was the Kinison EP which was from front to back packed with all these really clever funny interesting rock references because in my opinion from what I've heard so far and rooks catalog he's really at his best when he's got a sharp topic a concept that he can really pull apart and go in deep on do something conceptual do something ambitious which in my opinion is sort of what made his self-titled record a little lackluster because it felt a little like loose change kind of like a compilation a little unfocused whereas I know his sound is the kind of sound that that would go over much better with listeners if it was laser focused into a well-groomed project which is pretty much exactly what pax is track after track after track on this thing Droog comes through with song concepts ideas topics delivered in his deep smoky New York asphalt voice the entire album kicks off with a story on the track GK AC or gotta kill a cop which despite the title doesn't really carry much in the way of a political message it's not really a statement or anything like that it's really just a tale that seems to feature a protagonist who is high on drugs and crazy with paranoia and then he makes this rash decision to shoot some police officers and then he just kind of goes out in a blaze of unjustified glory it's a weird story there's kind of an anti cop tone to it but what droogs says about the protagonists in this track gives the audience really know reason to sympathize with his shitty decisions here he's clearly in the wrong but I guess in a way the track is just kind of like a comment las' depiction of some kind of crazed psycho who he says in the track practice or target practice on base heads and stray cats what's weird is with police brutality being such a hot-button topic right now year-old droogs somehow rights a protagonist who kills cops but his motivations make him more unlikable than the cops he's killing but of what whatever on the song I only drew raps about his reputation as a perfectionist saying that he only goes all-in when he knows he has his ducks in a row he has his verses well written all those double entendre z' and homonyms are perfected and he has an Apple Store Genius Bar line on here that I I think he got from our friend Cal Chichester over there we get some cautionary tales from Droog on the song you can do it where he's rapping about some guy trying to become a rapper when in fact he learns later that maybe he shouldn't try to be a rapper some guys deflated hoop dreams and a woman who I guess he knows or knew or maybe even made up just for the purpose of the story I'm not entirely sure who tries to sort of build a career or build a life for herself based simply on her looks and I guess some plastic surgeries and the song white rappers a good guest is a late but very necessary reply to the notorious statement that Lord Jamar made during that Vlad TV interview about white people white rappers being a guest in the house of hip-hop and while Droog does address and acknowledge that fair point ultimately he boils it down to talent whether or not somebody should get invited through that doorway and he does this over a very peppy funky beat over which he even pulls off a pretty solid sung hook with his husky ass voice Droog throws in a couple decent feature tracks here like grandma hips featuring Danny Brown or Bangladesh with hymns Droog throws in a couple of decent feature tracks on this thing like Bangladesh with hymns and grandma hips with Danny Brown which features this very kooky swanky jazz sample but I think the best chemistry this album was amplified on the track help featuring wiki and Eid on the track kicks off with explosions and sporadic guitar licks in every direction drew does not take any time on this track to sort of let the instrumental set the tone he just jumps right into the track and the song is just wall-to-wall intensity just like lyrical slaughter it's like an action film with guns spray just going on in every direction with a hilarious little interlude where some vocal loops from Frank Zappa's track help I'm a rock are thrown over that line that Rob bass wrapped on it takes two I want a rock right now though I love the beat on that track the Achilles heel of this album really is the production in my opinion it's grimy and dusty and Bumi and bappy to the point where it's just so stereotypically New York that it couldn't be from anywhere else it runs little generic at points especially when you put out a track on this album like just an interlude which features a no flavor feature from one mr. Chris crack still though there are a few exceptions like that beyond help love that instrumental also got to kill a cop which has these very crispy bappy just really just high definition drumbeats it's just such a good be it's such a good groove and then that's topped with these weird deflated synth leads that just go mmm with each bar there's also a very unlikely be on the track Winston red which is kind of this really odd silly funk loop that I don't think most rappers would even attempt to try to spit on and the song you can do it while it's not an especially refreshing or cutting-edge beat I do like the rich piano chords on this track and the gently driving bass lines it's really cinematic and sets a good tone for the kind of thoughtful advice he's trying to pass over to the audience on this song and I guess I also like that the beyond Bangladesh is seasoned with these really cool Eastern woodwind melodies but that does not make up for the fact that some instrumentals on this thing namely the track rap man sound like an MF DOOM leftover also kind of the case for the funny somewhat autobiographical lyrics on the song where Droog fashions himself as a superhero for rap music although I do love the bars on this track about him having the work ethic of a Mexican him having a studio tan I guess the opposite of a tan because in the studio I imagine you don't get much Sun and there are moments on this thing where he's clowning rappers who are I guess people would probably call them mumble rappers saying that on the mic it doesn't even sound like they're speaking English or other guys from New York who we've heard recently who are always rapping about their their third eye being open while I do like some of that stuff it is kind of a cliche at this point although that does not you know again make up for points like my girl is a boy which while I do kind of like the angle he's trying to go with the story with here it still is an underwhelming track because the hook is kind of flaccid the beat is kind of flaccid and while drew does try to take a little sensual on this track I wouldn't say it's uh I guess a vibe that's achieved still though even though some of the beats on this thing are stale bread droogs bars are still but uh like this one before I ever had FIFA 2k to play live it was maddening had to survive that Madden reference is hilarious wha gwan foghorn leghorn come Halloween on the wrong one - egg on four Megaton limbs harming him with my homonyms far from PC on VC with his arm in the rim made a vigil for the morn you couldn't hold a candle to what I did on wax before even signing contracts these are just a few examples and of course there are many moments on this record where he's making really interesting references to things like type o-negative and Depeche Mode jazz even Pokemon and also mr. Feeny from Boy Meets World you know this is a good album for drew gets certainly an improvement over his self-titled record but I think it's still a tad inconsistent or at least revealing that Droog still has a little ways to go when it comes to building up some versatility in his repertoire because despite the fact that he is a new artist in in some ways he seems like very much an old soul who's sort of stuck in his ways and while some of the criticisms he throws his contemporaries are warranted I mean some of their sounds are certainly fresher what's delivered here especially with astoundingly drew has swapped out a lot of the NAS influence on his previous projects for a very clear MF DOOM influence still though the tracks on this album were seemed like he was trying something a little new and stepping outside of his comfort zone went over pretty well I would love to hear that more in the future and I admire that he tried and for the most part succeeded to put together an album that flows very well from front to back which is aided by these really good Anthony Jeselnik skits where he's sort of playing this radio DJ in between so many songs talking about you know random shit between tracks and adding in funny little jokes and subtle bits of music humour one moment where even references Death Grips you know this this album is definitely for the old heads but I think there are enough good things about it that people who are you know really looking for new refreshing hip-hop will get some good things out of it too because drew does have raw undeniable talent that will certainly have you kind of rewinding points of songs just to kind of catch again what he was trying to say with the lyric because some of the lyrics on this thing are that good I'm feeling at decent strong 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't die just stay alive and watch more of my reviews every day so I make that sweet sweet green other videos next to my head that you should check out subscribe to the channel official website to is linked next to my head as well I hope everybody is doing good stay in good health and forever 
AYo0Rc1oA3Q,yeah hi everyone it's your bully O'Brien Kanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of stink peace I react where I respond to bad music writing online this week I'm responding to a beautiful op Idi Amin all places pitchfork shoutout to pitchfork Azealia Banks and the double standard of mental illness considering how much of a trainwreck miss banks career has been since the release of her breakout hit - 1 - this ought to be good our writer begins by referencing a viral video featuring miss banks that she posted on the internet which depicts her cleaning while she claims to be 3 years of work hair basically ritualistic chicken sacrifices that black twitter was really quick to point out it had essentially done nothing to help her career as Miss Banks is basically a walking el Factory the article here pinned some of the controversy surrounding this on people's lack of understanding when it comes to non Abrahamic religions and not because it's just made-up bullshit and here in reality there's nothing to understand about brutally bleeding out chickens for your own personal gain it's a heartless act and only someone is vapid as miss banks would post a video for self cleaning up the aftermath of it on Twitter while also acting like this is a sensible way to combat things like white supremacy and a clear instance of doublethink on this article claims that is Elia banks is crazy are written off as sensationalist while our writer acknowledges the the very real persona of insanity and instability that seems to follow miss banks everywhere she goes a personal problem that she addressed in a Facebook post and I guess in the lyrics of the song soda from her last full-length album the article then goes on to the moan the media's relative silence on this issue and while that's fair Azealia Banks talking about this struggle in a couple of stray Facebook posts and in a single song on an album that no one listens to anymore is not proof that Azealia Banks is perceived as a broken black woman and especially not a pioneer good attempt at applying that quote miss King basically what this op-ed is trying to do is paint this imagine double-standard saying that people are ignoring is Elia banks is paying because she's a woman meanwhile when people like Kanye and Kid Cudi admit they're going through some mental troubles their fans just give them endless amounts of undying support maybe the difference in which Azealia is treated in comparison to a guy like Kid Cudi is true but our writer doesn't provide any evidence that this has anything to do with gender just weak comparisons case in point mental illness depression and sadness are a cornerstone of Kid Cudi's it entire artistic repertoire the dude's middle name is woe is me Kid Cudi's fans directly go to his music to hear about that kind of emotional pain in fact that's how Kid Cudi's fans sort of connect with him with that shared sorrow whereas Celia Banks fans are more likely to connect with her desperation for attention by eating used tampons and as far as Kanye goes I totally get what you mean like he came out totally unscathed when he endorsed Donald Trump I mean here's a video of people doing a what you said rationalizing that [Applause] [Music] and of course culture writers are going to try to excuse Kanye hanging out with Trump doing meetings with Trump most of them wouldn't dare critique him and even slightly aggressive way at a fear that they would be at the other end of some kind of flame war with his most passionate fans I'm totally fine with that though shout out to Katy T you can't use what culture writers say about Kanye as evidence of how the general public sort of sees and reacts to him if that were the case if that was what reality was then he would be nowhere near as controversial as an artist that he actually is this op-ed just gets more and more disingenuous as it continues talking about Azealia Banks speaking out about black men belittling her physical appearance or the way she carries herself and then sympathizing with her being labeled as crazy when why she's labeled as crazy has nothing to do with her speaking out on the belittlement thrown at her by black men and it has everything to do with the countless twitter beefs that she's been embroiled in again and again and again only a few of which are cited in this article despite the fact that she's really argued with just about everyone that she could even erykah badu the article then talks about Azealia Banks mistreatment in the music industry being overshadowed by these Twitter beefs but no actual proof or evidence or instances of said mistreatment are brought up in the article just the Twitter bTW it's basically the article itself is guilty of what it's accusing other music publications of the truth of the matter is that Celia banks has burned an incredible amount of bridges even more than one of her biggest rivals Iggy Azalea who's very similar in that she just can't seem to stop putting her foot in her mouth but I don't see this article sympathetically pouring over any unfairness in relation to her now at a few points this article makes mention of the many racist and homophobic remarks that Celia banks is made over social media but doesn't seem to make the connection that people who make such remarks don't typically garner a lot of public sympathy when they're down on their luck I don't recall Kanye West ever calling anybody a curry scented bitch or a Punjab and Kanye's track record when it comes to things homosexuality and now transgenderism it speaks for itself but I'm not done with this article yet because the two dumbest paragraphs and this whole thing are right at the end first off this quote is uncritically printed of Azealia Banks talking about Kanye says something crazy and everybody knows him I see something crazy people rip my head off no no no Kanye is not hopping on Twitter on a regular basis to fight with his contemporaries and openly disrespect his elders he's not saying racist shit he's not saying homophobic shit sure he says crazy dumb things every once in a while and when he does like the stupid tweet about schools in Africa and it being the country when he says these things even by a lot of his fans he's universally mocked however this doesn't ruin his career because his fans like the spectacle and we go to Kanye to listen to music many of us are not curious about his opinions on world politics even when recently Kanye was talking about this lack of camaraderie of a personal and friendly connection between him and jay-z and Beyonce he wasn't hostile e attacking them he was just kind of reaching out to them he didn't seem like he was trying to tear down jay-z or Beyonce personally or artistically which is essentially just a part of the Zelia Banks social media routine and for an article hosted on a music site our writer is really quick to write off that this has anything to do with music discounting the fact that what most likely makes Kanye a way more sympathetic character than Azealia Banks is that he has one genre-defining record under his belt after another meanwhile Azealia Banks has one mediocre album it took way too longer release if there's a double standard here going on it's most likely that that when people are fans of an artist fans of a celebrity whoever they will automatically have sympathy for that person they will automatically come to the defense of that person even if what they've done is indefensible look at Bill Cosby how many people still believe it is you didn't do nothing people care about Kanye West they care about the things Kanye West does I mean I'm sorry for the rude reality check here but what is azealia banks to the music industry other than an annoying spectacle nobody synthesizes with her because nobody wants to because of the horrible and shitty things that she says it's not male privilege but you know what do I know about privilege I didn't go to Princeton what makes even less sense about the framing of this article is that men the gender that's notoriously mocked and made fun of across the board for being open about their feelings open about their emotions open about their pain they're the ones that for some reason here are getting all the sympathy pinning it is privileged by bringing up people like Nina Simone and Lauryn Hill makes even less sense because people fucking love Nina Simone and Lauryn Hill nobody actively dismisses Lauryn Hill's pain and suffering from what I've been able to see fans across the board had been very respectful of her reclusive lifestyle and have consistently elevated her legend status over the couple of very sporadic and erratic performances that she's managed to pull together over the past few years and while Nina Simone battled some very great personal demons when she was alive her fantastic and amazing music has in a lot of ways overshadowed that history I don't see anybody writing off Nina Simone because she had some personal issues this is my favorite quote from the entire article banks is not at this genius place yet but there's little chance she could ever get there if the world writes her off as a crazy villain first yeah you're right Azealia Banks is not there and I will predict the future and say she will never get there because what this op-ed is essentially doing is over inflating the perceived talent of a one-hit wonder and the reason she continues to be seen as a villain is because she keeps acting like one her personal struggles no matter how bad they may be don't excuse her shitty behavior none of which this article has actually been able to attribute to her mental problems in fact this article doesn't really divulge or know anything about Azealia Banks mental problems other than what's been written in a few spotty Facebook posts our dear writer here is not as Elia Bank psychiatrist so while Azealia Banks may have some personal mental problems I would say it is possible no in fact probable that I'll be hateful bigoted insane and petty things that she says online have little to nothing to do with them and everything to do with her being a shithead so please spare me this pity party for one of the music industry's most self-centered impulsive losers and just let her fall into obscurity like everybody who makes mediocre music eventually does transition and that is the new episode of stink piece right there what does that mean it was probably me but videos other

fs3LKYZkZ_8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week before we get into the tracks I got a shout out our Amazon Associates link down there in the description use it to buy if you live in the u.s. anything you want on Amazon we get kickback from your purchase does not add to your overall price and I want to give a shout out to our big big big sponsor for this video the good people over at Dollar Shave Club now if you guys follow this channel on a regular big Uhler basis you know that more often than not you see me scruffy faced and that's because you know a very busy guy very distracted guy I mean I shaved my head because I just don't want to deal with the inconvenience of having hair I'm also probably not putting the effort or the forethought into shaving as I probably should which is why I'm avoiding it a lot of the time but Dollar Shave Club they hooked me up with some good razors some shave butter some good soap too and now I'm actually like incentivized to shave because the razor really works and it's like not like a pain in the butt to actually go through the process of Shaving plus with the fact that stuff gets mailed to your house it's pretty convenient you don't go to the store and then forget razors and come home me like god dammit I have no razors plus combine that with the fact that their stuff is a lot cheaper than what you'll find with a lot of the high-end razors in the store and if you sign up with the link that we have down there in the description box it's just one dollar for your first month and a few dollars a month after that again check out this link down there in the description if you guys are interested in signing up let's get into the tracks alright as usual we kick things off with the worst tracks of the week we rip that band-aid off we just get them out of the way let's start off with our good friend Machine Gun Kelly the song at my best featuring Hailee Steinfeld this is kind of one of those really dramatic ultra corny really meaningful pop rap songs where Machine Gun Kelly is really trying to like just pull your your heartstrings pull your emotions here but for somebody who has a cold black dark heart like I do it just sounds really cheap and cheesy and and I will just kind of leave it there moving on from there we have a new track from G easy and Co money this track is featured on forthcoming fast the Furious soundtrack so of course it's garbage like every song that has come out of that soundtrack so far it it's like music's equivalent of a trash compactor it's just really compacted a lot of terrible music into one into one godforsaken soundtrack and you know out of morbid curiosity when the soundtrack finally comes out I might listen to the whole thing just to hear how bad it is but I I digress we will just move on to the next track here but rest assured that gez song is terrible of course the new linkin park track is awful battle symphony as every song that I've heard from this forthcoming album thus far has been you know between snippets and the previously released track the problem with these new tracks is that Linkin Park no longer sounds like a metal band or rock band that really sound like a band anymore they sound like Chester fronting the production of some kind of EDM duo or something who's trying to write these like really big epic ultra emotional EDM ballads and it just sounds awful it just sounds terrible I feel like Linkin Park and many other groups that were mainstream in the 2000s or the late 90s who are still around today are really throwing rock under the bus and trying to write EDM anthems instead which brings us to our worst track of the week the new Weezer song feels like summer this track is hot garbage and not only is it a terrible track and also like the Lincoln Park song sells Rock up the river in favor of just writing a shitty EDM anthem but it's also it also reeks of a sense of betrayal not that I think rivers and company owe me personally anything I mean for somebody who enjoyed Weezer's early work I'm used to the the feeling of disappointment up until this point you know what I mean I'm used to the years of of really unflattering awful albums you know I mean make believe we owe this I my point is though that we either just came out with their best album in years and now what it seemed like hey you know what the band might be back on track they might be actually like getting back to their roots and thinking about what actually made them appealing in the first place then they turn around and they're like hey let's come out with our worst track since Beverly Hills let's come out with our worst single since Beverly Hills and and that feels like summer I don't know what to say about this track other than that it sounds like a rock band from the 90s tryna rate a shitty EDM and I don't want to have anything else to do with it for the rest of my life so let's just go into the tracks that I was kind of met on kind of indifferent toward but you know certainly worth mentioning early some good things about these tracks Flatbush zombies have a new track out titled Babel it's one of the more low-key cuts don't expect flames on this thing don't expect to go into the song excited but if you are looking for the zombies to go into more of a socially conscious direction this song is definitely the track you want to catch out don't miss it and then moving on from there ARCA has a new track titled reverie arca coming out with these really weird off-putting unsettling eerie and creepy art pop ballads again with this new track the music video is so disturbing the song is just bone-chilling I'm really not sure how to take it it's strange it definitely gets a rise out of me I react to it I don't find it boring you know but I'm yet to figure out if I really like it you know it's certainly freshmen in a sense but I don't know if I like it you know it freaks me out but I don't know if I enjoy I don't know if I would listen to it for enjoyment you know but there's definitely something to what ARCA is doing on this track so make sure you give it a shot if you're looking for something strange something left-field but if you've been listening to arcus stuff up until this point you should know to expect that by now from there we have Muramasa with this new track this new pop tune titled one night featuring Charli XCX excuse me Charli XCX which is actually pretty slick pretty catchy pretty bouncy nowhere near as strange or left-field as all of the pc music production that was featured on her mixtape that dropped not too long ago I mean just a week or so ago but it's not a bad tune just because it's a little more accessible Portugal the man has a new track out it's been off for a little while but I want to mention here titled feel it's still and there's a music video attached to this track where I guess the band link to some various sites to kind of get people I guess I guess kind of politically active you know donating to places like the ACLU or calling their congressperson or their senator or so on and so forth and I guess in the in the music video there was a point where this guy is holding a music a newspaper and it's burning and it says Infowars on it now I mean obviously it was a jab at the website Infowars Infowars caught that and now portugal the man and Infowars are embroiled in like a beef where Infowars have quoted them on their website or I guess called them on their website band that is like communists they're Pro George Soros or they're funded by Georgia store to be coming out with this music personally I don't know if I'm all that crazy about you know the kind of funkier Direction portrayal demands been taking their music in on this track and what the other tracks I've heard recently from their forthcoming album but hell you know I'm down for a good Infowars beef that's pretty funny to me so it's pretty hilarious to see Portugal demand sort of throwing their hat into the political ring a little bit like everybody is doing right now maybe you're sick of it at this point I don't really know but all I know is I thought it was funny and hopefully there's more drama to speak of between Portugal demand info worse in the future we have Sam get you know this kid's been sending me his demos for a while and like even before he had a big following on soundcloud and he never told me how to pronounce his last name but I imagine it's Sam jelly jelly RT galley RT I could be totally screwing that up Sam you're probably watching this and I apologize you view a viewer of the show for a while now I should know this and I has I have failed you miserably but Sam has a new release coming on Excel recording is really proud of the dude because again he was sending me his soundcloud stuff before he had a following before he was on a label and while I've never been crazy the dude certainly has talent and this track certainly exposes that as well certainly proves that too you know his productions if I can say one thing about them he's an electronic music producer who composes really dense jittery songs you know if you love your melodies to be very nimble very agile very dynamic Sam is your man I mean I wouldn't say aesthetically his music is all that pleasing you know I'd the textures to me kind of feel plain sometimes but compositionally his stuff is really interesting no he drums up some cool melodies and some cool counterpoint too and you know the rhythms are interesting as well he's an interesting composer so definitely check this track out don't miss it why give him a shout out and also loan who has a new track out titled crush mood which is I believe going to be featured on one of the few EPS he's coming out with this year on our NS recordings which is actually pretty cool this one over here has a very cool house vibe to it with some strange vocal samples I don't know I'm just going to try out the EP when it comes out and I'd like to flavor this song I wasn't head over heels for but I thought it was pretty cool certainly more engaging than what I thought was delivered on loan last album so I don't know I guess we'll see where he sort of goes from here Raekwon has a new track out titled my corner with little Wayne that's OK from his forthcoming album which I'm not all that excited about but the song sounds passable and finally I want to shout out little ez vert with the song EXO tour life which was ok it did not make it in my most terrible tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week in a way the song is an improvement for mr. vert and the reason that is because his lyrics actually sounds kind of audible on this track like it's not just a mumble mess so you know that he's actually speaking English it sounds like and on top of that the song sounds structured like it's not like he's just a laksa Daisley slipping from one section of the song to the next and just kind of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's kind of the instrumental going on in the background with almost no regard as to you know what section of the song is in it just kind of sounds ridiculous like he's just not paying attention to his own tune this sounds organized this sounds well I guess kind of separated between the verses and the choruses sound like he actually sat down and thought about how this track would be structured so I think if he continues down this road you know coming through with songs that are a little more well built his music is going to be all the better for it you know and or at least that's my opinion but these are my favorite tracks of the week these are the favorite tracks of the week that I haven't even talked about yet so let's get to these I want to get the shout out to the Australian down the the Australian band excuse me I'm a little tired here flower truck they have a new track out called dying to hear new album coming in the fall these guys opened up for a few of my speaking engagements while I was down in Australia and they have a cool mix of influences and their stuff from old-school alternative rock and indie rock to some post-punk and synth pop to this track over here some really like you know grand pianos or keyboards on it that I thought were really cool the most dramatic track I've heard of them so far and I'm looking forward to sort of hearing what these guys do in the future with their stuff putting the finishing touches on this video I forgot to mention it Feist has a new track out yes none other than Feist and this song at least at the beginning this new track of hers it starts out very subtle and very inconspicuous a lot like many of the tracks from her last album but the payoff is huge like this is one of her most passionate song issues released in a long time and it's really it's kind of a mix between a barn burner and a slow burner you know it's an incredible ending you know but definitely a very slowly paced song at least at the start for a lead single but the wild sort of performance that she progresses into is the song moves along is electrifying definitely check this track out van horror the experimental industrial abrasive punk rat outfit horror has a new track out that I kind of flipped a flip through my fingers last week titled the United States of horror it's really noisy it's in your face it's ballsy and they're kind of experimenting with that aggressive rap sound that a lot of people are without just being a Death Grips ripoff or a clipping ripoff or whatever you know they definitely kind of got their own thing going and I'm looking forward to sort of seeing how far they can push it on the forthcoming project we have another song from Reno Drive art school these guys who you remember I shout it out on that track you're killing me really fantastic track make sure you give a listen to Remo drives you're killing me if you have not already and their new album greatest hits is out now this track is basically the new single the new music video track from the band that I wanted to shout out here just kind of remind you guys that the album is how you should check it out and I am going to give the review I am going to give a review so you know don't you you can ask as much as you want but I thought I am going to give a review so don't sit back there and they go I'm going to review it I'm going to review it and finally I want to give a shout out to the new actress track Xtreme I think that's a cute house it's x22 rme but I think it's pronounced extreme and actress coming through with an aesthetically pleasing a strange and a very eerie track that you know brings together those elements of house and techno and you just find some really interesting ways to experiment with it I thought his last album was going to be his last record under the name actress I could be wrong about that but I thought people are talking about that with the with the release of the last time which I liked a lot but I mean I like this - I'm not mad about it I'm just wondering - what I thought it was supposed to be a name change or something but maybe maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong but that's going to be it for this episode of the best most tracks the week guys appreciate you very much make sure to check out all these songs they are linked down there in the description along with our Amazon Associates link and again shout out to our big sponsor on this video the good people over at Dollar Shave Club and that's all thanks for watching thanks for making it this far in the video I'll catch you in the next one forever 
bHZ10YR3npo,hi everyone the Romani volcano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Laura Marling album temper femini this is Laura's sixth full-length album Pass and she made her solo debut in 2008 and since the release of that debut laura has very consistently stuck to what she does best very mature and measured contemporary in default topped with her very womanly voice occasionally embellished with some string sections or arranged instrumentation just to add a bit of depth now Laura checks most of the boxes of what I personally would look for in a good singer-songwriter but one reservation I have about her music consistently is that her songs her performances typically come off so polite that they don't really leave an impression on me now it seemed like that was due to change with the release of Laura's last album short films easily her boldest album yet made way more use of electric guitar than any record she's put out previously a full backing band too but now with the release of this new album Laura has gone back to her acoustic not so rustic coffeehouse singer-songwriter guitar player roots and the results don't exactly feel like Laura putting on an old favourite sweater or making this grand return to an awesome sound that she's long neglected with the exception of a few tracks mostly the singles on this album a lot of what Laura delivers on this record is just one original and very very sleepy now again there are exceptions like the song soothing a single off of this record I love the eerie very chill very subtle grooves on this track the cinematic string sections in this song to provide a great backdrop for Laura's very hush to vocals which crack with passion as she reaches into her upper register and despite the song's title the track is actually very unsettling not so much soothing the track actually borders on creepy and I also love the way that Laura sort of quietly cusses her way through some of the lyrics on the song wildfire another single from this thing Laura says on this track you always say you love me most when I don't know I'm being seen maybe someday when God takes me I'll understand what the that means occasionally on this album Laura makes some really interesting and smart and poignant observations on romantic relationships why they're frustrating why they're confusing she sends off of these topics into things like the ways men and women treat each other in such relationships this is the very concept of this album in a way but Laura's vocal delivery on this record pretty consistently it reads to me at least as nearly emotionless to the point where it's just difficult to read her whether or not she's neutral on what she's singing about she thinks what she's singing about is funny or really sad case in point the song don't pass me by which of any Laura Marling song I've heard has the most depressing descending chord progression what cuts even more about this track are the lyrics were Laura's singing about a guitar that I guess her and her boyfriend used to communally share and now she's telling him to take that guitar and play or hum songs that they used to enjoy together they used to enjoy playing together or like hawk the guitar for parts sort of dismantling it like the loving relationship that they used to have together it's absolutely depressing but the unfortunate thing about this track is that Laura's vocals do very little to sell the story in fact in the entire mix here between the string sections and the guitars and the lyrics her voice is the least dramatic thing Laura's writing on this song says I'm upset this relationship is over but her performance says I could take or leave it now the songs that take a more subtle instrumental approach on this record in my opinion are even more emotionally anemic like the track of the valley or the song next time whose vague warmth is the only memorable thing about this track or the track always this way whose melody I just cannot get away from it kind of reminds me of a slow-mo version of the chorus on Kenny Rogers the gambler got a Nolan Hold'em in wind bowl room Laura comes off a bit more expressive on the song wild one says she occasionally takes a break from singing on the song too throw-in these like little bits of spoken word that sound almost like she's reading a storybook to a bunch of bright-eyed children just hanging on her every word I like the finger pick guitar chords on this track they're very tense the well-arranged strings on the song are beautiful too and there's a lot of vocal overdubs on this track too that I thought brought the song a lot of character the son know well isn't bad either it's just Laura in her guitar the finger pick chords on this thing sound like they were recorded onto some weird old warp tape so they kind of have a bit of a dusty quality to them that I think brings some character to the track some of the most interesting lyrics on this entire record appear on this track as Laura is singing about assembly camaraderie between females and singing out this pledge of semper FM ni which the title of the album is obviously did named after in some ways this album is all right it's good but in other ways it's kind of aggravating and underwhelming because I feel like with each new record Laura Marling comes close to doing something really great but but just close whether or not she'll bridge that quality gap anytime soon and come out with something that sounds like it's distinctly hers or at least emotionally electrifying or emotionally enveloping I am because the sort of sleepy and very lazy but swaying alt-country electric guitar if I'd closing track on this record did very little to you know pick up the mood and it's not that I'm upset with this record being a very moody or a very sad album it's just a very blah album in my opinion I'm feeling a strong four to a like five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would your radiator that's your the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die because then you can't watch more reviews dude have a good day other links next to my head of albums I think you should check out subscribe to the channel Vishal website ooh 
0HBXfIV5xas,hi everyone Anthony Santino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another episode of on track with the needle drop our ongoing interview series and in this episode I'm talking with none other than mr. Denzel curry Florida rapper who dropped one of the most aggressive rap albums of last year right in the middle of 2016 Imperial his most successful project yet and in this interview we're going to be talking about the success of that project we're going to be talking about what fueled that project and where Denzel sort of ceases art moving in the future that more in this episode of on track going on dude I'm pretty good are you doing that's how we saw who's in the sexy yeah we were in Texas here in Austin you know where we just we were just outside Austin I think yeah we all know what it was because it'd be called loading time we were at the sound on sound festival you were invited there to perform I was invited there to do an interview with another artist and one thing I didn't know about that festival and something that it did not see advertised about that festival at all and I don't think you knew this either but it's on a Renaissance Faire ground so when we got there they were like all sorts of castles and shit everywhere yeah my standing it stands or you can get like turkey legs and there were people who it's like it's there people who work there year-round and they're dressed up in all like the Renaissance garb and everything and I saw some people they're still doing that it was a Robin Hood guy there and I saw some lady there and they were in character like amongst all these like you know festival goers and everything it was 40 years it was a college it was actually kind of gay because I love with this little Renaissance OD folks like yes yeah I was definitely like it was definitely its own thing and they had like I don't know it gave the festival like a unique thing like there was a guy who I don't know if you saw it it was like a guy who they had like all tied up with his hands near his head and he was like insulting people and we could throw tomatoes at the guy no I didn't even see that if you walked by he was like just insulting everybody who walked by it was like a weirdest thing wow I did not see that at all when I was oh but another thing at this festival that sort of made a memorable festival for me is that we met there and how we met is when it one of your dudes came up to me and he just said Denzel Curry's looking for you and I was like he's looking for me and then I said I hope we saw my new review I hope he saw my new positive difference roughly nearby III because I remember when you did nostalgic and I was like okay cool three surveillance rooms I thought she was going to get it where you like I use and then like Imperials like yeah I had to see their shit you know again when we heard that she was going to be out there doing the podcast is like man we got looked at right here and that's what happened and then they ended up finally Jew before I did it got a lot of things while we were down there and it's sort of like you know get going on my question something that I have to bring up because I heard people in the crowd talking about it when I was watching you perform and also recently a the platform is dead now so I feel like we kind of have to do a bit of a tribute here but one thing that happened last year we sure saw an ultimate sort of grew up on vine yeah and all of these videos were sort of like you know being linked to your song sort of like represents something really hard or crazy or like insane going on but you know I mean obviously I heard that song before all of that business and I enjoy that song or enjoyed it first outside of the context of that sort of meme it's called to me and the thing about that track is that it's so incredibly aggressive and powerful and from your face I mean such as such a fucking monstrous track and yeah you know in your opinion you know the guy who made that song I wrote those lyrics to perform that track you know I mean in your head do you have a vision for how people should be listening or perceiving this song like or not like like when like when people enjoy that song within the context of a meme that's a kind of ruin or for you is just another win at the end of the day there's another win because it gives more people to know myself in when I originally wrote that track here is just really for fun like is really for the fans like somebody for fun you know and it end up blowing up until things that I didn't even know we're gonna go bad so yeah I'm thankful about the means at the end of the day it could get enormous in size but now I'll thank for it because it's funny but it never grew up you don't yeah it probably would have got big but it's not sitting like that you know and I I do think though that you know obviously the world of people who are sort of being introduced to you through this meme are kind of different than maybe the world of people who you might have imagined kind of listening to this song the first place I mean you know are you the type of artist or the type of person who you're trying to make art that feels a certain way delivers a certain idea that live a certain feeling and you're trying to connect with other people who who also kind of share that with you or are you trying to go totally outside of your world kind of a look inside I mean I think it varies with both because sometimes I won't give you the lighter feel because everything is real at the end of the day if you want to be you know somewhat feel human and I want to do things that you later because I do some of the real disrespectful and like audiences all around the world by the same time like all like sometimes I come form for escapism so if I get very so he doesn't be able to listen to my music so like that I feel like that out of world experience like something that they never have before coming for like another dimension so like that like you can go to hand to hand it's like a balance I would say of moving away from that to just kind of how you're doing now as far as like you know career-wise at the moment I mean your latest record is it wrong to say that it's pretty much your most well received album so far as far as like you know diagram is not perception all that now it's not wrong to say that because it was actually well structured well written and it did feel like his own thing and most of the artwork in the videos everything was cohesive with the imagery that came with the music sonically you know so like I would say it was really their way down to the vision I'm saying is that I'm saying it's been we're really well received by the fans like it's getting you more of a following yeah yeah yes yeah that is true because most of them said this is like the real secret to nostalgia 54 which was got Miriam sitting in the first day and it really speeds in that cocktail okay so so it's gained you a larger following moving forward from here when you're releasing new music recording new music writing new music is it important for you to sort of maintain your artistic independence because as far as I know you're still not signed to like a major or anything like that yeah I mean it was really important for me at least because nobody can't tell me what Barney's end of the day I know what gets from the other end of the day and the people who spelling me know because they've been there and they know who I am and they know what I'm doing gave me what it is I go through you know so it's real important for me to have to creative control over myself nobody could tell me what gives occurs right only I know what I can write and what I can do and what I have to do and at this point with your career and with your your followers your fan base I mean originally you were getting a lot of tension off the fact that you were sort of affiliated with Space Ghost personal Raider clan thing and I wasn't that sort that sort of splintered off and would you say at this point you're kind of you sort of come into your own sort of the hypothesis that is kind of died down and now you've kind of got your own movement going yeah of course because when I was working on the interior win like I've basically owned my spirit and that's what separated me from the rest I mean even when I worked on ecology that was roughly Paul working on the album it's both you know even though it was over the majors it was a little like that I can't with some olive lay back win you know just like believe I do much and you know the sort of independence that that you're enjoying right now you know with your fan base I mean and people who were either a part of that same Raider Klan movement or are affiliated with it in some way you know other collaborators like little ugly Mane or other artists who obviously share like a similar fan base like bones for example you guys have such a huge a gigantic like a passionate and fiery following on Soundcloud and it's like it's really crazy because it's sort of like its own sort of like I don't know storm in a teacup or something because it just doesn't seem like it not to say that doesn't exist anywhere else but it seems like it's at its height there but you guys are getting hundreds and thousands of streams off songs and it seems like to me like as an outsider like that's something that labels would be just rolling over themselves to like get a hold of you know I mean our labels not approaching or are you guys like how is your independence that important to you that you're just like we're just going to do it on our own because we can just continue that way I mean they we did approach me and then I eventually ended up silence a number Vista's but the main thing was I didn't want my art to be compromised by somebody who doesn't even understand it and just go having it go and then show for you so I came up with a list of demands because at the end of the day this is my drug dealing and I'll get a drug dinner you deliver the dope you can't you know they just so spongy for the dope noses and you just got addicted money you slip it so I thought like a drug dealer when it came down for the music shit and that's the reason we're wildlife independence is like really important to me some because I'm not trying to be with the middleman I'm not trying to you know like be like under anyone like a soldier I want to be my own leader you know that's writing something and nobody could say from being and then individually like so I always give me you know be yeah I'm thinking my art is like going to get my dope and I can't have that happen alright well that's obviously what sort of drives you as far as the business side of things as far as releasing your music but what about sort of that drive for a creative progression because plan of shrooms that you were saying you know that that those sister EPS like that was way more experimental for you that was way more psychedelic what caused you to metamorphosize from that to Imperial we're obviously it's a way less psychedelic album it's way more in-your-face it's dry it's gritty it's rods more concrete it's real you know sort of wanted what what made you change from one to the other you know sort of in between those two projects because I listen to all my projects back on this nostalgic first and see why people really liked it so well and then I Leslie said pieces of playing shoes they had to understand why people did like that so where I see where most people see failure I could see success so what I did was I made something that was really straight to the point very cohesive and just very in-your-face because I was going through a lot of emotions at that time and that's what had to happen and that's how Imperial came out and um you know what about sort of your experience level at that point too because you know it has been a little while since you were put out those EPS and you know let's also put out there that you were really young when you came out with nostalgic 64 yeah you know and in between there and Imperial I mean a lot happened a lot could have happened in between those times and I mean even now you're still relatively young in your early 20s rub you know at this point do you feel like you're hitting upon a sound that you're going to be sticking with a while or do you still feel like you're still learning and that you still have a lot of progression go ahead of you and a lot of change ahead of you that part is it yeah I learned yeah learning pretty much I was just learning and try to progress every day you know I'm trying to find new ways to evolve I'm not trying to stay the same way because if I say the same way it's going to end up being traditional a routine they're people going to get used to it eventually get bored so I'll just find a new ways and a way to find a new way to learn in order to learn you guys do uncomfortable things and would be uncomfortable that's how you grow where do you see yourself going with this new record with your music on this new album where you're going to be pushing us next in terms of your sound of your message my ultimate link to all these together one of them do is like the trippy sound and the psychedelic sound that I heard on like the solid Rican 23 but I'm going to mix that with the structure that I had on the pier you thought it could be well written Falls and everything because if I don't know if y'all notice on in fear you like I didn't have those like really no real transitions but how the salsa did and like how we can guarantee shows me they're all going to mix both of them together because I know how to write the songs well structure in my cohesive now you notices and the deeper subject matters instead of just like the same topics that I've been going over to you I often it goes people info that I'm afraid to touch on just make a real positive about how things grow as an artist and what topics you know you were talking about earlier how you were going to sort of you know really touch people emotionally with this record what topics are you going to be addressing the sort of elicits that kind of emotion from not from the audience my strong suit is storytelling but I can tell the best stories when I'm using like this kind Rock involving and sick and tired like this life most of those you know so most of ourselves that were really well receive with stories and I just want to touch on topics that people that people don't touch on in life the childish revelations that lose the Imam you know like things like that like things while people relate to pretty much all right moving off of that because you've given us a lot on that and if all that's true I'm looking forward to the record but as far as sort of hip hop in general which I want to kind of give your opinion on because you know you're very young right now you're putting out music that a lot of people love you're going to be the future of this genre in a lot of ways you know because while you know a lot of other artists who are older maybe bigger than you in terms of status right now you know that their pockets ticking you know it's like you're the next generation so moving on from here do you feel like I don't know does it concern you that hip hop sort of seems so fractured right now because there are so many different sounds and subgenres and subcultures room the genre right now I mean live but not there's like almost like a sea of difference between artists like leap or V ghosts or bus driver and maxima and no to me so a little Rotty you know and sort of waiting to see yourself fitting into a dress because integrated so that seems like a tornado or a mosh pit with everybody sort of doing their own thing I mean I don't feel like I'll go fit in because yeah it's kind of arguing for this question right gonna launch me I'm like oh yeah I mean it's a big topic like I would say like I'll go fit in because I'm not going to do anything that's gonna make me sound like another artist you know because like if you listen emotions in a video of everybody pretty much down the same is shit I got the same things like lean and all this shit I already listen whatever the fuck in my real just gonna stand out because like everyone's up like I'm just gonna stand out because not saying I'm different just because like the subject matters in the state that's gonna set me apart with the beats and everything like every be dang I'm going to having go get Metro boomin beat or like this and turn that shit you know it's just gonna be like is it going to be me you know everything laughing like that's or something ready for everybody else everybody else going to tell about the end of the day we had the same common subject they are yeah they said they're man and is it going to other light forward for men that flower with keyboard but as far as I'm you know you're talking about a lot of hip-hop song sounding the same on the radio do you feel like the radio is dictating the sound of the genre and the culture as much as it use it as well that kind of you know gone onto the Internet nah the radio gig takes the style the Internet has every time you go imagine you just all have to look for it like you get people get paid to play the fan cinema and I know about it like that but it is you know so it's it's still sort of like radio is kind of like guiding the guiding the guiding the sound of the culture right now more than sort of what you're seeing online there yeah my dish a you hear like a we care for like I feel like on this like you heard it just now I did like three songs ladies you go ahead at them again is hidden heavy rotation when I was in heavy rotation is like you know is being dictated by somebody you know and if it's not there's an editor but back to uh I guess the genre is sort of being fractured a little bit you know do you still sort of see hip-hop functioning right now as yeah yeah that's kind of a culture as kind of a conscious culture or is it kind of just like in a bunch of pieces at the moment it's just in a bunch of pieces because everybody's not like conscious you know it's a everybody as they own the Jimi's you got your conscious people over here we got this like if you go over here you got your gangsters over here and whatever they do like it's still a hip-hop like it's not tradition hip-hop is not traditional if it was it will still be right there like an 80s overnight you know it has to keep my in order for hip-hop to survive it had to keep adapting in order to adapt you have to keep the basic form but at the same time you know other forms is why you keep your basic form then it just experiment with that so I would say like if I was still alive it's just like it's just go to the definitely keep moving that's the same way you rock you know right in the same way everything is progressing like how we were talking about like if you freeze with like and that just keeps progressing right that's how hip-hop is because nothing's really like routine nothing speaks there's nothing like kick you know today is going to keep evolving and keep adapting you know you just kind of used rock as an example there but a lot of people lately have been kind of uh spinning the narrative that uh that rock music is kind of run out of ideas and sort of hit a bit of a creative wall and in some respects hip-hop has replaced rock in terms of that countercultural force tell mater they gotta mix because rock and rap got mixed overtime like you hear some artists that sound like punk artists but their rap artists at the same time like even though other name lil ugly Mane used to be annoys artists and you couldn't tell by his music that he mixed noise along with rap and like same way my shit like I mixed psychedelic shit with my raps and that's what keeps it going and we came off like a rock field or whatever but at the same time there's a lot of stuff that's missing in my business and making fools in there there's like a whole bunch of movies in one part of music and that's why rap is replaced a rock because we know how to mix and formulate flow because they want to hear something that they can feel which seems like something that you can hear a rock because you can feel rock they have the same sound do you want to hear flow lets you hear flow you get there from my Caribbean music all types of music is all rhythm you love them so well like thinking about some of those artists that people would talk about say like oh you know these are great rock artists for example to me what sort of themes have been lost as kind of the spirit and that spirit has sort of continued in in your music and the music of artists like little ugly main you know that that rebellious spirit that outlaw spirit I feel like you know Rock traditionally you know a sort of loss because you just have tons of artists who are just kind of copying the artists who were outlaws at one time where's like people like you you're kind of venturing out and doing your own thing and pioneering in a way yeah yeah that's true because I don't want to just be doing the same thing that everybody else going that's not you do all right well I want to

yTYsVjeoe-Q,yeah hi everyone it's personal shrimp Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new idols album Brutalism this is the debut full-length album from UK punk rock outfit idols and this thing is so electrifying it's so enraged it's a raw and noisy and overwhelming the noise rock fans will be into it the post-punk fans will be into it people who like their music with a lot of mayhem people who are into albums like maybe a ice ages you're nothing we'll probably get something out of this too by comparison idols guitar work isn't quite as unruly it's a little more tight and driving and intense but they use that extra helping of actual musicianship to achieve a a similarly overwhelming feeling it's reaching a boiling point it's it maximum capacity the band is either doing that or they are sculpting these very groovy very jerky rhythms and bass lines and guitar leads that sound like the soundtrack to the most violent dancefloor on the planet over which the frontman Joe Talbot delivers these incredible vocals which could almost almost rival that of some of the UK punk movements most notorious singers like Marky Smith or Steve ignorant maybe even Johnny Rotten which I definitely get a vibe of him and influence from him off of the track Exeter nothing ever happens but Talbots vocals are so raspy they're so guttural it sounds like the guy gargles engine coolant for breakfast every morning and his delivery a lot of the time is so snarky that it burns so tongue and sheep that he has just punched a hole through his cheek like when he's singing on the song well done where he goes through a series of repetitious phrases like why don't you get a degree even taqwa and has a degree even maryberry has a degree yes name checking maryberry the the English English food writer for some reason he goes on to reframe these same phrases with reggae a-and football I guess in a way to lampoon the idea of pressuring other people into liking this really bad lowest common denominator entertainment or whatever I'm not entirely sure what the intended target is because it's just like a shotgun blast of sarcasm that's kind of spraying in so many different directions but the album is full of all these hilarious and socially sharp and very grim and sobering mantras like on the track Stendhal syndrome for example which I guess is a real condition where people suffering from it react in really extreme ways to paintings the band turned this into an opportunity to tear down people who react in really dumb and uncultured ways to art that they don't understand opening the track up with did you see that painting Rothko did it looks like it was pay to buy to your old head set against these blistering wild guitars and an insanely tight drum beat that I'm amazed that the pace keeps up for the entirety of the track you know the stupid ignorance toward art they're making fun of on this track it reminds me of someone or on the track mother where we hear this repetition of the the phrase my mother worked 15 hours five days a week 16 hours six days a week 17 hours seven days a week and also the best way to scare Ettore is to read and get rich talking about the right side of britain's political spectrum later in the track the band makes a statement about sexual violence violence against women which sort of brings a very grim context to the mother fucka chorus that has been repeating up until this point i mean this in the nicest way possible but john Talbots vocals are nasty and disgusting which makes the nasty and disgusting realities that he sings about sound even more nasty and disgusting but not so nasty that he can't pull off a song hook here and there on this album like on the track heal or date night or the very powerful faith in the city where he's singing about these people who he knows who are on hard times suffering from cancer having a hard time finding a job but they find refuge ghin in religion in their faith in God not entirely sure if he is using sarcasm here as well there wasn't anything in the lyrics it sounded like he was trying to tear these people down directly in like a in a really obvious way but nearly everything that comes out of this dudes mouth sounds like you know it's it's sour it's mean it kind of throws my sincerity meter off because I don't know when exactly he's being heartfelt be very catchy 10:49 gah so is the kind of speedy and bright melodic hardcore that I would have expected some California band to come out with in the 90s but they sort of put their own little fun grim concrete UK post-punk spin on it the track is an semuc and way more versatility in this track listing that I was expecting considering how the start of this thing goes off like gangbusters though later the band does attempt to pull together this very dreary low-key closer with mostly just vocals and a piano in the background I wish this track had more of a melody to speak of more of a structure to speak of it just kind of seems like a piano rant I appreciate that it's different than any other track in the track listening but it's kind of a dud still though the many spots of melodic sweetness on this record not only add memorability to these tracks but they kind of take the edge off of just how gruff these tracks are sometimes the band flirts with the meaning or the intent of a particular song rather than just kind of coming out and saying what they mean right in your face even though the tone of this music very much comes off like that sort of like I'm a song white privilege where we get a lot of funny one-liners one about how many optimists does change a light bulb none because they ask their Butler to change it this always poor never bored mantra and also this mention of this girl having one miscarriage two abortions a degree and seven jobs I'm not entirely sure what the intended target is of this track with such a hot-button title I guess it's sort of open to interpretation or I guess another example of track sort of being more of a shotgun blast than it is like a laser pointed critique of a particular thing you though the track is titled white privilege I imagine in a way that must have at least served as the inspiration for this song and I feel like I haven't talked about the instrumentation of this album enough I mean while it is pretty mean potatoes the performances on this thing are invigorating the guitars the bass and the drum are so raw and the performance you're just so tight they're just so goddamn ah they're muscular they're toned but yeah there's also enough sonic mayhem happening on with a lot of guitar freak-outs and distortions and squeals and to keep things sounding like you know not just a plain Jane Punk album but like a a whirlwind of insanity all that being said this is a great rock album in my opinion it's not entirely new for the style or the genre but I do think these guys already have a lot going for them in terms of good performances good vocals interesting lyrics good guitar work I like how fat and dense the production is there's just enough versatility to keep this 13 track forty one-minute track listing pretty interesting and it sounds like these guys have enough fire in their bellies to push themselves even further for another record - now there are a few tracks on this thing that pale in comparison to others like divide and conquer which is just really slow and lumbering doesn't really stick out to me as a highlight in the track listing here seems kind of like the pacing is off considering how many snappy barnburners there are on this thing and raychel co2 and benzocaine while there are elements of these songs that I like that they seem kind of like just a reiteration of the formulas that the band had been playing with up until this point they don't really add anything to the tracklist of the previous tracks didn't already in my opinion combining this with the closer I guess the album could have you know ended a bit stronger still though I am feeling a light eight on this record if you're looking for a hard-hitting heavy and very in your face and in lyrically intriguing Punk record don't let this thing slip by it don't let it don't don't let it slip by you make sure you give it a listen and we are going to transition have you given this album

lpA54RhgWEA,ha ha ha hi everyone the Ministry of Sound handle your Internet's busiest music nerd I'm sorry I don't incorporate Cal in any meaningful ways anymore that God man God and it's time for a review of the brand-new sort sort of new it's been out for a little bit now of the new blank mass album world-eater this is the latest album from electronic music producer benjamin john power he's better known as one half of the experimental electronic music duo fuck buttons he is back with his third solo effort over here his second for the sacred bones label I came away from his last album 2015's dumb flesh thinking it was decent but the album didn't leave much of an impression on me and overall the record just kind of felt like a bit of a an artistic outlet for Benjamin for a lot of the things that wouldn't have necessarily made sense on a fuck buttons record but now with it being 4 years since the duo's last album it seems like some of the ambitious epic and very climactic song progressions that typically make it onto their records are kind of seeping into world-eater over here because overall this album is sounding way louder more experimental almost unpredictable as the record kicks off with this weird cycling series of very glossy synth loops that sound like something off of a vaporwave album like not really the sonic tone I would have expected him to take with this record and even though it's a weird contrast the song seems to segue very smoothly into the next song Arisa sand- this track for me is beyond words favourite track on the records mostly because there's so much going on with this track the burning searing synth leads are fantastic I love all the layers of distortion the bustling busy relentless beats all the industrial sound effects the track just gets thicker and more overwhelming as it continues benjamin works through one passage after another on this thing it's a multi-faceted track and the song stays pretty epic from front to back some of the moments on this thing feature these beautiful glistening since arpeggios like around the 3-minute mark and then just at 4:35 things get hyper distorted and what sounds like these animalistic screams make their way into the mix sounds like something that would have been on the last Korean trekker door even a pharmacon album like I would not have expected the sound to turn up on this album and yet he does it so well and toward the very end of the track the music makes this shift into a very dense maximal electronic composition that is along the lines of that of a Dan Deacon this thing is just a nine-minute monster and Benjamin does a great job of just densely packing it with some really interesting ideas now unfortunately the next few tracks kind of suffer from a relative lack of ideas or a much more basic structure kind of like with a lot of fuck buttons material the issue I kind of have coming away from these songs is that they don't necessarily justify their semi-long link the song please stylistically I think is another subtle nod to the vaporwave community with kind of how slow and warped the song is the weird vocal sampling the singing has this low-pitched monie quality to it would probably sound very at home on like a Macintosh Plus album or even like Daniel Lowe patents echo jams but ultimately Benjamin comes to his own kinds of conclusions off of these references off of these ideas because again we have a mix here that's so densely packed so full of sonic experiments and studio trickery I just would have loved the structure of this thing to be a bit more ambitious as most of the song is spent with Benjamin shifting back and forth between these two kind of musical passages in the track kind of feel the same way about the song the rat although this song takes a different musical approach with this very driving persistent rhythm and these very kooky synth leads that are kind of her key and jerky remind me of something that would have been on an early battles album maybe even an animal collective vibe coming off of the rhythm here the pacing and structure of the song silent treatment is a little better the track kicks off at this very high gloss Loud large and in charge wall of synthesizers that are very attention grabbing eventually settles into these very very low versus with cerebral hypnotic beats and a very relaxing male vocal that reminds me for some reason of like Crystal Castles first record I love how he transitions out of this into these grandiose spiraling passages of synthesizers that are just huge they're opulent the finish of this track is super epic and it's easily one of the album's better songs the song Minnesota east force naked is another surprising twist because this thing for all intents and purposes is like a noise drone piece which I'm actually very into because if there's anything that I think makes this album special makes this album interesting it's the sound of this album Benjamin does excellent sound craft on this record the sounds are so crisp and did it and loud and in-your-face and tangible and rough and smooth and shimmering and beautiful and garish and ugly I love the strange stuttering glitches on this track the haunting tones these weird sporadic noisy pieces of percussion that sound like they were lifted off of a Halloween sound effects tape all of these things assemble into this monolithic block of sonic horror which intensifies very nicely eventually mellows out into these beautiful almost new agey synthesizers that kind of layer over each other they're there and then eventually at the very end we kind of get this dreamy nostalgic be looping into itself that seems very warped another obvious nod to either the sounds of vaporwave or the sounds of chill wave I don't know what it is about this stuff that makes Benjamin keep coming back and referencing it only for a little bit or referencing it in just a very very subtle way but I guess it does add some personality to the record unfortunately hive mind is not really the Big Finish I was hoping for it's one of the more easygoing tracks on the entire album it really does kind of take a while to get going although I do like its final destination I do like this album quite a bit a lot like dumb flesh Benjamin comes through with a real amalgamation of sounds that if you just listed them down on paper all these musical influences and styles they shouldn't make sense on an album but yet Benjamin's very unique and very distinct approach to designing sounds on this record somehow pulls it all together into a really cohesive album much more cohesive than his previous record I think and even the songs that I wasn't totally in love with did have very powerful moments that within them compositionally structurally I think the album did leave a little bit to be desired on a handful of tracks but for the most part that's really interesting and ambitious record for Benjamin and I think an improvement on what he's been doing I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this album true transition have you given this album a listen did you know did you hate it what would you write or hit

dePHKrFDZvE,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Charli XCX mixtape number one angel u kpop starlet Charli XCX is back with a new project following up last year's awesome room room which was my favorite EP of 2016 and a project that to me is really important in Charley's discography because it it marks the moment of her turning a new leaf a little bit because almost everything she's come out with up until that point I hated to be completely honest yet vrooom vrooom is so awesome to me not just because it's so colorful and risky and adventurous and strange and catchy and just bizarro but also it's just a departure from the bland predictable electro pop formula that Charlie had been playing with up until that point now linking up with the PC music label and bringing on AG Cooke and Sophie to do some production and writing on this EP helped make that possible and her connections to the PC music label continue on this new tape over here though in comparison with vrooom vrooom number one angel is decidedly less experimental it sounds like Cooke and company are doing their best to support Charlie in a poppier endeavor number one angel seems more like an even compromise although I am skeptical of Charlie and PC music going in this direction because that's pretty much what they did on the after the after-party single which considering everyone that was involved with that track I thought I would have loved it but that song was an utter disappointment to me now sadly Charlie and her producers moving in this direction on this mixtape the results are a little less refreshing but I guess there is a bit of a trade going on here because while number one angel is not really that kooky or off-the-wall the songs do feel more fleshed out a little more mature a little better written you know there's definitely a more straightforward electro pop vibe on this record with some hip hop undertones some contemporary rap undertones here and there but there's just enough quark to keep things interesting keep things from sounding generic keep things from in completely run-of-the-mill the opening track dreamer takes me back to the electrifying swagger of a lot of tracks on that room broom EP but now it's set against this huge spacious luxurious instrumental with loads of bouncy bass which is enhanced with this tight auto-tune feature from Stara and a great verse from Ray Charli XCX dominates the chorus and the bridge on this thing she almost feels like a feature on her own song because she doesn't sort of do a verse officially on this track but it's still a good opener to the record and an interesting sort of take between Charlie and her producers on sort of what is the contemporary sound of pop right now and there are plenty of other tracks on this thing that seemed to balance Charlie's pop sensibilities with PC musics eclectic style song lip gloss The Closer on this thing I keep it I keep thinking backing it glass which has the super bright sugary quirky hook it's very hyper it's very futuristic it's very synthetic and it's very sweet sweet on the ears but then that is contrasted greatly by the very gritty and graphically sexual verse that cupcake brings to the table which is packed with an icarly reference having cupcake on this track in my opinion is huge I might have never really been a huge fan of a single project of hers her music has always kind of been spotty a little bit a little inconsistent but she does a fantastic job on this track she's just what the song needed to make that sweet just a little bittersweet the song roll with me features all these punchy jittery rhythms some zany vocal samples a bit of a PC music calling card their chipmunk and reverent and that just creates a lot of musical mayhem in the background Charli XCX on top of this has this really cool composure she's smooth she's sexy she's singing about this moment of lustre attraction that she seems to be having - this guy in the club and she doesn't want that moment to end so she's asking this guy to come with her to leave with her to roll with her the song I love you to is similarly Bhoomi synthetic futuristic I love the tracks blaring guitar chords or they're probably the simpad or something like that on the pre-chorus and then the refrain is pretty antenna and the track of emotional is probably the strongest tune that this record has to offer this thing has a huge inspiring hook and it sounds more mature than anything that was on sucker however I wish there was more to speak of on the instrumental side of things PC musics wild personality doesn't really show up in the beat on this thing unfortunately they played a really straight they played a really plain again I just wish that there was more to say about this instrumental it just kind of goes through the motions of supporting Charlie which is fine I guess it's cool to hear Charlie putting out more music where the beat is the centerpiece the beat is the star of the show it's a vocal performance and her vocal melodies that are making the track so great which is also kind of the case for the very low-key and intimate white roses which has this very alluring sexy vibe to it then we have the also straightforward baby girl which features this vintage throwback synth pop B sounds like something straight out of the 80s Charli XCX is very sensual vocal performance here plays toward that vibe too I love everything about this track from the glistening instrumental to the very very sexy verses to the bubbly hook the one hitch on the track I would say is Effie's feature I mean it's very peppy it's just the amount of brightness that I think the track needed to pick things up a little bit just to add a little bit of contrast a little bit of diversity amongst the track but she comes in with what sounds like this this inflection that is oh is it a fake patois I have no idea what the hell she's doing when she enters the song because she sounds ridiculous it does make me cringe a little bit although ultimately I don't think it ruins the song entirely it's so short she's really like a blip on the radar of this song it's like a quarter of a feature there are a moments though on this album where I think the material trends a little too close toward bland blame it on you is a track that isn't completely run-of-the-mill in my opinion but the the beat is so uninspired in comparison with many of the other instrumentals on this thing especially since it doesn't change in any significant way on the hook the hook feels anemic very unsupported the song comes off kind of like a cold fish in my opinion I feel roughly the same about the track drugs and 3 a.m. while it is very bouncy upbeat tune comes off like anybody could have produced it in this obnoxious trend that everybody is going through right now where it seems like everybody has to come through with some Caribbean tinged dancehall tinged pop anthem all that being said there were only tracks on this album that underwhelmed me nothing I really hated or thought was awful I think number one angel is one of Charlie's most consistent projects yet but if there is a persistent problem that I think couldn't continually ways her music down it has to be the lyrics and not that the room room he was super deep lyrically or anything like that but it was at least kind of left field and quirky and abstract and silly playful lyrically number one angel toes the line for typical pop Pat and I get that Charlie makes pop music there's nothing wrong with making pop music I don't think the lyrics on this album are total trash or offensively bad they're just kind of run-of-the-mill very cliche which is surprising to be considering that it seems like she's trying to take a very artsy approach with her songs especially on the production end of things and why that sense of adventure stops at the lyric some I'm not totally sure still though while number one angel is less adventurous than broom broom in comparison I do think this is a step in the right direction because while I love broom broom I didn't come away from that anticipating that Charlie XCX forever would just be coming out with this super experimental weird abstract pop music for the rest of her career I mean she already has an established fan base who probably isn't that interested in that so again not surprised to hear her move in a more accessible direction with with this over here and hopefully number one angel brings her closer to coming out with an album very soon that is able to successfully balance her wishes to write these pop tunes right these pop anthems but maybe with lyrics that bite a little harder a little more memorable and backing all of this up with a unique production that PC music continues to provide I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this thing true at Ram chin have you given this album a listen vigil oh did you hate it walk would ever know hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die because then you can't watch more of my videos speaking of which other videos next

APoGyJqeeKw,hi everyone listening lists can out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a list Kanye West from worst to best what inspired this video is that earlier this year you may have caught that complex media the MCN for this YouTube channel came out with an article ranking Kanye West's projects from worst to best it was kind of controversial mostly because of the very low placement of late registration at the time I was thinking about doing some kind of response or stink piece about it but there weren't that many things that I disagreed with strongly like on a gut level in the article obviously the article was written from from a big fans perspective so that person had positive things to say about nearly every project there which is fine basically why I didn't really make a response because a lot of the logic behind that article seemed to be fueled by just more personal taste not really anything egregious within the article itself but still I thought the idea of doing this embarking on a list like this was a cool and an interesting idea so I'm trying to do it myself here cruel summer this is really more of a various artists compilation not entirely a Kanye project I only include it here because it was including the original list really more of a technicality my inclusion on this list there are some great singles on it but this is really just again a compilation that's kind of masterminded by Kanye through the good music label and I guess it's good to throw here because it's an example of Kanye kind of dominating during a year when rap crews cliques squads were the prevailing trend and then immediately everybody's rap crew kind of dissipated because everyone found out how hard it is to manage and just keep a rap crew going because of all the competing egos and artistic styles also varying levels of fame and relevance everybody kind of has their own separate solo thing going to it just comes down to everybody wants to be wu-tang but I mean after a while even wu-tang couldn't be wu-tang anymore because they all had to kind of go off and do their own separate things best tracks on this thing though mercy new God flow and also the don't like remix hey yeezus yeezus yeezus Kanye's worst album in my opinion and for a number of reasons for one this is the rare moment in Kanye's career where he's not ahead of the curve he's not on the cutting edge instead on this album Kanye is trying to play catch up with the growing trend of experimental and industrial hip-hop that had already been thriving and reinventing itself for the past two years and it sounds like it with all the rushed kind of rickety not that adventurous instrumentals on this album the ridiculously overly simplistic dumb lyrics pretty much everything Kanye does on this record tails in comparison to the new bold and boundary-pushing crop of artists who obviously inspired this album there are a few cool ideas and singles here and there a black skinhead is a pretty decent track even if this song at its core is Kanye crying about how the fashion industry won't accept him but ultimately this album on the whole is a miserable attempt at being experimental so much so that the afterglow My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy couldn't convince the entire hip hop industry to get onboard with this album but that's tracks on this album though being a blood on leaves and bound to watch the throne watch the throne watch the throne this album was essentially the first leg of Kanye's post My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy victory lap cruel summer being the second a lot of people at the time saw this collaborative album with jay-z is kind of being a torch passing moment but I don't see it really as that because I feel like that torch from jay-z's generation to Kanye's generation had already been passed if this album does anything or did anything at the time it confirmed what we already knew that Kanye was at the top of his game and nobody on a solo level was really competing with him though this album in a sense was still kind of a Jay and Connie trying to provide some counterpoint some competition to the noise that Lil Wayne and Drake were making at the time because Drake was kind of this new exciting up-and-coming face who was starting to rival Kanye in terms of being hip-hop artists with massive pop crossover appeal which if you followed Kanye's career that's one of the things that made him so special in the first place now this album did have a lot of shortcomings to it jay-z not being in his lyrical prime there are some very gimmicky beats on this thing too there are even a few tracks that I think in the short time this album has been released have not aged that well like who gon stop me sounds like a bad dubstep remix of what could have been a good Kanye song and this album came a year too late to be the glamorous send-off to The Bling era of hip-hop that I think it accidentally was and even Chuck D came out and I think made a very good observation of this album being so ritzy so glitzy to the point where it was kind of tone-deaf still some of Kanye's best tracks around this album the extravagance of this record does kind of make it a unique moment in his career and I would say there are more moments on this album than there are not where Kanye and jay-z bring quite a bit of chemistry to the table my picks on this album would have to be murder to excellence and God have it and dubbed the song about them being in Paris the life of Pablo the life of Pablo I think the life of Pablo is one of Kanye's most interesting albums he takes an incredible amount of risks on this record and the promotional rollout of this album was one of the oddest in the history of hip-hop but pablo lands in the bottom half of this list because it's such a mess of an album especially when you consider the subpar mixing on the first version of the record that was released to everybody that that was not really alleviated all that much with the version that's more widely available now musically and thematically this record is all over the place you have tracks like ultra light beam which features a great verse from chance the rapper and is essentially like this futuristic gospel epic the very freaky schizo freestyle for that I think comes closer to making industrial rap music than any number of tracks from yeezus and tracks like no parties in LA and real friends bring back the old Kanye that Kanye is joking about on the song I love Kanye there are some very bright and entertaining ideas on this album also some very uninspired ones to the line about Kanye getting some models asshole bleach on his t-shirt will probably go down in history as one of his worst the song part two is really just a glorified panda remix and there are still a number of tracks on this thing with the rushed feel of the album that come off kind of haphazardly slapped together and don't really sound like they know what they're doing or they know what they want to be wolves being probably the prime example still though that rawness that unpredictability that lightning in a bottle quality that this album has does make it a unique moment in Kanye's discography even if it does end up being kind of a double-edged sword for the record some of my favorite tracks on this album include famous ultralight beam feedback effects and real friends [Music] graduation graduation graduation Kanye's third album here is one of my personal favorites if I was basing this list merely on my personal preferences I would have probably placed it higher but part of my logic going into this list is that I wanted to talk about Kanye's albums not just from the perspective okay I like this one I like that one this is what makes this one special but also I kind of rank these albums in level of importance and relevancy and significance to Kanye's career as a whole I think this album was really good for the time it was released but there are reasons I didn't put it higher after the college dropout and late registration Kanye was looking to challenge himself shake things up try something different and potentially push his career to the next level by fully embracing the sounds of pop rap I would even say that he innovated within that sound with a handful of the songs here namely cuts like flashing lights and stronger by tastefully incorporating elements of dance music and electronic music the issue is that a bulk of this album right now sounds so dated because it just reeks of The Bling era that it was born out of which in retrospect seems like kind of an odd move considering that late registration and the college dropout were so great because they were a breath of fresh air from that prime examples of tracks that did not age well on this album being a Barry Bonds with little Wayne the good life with t-pain and never mind hot and drunk girls because that track was just awful upon the release of this record however for its time this album was nothing short of a success for Kanye and while there were some hip-hop purists who were kind of griping about him kind of doing a bit of a departure from his trademark sound this album proved that Kanye's talents were extending and could extend beyond the hip-hop universe which he would continue to do with album after album after album some of the best tracks on this album in my opinion are flashing lights good morning everything I am Big Brother an amazing autobiographical track from Kanye and I don't think he gets enough credit for the homecoming track with Chris Martin on this album because for its time that was a weird feature that was a weird collaboration for a hip hop artists to do very uncool for a hip hop artist to do that kind of feature and the song went over really well Kanye's continued to prove himself as being a hip hop artist who has way more eclectic tastes than a lot of his contemporaries 808 sin heart break it up 808 of it very much the opposite of graduation in that upon its initial release this album was widely misunderstood disliked by very many people a lot of people assumed that this was Kanye's complete departure from hip hop that everyone's assumptions that they were pulling out of what Kanye was doing on graduation had been confirmed but little did anybody know in 2008 that what Kanye was doing on this record would be the the shape of hip hop to come less than five years later because Kanye's hyper-emotional and auto-tune balladry on this album would down the road translate into artists like Drake and future now whether or not the genius of this move was entirely Kanye's is up for debate because Kid Cudi was a co-writer on at least a few tracks on this record but Kanye taking huge amounts of inspiration and ideas from his contemporaries and protegees is nothing new at this point no ID Rhymefest Travis Scott but being early to the party doesn't necessarily mean that Kanye did this sound best since 2008 this style has had a lot of time to mature and smooth out and I think gained more of a pop appeal there are a few moments on this record that did not age all that well like see you in my nightmares where Kanye goes toe to toe with Weezy to see who has the worst singing voice rarely does a song embody its title this much and the track Robocop fills Kanye's quota for horrific Lea corny song idea that made the cut of the album anyway but some of 808s most pivotal tracks I think still serve as a blueprint today for a lot of the very tuneful track that's climb the charts right now even if the artists making it aren't fully aware of that and the song amazing with Jeezy even teases toward the sound that Kanye would be delivering to us with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy this isn't a perfect album but it's one of the most cutting edge moments in Kanye's entire discography and also very glamorous and melodic adventure through Kanye's psyche during a time when he was going through a lot of personal turmoil due to losing the most important person in his life his mother somehow he soldiered through this extravagant pop epic and densely packed it with raw emotions so raw that they made up for a lot of Kanye's vocal shortcomings the best tracks on this thing in my opinion heartless welcome to heartbreak amazing bad news love lockdown and coldest winter lay registration it's nice rajen Sheth shed lady registration one of my personal favorites and Kanye's discography even if there isn't that much to say about it in light of what we already knew about Kanye at the time and heard from Kanye after the college dropout this album may be in a lot of ways they refined reiteration of many of the sounds that we heard on his debut but this record is super important because the show that Kanye had commercial viability he wasn't just a one album Wonder singles like gold digger made him what he is today and confirmed that Kanye's style had chart power without him having to wire it down or sell it short this record is like 10 years old at this point it still sounds great it's most likely going to go down as one of Kanye's most timeless effort and that's all thanks to the great fundamentals that Kanye came into this album with be very funny and clever one-liners in terms of phrase in his verses the great production on this thing laced with bright inspiring soul samples and smooth jazzy loops good feature list raw personality great messages on some of these songs very personal deep cuts to like roses and addiction and crack music those tracks on this album are some of the best in my opinion in addition to diamonds from Sierra Leone Purdham say hey mama and gone my beautiful doctorates in a faster okay I get it I can already hear the people typing I can already see that eyebrows raising at my placement of this album because my review of this record is what probably one of the most infamous reviews to to have ever been written in this decade but again if I were making this list purely on personal taste this would be a little bit lower late registration and graduation would be a little bit higher maybe the life of Pablo would be a little bit higher too but truth be told my overall opinions of this record have not changed all that much so re reviewing it which I constantly get requests to do wouldn't really make sense at this point so while this record hasn't really grown on me on a personal level all that much since its initial release the importance that this album holds in Kanye's discography becomes more and more apparent every year simply put my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is Kanye's entire career getting a second wind probably the biggest second wind any hip-hop artist has ever received in their career to the point where it's almost like he hit the fucking reset button and I think it's the second wind that Kanye's career needed not that I think it was on life support or anything but had Kanye not made the grand return to rap music that he did on this album I really think he would have been done for because after eight oh eight a lot of the hip-hop industry had kind of counted him out a little bit which he immediately made them regret doing with this album this record is also Kanye's long awaited meditation on Fame which at the time seemed to mean a great deal to his fans even if to me a lot of it seemed like very empty and like a lot of what he was saying was just him referencing this completely made-up tabloid lifestyle that he wasn't leading but clearly wanted to lead and went on to lead the song dark fantasy I think will go down as one of the best opening tracks of the decade the track power is easily one of hip-hop's most excellent and grandiose singles this album's opulence is really something to behold and I appreciate it as one of the most ambitious moments in Kanye's career even if I still do hold to my a opinion that this thing does really fall apart in the second half about as fantastically as the album starts I think though my favorite tracks on this thing dark fantasy power monster oh and gorgeous can't forget gorgeous which leads me to my number one spot my favorite record in Kanye's discography that would have to be the college dropout maybe that has something to do with me being around and remembering when Conte released the college dropout and remembering what a breath of fresh air he was to the music industry at large maybe it had something to do with me being in college when this album came out but I still do really feel that this album stands as one of the best artistic statements and Kanye's entire discography again a lot like late registration Kanye came in to this record with great fundamentals a cool concept sound and theme that ran through a great deal of the record I know this doesn't seem like a big deal but the skits were very colorful and entertaining and added a lot of character to the album keep in mind this is during an era in hip-hop where skits were notoriously shitty and often ruined an album Kanye's lyrical style his sense of humor his personality the fact that he just came off like himself he wasn't trying to put anything on he wasn't trying to convince you he was something that he wasn't he wasn't trying to put up this tough-guy facade either he wasn't pandering to his cult of personality he didn't have one yet Kanye's whole dissection of how people perceive college how people just mindlessly go to college without thinking about why they're doing it or what they're trying to get out of it showed a connection to and an understanding of what average people are going through which Kanye hasn't really showcased in a long time also it's been a while since Kanye's come off dislikable - and I'm not trying to imply that that by saying this is my favorite Kanye record this to me is his most important album because this is him at his inception is amazing and wave creating entrance into the mainstream I'm not trying to imply that everything is just kind of gone downhill from here because for the past 13 years or so there's never been a dull moment sure Kanye's had his highs and his lows which I'm sure will continue to be the case but that as part of what makes them such an interesting artist to begin with of course Kanye's production on this thing is fantastic consistently the beats on this thing are emotionally charged they're inspiring they're uplifting jesus walks still one of those most amazing songs other favorites on this album really it's almost all the tracks on this thing but I guess if I had to pick we don't care all falls down obviously through the wire school spirit breathe in breathe out new workout plan and finally get them high and I guess that's going to finish the video right here that around the video out that is Kanye West from worst to best in my opinion again sort of a combination of what I think is the most relevant and important moments in his career fused with you know what are some of my personal favorites too I didn't just want to do a very indulgent personal list I think I'm pretty proud of this list I think I came to the best conclusion that I could sort of trying to balance objectivity and subjectivity I guess if you could even do such a thing but there you go that's that's the list right there thanks for watching everybody transition have you watched this video I hope you did because you're at the end of it and what did you think of this list did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should list next and your your number one you the best okay cool Anthony Fantana Kanye West links next to my head subscribe to the channel other videos forever 
krbx-JeEwAg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's very sunny it's very stubbly it's very reflective day I hope everyone's doing well and it is our weekly track roundup yes our weekly track roundup before we get into the the nitty-gritty of this roundup into the worst and best tracks of the week a few things I have to mention our Amazon associate link down there in the description if you click on that you live in the US anything you buy on Amazon we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price helps out this segment it's easy just use it to buy some stuff you were gonna buy anyway also we have a few premieres on the website right now from the hard vapour resistance front they have a new EP over there for you to check out linked below also a new music video from Willy green producer who you might remember from the backwoods Studios camp worked with Billy woods has new great track out or a great music video for a track out that was off his last record featuring Denmark Vesey and also we have a track from whacks Fang it's a bit of a piano rock epic in three parts of the track is titled pusher very good song all premiered on the website link below check them out okay let's rip the band-aid off get into the worst I got to scroll down here the worst tracks of the week oh the track oh oh god oh god um okay the first track I have to mention here is a cover song it is a cover of one of my favorite tunes the song blue monday by new order and this apparently is a track that is to be featured on the atomic blonde sound soundtrack which is an upcoming action film which if you have not seen the trailer for it it looks badass as fuck lots of bullets and fists flying in all directions it looks really exciting and health the band health has done a cover of new orders Blue Monday and this this this cover is so it's so lifeless god it's like having sex with a dead person I'm not really sure what to say about it beyond that it's it's really it's really that uninspired I mean it's such a great song the band just hands.you greatness and you destroyed to do a cover you just gotta follow the blueprint follow the blueprint just make sure the performance is passionate make sure the performance is exciting but rather health's interpretation of the song is really like a cold fish unfortunately and and it's not that type of a tune you know you really just got to kind of give it a little to make it work but they fell short despite the fact that the bar was not set incredibly high but I digress let's get into the next track over here really kind of thrown for a loop with this new track from woods they have a forthcoming album titled love is love and this this is the title track off of it while I appreciated some of the funky grooves off of the band's last album and while it's it's always been pretty apparent that groups such as grateful that have always been a point of influence for woods it just sounds like they've gone full funky jam band on this track it's it's doing nothing for me at some point a line was crossed and this is just not my cup of tea at all like the grooves just seem really really corny and the tune isn't really all that inspiring either seems like the track is more about this groove that they're kind of you know harping on again and again and again but there's not really that much substance to the songwriting in my opinion the vocals no longer seem like they're all that much of a focal point either to the band sound on this track but you know I'm going to try the new album I'm going to see what's up although I am very much let down by this track however this song is nowhere near as terrible as the new single Iggy Azalea just dropped she's back after all the drama all the facelifts all that stuff everybody in the in the music industry almost disavowing themselves of her she's now back with a new single with guess who lil Uzi vert like it whoo he's just like hey why not I mean barely any people like me anyway I'm not that likable to begin with I'm not really taking a risk by doing a track with Iggy Azalea the track is titled can't lose and it is a loser of a track it is awful it is bad auto-tune PAP it's it's top 40 track with Iggy Azalea sounding as horrendous as ever with her weird affectation that she puts on when she raps which is nothing like how she normally talks and it's just a silly bland pop rap song so just throw it in the recycle bin if in fact you made the horrible decision to download it all right let's move on from there to the tracks I was kind of a met on you know they're not amazing but worth mentioning for sure bad bad not good has a wonderful new remix of the song lavender out featuring Snoop Dogg snoop Dogg on the on the on the on the beet soup Dogg on this beat rapping a verse sound in this slick as ever we have real estate with the song stained glass some very pretty guitar passages all over this tracks and very nice arpeggios to just very springy very bright very relaxing guitars but you know as usual the vocals and the tunes that real estate bring to the table don't really do too much for me but you know the guitar sound really nice if you're looking for something pleasant shout out to the new girl pool song whose heavy guitar chords and kind of the climax that comes after this very subtle intro and very close vocal harmonies on this track are very nice on the ear want to give that a shout-out also full of held illuminate full of Hell of course I'm looking forward to their new record I've enjoyed what they've been doing recently you know really noisy really abrasive really experimental stuff but now it seems like the production on this new track over here they've really cleaned up their sound while the performance is animalistic it is fast there are elements of power violence in grindcore I mean it's a noisy heavy in your face song but the mix the sound that they bring to the table it doesn't really seem that noisy doesn't really seem that textured or adventurous you know it's it's okay and I'm not floored by it and the track was a little short too you know maybe the song will blow me away once it's in the context of the entire record not entirely sure but as of right now this particular track to me just sounds a tad generic I'll just leave it at that Rick Ross has a new track out that I thought was surprisingly decent despite its silly title trap trap trap I don't know if you saw that those was awesome promo image of a Martha Stewart with a cake with the cover of Rick Ross's forthcoming album on the cake so he promoted his new album using a picture of Martha Stewart with with an image of his album which is pretty fucking and sane and off-the-wall but I digress there it's a no B track you know it's it's trap flavored obviously it's heavy summer Rick Ross's bars are silly but you know his heavy husky voice still does command quite a bit of attention young thug's performance on the track is energetic and even while I is like pretty entertaining on the song like he's not a slouch he doesn't put me to sleep like he typically does he seemed to try to match the energy level of the previous two verses on the track which was good so if the rest of the songs on this album and I'm not holding my breath but if the rest in the modernist album are at least this mildly entertaining could be a decent Rick Ross album could be a decent Rick Ross album and finally in this segment I want to mention the three Nicki Minaj tracks that just dropped this week we have changed it no frauds regret in your tears I mentioned them all in this segment but regret in your tears I probably would throw into the worst tracks category because it's just a really cheap generic really kind of reverb out an auto-tuned to death rap ballad that is not one of her better sort of pop flavored tunes all the effects that our voices sort of awash in on this track really kind of sucks kind of the personality and the passion out of the track and it's just really a throwaway no frauds featuring Lil Wayne and Drake is this response track to Remy Ma who everybody's been talking about how she's torn Nikki apart on the two tracks that she recently released Nikki's response in my opinion is kind of mild it's an OK track she doesn't really get as down in the dirt and as personal with Remy Ma as I think some people were hoping for maybe Nikki doesn't know that much about her you know kind of the most cutting thing is she's low I have pictures of before and after your surgeries well you know we have pictures of before and after your surgeries and Nikki so it's like what do you know it's load that's not really dirt you know that's like stuff anybody can get ahold of you know that's not that's not word of mouth from behind the scenes you know that's not like the kind of woe so-and-so said that kind of shit that Remy Ma was spitting even though her performance was kind of lackluster on she thir but I digress Nikki's performance was fine it's just when you got down to the lyrics the lyrics were not that cutting and sometimes it seemed like she wasn't even rapping directly at her it's only apparent who she's rapping about because we have that Remy Ma track to go off of I mean it's okay it's a little too subliminal for my taste but Nikki again the performance and then the instrumental is pretty decent my favorite of the three tracks though has to be changed it definitely a banger trap flavored charismatic performance on this one sure maybe it's not as direct or as you know topical as the Remy Ma response but it was definitely I think the easiest track to vibe two out of these three and that will do it for the tracks that was kind of indifferent toward we have quite a bit of music here in the section that made it into the best tracks of the week this is a good week for music in my opinion let's get going into this section remember all this stuff is linked down there in the description box year old drew has a new track out titled grandma hips featuring Danny Brown your old drew has a new album out titled packs not going to say too much about this track because I'm going to review that album very soon very good bars grimy East Coast vibe on this track the Brown performance is good too so definitely check that out also Mastodon with Andromeda this track is the first track I've heard from the sports coming Mastodon album that actually sounds exciting actually sounds like a metal track doesn't sound like the Foo Fighters trying to do a Queens of the Stone Age cover like the last single that they dropped this sounds like a legit exciting epic somewhat progressive metal song and they pack it into four minutes you know it's very dense tuned has some nice riffs good energy on the track not sure if Mastodon is going to pull through with this record but at least this song I am enjoying Freddie Gibbs has a new track out titled crushed glass Freddie Gibbs is back with some bars on this new track sort of making reference to the rape accusation that he had caught over in Europe what held him over there for a little while and you know talking about some other recent stuff going on in his life - there's not really an amazing hook on this track to speak of a very grand atmospheric epic instrumental and Freddie's performance on this track I would say is pretty good too so if you're sort of looking for a bit of an update and looking to kind of hear where Freddie might be going next sonically because this is a pretty epic track in my opinion as far as like the presentation of the instrumental and Freddie's performance he sounds hungry on this track maybe he's going to go down this road sort of bigger more ambitious on his next record not sure that would be interesting though but it's a good track Fleet Foxes has a very long and a very linear and a very grand ballad with 3rd of May and Oda how teasing toward their next full-length album it's been a while since helplessness Blues came out love that album so much this new track over here it's going to take you a while to digest it ok it's not very immediate it's not a straightforward you know sort of grand ballad in the way that I would say helplessness blues was when it originally dropped in teased toward its forthcoming album this one is a little bit of a slow burner so you really got to sit with it give it multiple lessons kind of untangle it because there's a lot going on and it's not um I would say very very direct it's kind of an elusive track so you know give this thing the time it takes to kind of warm up to you a little bit because once you do guitars are beautiful vocals are beautiful the way the song whines and twists is very kind of inspiring to a very interesting track from Fleet Foxes very unlikely lead single unlikely teaser but I think for people who are hardcore fans and have the patience for the band's sound it works alt-j also the very patient teaser track 3ww I hope there's not some kind of fucking thing that that stands for I'm not entirely sure but it's also really really low-key ballad I mean alt-j would quieter on their last record and it seems like they're trying to go even quieter with this new track over here you know for people who are kind of underwhelmed by the last record because it was so obtuse and it was so subtle the band is continuing in that direction on this track though I thought some of the melodies and some of the guitars on this thing we're really beautiful obviously it made it in my favorite tracks for the week section but again keep in mind it's a slow burner you got to give it some time power bottom with the song answering my texts I've been seeing these guys getting posted all over the Internet up until the supply addressed my mic line where's the hype I'm not like I'm not hearing anything I'm all that excited about I'm not like being floored by any of these songs that I'm hearing and then comes the song answer my texts which is this really funny tongue-in-cheek track about getting someone's phone number and texting them and you know trying to get a some kind of romantic connection going but there's like you know obviously the other person is not answering back sort of in the timely fashion the person texting would like them to they're kind of getting ghosted a little bit the hook is fantastic you know singing answer my texts you dick you know definitely a feeling that we've all had before if you've ever texted someone who we've been trying to date or something like that this is the kind of thing that in my opinion if rock music if indie wants to be popular in the modern age it needs to engage on the kinds of experiences and emotions talk about the kinds of things that young people are experiencing and dealing with you know this is like the kind of emotional sort of turmoil that young kids go through when they're not getting that response from someone that they're interested in you know and they're talking about it sort of in a in a modern and contemporary way you know I think there are other bands and not that every band needs to make a song about texting you know I think there are other things that groups could be engaging on that are also modern also new also contemporary experiences that uh that I feel like are kind of getting thrown under the rug by rock music and are getting engaged on every level by other genres of music like pop music and hip-hop but rock is still standing over here with like a fucking rotary phone it's like what are you doing dude what are you doing the good people over at constellation records are teasing tour day and you do makes a think album the song bound and boundless is the teaser track to their forthcoming album and this song exemplifies why this group is one of the more unique and underrated bands in the post rock in the instrumental rock genre adventurous song structures over here not just a bunch of cliched climaxes one after the next and some cool guitar work too so keep it up do makes a thing interesting things on this track I'm poppy is the latest single from poppy a wonderful beautiful and creepy internet damsel who I'm loving this new song over here because it's finally like her weird quirky internet persona is tying together with her music because she's released music in the past but none of it has sounded like you know there's nothing about her music to me that represents her internet person uh her internet persona there's nothing about her internet persona that like reflects in her music all that much either like maybe even some of the lyrics or something but not not really but now it seems like with this weird kind of digital electro pop thing that she has going on with some of the we're kind of taking a nodder turn on this track they're finally like gelling and it sounds really cool like it's not only creating an interesting visual aesthetic an interesting sonic aesthetic - and hopefully you know she can kind of repeat this for more than one track and actually like get a really cool album going Lord has floored me with this new song liability I did not know it was in Lords repertoire to write a wonderful piano ballad like this this is a good song it's a good love song to at least step through how it came off to me I mean I don't really know what to say about it other than that you got to hear this track because this is this is so far outside of what I would have assumed were was like in in Lords arsenal but apparently she has spent quite a bit of time since her last record kind of honing talents and in other sounds and trying new things and you know I'm not sure if she wrote this song when as percent you know a lot of pop songwriters they use Co songwriters I can only assume that she has though because she she's written her stuff in the past I haven't known her to use a lot of co songwriters or anything like that it's not really her reputation but in Nash's at another level of popularity again I'm just speculating here because I'm not you know too familiar with the back end of this stuff because the liner notes of the album are now I digress but damn like like where's this even coming from but fuck man it's just a really good ballad now and now I'm like officially kind of excited again for this new record because I want to see what else you're going to do you know let's move on the next track a Frank Ocean chanel new Frank Ocean track everybody say the new forgoes river goes it's pretty good I mean I like some of the weird mixing and some of the experimental sort of edits that are in the instrumental here the vocals kind of pop up in weird ways throughout the mix that I thought were really cool I'm not like insanely like enamored with the tune here you know I think the hooks just okay but you know very much the the beautiful low-key ballad like vibe of many of the tunes that you got off of blonde is kind of repeated here that in and of itself makes us a very listenable very enjoyable track what I say it's to me better than some of my favorites on wand and need on not really honestly not really but I would say it's a decent track I mean it would have sit in pretty snugly with a lot of songs on that record and sounded good so yeah I mean I like it you know I think it's definitely more adventurous again from production standpoint than a lot of the songs that Frank Ocean has been doing recently so you know maybe if you were to head down this road further in the future but with a bit of a bit of a stronger tune it could be a really cool and finally I want to mention a first-aid kit with your the problem here and this is an incredible fuckin song like first aid kits last record was a little bit of a disappointment for me because a lot of tracks on there were kind of bland and it seemed like lyrically it wasn't as strong as their previous album like there wasn't a whole lot about the album that was blowing you away but this song is a fucking this songs a monster but what sort of makes this song so incredible not just the vocal performances on this thing because it seems like they're doing something a little more raw on this thing not just the chord progressions which are very dramatic very big the instrumental performance on this thing you know sort of matches that drama very powerful but really it's the lyrics this track I mean it sounds like it sounds like it's about rape honestly or at least like some kind of sexual abuser or some kind of guy forcing himself violently or sexually on a woman and the lyrics are very graphic at some points you know not pornographic or anything like that but you know the the pain anguish the sadness the raw emotions of what is being sung about here are a really potent and really hard-hitting you know I would say this song is not for the faint of heart and I guess you know a trigger warning tool for a trigger warning in there too for anybody who may be sensitive on these kinds of subjects but you know if you could stomach it and you know you you're kind of curious as to what the duo is doing on this track its I'll just I'll just leave that that it's you know powerful powerful song and I'm loving it you know it's really great I mean if they could sort of stick to that mmm you know powerful kind of feeling and you know like a really pull on some you know I guess kind of incredible stories or descriptions as they are on this particular track you know their forthcoming record could be you know their best yet

31191e2d0kE,hi everyone both in the hot handle heater the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ed Sheeran album divide widely celebrated singer-songwriter ed Sheeran is back with his third big commercial major label album divide divide divide keeping to the cute max theme with his two previous records while I have never been a fan of Ed's music he seems like a nice guy and I've always appreciated from afar the fact that he's been able to climb to the highest echelon of mainstream pop music playing folk music singer-songwriter music guitar music something that is severely lacking in the top 40 in 2017 but the thing is I can only celebrate success with his music so far because once I actually sit down and listen to the stuff he's recording through the stuff that he's writing it becomes painfully obvious that the only reason his music appeals so widely is because it's trite which continues to be the case on divide especially as it seems Edie leans harder on his rap skills on a good handful of the songs here he also attempts to write more pop crossovers like the song shape of you where we hear a sexy edge Sheeran singing from the standpoint of a woman who he's lusting after saying that she wants to get his body on her body cummins over to body this song I just feel like taking a shower after I hear it on the song Galway girl Edie gets a little flirty rapping about an Irish girl who plays fiddle in a traditional band he's getting hot and heavy with her in the bar and Ed is just spittin verse after verse over this fusion of Celtic music and hip hop it's so gross and it gets even worse as ed is spitting bars about his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend on the track new man I get that the guy in this song is supposed to be like you know character but Edie describes this guy is having tribal tattoo but he doesn't know what they mean he wears boat shoes he has a healthy diet and he owns every single ministry CD fucking ministry what dimension is this man from also ed will not say fuck on the song hell a blatant reference to that word but he won't say that word however he will talk about this first boyfriends arsehole being bleached he'll rap about a bleached arsehole but he won't say the f-word I feel like there's a disconnect here now there are other tracks on this thing where ed is not rapping at all the instrumentation is pretty inoffensive very pleasant I feel like these more ballad type songs play more to ed strengths like the song what do I know or what do I know a track that is undeniably cute with Edie singing about changing the world through music and love and making reference all the instrumentation that he'd work into a song I like the plucky electric guitar chords on this thing they're very quiet but driving kick drum the very sweet background vocals it's a sweet song even with corny corny lines like life is more than fitting in your jeans leave song happier is okay even though it seems like Ed's attempt and writing his own version of stay with me that Sam Smith song he definitely had that song in mind when the inspiration point for this track came about the track castle on the hill is the better of the two singles teasing toward this record although it sounds like a glitzy overblown overproduced very glossy version of like tallest man on earth track the song dive is one of those Walt see dramatic ballads that super reserved on the verse but then explodes with passion on the chorus don't call me baby unless you mean it yeah it's kind of cliche at this point but I can't deny that Ed's performance within this blueprint is really good there's a lot to like about these tracks but Ed's big shortcoming again and again and again continues to be his lyrical abilities if Ed were a book he would be a sucess of romantic and inspirational platitudes is just full of images and phrases that have been recycled so many times that they mean almost nothing at this point or at least lost complete touch with their original meaning because they're just so far removed that's about all the lyrics on the track how would you feel where it sounds like ed is just going through the motions of a generic love song and then the track hearts don't break around here um I don't know how IDI wrote that down and didn't look back at it and just think II kind of cringing for whatever reason II D just seems to find great power in empty nonspecific promises for emotional and lyrical comparison listen to the closing track supermarket flowers attract that is an ode to his late grandmother it seems like there's way more attention to detail and an emotional investment in this track right from the start the track may not be the most amazing song I've ever heard but there's definitely like a difference in quality and conviction here in the performance - yeah I mean while there were a few highlights on this thing I did not care for this record overall ed Sheeran to me is is a singer-songwriter for sure but he is a very sanitized singer-songwriter he's a very safe singer/songwriter to me some my favorite songwriters come off on their albums a lot like a really good book a really great novel or like an amazing biography that you just get really emotionally invested in because it's so personal it's so revealing with Edie I don't get that sensation at all on divide it's more like I'm listening to the musical equivalent to like one of those really bad just girly things image macros or like a really crappy motivational poster that you've seen a million fucking times I get and I see the appeal of this album but it's just not for me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate your the best - the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry because you know with all sorts of other links next to my head and everything yeah I'm corny I know ed Sheeran divided forever 
QUGTCKrC-qc,hi everyone Pal carer citizen here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sleaford mods album English Peppa this is the latest full-length album from one of the UK's most unique Mo's Sleaford mods it's been a few years since the release of one of their biggest albums yet key markets and while this record still stands as one of my favorites of 2015 I came away from this album sort of wondering where the duo was going to take their sound next while key markets did improve on the somewhat rough around the edges and very meat-and-potatoes sound the duo was playing with on austerity dogs and divide and exit adding some more punchy and memorable hooks frontman Jason Williamson was making a more concerted effort to sing taking breaks in between all of his a rapid-fire vitriolic rants that were densely packed with slang and locale specific lingo about blue-collar life and weird odd musings about whatever but how far could this possibly go because it would only be a matter of time before the sound that they were playing with would be more or less explored if Sleaford mods are going to continue to be interesting change is inevitable but what shape would that change take and how to embrace it while staying true to the sound that brought the duo to where they are today while English tapas does have some highlights on it I would say this album is the sound of those growing pains like the TCR EP that preceded this album last year there are a handful of songs on this thing that just kind of sound like Sleaford mods as usual but not quite as refreshing this time around tracks like snout and mop top and dull but then they are cuts on here where they legitimately take risks and try something different make an attempt to push the sound forward which usually comes in the shape of Jason Williamson singing more doing more overdubs on his vocals punchy or hooks and occasionally trying to write what sounds like more digestible verses not so much just delivering this relentless flow of verbiage and then there's Andrew ferns instrumentals on this thing which incorporates some weirder bass lines some dancing rhythms a little bit more sense but they still have that really stark minimalist appeal that has always been pivotal to the duo sound tracks like Drayton Manor and Messi anywhere and time sands which throughout the instrumental here there is sampled this persistent cricket chirping I wouldn't say this is a redundant album but I I don't think it goes far enough especially on the production end of things where it seems like Jason's vocals are a little unsupported occasionally especially when he's making a bigger effort to write hooks sing more but when he changes into the chorus the instrumental does very little to kind of enhance what he's doing melodically or kind of grow or swell or change underneath his voice to kind of just following along musically with what Jason is doing with his vocals he's bringing so much energy and passion and emotion to the table on tracks like feels so wrong the closer on this thing but meanwhile the instrumental while it does have a little bit more piano incorporated into it it is a bit more melodic than the average instrumental on this record it still feels very flat and lifeless nowhere near as expressive as the vocals on top of it I appreciate the Mazda tent that sort of staying true to this very skeletal sound but I sort of sit here and wonder whether or not it's actually serving the duo's needs anymore they could easily stick to the same energy the same style while creating instrumentals that sound a bit fuller a bit punchier a bit more colorful more visceral and explosive and really light up what Jason is trying to do vocally especially since it seems like the space is there with him toning some of his verses down trying to write bigger hooks like on the track just like we do or on the song cuddley we're on this track this is like the closest jason has ever come to just straight rapping on a track from what I've heard and hip-hop has always been a bit of a point of reference for Sleaford mods and their music but it's kind of cool to hear a creep in a little bit more in terms of an influence on this cut if the duo's complete continuation of this very uncomplicated sound is totally fine with you then you will most likely dig this album much more than I am there is definitely a bit more until variation on this album as compared to key markets or anything they've done previously you have your typical driving loop post-punk beats that have a bit of a fall worship type sound to them and then those electronic tracks those dancing your tracks that have a bit of a funkier edge to them are a nice change of pace Jason seems to be getting a bit more ambitious with his vocals his writing is still on point for the most part some of his best stuff is here like on the track BHS where he comes off particularly funny and very on point with these social or political message they're trying to make with the track unfortunately though I still came away from this album somewhat underwhelmed I'm feeling a strong to a decent 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like

otyLHbEfRDQ,hi everyone do the new Hanna know you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Shu Shu album forget the art top and experimental music outfit Shu Shu are back with a new record that comes right after a pretty prolific streak for the band up until 2014 Shu Shu has been more or less content to drop a record every few years but immediately after the release of one of the most experimental records angel guts read classroom all of a sudden we started getting this slew of weird sound pieces released onto band camp a wonderful record where the band track for track for track covers the music of Twin Peaks emerged bough collaboration Jamie even saw fit to release an audio clip of drunk commentary he drank as he talked about the album dear God I hate myself and despite the massive amount of work that shushu has put out over the past couple of years two of their biggest years in a while they are right on schedule with a new album over here for poly vinyl records being put out for wide commercial release all original material and this album is a slightly popular change of pace from angel guts which made to listen a little bit easier for me songs like forget even threw things back a little bit in my opinion to a time when synth pop and post-punk were bigger reference points for Shu Shu in their music but for anybody who isn't already a Shu Shu fan I think that the changes they make on this album are probably still not going to be enough because they still have a very strange polarizing sound that's so idiosyncratic and unsettling that it's naturally going to rub some people the wrong way some of the instrumentals on this thing may feature some very pretty chord progressions or melodies but they also embrace every shade of dreary and noisy imaginable and they're all topped with Jamie Stewart's frightening horrific vibrato which still after all these years sounds disturbing sounds freakish in a decade where musically artistically it just kind of feels like everything has been done the boundaries have the pushed the taboos have been poked but still over here in the corner is Shu Shu doing their own thing still sounded as as odd as ever more harrowing than ever and even pulling out surprises like on the opening track the call which features these raspy loud vocals that are kind of a mix of like I don't know a punk singer screaming and some kind of alternative experimental rapper rapping repeating phrases like clap bitches clap bitches why why why why why cut which in a way might seem like unnecessary oddity unnecessary shock value or weirdness just thrown into the song for a laugh or something but in a weird way I think it actually plays into an ongoing narrative in this record I haven't completely put it together yet but the only other vocal feature or appearance or collaboration on the album that comes off this prominent is on the very end of the record on the closing track at the very start of the album you have this voice that is very angry it's all piss and vinegar it's aggressive it's in your face it's very simple it's not very well thought out it's very lewd it's very amped up and this contrast really starkly with the voice that's featured on the closing track which is very dry very drained on the verge of death it's very poetic from what I caught in an interview on tiny mixtapes shout out to tiny mixtapes from what I caught in an interview over there this poem is actually made of a bunch of one-liners that are just kind of a very short reactions to pictures of escorts which is something I caught when I had most of this review done because I tried to do my best to avoid interviews and avoid reviews while I'm doing my reviews because I don't want you know to read something that influences how I feel about a record but as I was listening with the lyrics on this album I really sneaking suspicion that something was going on sort of along those lines because there's so many lyrics on this album that are sexual take a kind of exploitive tone a lot of themes of self-deprecation self-loathing self-destruction and Shu Shu albums in the past have delved into those themes but as a listening to this record I just get this vibe that I am witness to the downward spiral of some trans or gay or just LGBT youth just falling into a world of drugs and very bad decisions Jaime's lyrics a lot of the time are pretty esoteric so I'm not going to try to project too much onto them but I still do get the sense of some kind of story or narrative progression throughout this album now as far as the sound of this record goes I like it a lot I love it I love the tension building verses on the song the call the gurgling bass the kind of sporadic rhythms that come together very tightly and very nicely when the hook pours through it's very cathartic the vocal melodies on the hook are chilling who the song queen of the losers immediately after takes a very industrial town with its beat it's very patient it's very mechanical all sorts of brittle distortions and a total freak show since and shouted vocals the hook is very haunting everyone loves you the pain is it you're the speaker wondering is easily one of the Bands best singles in years it's very danceable it's very infectious I'm dying for this hook what thank you I mean it's it's very catchy at least by shoo-shoo standards I love how confessional an intimate song petite is I feel this track adds a lot to what I feel is the narrative on the album the acoustic guitars and the beautiful string sections on this track are a nice touch also getting a very intimate and confessional vibe off of the track get up the really abstract and surreal imagery of pianos and harmonicas dropping on the protagonists space on this track is really and I also like how this track is able to capture that same intimate tone but with a different instrumental palette on this track we get a very spacious very open and quirky drum machine playing against some very minimal minimal guitar the track eventually builds up into this amazing huge large and full climax the song Jenny gogo is easily one of the creepiest songs on the entire record with the throbbing electronics hanging in the background like a for stalking you it's also topped with some of the most confounding lyrics on the entire record the track changes colors as it shifts into the hook with these tundra-like I see synth leads and and shrill screams the song forget is very much worthy of its title as a title track with it being one of the most powerful moments on the entire record and the song space torn apart I mentioned that poem earlier on the track which is a great ending to the entire album but also the the weird droney passages of sense and vocals that lead is up to that point are very alluring too if I have any gripes with the album it's that we have a few tracks here like hey choco bananas where the pacing is very slow I do wish more of the record was as visceral and as immediate as forget but the lyrics the way the band continues to play in really interesting ways with texture easily make up for that and I guess my other slight very slight gripe is that it's not one of the Bands more adventurous albums it seems like they've stepped back to reference a lot of their older material but they're taking a fuller approach this time around with better production and new instrumentation new tracks new ideas new concepts which isn't necessarily a horrible thing I think some older shoo-shoo fans will most likely appreciate the direction the band is moving in on this one really love this album loved what the band was doing somatically sonically musically I think the songs are very well crafted for the most part and I still continue to love sort of the vocals and the many things about a shoe shoes instrumental style that continues to make them one of the more unique groups out there in the underground right now feeling a strong eight on this album transition have you given this album illicit did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

_byxaI-DWeA,[Music] all right hey hey hey here we are Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music card coming back at you with a brand new episode of our once defunct kind of lazy on its deathbed the needle drop podcast and what what what is bringing this podcast back from the dead it's a very special episode it's follow-up episode of something I at one point had hoped to turn into a series by but we forgot to do one last year I remember we did one at the very end of 2015 and here we are at the start of 2017 a little late on this one but we're going to be talking about and I'm glad that maybe we gave a little time because the the hip hop landscape has changed a little bit I feel like we have all new artists here to talk about and the artists who were on the last list that we that we discussed they put out new material they've kind of changed a little bit we've all grown and we have different perspectives now we've all you know grown a little wiser fatter older so hopefully uh you know we can bring some fresh views on the hopefully that hope that that was not I wasn't trying to reference that Drake album but we're going to talk about that having said that this episode mr. d respect and I are going to be talking about the 10 worst rappers out right now who are the 10 worst rappers well I went on social media and I asked you guys and these artists who were going to be talking about in this list these are the ones that you guys said to me the most these are the ones that got the most mentions you the one we got referenced to me the most these are the worst rappers on the planet right now D are you are you psyched to go through this list I am so ready some we gotta say I was even born ready okay yeah that's what some people would say all all all quote Lady Gaga and say I was born this way I wasn't born this way all right let's talk about an artist who was not on the last list a relatively new artist in terms of hype and relevancy miss mr. Kodak black now I reviewed this guy I put out negative points of view on this man's music what were your thoughts generally on Kodak black lyrical miracle or just hysterical just hysterical but he's getting a huge boost now because he's currently imprisoned look at it yeah again right yeah yeah I think it was a probation of violation um what I can say about Kodak black is that I can say that if we set this out by like degrees he would be somewhere in the second half of coherent you know coherent voices where I can make out what he's saying um and that's all the credit that I can give them pretty much mm that's all I can really say about him I mean uh I've more I paid paid attention more to Kodak's antics more than I have his music I've seen him on Facebook live when his phone fell and his you know when exposed his junk his relationship with uh with a catch me outside girl which has been a treat to witness have you been aware this not only partially aware only partially aware well sir if you're familiar with jay-z and beyonce you ain't seen nothing yet is that is Chris Hansen trying to trying to locate their uh their whereabouts right now he is about 13 14 right how old is he he's what 20 21 yeah oh okay that's this podcast just took a dark turn yeah Chris Hansen isn't going to step into the recording studio or something or step onto the music video set and just be like yeah hey and you know what's funny I saw that doctor first I saw the doctor Phillips so the follow-up episode that she was on and it's so funny because that they took her to a they took her to a ranch with farm animals and horses and stuff and apparently this ranch Marcus itself as a place where you could take troubled kids and head straight but a non farm it doesn't scared straight it's like you know you you it's really hugged straight you know you love them straight and it was pretty funny because like that attitude that that that drawl that she talks in that slang that she talks and the second that she got to ride a horse it all melted away and she was just talking like an average teenage perky white girl so it's like you know it's totally a put-on it's totally something that she just puts on for attention or because she thinks it's cool I'm not entirely sure why but they have totally an act and it's it's something that clearly she will drop at the Hat at the chance to ride a horse but having said all that kodak black i kind of agree with you i mean as far as like mumble rappers go if we'll use that term without triggering anybody because there are some people you know who take personal offense to that term and i well i don't fully agree with every application of that term but as far as like rappers who you would label that and I think Kodak does kind of fall under that umbrella he's not the worst of the worst he's not the most unintelligible of them out there I can kind of see the appeal because he does have a unique sound I mean I guess I know Kodak on the mic when I hear him but the thing is everything that makes him a unique voice right now really annoys me like the squeak enos of his voice and the why ninis of his voice the tininess just the tone of his voice and just how lazy and really kind of lifeless he sounds on the mic most of the time he sounds high out of his fucking mind when he records and that any appeal I get to that any appeal but it's part of what just kind of annoys me because when I'm listening to an artist I love hearing something exciting I love hearing something that just jumps off the mic jumps out of the mix at me you know I love hearing like somebody who takes an aggressive tone on a track you know I love hearing that and Kodak just seems so lazy to me and I I guess that's sort of why he got so many mentions you know like I could see that those sort of working against him in the eyes of other people but you know as far as like if this style of rap music is all you listen to because you're younger and you're coming up and you just want to be on what's trendy and what's new and what's hot and you know what's what's what everybody else is listening to like he certainly sounds different mm-hmm yeah but I mean I I guess if anything makes him one of the worst rappers right now it's just his lazy delivery his floppy flow his annoying voice his substances his his very I guess the blatant lack of substance in his lyrics I've heard some people like you know reference some of his verses would be like here look at this one line I pulled out of it he makes some comment on how hard his life is or how bad the streets are or something like that and it's like okay you know fair but that's like one somewhat observant reflective line out of like right you can just like a sea of like you know I guess a rap raps equivalent to chicken scratch right a broken clock right is at least you know two times a day have you seen the the tunnel-vision video oh god yes the tunnel-visioned video is similar to that run the jewels video a little bit yeah yeah yeah with it with the cop chasing chasing the guy yeah the ongoing struggle yeah yeah but but what I felt what I thought but myself so funny about that is just like how little anything Kodak is saying had to do with that bat was it message it was like you know there's clearly like a bold political statement being made here with the visuals here but it's like you know what he's what he's rapping and what he's singing if you could even call it that is just like so on what he's typically rapping about yeah I mean maybe it's maybe it's the idea of you can separate the visuals from the audio maybe there's people who are just really into watching that video and delving into the social commentary or the images and Kodak black is just working as background music that has nothing to do with the images yeah I mean you know I've gotten complaints from people who watch the reviews who you know might watch me tear apart a song that Kodak might put together or something on a similar level and you know they'll come at me and just be like dude like don't you ever just five to something you know like you always got to be thinking about what you're listening to and it's why you always have to think and I mean I know that's kind of an insulting way of framing what the person was saying but that's essentially what they were getting at and the thing is like I mean I kind of get it you know if you're looking for something that's just kind of background music something you can get high - I mean I guess it works you know it's fine but but the thing is like I don't know if I'm reviewing something you know I mean I think you kind of go into understanding that hey guys listen I mean I'm going to actually think about this before do you know like I'm going to be critical of it I can't just do I can't just put up a video and be like hey you know it sounded pretty good in the background 10 out of 10 bitch yeah like you know maybe somebody can come up as a reviewer and sort of review things from that perspective like how great things sound in the background but well I would give this a background score of a nine but once I started paying attention to it it easily dropped to a five anything gets a background score of nine up most things do anything does a lot of things do yeah I would say that you know I would say there are a lot of horrible things that said that you know probably sour the mood when they hang around in the background mm-hmm but you know whatever what's a but but I think we've kind of gotten to the the nitty-gritty of what makes Kodak black kind of a lackluster artist I mean at least his antics are fun to pay attention to I guess mm-hm and and you know that's that seems like all you need these days for the most part all right moving on we're going to get down to the next artists on the list who got suggested here a lot of suggestions on this artist even though I personally feel like he gets a little undue hate but it's Jay Cole um what we don't record cause last record was it was underwhelming yeah um it was SJ Cole's middle fucking name uh it was you know I listened to it a few times like trying to piece together a narrative because that's what we all sort of forced these days when we get somebody of quality in our hands were just like no this this all means something we do we tend to get into just a bit too much and I think if you know there were a few tracks that were kind of silly uh III was obsessed with I was obsessed with I wanted a mother fold clothes I wanna bow clover for several weeks for several weeks I was obsessed with it um neighbors think I'm selling dope it there were a lot of tracks in it that were that were quality but I don't know I don't know if I did myself a disservice for expecting something well put together because as they stand I would say about four to five records on the album were were decent yeah I mean I thought there was at least a handful of great tracks on the album but the thing is like you know J Cole I don't think is a bad artist I wouldn't put him down there sort of in the recycle bin with a lot of other rappers who I hear these days especially a lot of the trendy ones the ones that have no substance whatsoever the ones that no personality whatsoever and just sound like a copy of something else you mean hey Cole doesn't sound like a copy of something else he sounds like himself but the thing about J Cole is every time without fail and I hope it changes one day but every time without fail like he falls so short of dropping something great and and the the amount of the amount of distance between what he's doing and a tip of a butterfly or a good kid maad city or even a section 80 is just so glaringly apparent you know because you listen to that album his latest record and there's very clearly a narrative there there's clearly a story going on there's clearly some kind of theme happening there but like whether it was through a lack of tracks or a lack of lyrics or just a lack of just obvious direct narrative connections like those tracks were not coming together that Jerry was not coming together like it only became apparent through like a series of telephone like suggestions over the Internet where people were like oh wait this track means this and this track means this and you kind of rapping from this guy standpoint like and the thing is to me that's not like that's not like putting in the effort to get it because what the artist put together is really cryptic and really deep and really heady and like whoa it took you a while to figure it out like that that's it taking a while to figure out because the artist did a bad job of putting it together yeah you know like they didn't weave together a coherent story and that's why it took you a while to get it not because it was super deep and just like you know really difficult to understand it just wasn't well put together it was like a series of loose vignettes that all kind of came from the same place and it only took like a little bit of sleuthing online for people like kind of piece it together but now that it's finally there it's just like man if that's the story like I feel like you could have said so much more like what about this or what about that it's like you don't have this you have anything to say about this other thing over here like it just seems like it's so messily and so weakly put together that it doesn't have any punch to it I mean don't get me wrong I think this is the closest j.cole has come to put to putting together a great conceptual album but every time he just fall so demonstrably you enjoyed it or more than four still um yeah I did I think so Forest Hills I thought was kind of sonically underwhelming from from beginning to end this one I felt like you know had a little bit more of a story to it was a little bit more engaging but the thing is like only by a shade you know like this is probably the closest I came to really digging on one of his albums but the more I started listening to it the Morrow's like that you know again that that sort of weekly put together project that weekly put together concept and theme I feel like is ultimately what bites Jay Cole in the ass every time because like he clear puts together enough effort for it to be hinting in that direction but like when you really dive down into it it's like this this is falling short like there's there's something missing here I don't know if you feel the same way I think you mentioned what part of what was part of the reason why he's on this list and of course neither of you know neither of us think that he is it what of a 10 the 10 worst rappers we know what he did a lot of suggestions but he right but he got the suggestion so he's being discussed so I just want to make that clear but um I think the the Kendra comparison him just sort of being viewed as a poor-man's Kendrick if you listen to Black Friday that song sort of illustrate his whole career at least at least the way people look at him in terms of being considered the best in the game and one thing that I think shoots us all in the foot is that we've always had this thought that there can only be one guy that brings us there there's only one guy who can be socially aware who can sell records who can feel like he's actually making great music and he's you know he's using he's making different sounds you know he's appeasing even though that no music on a deep level we only believe that only one person can stand on that throne and right now it's Kendrick and this isn't cold fault he's sort of just working as a poor-man's Kendra kind of like you know the way Rob Lowe kind of works is like a low-rent Brad Pitt innocent I mean do you think that's a product of the type of product uh but it's it's that's us that's what we part I do you think that's a product of now or do you think that's kind of been an ongoing thing because I thought well ten years ago you know you saw a Talib Kweli and a mos def coexisting in the same world and collaborating together to and beloved by fans of each artist and nobody was necessarily coming to one and saying oh well most is just like a really shitty talent or vice-versa you know you didn't really have that you know you had different levels because these people were existing in different mediums and now with the internet obviously everything is just thrown into the same pot so now it's it's one big great thing I think now it's really being magnified and now you can really tell that yeah this has always been this has always been an issue the issues always been this sort of odd what I've always compared to be like this odd sort of tie to Christianity that we tend to have were you know we want a savior somebody's got to save hip hop you know that's what's always being said that's the language that we use and and most stuff can coexist with uh you know he can coexist at the same time when jay-z could coexist in 50 cent could coexist he'd be on bt he's on MTV you got the other guy just just putting out random mixtapes now it's all one thing and I think it's hurting Jay Cole artistically and if I mean obviously commercially it's not hurting him I'm sure this this thing go platinum did he go platinum with no features because that's the take old guys we go plaid with no feature god I got so sick of here that shit I don't know I haven't followed the sales on this new album hmm okay but uh no I I feel like as far as I agree with what you're saying to the extent that he's making music that sort of has a conscious edge to it and he's getting lumped into the same you know pot is Kenny arc because they're both kind of doing that and they're built on that mainstream level I mean in the grander sense I think hip hop is you know you know a little yadi is not getting thrown at the same pot as Kendrick or Cole you know neither is danny brown or open mike eagle or run the jewels or whatever you know I feel like people are putting these artists in very different categories you know run the jewels latest record was probably their most conscious yet with loads of social and political tracks but nobody was coming at that record and I'm like oh well you're just making a conscious record now you're just a poor man's whatever you know see but Cole so close to the light he collaborates with him I'm sure if give killer Mike with anything records wouldn't matter yes and and that's why I think you know sort of the comparisons continue but a big on his radar he says radar exactly exactly they're sort of Iran in the same area on the map which by the way if killer Mac a killer Mike and fucking Kendrick a record together that'd be awesome that would that would be amazing but the thing is even if that ended up being the case I still think there wouldn't really be a comparison there because killer mic is sort of seen is more than an OG yeah where's Kendricks more New Kent has a totally different sound so it's like I think there's room to co-exist but the thing is Cole I think with his music purposefully kind of puts himself in that situation you know it just kind of had that jazzy tone to it it does have that conceptual tone to it it does have you know him trying to address so wider social issues but again as far as like his lyrics and the way he strings his concept together he just falls miserably short of his competition and I think that's just consistently why people say he's one of the worst rappers because he just doesn't match up I guess yeah I guess if this is all about personal potential or individual potential then it would make sense that he would be on this list sure I guess that would make sense yeah yeah all right let's move on to the next artist in this list one of your personal favorites we talked to Adam last time I'm not really sure if there's too much to say now though did we talk about it last time okay I love this guy little Uzi vert it was it was he around last time we have us know we we reviewed the perfect look yes yes we reviewed that tape together so that's why the conversation is kind of fresh in my mind but last time we didn't have a chance to talk about him know there's you know why because we didn't get a chance to look I'm sorry I'm going to have the honor of quoting him by saying yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what was that five times a six I'm sorry was supposed to be five you know the thing about Lulu Seaver said if I've done the thing about little Uzi vert I guess I would throw him the same kind of mumble rap trend as people would like Kodak black but believe it or not I actually would give way more credit to Kodak then I would lose you because who's he not only do his ad-libs get annoying like that not only is y'all one of the worst and most uninspired ad-libs on the planet and I love a good ad-lib you know if you had a mean funny exciting ad-lib that perks my ears up like the moment that you're about to step to the mic you know or you know just to like fill out a little bit of dead Aysen a song just kind of keep the energy up I can appreciate that as long as your versions are good as long as the chorus is good as long as the Energy's there I can appreciate a little filler ad lib but the thing is like when your ad-lib is so annoying and uninspired and obnoxious why I don't even see the point and like at least Kodak I mean at least she's writing something you know little Uzi vert I didn't really get that vibe from him like one of my least favorite moments in hip-hop so far this year is Uzi appearance on the bat and boozy track on me amigos new record like to me that song just ends when he when he appears at the very end because there's like a point on the song where he just like he wastes like two stanzas of just with just like nothing you know yeah it just was just was just like filler filler bullshit and it's just like dude come on this is like what one of the web's a lot of saddle rats there's one of the better singles of 2017 years you're going to just going to blow it but the thing is like that that's kind of what people expect for him they just expect him to sound like silly and ridiculous on the mic and I don't know man you know it's like I can appreciate some light hardness and a rapper with personality a rapper who's kind of quirky or funny or sort of to the left a little bit but he doesn't really strike me as any of that he just kind of strikes me as just I don't know mindless and here trigger you want him to be um a bit like Kodak like when he had The Breakfast Club interview where he was wearing a ski mask like just a bit eccentric he's not eccentric he just dumb is that what it is yeah I guess I guess it's kind of what you could say yeah I mean it's like you know and I didn't look funny now is that like there's so many rappers today that like it seems like on the outside to kind of come off that way because it's like they're wearing the rock-and-roll t-shirts and they've got the crazy colored dreads and you know it's like they're there all the piercings and all the tattoos and they look they look like you know really alternative like they look like some fucking punk rocker from the 90s or something you know but then you listen to their music and they're just like really nothing to it whatsoever and it's like you know at least I don't know bring some aggression or something something to the table like some kind of I don't know a vibe or energy that's at least like maybe it's custom old maybe it's cuz Imola but I think he's the one that depends the most on that word that gets thrown around too much which is vibe he he's the one that depends on that the most more than any of them sure because he'll just ride a beat and start off a huge record by saying yah yah yah five times and he's I think he's if we're going to say that little yah T is it not little yadi excuse me good guys are interchangeable a little revert back to got a reference code act like oh good if I could say that Kodak black is more coherent than little daddy's the full extremity of what would be considered a mumble rapper if you know if you want to use that term um I think I think that bad and bougie record will be because I mentioned to you before this podcast that I have given out some yearbook rewards and little Aussie is most likely to have peaked okay I think I think it's about to take a nosedive mmm this markets going to become so much more saturated and as we all know everyday it's becoming more and more saturated yeah it's it because this can be easily recreated I mean um you know when you think of a future for example when you think a future and then you you think of designer coming along just replicating it almost to a tee just is perfect and look I mean and a future has some he has song making ability he's a songwriter you know but sort of it's sort of he's a little lose the sense of the term he's a songwriter that he can he can write a hit let can we give him a he can write he can ride you see he's got a few hits under the bill right right little Aussie vert is he going to pen any big hits that remains to be seen but I think by behind their hits but their internet hits though yeah because the thing is he has some huge tracks on soundcloud he's got to be huge tracks on some of those mixtape sites you know what I mean but the thing is like it doesn't seem like it's anything because like in the mainstream as far as like the music industry and everything like it does it doesn't sort of it's not on the radar you know what I mean but you go to these festival shows and like the kids love them and they're obsessed with them and he's just like he's just omnipresent in a lot of ways you know with with can I ask you a question with word of mouth how big do you think it would have been for little woozy had Donald Glover said I want to thank migos and little easy verb for making that bad in Busey record when he got that award um I think that we should I gave it a boost yeah like you mean like what would you know the thing is later at this point I don't really think Donald Glover is necessarily bigger than me goes like maybe in the sense of like he's more widely recognized in the music industry itself but like me goes I see is stylistically way more influential than Donald Glover you know because like when they came out just as Drake that's fuckin the triplet flow everybody everybody else don't do in that fuckin triple yeah like since they broke like they're they way more street cred than Donald Glover has Donald Glover street cred is like what negative five you know he has lots of industry crannies lots of you know like middle-class you know whether you're white or black like music listener cred like he has a lot of mainstream music cred a lot of you know mainstream entertainment industry cred you know but I mean if he gave that track any kind of boost it was just a boost to kind of maybe a slightly different uh um you know demographic or crowd of people but the thing is like you know a lot of those people who are listening to dog-lover they'll listen to that trap shit too because that's like this is popular right now so it's like I don't know I don't necessarily see Donald lubbers being like you know the reason that track took off is as far as make it know what yeah not not the reason why but yeah just but just by the mention because because I think it was a means anything you can get at this point if anything I think it was really the the raindrop drop-top meme that sort of helped boost that track because those opening lines became a big fucking meme on the internet and it would just be it was a meme to sort of just repeat those lines and then come through with a third rhyme to sort of finish it off that would be like kind of a punch line or you know a joke to sort of reference something else I saw Zac Efron and a crop in a crop top as I saw him in a crowd stuff I did I did yes so I mean you know but to bring it back to a little easy yeah I mean I guess as far as mumble rappers go he's probably the most substance list that I've heard I mean I'm sure they're worse out there if you sort of you know spend all day sort of filtering through the dregs of WorldStarHipHop you know but the thing is like as far as like is the biggest and most relevant that are out there right now he's probably one of the worst the worst I think and and that's why I guess he got so many mentions I don't know if you feel the same way but but I guess I guess you kind of do because you just said most likely to peak he's the most likely based Anthony you think it's you think it's it's over yeah that's it bad emoji Segrest out okay but what about what about 21 savage and you know and and and via him let's also address savages 22 through 35 okay okay 20 through 22 through 2011 you know I have to be completely honest because uh what we discussed we discussed this um this podcast I told you that I was aware of a 22 and then you said wait a minute there's a 23 I think that isn't that yeah there is and and I and he's a rap artist this isn't just a troll I'm in it yeah but you know let's let's not get into all the other savages yeah looks like the pointy one savage now the thing is I know he gets kind of lumped into the same category but I don't consider himself favored an honorable rapper I I find it pretty intelligible like when I listen his way I know what the fuck he's saying I just you know and I guess on some level I can appreciate his style and aesthetic you know there are lots of records out there are lots of rappers out there who I've applauded and celebrated for having kind of a very quiet sort of cold-blooded sound I'm not a huge huge fan you know I can appreciate like what a guy like Rocky Marciano does I'm sure you can tell GMAC oh sure exam you know I can appreciate like you know what these guys have when they're trying to go for like a really dark cold-blooded murderous sound yeah you know the issue for me was with 21 though is that I just find them kind of one-dimensional you know like to me it sounds like he's not really that different track to track like he's not really taking that different of an approach from song to song and that just kind of feels obnoxious to me and I guess after a while the song is just kind of blend together and bleed into each other to the point where it's just like I don't know it just feels really redundant um you know I can't really knock him too hard for his lyrical content I mean it does sound really murderous and mean and nasty and cold-blooded I get the concept I appreciate the concept I sort of appreciate the sound for me it just doesn't really go anywhere and that's why he's a lackluster rapper to me maybe that's why people suggested him I'm not entirely sure but you know what's your take just he's he's on the high end for me he's on the high end of these this freshman this freshman class sure um no heart um that record for me is I say I think it pretty much it's what I like about him because he can start off the track sort of monotone the way he does but he picks it up and I find myself actually gaining some energy from it in a stupid fucking way that I didn't think I would um the savage mode tape uh it's it's it's it's listenable it's listenable listen you're like I yeah I felt like I went into a movie not expecting much but I got a lot you know I uh I got I got a lot man I mean yeah I'm sorry I'm see when you review music like this you just tend to have brain farts um ex ex bitch future that's those those are my two favorite tracks from him is no hard next bitch I feel like he's capable of a lot more maybe not a lot but he's capable of there's technique there there is there's a skill there that I don't know if he's going to tap into it but you know but you're right I mean he's one-dimensional now but I think this could blossom into something else and I think he could really surprise people yeah I mean I guess I I would I would I would label him most likely to succeed yes I guess if you were going to do with superlative here yeah I guess there's something to it you know I agree and I and I wouldn't put him you know as far as like the rappers that are on those lists I wouldn't put him as the worst of the worst I don't think he's the one of the worst of the worst you know I do think that a metro boomin sort of project was kind of lackluster but um you know but but again I think it sort of comes down to that one dimensionality is that one dimension okay yeah I think it's fine I think there's something to it you know but the thing is like I feel like you know it's I just wanted to kind of go somewhere else or I want to see you know sort of where your versatility at is sort of you know how long you kind of keep this style interesting or sort of develop it you know because even a guy is talented as as again the reference Rocky Marciano you know I can only listen to so much much of his music you know it does kind of wear on me after a little while I get you know there's only like a handful of artists to sort of take that super subtle super quiet super laid back somewhat monotone approach and I can like really get into it like kha or kweli Chris or something like that but uh but I guess he's just not one of them as you know twenty one savages but you know I see an opportunity for him to become that in the future and I sort of wonder where he's going to take things next because he hasn't been one of these artists who has kind of like a young thug who I'm surprised didn't get more suggestions he's not even on this list yeah I'm surprised he hasn't been one of those artists who just kind of routinely and prolifically just drops one fucking project after another you know because you know there are some rappers out there that since that Metro boomin project have probably dropped five EPS albums or tapes or something you know what I mean like and he's just been like just hanging back there like creepily in the background and it's like what the fuck you going to do and I don't know I'm intrigued I'm intrigued so I mean I don't think he's one of the worst of the worst I I'm not a huge fan of his last project I could see why people wouldn't be a huge fan of him but I think that's mostly because he's yet to show his full potential and I think we'll leave it there as far as 21 Savage and all the other savages that come after him still have 22 through 50 we're just going to skip them and go on to edge your second favorite rapper on this list mark Marcus hops on hop stone hop stone aka Hopson yeah whoo-hoo he got a lot of suggestions no surprise no surprise yeah I don't know if there's too much more we could say about Hopson now he was on the last one wasn't it yeah he was on the last one he was on the last one you know but the last time we talked about him had pound syndrome came out I don't think so right I don't think so I was bound syndrome out and I don't know if yeah I wasn't passenger a hound that's the fucking title right sound good rounds Andrew yeah no I think about that's such a fucking Hopson title that's like it's totally possible titles album yeah because it sounds hard but like syndrome is thrown in there because it sounds like kind of lady scientific he's sick he's sick man you know it would have found is from that I don't know it sounds hard talked about it is a count pound syndrome he's down with the sickness I cringe cringe but um yeah you know that's it's death again you know we said Jay Cole's middle name was underwhelming it happens middle name fuckin cringe if it's nothing like that in a rage it's cringe most likely to cringe yeah he is this is the yearbook superlative we give we give Hobson he's got the he's got his new video that he put out a couple weeks ago the it's your fault yeah and you know this is that's just so his attitude it's more the same from him except this time he's he's not card getting his manager anymore he's targeting one of his best friends which was it who's in the crew a because it's Swiss yeah he's marketing Swiss snaps whiz yeah he's I call you you know you're just like your brother or whatever so he's turning on everybody his girlfriend at what point at what point he's you know this record is there's going to be a record that he's going to come out with and you know he'll do this he's gonna come out with a record called the mirror and he's gonna rap in front of the mirror the whole time he's gonna say it's your fault and he's gonna break it yeah but the thing is you know that like see this is the thing about Hobson he's just so at least in his art I can't say on a personal level but he's just so he just lacks any kind of introspection like everything in anything that's wrong with the world or a situation has to do with somebody outside of him it can't have anything to do with him he didn't create the situation like that stupid fucking song where he's just tearing down that that friend of his who was a directives addicted to drugs and he was just like you know it was just this whole big show of like you know this is all you I hate you so much that I got arrested me how could you do this yeah exactly like it's like you know the song is all about him being angry and how mad he is that you know his friend's shitty life choices and then he had the battle record to God yes yes he battled God and the thing is like you know again it's your fault that's so a Hobson's song title because it's like you know his music is all about blaming other people for his problems blaming other people for the problems that he sees in the world when he doesn't sort of think like wait maybe it's me or wait maybe it's my perspective on a lot of najin growth not an option not an option and you know that's consistently what makes him such an annoying artist because the thing is like with Hopson I think we could say have anybody on this list he has the most technical skill but the thing is like it's it's it's it's it's used for evil like mmm evil being cringe um every single time you know I remember a pretty funny article that came out around the time pound syndrome dropped was one reflecting on that one track which was like a funny interlude track where he did like a parody future song and he was just like yeah these rappers didn't even say anything anymore they just say dumb shit over a hot beat to make you like it I'll do duh and then he started sort of you know doing this feature impression and it's pretty spot-on impression yeah and immediately this article was like Hobson accidentally drops his hottest song best song in it best song he's ever done and it's the song where he was trying to parody music he thinks is bad it sounded good and you know I get it you know it's like you know it's it's like um it's like it's like the asshole who spends all of his all of his days all of his years like perfecting his craft playing guitar and then he sort of comes along and you know see is like a Ramones show or something he's like anybody could you juice this is stupid and then he just like you know comes out with his own parody Ramone song but it accidentally ends up being like a good Punk song yeah it's pretty much the equivalent of what's going on there you know and that's the thing it's like so much of what makes his music bad comes down to his just shitty shitty perspective and it's funny because like when I listen to his music I just can't fathom the fact the man is over thirty because it's like all these things that he says all these epiphanies that he has like these are things that I remember thinking and feeling like when I was 14 or 15 you know it's like yeah like when I was 15 I used to think like religion really sucks and yeah like all these people who do drugs really stupid and it's all their fault the words stupid and it's just like you know once you get older and gain some experience like you learn that there's like so much more to like the what motivates people to do certain things and that and there's so much more to the world's ills than you know oh it's religion ER oh it's drugs or oh it's conservatives or oh it's liberals or oh it's whatever you know and and he just seemed like somebody who buys so quickly into that into that mindset he he's always angry and I and I feel like like for example hoozy Busey has a song I'm a purple tape um I do what I want it's like now I do what I want no I do it's it's jovial it's it's fun like hey I do what I want I'm playing I'm a kid if Hobson made that song he would add anger to it and that song would have a totally different tone and I understand it I mean it's not his that's his art you know but but it's just like one tone and you would expect somebody that would be so technically sound would would observe that and say you know what I've been I've been uh with with the mono mono chromatic this whole entire time you know I got a switch at these colors man I got to start doing different things and he never seems to have that data that overview of his music which is really surprising so um that record is coming there's gonna be a record where eventually he get it's going to be through the process of elimination if God is already done we'd already done my girlfriend my best friend he is going to come out with a record where it's just going to be like I hate myself but that would be the next illa my other would I say earlier I was going to say earlier that that person who is rapping out who he was rapping at who he's angry at in the mirror he will see that person no one else as somehow exactly you can exact someone else in the mirror exactly well it's not just that he'll see it as kind of like a schizophrenic sort of thing he'll be like oh the evil side of me or the bad side of me or the you know the really annoying or sort of you know judgy side of me who I know they're there but the thing that and I want them to stop but you know that he's not going to get down to like the root of the problem because it's going to be like that that person the mirror is going to be someone else it's going to be him but not him he's gonna back here it is he's going to back up from the mirror at the end and then it's going to be an image of somebody who looks like Trump and it's going to be a huge social statement dony is going to love that song off if he does a trump diss track oh man that should be binding on that should be on its way he could just be like all the world's problems are because of Trump Berg oh I would love to hear that song please I would love to hear that it would be so adorable to lizard it okay let's let's move on to the next artists in this list as tempting as it is to do with entire hops and podcast the next artist in this listen I don't really have much to say about him although he got a lot of suggestions his name is famous dex and to me he's just kind of one of these semi hyped WorldStarHipHop music video artists who you see all over their their YouTube feed his musics kind of bland a lot of the time it sounds like he's borrowing most of his ideas from little yachty I mean he has a few internet hits that are okay but there's not really much to his sound or style that I don't already hear in other rappers of his style and of his sound he just kind of sounds like as far as mumble rap goes and as far as like that really trendy trap rap goes like he's just one of the more non-essential artists I've heard right now I've yet to hear anything that sounds uniquely his in a song so it's like I'm not even really sure how to address why he would be suggested or how I would sort of go about critiquing him other than just say it doesn't sound like he or even look like he has much of a personality of his own this is nothing really to discuss the interesting thing about him ex is that he's from New York City really yeah that's a I just I just Wikipedia PD in him yeah he's from Manhattan New York City that's a big surprise I just kind of Emprise I guess it was designer what was a surprise I guess this is less of a surprise but most likely to beef with little yachty um we were pretty much in sync with that one on that I heard a song huh where he's where he I think of the hook he goes like oh you know I'm not that little bow that's my bro that's passive aggression right there that's going to build up and so he keeps hearing that his red hair is similar to the boat and he's get you're going to see a dumb internet pose you're going to see him on Instagram yeah that's fun pack that fuck nigga at that foot make a little UI nigga a you've been tired nigga what a bazillion but you're incoherent shit and you know that's all she wrote well then let's then if you don't really have anything else to say then let's just skip over the little yachty then let's let's do it since he's the one of the national he does such a good job at stealing from little yadi that he's done the one thing that none of these kids have done yet and they haven't taken little yachties sort of lively instrumentation like they haven't taken that sound he he has he's been borrowing that a little bit GBI has yeah and that's one of the more obvious things about dex because the thing is there aren't too many rappers out there who sort of you know and this is what stands out to me about little yachty that makes such a be kind of happy-go-lucky very smiley very shiny bright sort of trap music like he doesn't bring that sort of dark very nasty menacing tone that a lot of trap music does and and that's one of the most unique things about little yachty in my opinion right within the context of that type of music you can see where little yachty works I wouldn't be caught dead fuckin listening to him but when I hear little yachty I can understand to some extent that I'm not really supposed to be paying attention to what he's saying it really is about the whole entire sound of of the package um when I saw him in that that sprite commercial shit got real like it was one of those life-affirming moments that it was kind of like alright we're all going to hell because little yadi is gonna come in a sprite commercial with lebron james and i think since then i think rap critic told me that he's in another he's in another comer he's in a target song he oh he recreated what was a psalmody we created it's it's it takes to deliver Rob bass song and on the hook is a Carly Rae Jepsen I fucking love that song okay you know about the rendition of the Rhett I love the rendition yes I do have you heard it yeah it's fun it's an embolic Hey look if it's climb it's fun I think he did a great job of recapturing what made that track so fun you know and for 2017 like oh man I'm little yachty and I'm down if you're down like he's people give him shit as if he knows nothing about hip-hop he doesn't appreciate hip-hop and I get that he gives off that vibe but the thing is like he for me he has people act like he has no technical skill like he has no lyrical skill whatsoever and I'm not saying that you know uh that ok I'm people your people I'm people I'm just I'm just complimenting his his uh his uh his choice of instrumental sure that blend well would sort of in the same way that that Drake has that okay yeah that ability well you know gets it before before we move on you know okay obviously we're going officially in the little yachty at this point in the list let me just say in the list little yachty is probably my favorite out of all the rappers who have been suggested so I am a lil yachty apologist I mean none of his projects had made my loved list like I've never loved a little yadi project from beginning to end like you have an appendage is is his projects have you know always had some flaws to them but I liked you know his projects he's made some of my favorite songs over the past few years I loved his appearance on that um DRAM track broccoli you know I just think he makes really fun poppy bright shiny rap music that sounds really unique to me and it's funny that you say that you know it's about the sound it's not the total package I know I'm not supposed to be listening to lyrics by though that uh I mean I actually like his lyrics because it's not that he's super lyrical it's not that I think he drops like super hot bars I just think he's funny I think he's got a fuckin sense of humor and it comes out really obviously in his music like he's clearly self-aware of how goofy his music sounds like he's clearly several wears how goofy his voice sounds and he so plays it up and I just like how again how humorous his bars are I mean I thought they were he had a couple funny lines on the on the takes to track again it's like I'm not listening to him like damn he's dropping some cold hard shit well I mean but the thing is like I think he has a sense of humor I think he brings like a really fun happy-go-lucky vibe to a song and in a way that I don't think a lot of rappers do these days you know it's like it seems like if you're not trying to sound hard or aggressive you're trying to sound super meaningful or like sad or like buttery smooth in the same way that Drake does like higher number and you know you're around the same age as I am you know a lot of the hip-hop that came up in the 80s and the 90s and sure that was like lots of meaningful and you know serious and aggressive stuff that came out then that was great but like what coexisted also at that time is like you had serious like awesome fun upbeat like inspiring party music that came out of that genre or two and it seems like there's less and less of that these days I mean sure there's plenty of hip-hop out there that you can party to when people do like you know people party their fucking asses off too bad and bougie but you know there's nothing really about that song that like feels as upbeat as a little yachty song you know and to me he's sort of bringing that upbeat vibe back to the genre in a really real and a really entertaining way and I feel like people don't give him enough credit for that just because they sort of see the fact that he fits into this mumble rapper mold to an extent but the he'll come through with a rendition of that like look at it this way you cannot ask a little easy vert to do a rendition of it takes - like he would not come through with two coherent verses to do that you know what I mean little yadi did like were that were they amazing verses no but the flow is that Kodak no fuck no but but little yachty the mood was there the tone was there the pronunciation was there you know what I'm saying like these other artists who people also toss into that mumble wrapped sort of been like could not do that you know and while lil yachty doesn't try i don't see it as a complete lack of lyrical ability I see it more as a means of his philosophy because you know again and again in a really bold and upfront way he said an interview after interview like listen this is like now a hip-hop is about anymore you don't need to have a cold 16 hearing that a hot 16 I mean you know you know the interviews you know the transitions that he's had like that's just the way that he sees the genre moving right now and you know but but the thing is like you know sure he's not a fucking exhibit like behind closed doors you know but the thing is like he can at least step up to the technical ability necessary to tribute a classic song like it takes to I mean I get why people don't like him I think he sounds goofy what I think I think he sounds ridiculous on the mic sometimes but that's kind of his appeal to me I think he sounds kind of silly I think he's kind of taking the piss out of sort of you know hard rap music in a way sometimes sort of paving the way for for artists after them in a sense if they want to be goofy if they want to be silly if they don't want to have to play up this hardened image or something you know yeah I don't think it without necessarily like trying to soften yourself up in a way where you're clearly just doing it for attention sort of in the same way that like you know young slugger a little bee might wear a dress you know what I mean it's like well you know to try to work against the whole heart and rapper thing I'm going to look or act effeminate you know what I mean but he's like going in that route but doing it in a way that seems natural doing in a way where it seems like you know he's just being a silly dumb kid you know he's not doing it for attention but you know only only to sort of connect with other kids who are sort of also kind of isolated out there and also feel kind of like well you know I really like to act silly or dumb or you know ridiculous if I want to you know and the thing is like I feel like there's more and more of a place for that kind of personality in in music especially hip hop these days because of you know the way the mean culture has kind of infused itself into hip-hop right now like little yachty is such a rapper that I think could only exist during a time when mean culture is kind of as popular as it is within the hip-hop community you know where hip-hop fans artists because he's self-aware yeah because he's self-aware you know if you look at his music videos the total fucking ridiculous like he doesn't take himself seriously at all but see but I but I kind of feel like this is what little B was I feel like this is what little B was so it's I don't know little a agree because little B does did have a lot of those moments raised like this is my deepest song this is my deepest shit I'm trying to say something real here I think this is point little little yadi knows that if he if he sticks out his chest even the slightest bit people will they'll slap him on the wrist for that I mean because he was at he was unfairly sort of targeted through a series of those interviews and people asked him fucking stupid questions I mean the kid is he's like he's 19 but you know that's not if that the kid was probably born like 99 maybe the year 2000 who knows and and and I don't I don't believe that I don't believe that that that the idea of oh this isn't the donger it doesn't have to be this certain people always have this extreme view there's never any in-between for them they either think you have to be lyrical circle miracle or a little yadi we know that all those styles exist but I think that sort of that relative you know that all is relative conversation is eventually what drives us into the ground and while we're discussing people like this right now you know I think that's what's driven into the ground I think in my opinion this started with it all starts with Kanye I think he's he he is the one that came in and said listen you can be yourself you can be yourself and now artists are taking slight variations from that maybe little yadi slicing a bit off of that but the thing was with Kanye is that he had something that was undoubtedly timeless you know a bunch of different abilities you know something that he's always preached to us that he that you know an ability that he's had he has which is being a visual artist and now you get to see it with the with his onstage work and all that stuff so he's multi-talented it started with him and then it's kind of taken a nosedive of we're still riding on this wave of creativity and Horsa yadda can make you know the records that he wants to make you know because they do sound fun as I said I understand him within the context of the rest of these guys he is refreshing you know if I'm looking at it from the outside of a grumpy sort of East Coast fan like her karate I I understand it but I think that that conversation is what drives us to this point where it's like wow you know there's no difference between uh you know shit and shit and the other thing that might be I mean there are some people who might frame it that way I personally want to frame it that way I like we know I love you some little yachty I love I love little yachty I love me some little yachty but I wouldn't necessarily say he's making anything super timeless right now I think he in you know unless he drops some amazing fucking album in the next two years I think he'll probably go down as somebody who sort of marks sort of this mumble rap era you know because I think he's certainly gone the most mainstream with it and and it's certainly probably the most commercially viable of any artists who have kind of been thrown into that into that genre into that style as you know he's been in the commercials he's had the huge hits he's had the huge music videos he does kind of put a friendly face on the sound and the style that many other artists don't who are a little more edgy and maybe not as you know commercial friendly so I think I think in those respect he will go down sort of in history as a marker for this era because you know this this air is going to go down in history just like the bling era did you know like we're going to remember it's going to be there it's going to be written whether or not we sort of find the artists to have any staying power within it or not you know and I think he'll most likely go down as a marker for that era and at least one of the less headache-inducing points in that era of music I do like it a lot but I don't think it's necessarily because of some kind of relativism or anything like that I can objectively say artistically even though you know I'm not like the biggest fan of what he's been doing lately like Kanye is doing more interesting things he's doing more challenging things he's doing riskier things on the hold and little yadi is but you know let's let's see maybe little yadi somehow laughs in the next decade we'll see I guess but before you go off into the next person I just want to say that when you were saying when you were talking about yachties marketability so I said you know what I'm looking at a picture of famous decks with a gun let's see if little yachty would be in a picture with a gun so I have little yachty gun and the only thing that comes up is him I'm not sure if it's the broccoli video the Minnesota one where he's on a boat and he's got like a harpoon does it he doesn't have a gun but he's got like a harpoon I think I can't remember what music video that is but azar like a rain jacket yeah it's some crazy music video that came out shortly after the the little boat mixtape got huge and um you know I think he does have the potential to drop a great album but I mean I don't know I think it remains to be seen most likely to have a show on Adult Swim someday most likely to have a show on Adult Swim someday I fully yeah absolutely all right let's move on to the next artist here we only have a few more left we talked about this one last time I believe but at the time we had a discussion about him he was he had a different sound in a different style he was doing something a little different this time now and we're gonna be talking about Drake here champagne poppy as as he's known a lot of people lately and maybe this is why he's on the list I'm not totally sure but a lot of people lately have been talking to me about Drake as if he's not even hip-hop anymore because of what he did on his last album views because he's sort of going further in that pop direction further in that dancehall direction some people seem to feel like even though bulk of the tracks on his album were hip hop he's kind of giving himself up more to the pop world than he is the rap world like he's not hip hop's anymore I guess and maybe that's what makes him a lackluster rapper at this point because on the rapper front it seems like he's not really trying all that much anymore ever since if you're reading this in those meek Millz disses dropped it seems like his head's kind of been in a completely completely different musical space kind of maybe becoming a victim of his own yes I mean maybe that's why maybe that's why more life is getting pushed back as much as it is that's never a good sign yeah because I was supposed to be out at the underlay everywhere at the end of every where I believe it was supposed to be out late last year then I was supposed to be January I was supposed to be the end of February and now who the fuck knows yeah so I think he's he's broken out commercially so much with those records with those different sounds that now he's got to sort of keep going on I mean he's not going to come out with an album and people need to just let go of the idea of him coming out with an album with a song every song sounding like hype from views I would love it I would love it personally but that's not something that he's going to do he's gonna make he's going to experiment with the with sounds he's going to make more hotline bling more one dances because he's got a he's got to keep this Drake train going you got to finance this whole thing so um it does surprise me that he's on the list because no one had such a big year uh-uh-uh I mean I mean the past the past two years have basically been his so maybe this is more to the point of him being a victim of his own success because the minute there seems to be some form of stagnation it's like oh wait a minute we're panicking and that might be the case here well to me it seemed like the hype kind of dropped off pretty quickly after views dropped because nothing on the album really came to light as far as like whoa this song is amazing or this track turned out being a really huge single or something like that all of that album's hottest tracks came out before that album was released so it's almost as if the hydra's kind of dropped off immediately after views came out and not necessarily because Drake's fans turned against him on the album or anything I personally didn't like the record there were a lot of people who I knew who are anticipating the album didn't really care for it either but it seemed like his hardcore fans enjoyed it but uh it seemed like almost as if he went on hiatus a little bit after that album came out because there hasn't really been a whole lot of noise outside of the couple of tracks that he dropped in promotion of more life which we're still kind of sitting here waiting when is it going to come out I don't know so I mean I I understand what you're saying like the next time he comes out with it's probably gonna have a totally different sound like he might entirely abandon this whole dancehall thing he's been playing with and maybe he's kind of sitting there waiting for the hype on it to kind of die down so that his fans don't anticipate him to come out with more music like that because uh because he kind of started that trend in a lot of ways immediately after he came out with one dance and controla like every pop dance music producer and a lot of other rappers - an artist and R&B artists were coming out with these like really lukewarm whitewash terrible dancehall songs there was like hey we're on the trend too don't forget us we're here I think I I heard your post Malone review didn't you mention that he had one of those sort of Caribbean kind of I think he might have si - yeah you know nice guy though nice guy him and I beefed on Twitter for a little bit oh and then and then we got along because because I don't know why um we just started joking and then the beep the beef kind of just subsided I guess but whatever yeah I'm sure he's a nice man shoutout to post Malone the good man he's good men but I mean I don't know why Drake is on this list either I don't think he's one of the worst rappers that's out there right now I kind of get why some people are complaining that it seems like he's kind of abandoned the sound because you know the rap tracks on his album were some of the more lackluster on the record I get it and the rap tracks didn't really seem to be the centerpiece or the main focus of the album as some of the biggest hits on the record we're not really the rap songs on the album and you know he did he did have those quarry moments on the record where he was rapping about arguing with this girl at the Cheesecake Factory you know ginger let's let Drake have his fucking Cheesecake Factory you know and drink drink loves his cheesecake but uh having said all that have is cheese the map is cheesecake having said all that you know this next album we know it's going to be different we know Drake's going to change lanes again because always what he does I mean we know he's going to build some ideas from another place or another direction or something to do something totally different there been people have been accusing him of stealing ideas from another rapper on this list yeah you know but before we get into that rapper I you know that recent interview that he did with uh with DJ um syntax he he mentioned like he openly mentioned that he's on his computer just diving deep into the internet I mean that sort of incriminates you a bit more when you could find any obscure video of an artist who has a particular sound and then just use it and it is clearly done that and again DRAM he's clearly done that in the case of other you know southern rappers you know eivol she with the low prices I want to ask you this I want to ask you this and maybe and maybe this is why some people you know sort of hate Drake I've heard this critique lob to him a lot do you think Drake's a culture vulture I've heard a lot of people call that I've heard that critique thrown him quite a cook from from the viewpoint of him up from a nationalistic standpoint a racial standpoint I'm not really sure because it seems almost as if like to know that an artist like Kanye clearly borrows from his contemporaries like in a really big way um you know to the point where he's blatantly ripping them off or he's paying them to produce songs or write songs for him like he clearly is immersed he immerses himself with every new record in what's hot and what's relevant to sort of keep himself relevant keep the train going you know Drake in a lot of respects I see is doing the same thing but in the case of Kanye I don't see that critique getting loud to him because what I do because if Jim Hall Drake a culture vulture we go to terminus as if he makes hip hop while not really being a part of hip hop culture yeah that that term always it's spoken about somebody who is of a different race or from a different place that's where I've normally heard the term culture vulture I mean when I first started to hear that it was about Leah Cohen um who's I think he was president or CEO CEO of Def Jam Records and I used to hear about Vlad from glad TV um Iggy Azalea I've never heard I've never heard but do I think okay if I if I come down a step do I feel like he is I don't think so I mean I think Drake is feeling like an artist hmm you know which is what is sort of always suggested that that's what you have to do you don't you don't take direct um you know you know you don't take it directly but sort of you you turn it into into your own and everybody everybody searches the internet of course I mean I'd be stupid to believe that all these large artists they're not looking out there in to the benefit that the World Wide Web of course they are or other people are like yeah or other people are doing it for them yeah yeah exactly but but it's just the fact that he openly says it I think there's something to that and I think that feeds that narrative of yeah of course and of course you'd be the guy that's that's uh you know looking over there looking over everything with a fine-tooth comb because because this is what you do um he's being innovative because I mean as you said people are borrowing those those those sounds that he's using now migos can you know that's confirmed he did but so did a lot of people showed it a lot of you Drake's not the only one that was guilty of that yeah um the weekend is another that's another big one a huge one yeah yeah yeah um I mean all these other guys the guys that we're about to mention now I I don't see it I don't know if there's a particular song but I don't see it there you know maybe I haven't heard enough of him to be able to come to that conclusion but I don't see it they're not with the recent one okay as far as let's skip over to another artist who we have on this list to sort of jump off of that conversation xxx temptation so I have heard some people specifically say that Drake took one of his flows off of a track and put on one of his tracks or pradhana versus one particular chocolate one particular flow and that's it because that's that's really all about his sound that I could see Drake taking a flow or something because to be honest like his sound is so angry and loud and distorted and aggressive I can't really see many artists out there it's more level Wayne hmm closer to Wayne than they've been Drake I don't know but I mean as far as this guy goes I mean do you know much more have you heard much of his music because I mean he just kind of falls into the category of like a back of decks I mean internet fame sort of I mean yes but the thing is like if you go on soundcloud there's like a really healthy trend going on soundcloud right now of artists who make really edgy distorted angry very aggressive hip-hop music and you know some of them are white guys some there were black guys I don't know where it kind of started I mean I know bones is one I know Space Ghost perp and sort of the Rader clan had a big following over there for a while before Space Ghost perp kind of fell off the radar Denzel Curry is one puia is another example this guy is another example you know we're talking about right now there's a lot of angry loud very in-your-face trap rap going on on soundcloud right now and I kind of see this guy is the most extreme of the extreme of artists who are kind of playing with that sound right now and I get that some people might find it so loud that it's annoying but there's nothing really about his sound or his style that makes them stick out to me as being one of the worst rappers out there right now I I guess I'll say that he does have kind of a reputation that precedes him if you look him up most of the pictures that you find of him online are mug shots yes and there's kind of a reason for that but um I've seen a few videos of him fighting yeah but I mean beyond that I mean I do it kind of like 21 Savage I do think there's something to his sound but it is kind of one-dimensional I don't know if you feel any different about about what you haven't heard enough of him to come to determine whether he's one-dimensional or not the reason why I said the Wayne thing is because on on look at me he sounds the way Wayne did on on 6 foot 7 foot um with cory gunz you know his sort of flow i saw a sort of a periscope um a periscope thing that he recorded he was talking to his fans and what really surprised me is that he was he was addressing black lives matter he was addressing it he sounded very articulate he he was even he was even making commentary on Malcolm X um you know not the most you know II got Cornel West but but you know but but it was it was definitely it definitely led me to believe that I would give him the most likely to write some real shit one day most likely to write some real shit one day the most likely to write some real shit yeah it's a little it's a little uh specific I know but um BM I think I think just like 21 Savage there's a lot of potential based on what I've heard and yeah you're right the the persona I think it's due to Google it's due to the fact that you you type in X extent the song and that's all you're going to find as much shot but I mean like I mean I think he has potential as well but at this point I think he also has the potential to end up in a Bobby shmurda type situation you know when I'm president right now yeah yes he is he is in prison right now oh he is no kidding you know you know fuck I'm not fucking with you yeah I think he is in prison right now so the thing is like you know there is chance for it to become a bobby schmurder situation where you end up in there so long that your career is essentially just in the trash because who's really going to be looking for a bobby schmurder song when he gets out you know what I mean and you know maybe he'll again maybe he could get in the same situation I'm not necessarily looking forward to that you know being the case you know and again I do think there is musical potential there but I think if he's ever going to reach that he's going to have to come clean about some of the stuff that he's done and he's going to have to just kind of clean up his act you know and just kind of focus on this potential career that he has in front of him instead of just like you know putting himself in the slammer I guess but um that's that's all I really have to say about yeah not much else before we get into this last person though I want to just throw in two more people that judging by the rhythm of this conversation I'm surprised that they were mentioned or maybe they were and they were pretty close sobs a designer who you know I'm sure that's no surprise but logic is somebody that surprises and on this list of J Cole was here logic should have been here to you knowing logic I agree sort of if we're talking about potential if we're talking about if we're talking about that then definitely but he didn't get mentioned and designer I think is kind of just fallen off the radar since his last mixtape came out because I mean he had that new single then it was okay you know but I think I think if weak I think it this was last year and we were close to the release of Panda that's a zombie Lenore was a I can't remember at this point um his new single was okay I think this was last year and we and we did this recording closer to the releases Panda and new English than he probably would have made the list but um let's talk about Big Sean real quick I mean he made the list he got some suggestions I thought his last album was okay but to me still he's probably mainstream raps most non-essential character because the best songs on his new album to me just sounded like good Drake songs and I'm serious they sounded like good Drake songs from if you're reading this and that's really it like those songs I hear Drake recording them or here or here drink writing them or your drink you know rapid you know his best songs on his latest record they were good Drake songs and and even the worst songs on his new record they were bad Drake songs you know so it's like what are you really doing at this point you know he to me he's just some kind of rapper who exists out there who is is is there for people who just kind of want more of the same or just who haven't had enough you know I want to say that I am a big Shawn apologist hmm to an extent to an extent not musically I do remember around the time when control came out you and I had a conversation I'm not sure I'm not sure what it was but I said Big Sean's verse was good you were like get the fuck out of here like you were just telling me like you thought you were sorry to eerily like he had agreed with I'm a big Shawn apologist just because of a series of a series of monologues that he has online that they're just gold and I think if anybody in your audience to go look for them just type in Big Sean motivation or inspiration and you'll find a use find like five or six different ones um just just him as a person he seems like a good person but to his music you know recently on the no favor song with with Eminem which which was on a what's the name of the slob I decided on I decided um I thought this verse was better than Eminem's uh which I mean obviously IIIi think Big Sean versus stick out for some reason I get why people don't like Big Sean because he does sound Big Sean to me sounds like a better version of what Nick Cannon would sound like like just Nick Cannon but just a little better it does sound a little after-school special it does give off that sort of vibe at points but I would give him more lyrical points on this new album because they're who drive he drive there were more spots on the record roads like wow that was those a clever Ryan always a little clever he always does that like little just clever wordplay that you sort of just oh I see what you did there but it's never enough for you to stick around yeah in November and the thing is like it's never enough for you to stick around and the thing is like his set he so blatantly wears his influences on his sleeve and the thing is his the people who influenced him the most always happened to be those who are more popular than him his contemporaries people who are making more waves than him so he just always ends up kind of just drowning in the hype of the artists who he's kind of blatantly copying in my opinion um you know and which is why he only ever sort of grabs the attention of people who don't mind just kind of hearing more of what's already out there you know again I give him more lyrical points on this record but there's just very little to his style and his sound that I that I could give or attribute directly to him you know I I get that some of his most hardcore fans will sort of you know argue til there are blue in the face that um you know early early on like you know we're talking like 2010-2011 like it was actually Big Sean who was influencing a lot of what Drake was doing and you know that might have sort of been the case around that era where you know people would talk about like you know hashtag rap like you know like a you know sir the certain hashtag style rapper versus but the thing is since then Drake has undergone like four or five different evolutions many of which been in a row Cudi in there to it that at that point sure absolutely yeah yeah you know it drink probably even more so that more so than been shown Drake has undergone so many evolutions at least a couple of which Big Sean hopped on the wave of so it's like you know obvious it's obviously it's a bit of a two-way street there you know it's not just Big Sean influencing Drake every step of the way maybe a little bit at first but you know Drake clearly took what Big Sean did and just brought it to a higher level you know and that may not necessarily be because of just pure skill or anything like that you know I'm sure a lot of it comes down to marketability uh you know but but beyond that I just don't really sort of shit see Big Sean's place in in hip-hop right now that continues to be a problem for me but um but yeah that's kind of my take on him overall so eventually Big Sean will I mean if we're predicting what hopson's next move is going to be Big Sean's next move is going to be sort of this releasing the releasing himself of the shackles and saying you know I've always been in somebody shadow because you're right now no I I think he's going to continue to be another artist shallow shadow because it is always is comfortable it just works it just works Fran he's comfort he's not Iron Man he's not a leading man I think it's where he does his best work it's it's there doesn't seem to be any pressure for him to do anything else so I think he's just going to continue down that road yeah all right man this is a been a pretty interesting conversation we've gone through a lot of material here we have and everybody listening thank you for sticking around to the very end this has been goddamn the the 10 worst rappers out right now my guest has been none other than be respect check out his YouTube channel check out his Twitter page link down there in the description this has been another episode of needle drop podcast you're the best forever [Music] [Music] 
vK8002cpon4,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly y-you know review segment where I go into a series of albums that I didn't get a chance to formally review over the past month I deliver these opinions to you and a series of hot short takes in a bunch of micro sized videos all of which landed on Twitter before this at the needle drop get that beautiful beautiful Twitter tag up there follow me over there if you get a chance and yeah that's it info on all the records I'm talking about in this video down below and let's get into the gauntlet you know if you go back into Cloud Nothings discography you'll find pretty easily that the band has never had a set style a set sound but then all of a sudden they blew up with this great attack on memory album I even love this record but immediately after this album it's like the band just tossed out the narrative they tossed out the sound they tossed out pretty much everything that attracted fans to the band that blew them up in the first place and now this new record is just kind of further instance of that further proof of that as they just kind of deliver all this by the numbers indie rock with a little bit of a pop punk flare to it it's just not that distinct it's just not that memorable and I wish the band would just sit on an idea and hone it and perfect it to the point where they can make it distinct make it sound unique maybe give it a little bit of a perspective that only they could but instead they're just kind of just I don't know hopping from idea to idea sounding really non-committal on everything and I don't know just very wishy-washy my god from the moment I heard this guy on Travis Scott laughs record I knew man we were in for something special if he ever dropped an album this thing man it's ordinary painfully dumb lyrics ordinary instrumentals that have kind of a you know very atmospheric kind of moody dark trapped flavor to them but they're really skeletal happen sound like demos and his vocals are so passionless and flat and average they're so average in every way shape and form and the vocal effects they put on his voice throughout this album leave him sounding like system I don't know a cold emotionless robot so what does he appeal this album is it that it's so generic you almost can't describe it is it that it's so painfully cliche that there's absolutely nothing special about it is it that you can't keep yourself from laughing because he just drops one corny bar after another enlighten me please educate me because if there's something good about this album I would love to know young-dal definitely has some catchy refrains on this thing and he has a pretty eccentric delivery a very low deep voice that commands a lot of attention but you know if you're looking for a trap record that's kind of reinventing the wheel or doing something all that different or refreshing this is not it this is not it at all I do appreciate him keeping it keeping it concise and keeping it short though it's just like a 30-minute project or so so you know it's doesn't overstay its welcome or nothing there are definitely some things to like about this album productions pretty colorful bangs a lot of the time and cuts like adora and also Bambi are really nice because they sort of bring together that new trap flavor production with sort of this old soul Motown style of singing and songwriting that I thought was a pretty cool collision of musical worlds for Jenna Anna Anna it's sort of a couple sounds that no other artists are bringing together at least not in the way that he is on these tracks but outside of that much of the album just kind of struck me as being really average pop rap with a really obvious Kanye influence so insulin flowing flowing flowing flowing flowing flowing and can we agree worst course of the year right here worst chorus why why is this real why is this real really crappy guitar songs crappy crappy guitar song that's where we are right now nonetheless that's what we're doing now and this album cover makes me sick oh how it's so excited to listen to this EP because I love Ariel Pink's music and wise bloods last record was a pretty good broke pop effort but their chemistry on this thing is about as awkward as a junior high slope ants and pretty much every track after the first track is horrifically under written to the plane where there's just nothing in terms of a compelling weed melody or hook or anything and it's not just the chemistry but even the vocal performance is isolated outside of the idea of this collaborative EP sound really flat and lifeless for both of these artists by both of their individual standards judging by the music they've released thus far so I know man this EP was really just like a big swing and a Miss in my opinion if you're looking for a hip-hop record from the UK this is not a bad album to try the high focus record label it dropped this project always puts out some quality stuff you know there's definitely like some quality standards that they expect every album to be reaching before they release something so you know definitely one of the more consistent hip-hop labels out there in my opinion and it's so cool that they're from the UK and sort of putting a lot of that talent that's over there on a platform that would not have been there otherwise that being said you know this is a pretty fun quirky tongue-in-cheek album with a lot of crude humor and and funny obscure dorky references but there was something about it that was just nagging me and nagging me and nagging me as I listened to it and then finally as maybe I was like 3/4 of the way through the album it just hit me so much of this album just reminds me of MF DOOM from the flows to the lyrical style maybe not so much the instrumentals as they are maybe a little grimy err in a little earier then you would usually catch on an MF DOOM album but not by much you know I mean obviously the vocals are very different because deep shouty vocals with you know obviously a very stick English accent on them but you know that MF DOOM influence it's so there it's so on the sleeve and you know it's sort of bugged me after a while or sort of made the album seem so much less novel or intriguing to me but for people who don't really mind that don't really mind hearing that influence so obviously in their hip hop check this thing out because you know it's really not a bad listen what is this is this like some spacey lo-fi homespun very skeletal like bland trendy R&B like ultra alternative R&B no thank you not not into it there's a couple of good a couple of it later couple of it there are a couple of good riffs on this thing but with me on me is have something that's brand new can sound so stale right out of the gate as far as contemporary commercial R&B goes this is not that bad I mean it lives up to the title I think a lot of very sexy and sweet moments on this record it's very blissful very easygoing there are a lot of catchy spots admittedly I'm not really that into Kalani as a singer I don't think she has a terrible voice for sure not a terrible voice but she's not really like a stunner to me vocally you know it's not really much about her voice that that stands out to me is memorable and that is also kind of the case for a lot of these tracks as they stick to a very clear formula a lot of the time I mean a lot of these tracks have very much the same vibe the same tone so even though you do have a few songs here and there that do stick out it's great singles in a way they do end up a little drowned out standing shoulder to shoulder with all these other tracks that have an incredible likeness to them but still you know if you're looking for some feel-good R&B to vibe to this is not a bad release [Music] unfortunately a Droog and Wiki don't bring quite as much chemistry to the table as I hope they would have on this EP I mean you know some of the bars on this thing are pretty grimy some of the beats on this thing are pretty grimy but especially the last track it seems like there's really nothing significant and exciting going on the only track where I felt like they really melded and then we're making something truly unique to this collaboration with the song vigilantes that track is great but pretty much every other song it just kind of seems like I don't know of course they're performing on the same track but it's kind of like they're just in the same room it really is somewhat standoffish way and the collaboration doesn't really have that much kinetic energy going for it you know I mean you know sure if I was looking for a reason to sleep I can definitely see why people have been hyping this album up to me I mean this English rapper here seems like he has a  together it's a pretty well groomed album but his voice is delivery just does nothing for me it's so understated and it's so flat and emotionless and I'm into alternative rap styles but he's so quiet and he's so I guess I don't know he's just so polite in his delivery that I almost struggled to just be listening in and just hear everything he's saying because he's he's just a few shades above a whisper sometimes though again I do credit the very beautiful and very classy instrumentals all over this album and the fact that many of the songs on this thing are very personal and once you read into the lyrics kind of touching but I'm just not really a big fan of the sound of the delivery but again I see the hype and you know if you're in the alternative rap and you're looking for an album that does take a more emotional tone I would definitely recommend trying this out I will give it to fans of this record that this is the boldest thing that CID has been on ever the production alone makes it that it's really quirky it's kind of clunky it's got a good group to it a lot of the time it kind of has almost this Pharrell or Neptune's vibe to it but it has that smoothness necessary for it to sort of be proper backing for a neo-soul album and aren't an alternative R&B album which this in fact is but Sid in my opinion still leaves a lot to be desired vocally even if the vocals are more up front and center than they typically are on an Internet album to me listening to her singing is is just like watching paint dry there's nothing all that exciting or passionate about it there's nothing about her voice that just pops off of the mix to me she's just not a singer that I'm all that enthralled by but if you like this record you know I understand it you know I definitely see the the mayor behind the cell but definitely not as sloppy as the Internet's albums tend to be way better produced definitely slick but it really is not for me I consider myself to be a casual fan of Hunter hunt Hendrix's work because I love liturgies music so much at least some of their music some of their back catalogue so I was curious to try out this little collaborative project over here with mr. M Lamar and I don't know like its unique but it doesn't really strike me as being all that good but you know maybe it's kind of a different strokes for different folks situation you know this thing it has some really tense fluttering piano arpeggios all over like really really dramatic and theatrical and then my Mars vocals kind of top those with these really weird vocals that seem somewhat operatic but he doesn't quite have the chops for opera so it's kind of like this weird amateurish I don't know version of an opera singer I don't quite know how to explain it it's weird it is ah I don't think I'm the kind of return to it again but it was a unique experience it was a unique experience I'm not going to tell you not to like this I mean I certainly see the merit in what the men zingers are doing on this album and I have enjoyed some of their music that's come out in the past but but this release just kind of struck me as being really kind of commonplace as far as pop punk standards go if you've been following the channel you know I like the music of the band off so when the band's frontman Tim Darcy announced that he was going to come out with a full-length solo album I was pretty excited but I don't know I was kind of disappointed to hear that his neurotic weird quirky singing style doesn't really translate to the whole singer-songwriter thing all that well the tunes aren't really there either I don't think it was just a bit of a letdown in my opinion but you know hopefully ops next record is still hella good this is such a weird follow-up to their last album like prior to this I may have not been a Japan droid fan but at least I sort of saw why other people found the band exciting you know they're youthful energy they're electrifying performances they're sort of Punk edge but now with this new record they're just combining that sound but they're softening it they're sort of dulling the edge and fusing it with like this really kept boring Heartland rock I don't know why there's so many artists out there that want to sound like Bruce Springsteen now I mean Bruce Springsteen is great but I don't know I don't really see Bruce or sort of copying Bruce or borrowing from Bruce as being this thing that's going to pull rock out of the rut that it's kind of dug itself into in this decade all I'm saying is that I think we could do better what am i listening to I heard this just five minutes ago and I cannot remember not a lick and not a not a single second of it I can't remember not a say it's the most by the numbers post-punk revival ISM I've heard in a long time how anybody could hype this I have no idea what is it with the vocals on this thing they are so nasal and they are so lifeless and they're so emotionally flat that it's like surfer blood doesn't even care if you can audibly hear that they're just phoning it in on this album session have you given this series of albums oh listen in this in this while you know review if you have what did you think as you loved them hate them why and all sorts of relevant links next to my head other videos subscribe to the channel official website make sure you eat your fruits and vegetables drink lots of water and I'll see you in the next video forever 
Mr-kmKlveg8,ah hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go into what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week goddamn was this a busy week so many tracks some of them even slipped by me some of them I didn't even make into this segment because there were just so many songs to mention so many songs to talk about this just was a huge week for singles before we get into the tracks I want to say the shirts that we've been selling that they are gone they are sold out but everybody who bought a shirt your your shirt is getting processed your shirt is coming soon I chose the vinyl winners of the people who bought shirts Logan from Michigan and Hannah from Ohio you are getting I'm sending out some copies of Death Grips EP the the interview 2016 EP and I'm sending out a copy of street sex latest album so there you go so those records are on the way Amazon Associates link down there in the description so if you want to support this segment if you live in the u.s. hit that link anything you buy on Amazon we get kick back from it does not add to your overall price and finally I want to mention of a symbol app who are sponsoring this video very soon this coming weekend actually not this weekend now this coming weekend I'm going to be doing an AMA on the app I believe I probably should be doing it on like Friday night or Saturday more details to come follow me on the app over there at the needle drop account over here you could see the picture of the account here and make sure to get the app a link down there in the description it's great place where you can share music kind of formatted and looks a little bit like Instagram but you're sharing songs and talking about music on there rather than just kind of simply you know sharing pictures so you know it's good music sharing app get that freaking app follow me over there am a coming soon over there on the app and yeah so stay tuned stay tuned on that info now let's get into the tracks okay let's rip the band-aid off and get into the worst tracks of the week first I'm going to kick things off with the new Remy Ma song another one yet another Nicki Minaj diss a lot of people earlier like a week ago were really hot over her she thir track which was also a Nicki Minaj disc didn't talk about in one of these segments but I'll kind of talk about these two tracks here and now both of these songs are really boring really tired in my opinion if these songs were about anybody else everybody and their mom would be reacting to this like Oh her bars do not sound that good her performances weak doesn't sound like she practiced this beat is old as fuck I have not heard anybody rap on this beat since like 2006 but I'm not from New York if you're from New York you probably hear this beat at least twice a day but from anybody who's not from from New York you may not even know where the fuck this beat comes from but this beat is oldest fucking dirt so I'm not I'm not into hearing anybody rap over this beat in 2017 number one and aside from the lines about Nicki Minaj's popped ass there's nothing really all that exciting about the track it's a pretty mild dis song you know what the problem with today is that this tracks are so subliminal this tracks are so implied this tracks are so kind of hidden and in the shadows that when somebody actually hears someone mentioned someone by name it's like whoa whoa whoa and with that being the standard anybody can drop a hot diss track you know what I'm saying so this one I don't really think it's that great of a diss track especially this new track over here another one I think is even weaker this beef is already tired as fuck Nicki Minaj is not going to respond she's on another completely different relevancy level than Remy Ma at this point there's no relief there's really no need for her to respond and she writes pop rap you know it's not like she's down there in the underground in the grime you know uh fraternizing with the battle scene and the way that Remy Ma is Nicki Minaj is just writing chart-topping stuff so if she doesn't respond I'm not going to be surprised it's probably not going to happen though again I just think some of those bars about her ass were funny but uh you know beyond that there's not really much too exciting about these tracks you know just kind of seems like a case of people having a warped perspective of diss songs because it's been a while since we've had some good ones but but going on from there we have a new track from a band by the name of these nuts these guys are bringing rap rock back with a vengeance it is giving me PTSD style flashbacks of my days in the late 90s and the early 2000 and I want it to stop please but you know if you're looking for something that you can listen to a little ironically please give this a shot moving on from there Thundercat has a bonus track off of his latest record titled high you have to be high to wanted to make this track with Mac Miller because you know it's a nice smooth sweet slightly improvisational jet you know jazz fusion a little a little piece but Mac Miller singing on this thing is terrible totally understand why it would not make it onto the record Mac Miller fans are probably crazy for it but the singing not good the lyrics even worse yeah I mean I was underwhelmed by some of the record by some amount of bucks by some of Thundercats album really happy this track is not an official album track really happy it's a bonus track but moving on from there that's not even the worst track a week that would be handed off to little Uzi vert quavo and Travis Scott the song go off which is going to be on the new fast and furious sound track this track is trash this is such this is such garbage like all of their lyrics seem like they were written by the marketing team over fast and furious because it's just it's just so many stupid bars without racing and being in your car and getting to the finish line it's such promotional bullshit and the B is bland as hell the vocals are so processed so there's no flavor there's no there's no body to any of the vocal this song is garbaggio like it's been a while since I've heard a rap song that was this trash that was you know basically just a commercial for a movie you know it's I guess I guess a lot of the tracks on the Suicide Squad soundtrack were pretty bad because they kind of suffered from the same problem but this is even worse like at least some of the songs on the on the Suicide Squad soundtrack were a little edgy this track over here is pure commercial like trash that that would perfectly fit into a shitty movie about cars racing around but I I digress so there you go worst track of the week in my opinion let's move on to the tracks that I wanted to mention wasn't crazy about but they weren't terrible kind of meant on these tracks Chaz bundok meets the Matteson to disco kid it's not bad I mean I'm not really all that crazy about what it sounds like these guys are doing on this collaborative project so far from the teaser tracks just kind of sounds like some swanky funky instrumental music from the late 70s early 80s it's okay it's it's alright you know it's it's it's played well it's produced well certainly captures the nostalgia of that era but there's nothing really all that urgent or exciting about it but it's it's listenable it's listenable moving on from there six organs of admittance adoration song this is a nice very funky spacey kind of ballad that I thought was okay dial 666 8100 goober split to Gatwick this is a new electronic single out on Ninja Tune records kind of funky kind of funky little textured got a bit of a techno vibe to it but again not not really all that fiery or exciting in my opinion but it's got a good groove to it the shins painting a hole the shins continue to come out with songs that would have that would have been shoulder to shoulder with some of the bolder artists of the 2000 when it comes to the indie side of things the shins for whatever reason ten years ago were coming out with some of the sleepiest music in indie now it seems like they waken up in there like hey man we're come out with really edgy indie stuff and it's it's kind of just like 10 years too late back when there were bands that were way more interesting than you guys you guys are writing stuff that sounded like you wanted to take a nap and now all of a sudden you want to be wolf parade now all of a sudden you want to be modest Mouse now all of a sudden you want to be one of those you know edgier sort of like yeah man we're right up B in your face in these stuff and it's just like why now why now why when this sound is at its least relevant do you decide to wake up and do something kind of lively it's it's okay I certainly like it more than a lot of that sleepier stuff they put out back in the day but it just seems like a little - it just seems like too little too late I guess moving on Lord greenlight it's not terrible but I'm officially not excited for this Lorde album now because even though her vocals do still have a somewhat unique quality to them it sounds like over this really generic dance pop instrumental Lord is giving up what has made her music at least you know slightly left field of most of what comes out in the mainstream most of what seeps into the top 40 this just seems so much more Louis cannot a common denominator it just seems so much more commercial just seems so much more formulaic than what she has done up until this point which is kind of odd considering that when she originally dropped her last album so many artists out there were copying her I think there was still an opportunity for her to continue in trailblaze forward in such a way and continue with the sound that she had because everybody wanted to do what she was doing you know for at least a couple years because her sound was so popular her sound was so hot and now it seems like she's turned around and watered her sound down for something to achieve something that's just way less memorable when in fact you know she could have continued leading the way and influencing her contemporaries instead she's doing the opposite I think on this track Mike will made it has a new track out titled Gucci on my with 21 savage yg amigos this is kind of one of those very stripped back very minimal pop raps and that are okay you know it's not one of the more amazing ones that I've ever heard you know certainly I like each guest verse on this track it's okay you know even twenty-one savage sort of comes on and does his thing but the BI didn't really you know feel all that enamored with and the hook to felt kind of lifeless you know if you're going to come out with the song it's this quiet that's this laid-back the hook has got a fuckin pop and this Gucci on my hook is is not really all that great so I think the song kind of falls flat on its face a little bit but I can sort of appreciate what they were going for moving on from there deadmau5 has a track out called hacks Pig now that has a bit of an 8-bit vibe to it from a new project that sort of seems to imply that this is like older stuff of his could be totally wrong on that but I think this track is really fun quirky has some fun melodies on it too so check that out and Coldplay has a new single out hypnotized that's a decent you know it's okay definitely not one of the worst songs have heard from them in a while but you know it's one of their spacey Airy very ethereal ballad type songs something that sounds like it could have been on ghosts but slightly more enjoyable pile as a new track out called leaning on a wall which I only place in this section of the segment because it's just such a winding twisting emotionally heavy song that I'm yet just fully make heads or tails of I haven't quite decided if I think it's like messily arranged or if everything comes together in this really epic climactic emotionally powerful way could be either/or you know I do give it to these guys on the lyrics they seem to tell a very serious and heavy story in the song and it seems like they're getting ambitious you know they're not just simply kind of that experimental rock post-hardcore kind of punky boston band anymore especially on this song seems like they're writing something that's almost kind of progressive in a way so if you're if you're into that band make sure to check this track out don't let it slip by you and we will finish this segment off with a few more panther new prints has an ambient version of the song islands in the sky from his last record apparently he's coming with a record of ambien versions from that album and this it sounds pretty sweet on the ears very pleasant moving on from there we have new track from the drums called blood under my belt seems like the drums have kind of taken a few steps back on the production end of things this track sounds really Hollow not really a whole lot of weight or punch to it unfortunately still has kind of that post punky sound but it seems like the band is completely refused to progress at all on this new track I sort of wonder if there's going to be any reason at all this sort of you know keep track of where the band is going next because it seems like they've totally rejected the idea of progressing or trying something new and finally the beach fossils another band that sort of has that kind of twangy in the surf rock sort of sound but maybe not quite as much on this new track over here I have a new single out that it's titled this year kind of underwhelmed by it because it seems like they've completely embraced the dream pop side of their sound while just tossing the whole post-punk vibe in the garbage which I think gave them a little bit of edge over a lot of the bands that we're doing kind of that dreamy Beach rock thing now it just sounds a little a little too bland in my opinion it's not a terrible track but nothing all that exciting about it let's move into what I felt were the best tracks of the week favourite tracks for the week quite a few songs to dish out to you guys over here Sharon Van Etten has a wonderful Skeeter Davis cover of the song the end of the world which is absolutely beautiful wonderful just dreamy dreamy dreamy and spacious ballad Sharon's vocals do this track loads of justice love the sort of vintage melody of the song - that she does a lot of justice as well future islands in their typical driving very passionate synth pop fashion have a new track out titled ran which is awesome as fuck lots of energy lots of again fire to fire and the band's lead singer runs like a motherfucker throughout the music video here pretty much showing us how he stays in fighting fit when he's going out on stage and swinging those shoulders and you know showing off you know that that amazing that amazing you know Peck piece that he has over here very wide chest awesome shoulders that guy is built moving on from their father John misty has another very lyrically sharp piece of music teasing toward his new album this track is a panel rock vibe to it that I thought was really good a total entertainment forever loving this track a lot this band called succumb has a new track out coming up through and teasing toward a new album on the phlegm sir this track is titled survival and it's an awesome mix of death metal black metal punk and post hardcore it's just a lot of genres sort of coming together in a way that I haven't quite heard them twisted before of course there are a lot of bands mixing the sound mixing these worlds together deafheaven being one for example you know like there's a lot of groups out there sort of pulling the other the post rock world the black metal world the death metal world the punk world and these guys sort of seem to be taking a slightly different approach with it sounds really aggressive it's a little more on the metal end of the spectrum but those are those very primal and those very sort of chest-beating punk elements are definitely there in the mix so liking that a lot HM ltd or formerly known as happy meal unlimited this really great wonderful post-punk band that I've been enamored with ever since I heard their last single has a new music video in single out titled to the door and this is like some crazy fucking like old-school public image limited or old-school Bauhaus or old-school the pop group like there's something really frightening and freaky and off-the-wall about how these guys come together with this post-punk sound that I like a lot and there a few passage in the passages in this song where they go into a weird sort of electronic thing like there's definitely something contemporary about it it's not just an exercise in nostalgia and the band's energy the band's look the bands sort of will the sort of poke and prod uh I guess kind of uh sexual taboos and stuff and their lyrics and in this music video that they just come out as a really fucking sharp and really out there really left-field loving house or draw that the band sort of comes off in edgy too I guess moving on from there adults I every single I hear from this forthcoming adult album I'm really liking it even though I was kind of skeptical going into it because each track features a different guest vocalist but every song I've heard so far is just like this really fucking dark very sharp and very like hard-nosed experimental dance techno shit with just crazy wild vocal performances over it and this song featuring Shannon Jess probably not pronouncing that correctly the song we chase the sound is no different so I don't know I hope they continue on this miss wave over here the album is just coming out just around the corner I believe and just really excited to sort of hear what it holds because again every track I've heard so far is fucking great moving on from their waves has two new tracks out titled you're welcome and Daisy surprisingly I really like this track or these tracks waves to me this is one of the better examples I've heard of kind of playing that punk sound playing that garage rock sound it's obviously got a rock sort of foundation to it but the way that Nathan produced the track the way that Nathan sort of included electronics into the track it sort of still has a visceral rock energy to it but it sounds fresher it sounds more modern it sounds like it's on to the next thing you know it sounds like he's doing something a little more adventurous with it which is great because you know I think we need more people in Rock taking risks trying new things trying to take contemporary sounds fuse it into the genre while keeping the original spirit of rock music you know not turning it into whatever crap imagine dragons are doing you know what I mean so it's great that Nathan is I think I'm doing this more than I think a lot of his contemporaries in rock music are even if some of the lyrics especially on Daisy they're a little corny you know Nathan's not the fuckin greatest leaders in the world but I like the sound of these tracks it sounds like he's doing something cool and certainly much fresher than you know a lot of what his past couple of albums have been like you know just like the grunge worship and all that you know it is it's so much better for him to be doing something that's a little bit more in the future than it is like hey let's let's just redo the fucking 90s you know uh uh look soso Pelle added waves on those two new tracks looming out from there Laura Marling has a beautiful new ballad out nothing not really do I want to say too much about it because they're new records coming out around the corner I really want to review it really excited about it think it could be her best think it could be her best because sound which she's putting out some of the best ballads that I've heard her drop as far as teaser tracks moving on from there Wesley Gonzales of let's wrestle Fame which a lot of people probably have not heard of the band let's wrestle they were this really great indie rock band from the UK for a while really funny quirky lyrics a lot of personality unfortunately when they came through with their sort of big commercial record it was a bit of a flop in my opinion but Wesley Gonzales the band's lead singer has come through the really sassy sort of solo piece with some driving sequence drums and some funny lyrics like everything that I liked about Les Russell's music is here but it's in more of a singer/songwriter context so I'm just I'm just enjoying what he's doing here and looking forward to sort of seeing if he can pull off a full album of this kind of stuff moving on from there white Reaper the world's best American band white Reaper in my opinion has never been like one of the most standout bands out there in the scene like they've always had kind of a bit of a run-of-the-mill garage punk sound to their to their music though I have liked some of their tracks in the past but this new song over here has a bit of a hard rock edge to it from the late 70s in the early 80s and the energy on the track is great the grooves and the guitar lines on the track are sharper seems like there's a better focus on the lyrics and just the hook writing like the band is writing something that has like a bit of an old soul to it but they kind of still have that grimy garage edge to it you know the sort of bring in the past into the future a little bit on this track I like the energy of the song I like the writing of the song and I like that this title of the track was almost like a challenge for them to write a song that was kind of in this bombastic arena rock like tone but of course you know still kind of keeping that punk vibe in the song and I like the track al I think it's one of the best singles would come through with in a while so if they can come through with an album that maybe it doesn't all sound the same as this but you know it's taking risks sort of in the same vein or you know it's coming through with a bit more of a unique energy to it that'd be fantastic could be really exciting to hear the band sort of them you know try something new on the source coming record moving on from there the band's soul stuffier has a new album coming out very soon typically they're doing a bit of a sludge metal thing they have a post rock thing this track I'm not quite sure how to categorize it honestly there's a lot of stuff going on here I mean the drumbeats kind of danceable the vocals are super passionate the instrumentation the rock instrumentation is pretty grand it's epic but also straightforward it's danceable but you know it's not just kind of this happy-go-lucky kind of thing like there's some serious urgent passion to the song to again very hard to define sounds like they're playing with so many different things at once but yet it all comes together so well so I'm just going to leave it at that I'm excited to hear if the band you know can effectively pull together even more surprising raises sounds on on their forthcoming record and finally I'm going to shout out the new Los Angeles Police Department track morgue which is a beautiful elegant piece of piano pop great ballad there and very fun smoky music video that pairs with that I thought was pretty good and that's it guys those are the best and worst tracks with Lee I told you guys a lot of fucking tracks this week this is a big week for tracks hopefully a next week I don't have to load you guys down with as many songs but I thought I came through with a lot solid

Mark kozilek but a very fulfilling very thoughtful very um emotionally traumatic at points to album and and I think um you know sort of goes into a lot of the weird personality quirks of Mark kozilek as an artist in a really intriguing way he spent some interesting narratives here spend some interesting yards he goes through the kind of spoken word rock instrumental playing in the background formula that he was toying with on universal themes here as well but I think he does more interesting things with it he even dabbled in like a little bit of hip hop all the things some of the some of the songs do border on him like rapping it's kind of interesting a lot of a cool clashes of musical styles coming together on this album in a way that actually kind of complements each other in a way that's actually kind of boundary-pushing I would say yeah it's a really adventurous record really like this album from mark I think he bounced back from his past few kind of lackluster releases even if some in the music community don't seem to think so I'm really enamored with this album moving out from there also loved the brand new album from Santha process sampans debut full-length album it was a long time coming but very well worth the wait considering how passionate how beautifully orchestrated and perform and sung these songs are it's very futuristic very cutting edge soul and alternative R&B you know that sort of James Blake similarity is most certainly still there in his vocal tone but I think Santa's sort of proven himself to be a different sort of a composer a different songwriter on this record also a very different lyricist as well a very sad album very moody album I'm going to say you know this is not an upbeat record there's not a feel-good album it's not an album that you want to put on when you're trying to lighten the mood but I do actually think it is a very beautiful record I think it's a very heart-wrenching record definitely one of the better singer-songwriter records we're going to most likely hear this year and also I want to give a shout out to the new quality crisp album being you was great I wish I could be you more often a really introspective hip hop album probably the most introspective I've heard a hip hop album get in a while really conceptual - and quality Chris manages to sort of go to some real emotional depths while maintaining sort of the cynical funny tongue-in-cheek really clever personality that made his past releases so good and I'm going to leave it at that I want to shout out a couple other releases here they didn't make it on my love list but certainly I would still recommend them the new power trip album nightmare logic really quality thrash metal album with kind of an old-school underground sound really aggressive really in your face really badass the new Jessica hoop album one of the most skeletal and stripped back and simple but also beautiful singer-songwriter records I heard in February and as the new John Wayne album rap album - which is disheveled and is disorganized as it is that album reaches some serious emotional depths as far as hip hop goes and God the opening track is just so goddamn killer I would try to sell them out just for that opening track TED talk if you listen to any track on me I listen to that track and blue green - that that's that's a really powerful song but those are all downs I want to recommend in this video links and everything like I said down there in the description box thanks for watching hopefully you get some good recommendations out of this and you are the best transition have you given this set of albums that I recommended on to you a listen I hope you have it if you haven't links down there in the description box you're the best and tuan fan tuan of other links next to my head make sure you hit those subscribe to the channel official website to eat your fruits and vegetables forever 
i1UVfTixFKw,okay yeah music is awesome hey everyone King fatigue scandal here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new king desert and the lizard wizard album flying microtonal banana king gizzard is an Australian rock band fresh off one of the best albums and albums spot fresh off one of the best albums in their discography nonagon infinity just dropped last year a blood pumping mix of garage and punk and psych Rock that at the very end of the album seamlessly loops back into itself creating a nonagon infinity and from track to track the album is pretty seamless as well now for a while now king gizzard has been one of those bands that goes into an album with a concept to challenge an idea like on quarters or they're all acoustic album paper mache dream balloons now apparently flying microtonal banana is going to be one of four or five albums the band releases this year and the concept or the going experiment on this album is that the band are working with microtonal instruments microtonal tuning on this album exploring the pitches that you don't often hear hiding between the tones and semitones in the chromatic scale which in terms of musical style and structure might not be that big a deal on a king gizzard album because there are a lot of elements of king gizzard sound i imagine could stay roughly the same while embarking on this musical experiment but I do go into this album interested to hear if this experiment pushed the band in any new and refreshing directions with their music because I wasn't necessarily getting that hint from the lead single to this album rattlesnake a track that I really like but for the most part this song dishes out a lot of the very tense groovy jammy punky psyche rock that was so great about King gizzards last album but the melodies sort of follow that microtonal sound and are really jerky and sour and odd but thankfully the risks that the band takes on album don't just stop there the band starts pushing themselves pretty far outside of their comfort zone on tracks like melting a track whose very spicy keyboards and rhythm section take on kind of a Latin flavor and it's pretty awesome that the band is able to stick to this musical experiment stick to this microtonal experiment while transporting the band's sound transporting the band's music to an entirely different continent and when the band isn't doing this there are other tracks on the album where it seems like they're toying with middle-eastern melodies like on tracks such as Billabong Valley maybe not as satisfying as some of the longer tracks on the album but I do like the change of pace the song provides the vocals are a lot clearer and straight forward making the lyrics very readable and the lyrics actually tell a tale of a guy named Mad Dog Morgan who was an Australian folk hero and bushranger outlaw type gives the track a really gritty vibe and again I love the desert melodies that the band complements this story with but again these lyrics are kind of the exception to the rule on this album most of the time the vocals on this record take on this very dreamy droning tone which was present on King geezers last album I'm not all that crazy about it but I think it pairs well with the really tense Restless jams that the band embarks on on this record because it sort of creates this interesting juxtaposition where the songs are simultaneously sleepy but also just really really amped because the drums are so crisp the guitars are so driving case in point the song sleep drifter which features these cycling hypnotic guitar leads really alluring I kind of get the same vibe off of the song energy fairly new as well except the intro to that track is way more quirky I think the beat is much more danceable to the band throws in a few bombastic tracks to kind of break up the track listing as well like open water probably the craziest jam on the entire record I love the driving tremolo pick qatar leads on this thing they sort of create this wall of sound this drone hanging in the background over just the loudest drums on the entire album that bookend each passage of the track with these really dramatic drum fills also this is one of the few times on the album where the band intensifies the performance intensifies their sound with these really loud just we read instruments that are just wild as fuck this also creates a highlight on the song boom city to the really trippy closing track which is very chill very laid-back is decent too I will say the one downside of the album is that the second half I think starts revealing a very clear and plain formula that the band is approaching these songs with with this micro tonal experiment you do have a lot of moments on the record where the band's instrumentation the background just kind of jams and hangs out in one single key while all this melodic microtonal mayhem happens on top of the rhythm section the band does a somewhat decent job of writing choruses or alternative passages like on tracks such as doom City that at least break that up a little bit but it's still pretty clear that I think they could have taken this microtonal experiment a little further as far as the rhythm instrumentation the chord progressions on the album still though I think King gizzard with this record is continuing the creative streak that they've been on for a while now because this is something that could have been so indulgent in one-dimensional of a record but instead whether you're aware of what microtonal tuning or micro tonal music is this is a really fresh fun enjoyable very peppy very exciting and intense sight Garage experience hopefully the next album that they dropped later this year provides another experiment another concept another idea because I do have the sneaking suspicion that they really drove this concept to its limits or at least the limits that the band would push it to I'm not sure if dipping down again into this well will provide another great record not unless the band started to really revamp how they structure and compose their songs but I guess we'll see since I'm guessing a good deal of the material on these three or four albums that are forthcoming hasn't even been finished yet I'm feeling a like decent 8 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate to get a best year the best so should I review next have to like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry

8grYlwFrN9o,hi everyone here dominicano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time to check and make sure the microphone is on and guess what it's on it's also time for a review of the new Dirty Projectors album itself titled this is the latest incarnation of the long beloved sound II and experimental music project the Dirty Projectors spearheaded by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist mr. David long stress now continuing Dirty Projectors as a solo venture after the departure of the band's rhythm section and it's star vocalists angel Dara Dorian and amber Kaufman the latter of whom David was romantically involved with when she joined the band and this album is that I guess kind of a musical and artistic reflection on the demise of that romantic relationship its breakup album its breakup album everybody get get ready for critical acclaim across the board but this record is not just David rising from the ashes like a phoenix in the romantic sense also in the musical sense because david has taken this opportunity to completely overhaul the sound of Dirty Projectors not only with some pretty public statements on how Indies so old and out of touch and passe and isn't providing anything in terms of context or meaning in these troublesome and very bad and boozy times all of this was covered pretty heavily in the music press but also with the teaser tracks leading up to the release of this new album which had David pointing in the direction of alternative R&B which in a way is not really all that surprising because David seems pretty focused on keeping up at the times he also had some spectacular musical input on that solange album a seat at the table that dropped not too long ago though still I was pretty skeptical of David taking the Dirty Projectors sound in this direction on this new album I remember reacting pretty negatively to the song keep your name when I first heard it thinking the way that he kind of pitched his vocals lower throughout much of the track was is just being a little gimmicky but after hearing full scope of David's vision on this entire record I have to say that this thing is one of the more refreshing albums to drop in this musical style this decade maybe not the most challenging feat considering that 80% of alternative R&B right now are just people who are ripping off the weekend but David does a pretty good job on this album of translating his very eclectic musical and lyrical style into the very smooth and sensual and sweet sounds of R&B he also makes sure to add plenty of odd experimental quirks into the production - it's a good balance of weird and gorgeous and emotionally moving and moving the genre forward because on this album David effectively carves out a little niche for himself in this genre on his first try there are a few points where I think some of his songwriting or production comes off a bit bland or succumbs to the trendiness of the sound that he's playing in like the track winner take nothing probably the least risky song on the entire record David even indulges in these old commercial R&B like vocal harmonies here and there on the track that sound a little goofy and despite being reduced down to one piece David still insists on incorporating these chirpy vocal harmonies into his compositions on his songs but the thing is he's recording those vocals now it's not amber and Angel and while it's still compositionally interesting hearing one David long stress layered over another again and again and again on a single track considering how idiosyncratic his voice is it does get a little grating like on the song dead spiral the song work together is equally gaudy with its vocal layering and the synth bass and the percussion patches on this thing they're so flat they're so dry it sounds like he didn't really put any effects on them it just sounds like the product of some SoundCloud bedroom producer I just wish some of the beats and some of the scents on the thing we're a bit more dynamic had more sonic depths to them and the auto-tune that David puts on his vocals on ascent through clouds does his voice no favors whatsoever it's just a gimmicky sound that adds nothing to the song itself as the first third of the track is this Baroque folk ballads it's very pretty and sounds like something that could have been one of Dirty Projectors to past albums after this passage in the song we kind of get these weird glitchy driving beats and vocalizations that sound very James Blakey and I appreciate the vocal acrobatics but again this is one of the moments on the album where I feel like David succumbs to the trend that he's playing in a little bit but outside of these tracks I would say the rest of the album is really well written very inventive and beautiful I love the reggae undertones of the song cool your heart with Dawn her vocals add a lot to the track I like the chirpy organs on the song that sort of emphasised the upbeat meanwhile this is all this polyrhythmic mayhem going on underneath which is occasionally interrupted with these stuttering glitchy Kirk it's an odd sound but Dave and Don's vocals do a lot to warm the instrumental up and just make it sound really pretty with all these expresses passionate vocals also the funky drum bridge on this track sounds like something off of a tune-yards album it's very fruity it's very tropical while also sounding like it's from another dimension the organs on the song I see you take on more of a gospel tone I would say Dave's voice also kind of steps in that direction I love that after all these very sad and personal and emotionally traumatic songs Dave kind of finishes the record off on a bit of a high note especially after heartbreaking tracks like little bubble where the lyrics are especially gripping on this track David kind of reflects on the love that he had with amber as being like this enclosure being this double being this refuge that is gone now and he's very sentimental about it too as these things about having his own little boo boo Flula and I love the many musical passages and flavors of this song too there are beautiful acoustic guitar passages on this thing that melt into these digital chords these synthetic sound scapes than these other passages with these charming piano chords that are matched with like these weird tinny distorted drones the song up and Hudson is a great single on the album beautiful vocal harmonies at the start that melt into some wonderful orange sections and the track goes into a very cute story of how David and amber meant how she joined the band how they had other girlfriends and boyfriends at the time and they dropped all of that to be together one thing I think that's sort of interesting and unique about this breakup album is there's not even really a hint of bitterness to it I mean there are certainly some very sad points on it but Deva doesn't really go into the Nitty Gritty of what made their relationship dysfunctional for the most part he seems to look back on it in a very positive light even on the song keep your name where he seems to be directly addressing the romantic and also creative differences that he and amber seem to be having as they were working on the same musical project together and this track even warmed up to me a little bit as I listen to the album more and more I sort of got past what I felt like and still kind of feel like are the gimmicky lead vocals what made the track shine for me are not only the beautiful melodies and the great chord progression of the track but also some of the lyrics on here I love the the one moment where David says what we imagined and what we became and this idea of leaving sort of this relationship I guess the romantic and the creative relationship keeping your name whether I guess sort of that's in the sense of getting married together or sort of being in a different musical project or something it's a really haunting track especially as David sings parts like what I want out of art is truth what you want is Fame probably the closest David comes on this album to like LA being a critique at the other person or maybe he's singing from her standpoint I'm not really sure there's also a weird rap passage on the track that I'm not entirely sure I'm all that into not just because I don't care for the sound of it but I'm not really all that enamored with the lyrics on this part my body said that you we can still though overall I think this is a good album I think it's an entertaining album I think it's a sweet beautiful intriguing album very personal record a good return for Dirty Projectors and an admirable attempt at trying something new I still think there are some kinks to work out if David's going to continue in this style which I kind of doubt he's going to I mean I once this trend is out and it's become passe David will most likely move on to something else which is fine not necessarily anything wrong with that not necessarily anything wrong with this change in style because even as David has attempted to play within the world of alternative R&B on this record a lot of his compositional quirks a lot of his lyrical quirks as I said from his past records from the Dirty Projectors you know typical sound carried over onto this album in a really obvious way in a way that if you are a Dirty Projectors fan this is still very recognizably a David long stress out with all that being said I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry if you're mad at this reviews I don't see why you would be I mean it's a pretty good album I think it's pretty good though I do foresee it being a polarizing album I mean they're going to be a lot of Dirty Projectors fans you hate this thing and I think there will be some though who enjoy it and there's also the potential for newcomers to come along and you know sort of enjoy what David is doing but I digress all sorts of links next to my head other videos subscribe to the channel official website to your the best forever 
9NliOip-0tY,yeah yeah hi everyone raised in each age scale here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for your review of the new power Swift album nightmare logic power trip is a dallas texas band this is their second album it's also their second album for Southern Lord records I once caught these guys down a South by Southwest where they did one of the most badass spin kick worthy sets I had heard all that week but then it was a little letdown once I actually heard their debut album and found that the recording was nowhere near as powerful as the live show mostly because I thought some of the tracks on here sounded a little washed out a little too reverb II even though I kind of understood that the sound came with the territory the band was playing in this underground 80s crossover thrash style and that's still kind of the case on this new album over here it's very atmospheric but the guitars and the drums are a little heavier has a bit more clarity to them the vocals more upfront the lyrics are actually readable at some point and even though the band has this newfound clarity on this album they're still bringing a pretty old-school sound I was instantly reminded of another thrash revivalist album that I had reviewed recently that new iron Reagan album crossover ministry by comparison that album is much more modern much more cleanly produced way punchy er way heavier way more compressed all good things but also things that led to the album feeling kind of one-dimensional power trip sound by comparison is not as cleaned up it's way more raw it's a little smudgy ER and I think the end result in a way is a little better because the band manages to capture this wild relentless energy that made so many of those crossover thrash records from the 80s and 90s oh good even if the final result is kind of old fashioned now even though on this record we are hearing a blend of thrash metal and hardcore punk tower trip does not bring the political commentary or the sense of humor or the punk attitude that a lot of those thrash crossover bands did instead powertrip try to give their music as dark and it's gruesome a presentation as humanly possible in a way kind of reminds me of that band toxic Holocaust that's the only other thrash metal contemporary I could think of that has a similarly devilish sound power trip sound comes more from the depths of hell than it does from the mean streets of LA or New York from a bunch of guys wearing jean shorts and bandanas all that being said power trip I still think has a ways to go to hammer out a distinct sound in this genre of music in a way that almost seems to be the point with how meat-and-potatoes the bands approaches on this album but unlike most thrash revivalists that i hear these days I wasn't completely underwhelmed by this album it was pretty exciting from front to back loads of adrenaline loads of blood loads of guts splattered in every direction the performances on this thing are electrifying from the enraged vocals even if they are a little ordinary the drums do a fantastic job of just pushing propelling the instrumentation on top of them like a semi going full speed with the brake lines cut and the guitarists all over this thing are awesome they have this groovy chunkiness to them that reminds me of some of Anthrax's best releases from back in the day but of course these guitarists are executed with the speed and aggression that only a punk could love the guitar solos are pretty good for the most part and powertrip don't really give themselves enough time on this album to really get boring or where they're welcome this thing is just 33 minutes long which is spread across eight tracks and pretty much every song takes the same blitzkrieg songwriting style the song ruination for example with the exception of a few spots to sort of just give some breathing room to build tension until the next onslaught of riffs and drums this track does not let up this song will do to a mosh pit what a giant canister of gasoline will do to a wildfire which is much the case for the rest of the tracks on this album - most of which segue into each other pretty smoothly making this album a pretty seamless listen overall this album flows pretty well I love the sound I will the production I love the performances on this thing and the energy the band brings on here is just incredible even if on the whole this album is just a little run of the mill by thrash metal comparisons looking at the genre OMA feeling a light seven on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't die because if you die you can't watch my videos anymore power trip nightmare logic get this bitch on southern world records forever 
zPMU0w-XaPw,ladies and gentlemen this is my dramatically lit take on the new Thundercat album drunk Thundercat is a songwriter he's a bassist extraordinaire for the brain feeder Records label he's been one of their flagship artists for a while now I've been pretty enamored with his sound since he dropped the Golden Age of Apocalypse album and since then he's done a lot to win over fans with his amazing contributions to some of the latest records from Flying Lotus and Komatsu Washington Kendrick Lamar as well as the pressing people across the world with some amazing live performances in his music Thundercat is consciously conjuring the corniest sounds from jazz and electro funk and soul music from the 70s and 80s kind of reclaiming it in this self-aware way that's a little tongue-in-cheek but still pays homage to the sound this era of music though I will say the Thundercats last album apocalypse his last full-length album I think his last release was more of a mini album his last album apocalypse was really everything that was kind of lackluster about his music exaggerated to the point where I just could not enjoy the album at all everything from the lackluster vocals for the kind of flat hollow production and on this album I thought Thundercats sense of humor was kind of working against him which is actually not the case at all on drunk this record if anything makes us stand out in Thundercats discography it's that his vibrant personality and his gut-busting sense of humor are both on full display on nearly every track here whether beyond the song Tokyo where Thundercat is almost showing like some weeaboo type tendencies whether it be him singing about spending all of his cash on anime as he's hanging around in Tokyo or sort of calling back to a younger version of himself that found himself obsessed with Dragonball Z after getting a like a Dragonball Z wraparound bracelet he goes as far as to say that Goku ruined him which is actually one of the most hilarious spots on the album or the track captain stupido which is one of the album's openers which between calls of jesus take the wheel of thunder cat is singing about beating as me going back to sleep thinking that he might have left his wallet at the club it just kind of seems like a very lazy and ridiculous morning-after routine from a wild night out the song friendzone is about exactly that as Thundercat references playing Mortal Kombat and Diablo instead of I guess going out and pursuing this person who has thrown him into the friend zone and on the track bus in the streets he kind of reflects on technology losing his phone talking about how it's okay to disconnect from the internet sometimes the songs walk on by and lava-lamp in a lot of ways are very beautiful ballads you know there are a lot of lyrical and topical highlights all over the album some of which are very emotional very personal very touching others are really creative and out there and kooky the issue is though that Thundercats usual shortcomings on an album also carry over onto drunk maybe not as badly maybe they're not as pronounced because some of the writing and some of the lyrics are more entertaining more fun but Thundercats vocals are still really limited in terms of range and tone and emotional delivery after almost an hour of material that they do get kind of Ault after a while mother more monomer and the production and the mixing on this album still leaves a little bit to be desired like they were the product of just some fly-by-night bedroom recording session like on the track of fans mail I cannot be the only person who hears the crackling static on the drums at the very start of this track and throughout much of the song actually and it doesn't sound intentional and if it is intentional it does not sound good even though the lyrics on this track are hilarious and about being a cat and there are numerous calls of meow meow meow on the song these lyrics do very little to lighten the mood or the track inferno where the second half of this song features mostly just Thundercats very twanging oddly tone bass guitar and some very flimsy sequence drum patches that just don't add a lot of punch a lot of group and drunk also kind of presents a new issue and that's that we get a lot of material we get a lot of tracks on this album many of which just number between 1 to 2 minutes and are capped off with a sudden finish or some kind of suffocating fade-out it just seems kind of non-committal especially when you have a track late where I'm wrong where a quarter of the song is fade-out this makes the inclusion of the 30-second tracks from the track listing here even more confusing because what are we really taking an interlude from what are these short songs really providing in this ocean of short songs most of these tracks just kind of feel like filler don't leave a strong impression even if they are Jameel space ride which is one of the funnier songs in the entire track listing I just kind of feel like there could have been more potential here had it been made longer the features on this thing are kind of hit or miss Kendricks appearance on the song walk on by is okay I think he holds his own and adds to the lyrical subject of the track even though his flow is recycled straight off of to pimp a butterfly on the song show you the way Thundercat effectively balances his comedic sensibilities with his love of 70s Yacht rock with awesome appearances from Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins both of whom provide just great singing on this track I mean this track is really one of the better centerpieces of the entire album because he points right to his influences he points right to what inspires these types of songs that he pulls together on this album he does a great job of recreating this music I think he holds his own vocally on this track for the most part and I think it's pretty funny how before each guest sings on this track they're sort of introduced with applause and Thundercat saying is smuggling done but then frail is easily the most forgettable feature on the entire album far from a showstopper and Wiz Khalifa sounds as corny as ever on the song drink debt where he just drops one more of already many generic by the numbers hey let's get high rap verses this album while I liked the aesthetic of it and I liked the tone of it as I was sort of embarking on my initial listens the more I listen to it and the more I paid attention to what I was listening to the more all over the place and messy the album kind of fell between all the filler tracks and the odd features the Moody jazz funk instrumental set against lyrics like I don't care what you say so many feels bro lol I'm so over it because nothing is real thundercats very limited singing voice and even his bass playing starts coming off a really formulaic after 50 minutes of material spread out across 23 tracks I think the quaint little ditty approach that he takes to some of the songwriting is occasionally cute on this album but it's the approach he takes with a majority of the tracks here and all the songs feeling much the same in musical tone emotional tone they all kind of drown each other out you know there are things that I like about this album but to be completely honest I'm not in love with this record but I can sit here without worrying about whether or not I'm going to hear from Thundercat again because his career his fame his popularity doesn't just hinge simply on whether or not he's come out with a great record a hit record a lot of the time it's about his great live shows it's about the stellar contributions that he provides to other people's records that keep his name in the mainstream keep people curious about his music so that could be part of why when he comes out with a record like this he doesn't feel the pressure to groom it to sound like a traditional album to flow like a traditional album he can just kind of do whatever he wants that sounds like what he's doing here for the most part I myself would have preferred something a little more developed a little more organized something where a lot of the fat that's in the tracklisting here was cut but it's still a pretty decent album I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry and because I know some of y'all are probably mad at my opinion on this album but I'm sorry it's how I feel just get just getting mad in the comments please don't threaten my life you're you're the best Thundercat drunk forever 
3kFmkDNp1fY,this new future album not good office not good segment off with an apology in my last future review I had come away from the album the self-titled record kind of indifferent and said future is one of the most uninventive and uninvent rappers and artists out there in hip-hop right now because he's so predictable he doesn't push himself outside his comfort zone he doesn't take any risks you know that the thing is he proved me wrong with this album and god I wish he didn't this this Hendrix album over here it brings us a little bit of context and a little bit of meaning to the self-titled record not only is that album again you know pretty uninvent respire standards but it's pretty one-dimensional album too with many of the songs being I guess of the more aggressive set that future usually puts together Hendrix is the sad syrupy smooth trying to be sexy soulful R&B flavored sister album two self-titled features going a little easier on this one this is a more sensual future he's singing a little bit more on this one the beats are a little bit more you know amis furyk prettier he's taking more of a ballot approach to some of these songs - there's just there's just one problem with that though by you did you I know these vocals might sound good in a world where habitually drinking cough syrup is a good idea but over here in reality that's what we call bad singing and that bad singing is all over this album it's one thing for future to mask the fact that he's a mediocre rapper by not only mumbling his lyrics so they're nearly indiscernible and then making his words even harder to decipher by slathering his vocals in auto-tune so you kind of get those horrible little manipulations as he kind of stumbles from one word to the next but the thing is the auto-tune doesn't hide the fact that he is not a good singer the way his voice strains and and sounds even goofier when he's a you know truly really trying to pull out those emotions man you know this is an entirely new future or anything I mean we've heard a more luxurious more sensual future in the past on songs like a rich sex and turn on the lights but this to my knowledge is the first time he's come together with a full project of songs that are in this style take this tone and this albums even longer than the last album future just dropped a week ago so this is over an hour of a more sexy passionate future the problem is when you dive into the lyrics on this thing features and really taking that different of a tone than he's taken with his past projects I mean maybe he's leaning a little harder on some of the you know love interests on this story but when he muses about these women who he meets with it's not like he is getting to know any of them significantly or at least he's not putting any details of that into these songs he's just kind of sleeping around playing the field which is cool but he tries to put this romantic veneer over it with all these really horrible clichéd lyrics that are not really that's awful case in point on the song hallucinating he routinely brags in the chorus here about a seducing women with Aston Martin's and Rolls Royces because God knows it's not his singing voice that's bringing them over also this lyric over here I could turn a stripper to a diva chinchilla honor that's a PETA my reviewers side of me doesn't really have anything to say about that but my inner vegan says fuck you but I'm not really that mad because the song sorry at the very end of the album I know this track is not about me but I took it as a personal apology for having heard the album all the way through and as long as we're talking about lyrics and future's more romantic side on this album take the attract my collection for example which kicks the album off which has a wonderful sentiment in the chorus talking about how if he has sexual relations with a woman essentially she becomes part of his collection it's a kind of stalker oh damn I miss I missed this gem over here standing on black socks meet me at the yacht dock I sand out the clock watch bitches on my cock what's even funnier is that this rap genius annotation seems to think this is clever whoa you said clock and watch in the same bar like a clock watch Jules on it iced out futures just a regular wordsmith case in point on the song damage we have a beautiful set of bars over here a couplet if shoe Hill I had sex in a whole week just so you can get to know me future putting off those sexual relations to sort of get to know this woman in a more emotional sense in a more intimate sense but then I guess they get right into the sex thing right after because in the in the following two bars future says douchey gosh so Sookie I put it in go so deep motherfuck how far you come over here and get the write-up I can't think of four words that would end sex faster than gushy gushy so Sookie if anybody's willing to you know take one for the team and do a bit of a social experiment in the middle of sex just gushy dish so Sookie or maybe if you write erotic fan fiction or something or you know some of those really hot and heavy romance novels and just the China was goosey goose so Sookie and this is what happens when future actually writes lyrics I mean we have other songs over here like fresh air for example the Sun is mostly refrain and chorus the verses are so short on this thing it's like he's barely even trying to write anything but you know that's the album from a lyrical perspective I guess future future the underrated lyricist so lyrically that the album's is really trashy and you know sonically I guess I can get behind some of the instrumentals but only if there was a better rapper or singer on them but think about future doing an album like this is that he's terrible at singing he's terrible at writing lyrics that invoke any kind of feelings of love or intimacy or romance or sensuality how his voice could even set the mood for anybody I don't know because so goofy I want to go to the research there's a lot longer to research there are a lot of imitrex there are a lot a lot of good readers responses honor me I will honor you truth be told future songs where he goes in this direction are some of his worst tracks some of his most boring tracks and he's decided to come out with those kinds of songs for over an hour which of course is going to make this his worst record this is not good it's not good transition have you given this album to listen you love I hate it what would you write here the best you're the best where should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just just get get angry in the comments if you're angry future Hendriks eat your fruits and vegetables forever

into the worst tracks of the week that you know with the this week was pretty easy on us we didn't have too many horrible tracks this week too many tracks that I couldn't stand but nonetheless the first one here is little disappointing was not expecting to dislike this track as much as I did however I didn't even anticipate this track was ever going to exist or this project this forthcoming project was ever going to exist but it was announced this week that apparently a ninja tune electronic music producer the bug is coming through with a full-length album with earth yes earth the the stoner rock band the doom metal band Dylan Carlson earth and I don't know that this first track was not a fantastic taster maybe sort of the wild noisy kind of droney guitar playing style of Dylan Carlson didn't compliment the bugs production all that much I don't know you know where exactly the problem lies is that Dylan Carl Carlson not playing to the bugs abilities all that well as the bug not sort of producing or sort of chopping up or editing the guitar playing into his production all that well III really don't know there Justin really seem to be that much chemistry that much of a meld the I really don't know where to go from here it just kind of falls flat on its face despite the fact that I respect both of these artists I was intrigued when I heard that this was going to happen but there was just nothing really all that exciting about this track in my opinion hopefully uh you know that there's something more exciting from it coming down the pipe but I have to be honest here just not really all that thrilled about what I'm hearing on this particular track moving on from there wale has a new track out titled fashion week it's super corny it's one of his popular tracks and it features G easy need i say more but really in my opinion what was the worst track of the week was this amazing new track from the chainsmokers and Coldplay Jesus Christ it's titled something like this and you know what's what's great about this track is that it allows Coldplay to do what the chainsmokers do and it allows the chainsmokers to do what what Coldplay does because really at the heart of the chainsmokers bland boring and lowest common common denominator EDM music what they really want to do is write pop it's it's really what they want to do they really want to be a band they really want to write pop music and Coldplay as evidence from their past couple of Records they're pretty tired of being a rock band they're pretty tired of being you know even a pop rock band they'd much rather be writing dance music electronic music so this allows them to both kind of you know dabble in what the other one is successful in and what the other one really wants to do but you know of course neither of them do it all that well so they're kind of just like you know coming out these bad songs together in collaboration it's a really trashy really boring pop song it seems like Chris Martin does his best to dumb down his lyrical abilities as much as possible just because he knows sort of the audience crossover potential here and the sort of you know lyrical tone that chainsmokers fans are used to you know and the thing is the lyric video of this thing it's even more shameful because you just read along they're chilly Oh God really really please Jesus Christ and most of the song didn't really sound like the chainsmokers had any influence on it up until the point where the dance beat sort of pops in but you know again there could have been a lyrical influence there too but I digress that is my probably my least favorite track of the week let's get into the songs that was sort of uh I guess indifferent tort but you know not really hating definitely want to suggest them to you guys first off I want to give a shout out to the new the new the new choreography for his song the world is of the theatre you know just a straightforward piece of power pop over here nothing really all that special to abide New Pornographers standards it's kind of sweet straightforward catchy you know really sharp lead vocals driving guitars it's an okay track you know again nothing all that new revolutionary about it moving on from there ARCA experimental electronic music producer ARCA who you probably heard much about over the past few years has a couple new tracks out this one titled a noche that I wanted to put a bit of a spotlight on but this is not the a glitchy almost undefinable electronic music style that we've heard from him in the past which is really difficult really challenging kind of confusing very abrasive very glitchy very moody very textured no the tracks that he's putting out now are like this really odd off-putting artpop with you know these very light kind of effeminate vocals which are kind of chilling I'm not completely sure what I feel about it whether I like it or dislike it but it is pretty strange it is very bold it is very in-your-face and I am kind of excited to hear how this song and many of the other songs of the songs of this style are going to hear sort of in context on a full-length record again not crazy about it but intrigued and just wondering how it's all going to sound on the album this track is pretty strange especially when you coupled the new sound with the music video that he's put together with it it is again a very bold change a very bold move a very bold sound moving on from there jamm baxter for a limited time only production from chemo on this one a jam baxter of high focus same comes through with one of them were moody singles I've heard him put together it's not a bad track not mind-blowing or anything but you know it's not a bad track nielsie Cerreta if you check out his Twitter account please put the @ sign for that up thank you he's put out like five different b-sides from his recent mouth sounds album which are pretty decent I could sort of understand why some of these tracks didn't really make the cut on the album some of them don't work quite as well as the songs that were on the record and this song over here that I'm mentioning Roxanne Midd is a wonderful revision of the police's Roxanne but with like MIDI instrumentation hanging in the background it's pretty funny moving on from there young thug with the song safe I guess in a way you could name the song that because it's one of suckers most safe singles that I've heard in a while there's nothing really all that new or refreshing about it unfortunately it seemed like or seems like after hearing this track maybe he's going to kind of cool it on the experimentation and the adventurousness that we heard on Jeffrey and you know sort of go back to doing what he typically does with his squeaky you know sort of kind of wild ELP vocals you know overt rap beats and you know how to beat kind of aggressive kind of melodic you know it's it's it's sort of sucker by the numbers and a lot of ways on this track you know wasn't really blown away by it or anything the music video is a little weird but you know whatever moving on from there at the drive-in with incurably innocent you know aside from the fact that the guitarists didn't really stand out to me on this track and the lyrics are slightly cringy uh I really didn't have any issue with this song it's an okay track didn't really blow me away as much as the first at the drive-in tracted from their upcoming album hopefully the rest of the album is exciting I really don't know what to say about this track it's not really all that refreshing and finally Calvin Harris slide featuring Frank Ocean and me ghosts this has been a huge track over the past couple days I mean there have been a lot of people I mean I came right out on Twitter and I was like I'm not really that crazy about this song I don't think it's terrible I don't think it's great but people would say hey man you you really you really gotta give this another shot this is a great song um I I disagree I mean sure it's not the usual kind of trash that Calvin that Calvin Harris comes out with but I think for Frank Ocean the song is kind of a step back this sounds like the kind of song he would have put out around channel Orange and I know a lot of people love channel orange but to me what he's doing on blonde is so much more interesting so much more progressive so much more cutting-edge what was happening on Channel Orange was a little bland er a little safer to me and that kind of seems like it seems like what this drag is going back in that direction and in my opinion me ghosts don't really add anything to the song you know maybe if they were rapping instead of trying to do their sing sing same thing and trying to be ultra melodic try to be sort of on that melodic level of Frank which you're not going to get there because Frank is way more capable singer than anybody in me goes in comparison if you try to sing on the same track as Frank you better be a fucking good singer nobody amigos is a good singer you know they hold their own on their own albums or when they're singing next to some other trap rapper who can't sing either but you know all the MIGO singing on this tractor sounds goofy so I don't know it's kind of a bland forgettable track in my opinion not really that great of a single but let me move into the best tracks of the week my favorite tracks of the week your old Ruge despite the lack of chemistry between between him and wiki on their last collaborative EP that they came out with has an amazing song with wiki and Eden this new track called help which has this kind of industrial noisy crazy off-kilter boom-bap grimy New York beat it sounds brand-new but has that sort of very clear New York roots in it and both their verses are great lots of energy lots of nastiness to the track that I think is great spoons new single can I sit next to you is funky and fun as hell maybe not as memorable as their last single but this one is certainly got a great groove to it a great beat to it great energy to it that I like a lot moving on from there night bringer with miss rule if you love kind of that big over-the-top very showy high-gloss production value of like the latest behemoth album you know and you're a black metal fan and I think you're going to like this song a lot because it's really powerful it's really heavy it's really dense it's really fucking epic there's you know just kind of this great great power seyton sort of flowing through the check it's actually pretty great moving on from there Shugo Tokumaru with lee taruta this is a fun little pop song over here that I like a lot and I highly want to recommend to you guys spend a while since I've been crazy for a poly vinyl records album and I'm hoping that that's the case I'm hoping the rest of the sounds as fun as it's tracked over here the mountain goats have a new track out Andrew L Duras is moving back to Leeds this is sort of an interesting track because on mountain goats band camp because I guess they're coming out this album via band camp it says that there are no guitars there are no guitars on this album I'm assuming because it says that on the album page so we're going to have a completely guitar list Mountain Goats album which if I'm correct I've been listening Mountain Goats for a long time that that has not happened that's not a thing so we're going to have a whole mountain goats album where it kind of sounds like this where maybe John Darnell is you know sort of wrapped up in these elegant string sections and it sounds very theatrical very dramatic and at first is when I was listening with this track I was not all that into it but then as I listened more and where I was like okay wait you know he sort of has and has had this very theatrical dramatic vocal style in the mountain goats music I think it kind of makes sense for them to sort of go in this direction at least for one album because for him to be singing over what sounds like maybe a mini Orchestra or something is again kind of sensible because that's just kind of his singing style like it could work in that context and it definitely sounds like it is on this particular track in my opinion so I'm pretty interested to see sort of where where they where they bring it from here and finally Buchan gates have a new PJ Harvey cover out for the song dress as part of that you know 100 days first 100 days of trumps presidency project and it's pretty good cover it's a nasty cover and of course it being Buchan gates they bring you know like that extra crunchiness that textural sort of aggression that you usually get on their albums with them playing the buek and the gates if you don't know who be you can guess are them look them up because they kind of made their musical duo their musical project after their self made instruments and it's pretty cool alright those are the best immersed tracks of the week that I want to shout out and again you know make sure to hit up that discogs app amazon associates link last week on t-shirts down there in description and i will see you guys in the next video thank you very much forever 
GUerNUwHLS0,hi everyone what happened last night what happened last night here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new yen's lek Minh album life we'll see you now this is the 4th full-length album from Swedish singer songwriter in blackman 5 years since his last record I know what love isn't it's been a while since we've heard a studio effort from this guy and it kind of sounds like it because lek Minh has come through with an almost full reinvention of his sound because this is really his his pop album this is his copyist album so far this is if any record of his was going to be some chart topper I don't think that's going to happen but if there was this would be it although that's not to say that pop hasn't been an influence on his previous albums it certainly has but this is the most direct and simplified and funky his music has ever sounded I guess he was sort of trending in this direction with at least a handful of songs on his last album sounding a bit more simplified a bit peppier very hooky but this time on this album Jen's is backing his songs with one dance beat after another while still kind of bringing that whimsical chamber pop instrumentation at first when I was listening to this thing I thought to myself wow this is what it would sound like if Belle and Sebastian went down to the disco and then I remember that that's what the hell Sebastian did with their last album but I like this new lek Minh album better but that's not to say that this album perfects what Belle and Sebastian tried to do on their last album either yen's is playing with a lot of different genres on this album I think effectively he gets them to meld pretty well but I don't know if he's so much plays to the strengths of every musical style that he's toying with here I think the direct musical approach and the loud danceable rhythms all over this album kind of take away from the subtlety and the intimacy of like men's music also kind of takes away from the impact of his lyrics which are usually pretty thoughtful wordy have some underlying humor to that or maybe some kind of personal anguish or heartbreak also I think a lot of the sequence beats on this thing some of which have a kind of digital electronic tone to them clash in a somewhat ugly way with the very organic very acoustic instrumentation the guitars the pianos and strings and on the flipside yes doesn't exactly have the voice to really sell a pop song I like his singing but his voice is super polite very quaint and the result is a lot of these songs being somewhat breezy lacking in punch or urgency memorability sometimes the lyrics can be pretty sticky can be pretty memorable or funny like on Hotwire the ferris wheel which I think has one of the more interesting stories and narratives on the entire album or the song wedding in food I'm going to try to pronounce that which I think has one of the smartest choruses on any of his albums where he sort of depicts five-year-olds 10 year old 15 year olds 20 year olds 30 year olds all kind of watching each other in succession and learning from one another's mostly bad behaviors are kind of seeing what's coming next for them down the line in the future I don't feel like the hand percussion on this track it has a bit of an island funk to it that I think is really sharp the song how we met the long version is also very self-aware and witty too but then we have cuts like our first fight which gets directly into the mundane I I don't dig the lyrics of this track at all and what's the perfume you're wearing is sickeningly sweet and then they opening track to know your mission I don't know if I'm missing out on some tongue-in-cheek humor here or some irony but on this track Yin's whether it be himself or maybe through a character laments about not knowing or understanding his purpose in the world or vying for a purpose in the world he says that he wants to be an ear in a world of mouths he wants to be a social worker so we can hear other people's stories or be a shrink even though he doesn't have the grades and I don't know that just kind of struck me as a really selfish reason to go into those fields where primarily your focus should be to help other people now I hear their stories and these are the tracks that really for you good or bad stuck out to me much of the rest of the album just didn't really lead that strong of an impression on me it was certainly pleasant to have on in the background but again I feel like those dance beats left a lot of the milder tracks instrumentally feeling a little stiff especially on a song like postcard 17 whose dance beat kind of clashes with a very sad vibe of the instrumentation you know it just seems like the two or three different worlds of music he's bringing together on some of these tracks occasionally they enhance each other a lot of the time they work against each other and here and there they're cancelling each other out I think the mission yen set out on on this record was certainly an admirable one but the results at best are pretty mixed even if evening prayer is a tune I'm feeling a light to decent six on this album treacherous trip transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like

kYVQR4cdSQ0,hey doing another review over here a quick review of this new animal collective EP this brand new painters EP following up painting with animal collectives last full-length thousand which admittedly I was not a huge fan of yet I think it's one of their you know one of their worst rip if I'm being honest I'm being honest my feelings here okay but I actually like this EP quite a bit I mean it's not a perfect EP and even if all the songs on the EP were amazing it's just four tracks you know it's not like a game-changer or anything like that but I think kinda bonkers that kicks EP off is one of cannibal collectives best tracks in a while certainly best out many songs off of painters I not only love the lyrics on this track I love the sentiment of the refrains or reflecting on all these situations in the world at large that are kinda bonkers I also love the how catchy the hook is on the track you know what sort of was a loss for me on painting with was that it felt like the songwriting wasn't there a lot of the time to me but kinda bonkers is a return to hey this is like a good tune at the core of this track doesn't matter of sort of how goofy sort of production sounds doesn't matter you know how much experimental sounds we work into the track over here but the tune is a good solid tune but beyond that you know the next two tracks peacemaker and goal keeper the Lee songs I think do have good elements to them peacemaker is certainly a very relaxing track some very smooth and beautiful melodies on the song goalkeeper not as memorable for me from the melodic standpoint but it is more aggressive you know the rhythms and the vocals are way more intense and in-your-face so of course you know that element of it makes the song a little bit more exciting but to me these tracks are a little bit more of the unbridled kookiness that made you know painting with sort of forgettable you know while I like animal collective energy there's got to be a tune there at the core of the song really kind of me in and keeping interested case in point the song Jimmy Mack which is my favorite on the EP but it's not even enamel collective song is a cover of the song by the same title from Martha and the Vandellas and this sort of repurposing of this old soul tune and this is part of what I love with that animal collective their saga so you need their sound is so unique and it's so inventive that if I hadn't been told this to the cover I would not have thought it was a cover because their sound is so out there it's otherworldly that anything that they may be covering it just kind of really just instantaneously throws you off of the path it throws you off of any clues that like oh this song comes from somewhere else because in a lot of ways it just kind of sounds like you know a really great animal collective song from the 2000s or something and it's it's almost like because there's a good solid tune at the core of this song that has sticky refrains to it solid melody Animal Collective is kind of free to sort of put in all of this energy all of this cuts ball all of this gusto and it sort of goes somewhere you know they have a place to channel it into they have a great song to channel all this excitement into so the cover sounds like balls to the wall the cover sounds like you know everything was in the read the cover sounds like a really electrifying performance so you know that and also kind of in the case with a kind of bonkers though that too is a little more relaxing it's a little more reflective and introspective I would say not quite as aggressive as a Jimmy Mac but still more compelling on the whole because at core that track is a good tune again not so much the case with goalkeeper and peacemaker those tracks are alright but I feel like Animal Collective through if they're going to continue to come out with records that I think compel listeners it's not just your sound that's doing it you know it's like those basics of like the great songwriting that we heard on Merriweather Post Pavilion or some tongs or you know some of the great ballads on fields or like um strawberry jam I think that's what's going to you know sort of continue to wow people of course you sound is great of course that sounds great of course you know Animal Collective style is part of what makes them so unique you know but still there's not like a great quality tunic or that track it's just like you know it's like they're kind of taking all that energy and just throwing it out for the wind to kind of just carry it away into the you know into the ether because it's just like you know dust at that point it's just dust but but those are just kind of my thoughts on it you know I do like the EP the two tracks in the middle that I was just kind of you know indifferent toward you know while they're not amazing they're not terrible and you know the EP at least starts and ends really strong I had fun listening to a lot had it on so you know there's that and uh yeah pretty much those are my thoughts on this in the animal collective EP what did you think that this thing did you levitate a why where you think as you review next and I will see you guys in the next video forever 
vEl7_Pt6y3Q,hey what up everybody Antoine fan chuan here you know who it is on the mend not quite as sick today feeling a little bit better at least good enough to do a couple of raw unedited reviews on the iPhone over here going to be talking about a couple he pees today it was first EP I'm going to be talking about is from flume it is his skin companion EP number two the second of two EPS he has released since his big breakout commercial record skin actually really not quite as breakout as his self-titled album a couple of years ago but he did get a Grammy for it you know so so hell yeah man I personally was not a crazy fan of the album myself but I have liked the EPS he's released since the album especially this one of the 2 EPS because what I think is so awesome about this is that he's taking the wonky sound he's taking that experimental hip-hop production the the weird since the digital soundscape that typically comes along with this genre and off-kilter beats and he's doing something big and kind of glitzy and huge and epic with it but he's not making those commercial concessions that he was on a lot of tracks on skin that um kind of sounded to me like he was just trying to get the EDM fans into what he was doing on here there's not quite as much in the way of like you know artistic compromises there to sort of get that audience into the music the song fantastic with a day from glass animals on it is a really eerie dark and textured piece of pop music with weird wonky beat hanging in the background and the way it kinda reminds me of Clarence clarity if you don't know who that is please check him out his album know now is an excellent experimental pop record and it's just kind of weird to sort of hear that similarity even though I presume it's unintentional I presume it's not like a clear sort of direct sort of a inspiration point of inspiration or anything like that but there is definitely a similarity there especially with the sort of weird somewhat a ghoulish chorus vocal effects that are thrown onto the vocals death charge slow really cool banger track that it takes a while to get where it's going it's a slow burner for the first half but what the B stars are going it sounds really great then we have a weekend with Moses substance has hugged me yeah that's how you process man or I would hope that is and this trap also a slow burner if it doesn't kind of have that big rhythmic climactic payoff that the second half of a depth charge does actually one that I think about that track the more fitting the title is because the weights the beats hit on that track in the second half ago my sort of thing is actually really I don't know sonically intriguing it's a really good like sound play in the production on that track then with a weakened that track it takes a while to get going I would actually say it's really kind of the most ambient of all the tracks on the EP very relaxing very Spacey very atmospheric pretty experimental in a way with how the vocal scent kind of like ghostly and distant and hit in the background as the very linear progression of the song kind of just intensifies sort of swells the sense further and further and further as the song progresses the only track I wasn't really crazy about was enough with push a tea mostly because I thought Pusha T's vocal contributions to the track just felt really washed out like there was much presence to his voice in the mix I think it had a lot to do with the mixing just the volume level of his vocals and the effects that were throwing onto his vocals that just kind of made it sound like not like a great star you know I guess shining sort of stunning feature it felt more like you know just kind of like another instrument or another piece of digital whatever hanging in the mix when I hear pushing can attract I want to hear  push a key on a track because I think we should tease great so it's sort of I don't know have him there I sort of have them not in the spotlight on the track just kind of seems counterintuitive to me but whatever overall this is good EP I think it's good et think it's a good follow up to the last companion skinny pea I think it's a good follow up to the skin album and hopefully you know with these two new EPS even though they weren't quite as commercial as a lot of the songs on skin I hope that you know fleeing does a little something more like this on his next album I mean it's cool that you know it seems that he's been able to take wonky and effectively cross it over into the mainstream and actually get artists who do have a mainstream sound or do you have a mainstream appeal to sort of work on music like this because this is typically not like you know a top 40 kind of sound this is typically you know these it's not wonky artists who are sort of like you know wall-to-wall being lined up at these big EDM festivals you know so it's cool that flume is kind of breaking that group that glass ceiling for a lot of these Waukee artists even if it's in the process he's had to kind of change the sound a little bit guffy it up a little bit but you know obviously he's conscious of what makes the genre interesting he's conscious of what makes the genre unique and he's playing more to those things on these EPS and I hope that on his next album he does that a little bit more too but again good EP check it out definitely worth the listen if you're an electronic music fan definitely worth listen if you've heard the previous companion EP previous skin flume album and a muscle listen for a you know Waukee fans as well too so that's it see you guys in the next video forever 
dvcM8-25H38,Hey hi everyone coughing hak-kan oh here the entrace busiest music nerd here and it's time for review of the new John Wayne album rap album a number two John Wayne is a rapper producer hails from California he's got a husky voice and a husky size and he has prolifically been releasing one project after another since 2010 even before that he was involved in a couple of different outfits he started turning heads back in 2011 with the bowzer instrumental album that was released on alpha pup records and then he expanded his fan base with his mic skills on his Stones Throw Records album rap album one we're in very self-aware fashion he used a cracker as the album cover now I heard this record but it didn't really stop me in my tracks honestly while John Wayne was clearly a student of the underground he kept tabs on his dooms and his Dilla's there wasn't really anything on the album that struck me as being particularly bold or show-stopping but I still saw some merit in what he was doing on this album maybe listeners found a kindred spirit in John Wayne due to the introspective tone of his lyrics or his loner status and that's still kind of the case on this new album over here in a way I feel like John Wayne's music is hip hop's answer to one of those weird basement shows that your friend invites you to you do a $2 donation at the door just to watch some guy sit Indian style and make improvised drone music for 90 minutes on like 13 chained guitar pedals because there are multiple spots on this record where John Wayne isn't really communicating anything other than his difficulty to communicate things like I'm a song the single which is basically a 1-minute track consisting of a series of failed attempts to record what could have been maybe the hottest song on the entire album or the song live from the fuck you where essentially the track is a skit where John Wayne is put in an awkward position kind of put on the spot to rap in front of some guy because I guess his girlfriend is a really huge fan and then the that comes out of John Wayne is sort of all about you know leaving him alone or you know I guess the social awkwardness or his inability to sort of handle himself in these sorts of situations the song rainbow doesn't really seem to consist of anything more than a short verse from Danny Watts in the first half and then immediately after that the instrumental turns into this cycling noisy glitchy textured somewhat ambient instrumental piece there are lyrical moments on the album where John Wayne gives off very much the same tone like when he says he'll throw tomahto in the face of bravado not my fault the Model T is parked in the pothole or this set of bars over here where John Wayne boasts about how popular the song would be if only he'd actually put a hook into the track and these are just a few examples of John Wayne sort of boasting on a track about his refusal to play the game in such a way that would net him a major profit or a major fanbase he seems kind of content to play to all traps most misanthropic listeners at one point he refers to his audience on the album as an artist audience John Wayne sort of embracing this path embracing this approach to his music I think leads to him shooting some of his own tracks in the foot but there are some fully fleshed out and developed songs on this record where he dives into the feelings that that sort of fuel this mindset and and speak to these emotions in a way that I think no other rapper is right now the song human condition is a really witty and smart track about shortcomings his own shortcomings the flaws that come along with being a human being and the song out of sight is a very personal autobiographical track where John Wayne is rapping about having his head in the clouds burning social bridges to kind of prioritize his health his struggles with alcoholism and at one point he kind of points out the funny irony or at least what he sees as irony of working on his ability to live get his shit together work on this album so that he could sustain his life just so that he can kind of turn right back around and rap about life and of course all this is set to a very sad spacey beautiful instrumental that John Wayne's gentle giant voice just demain and attention over tracks like paper and city lights are equally impressive from a lyrical standpoint and have a very classy jazz wrapped vibe and the track these words are everything is an awesome finish to the album it's a really life-affirming track it sees Dwayne at his most confident on the entire record he lays a lot of historical groundwork for what brought him to this point in life and it is a much-needed pick-me-up after the song blue green which is a soul-crushing look into John Wayne hitting rock bottom with alcoholism like throw up on his sheets could have choked to death on his own vomit his own tour canceled and then the track afraid of us the longest track on the entire album reads a lot like one of those letters that you have to write in a a or really any kind of addiction program where you're apologizing to all the people who are close to you for how your addiction might have hurt them but it sort of ends up with a feel-good vibe because it sort of embraces and emphasizes the importance of friends and the support system when you're trying to make it through life struggles and of course this track and many others on here are executed with some very simple but very quality production that the scenes homespun has some beautiful interesting little quirks and flaws to it you know these are the highlights of the record these are the great things about the record when John Wayne can actually focus enough to get something like this out this is very perplexing album for me in one breath this album is disheveled it's disorganized its disjointed its disoriented its deeply flawed it's the definition of not having your shit together but in another breath there are some great tracks on here and there's some seriously bright moments of talent on this thing like jaw-dropping the song ted talk for example that kicks the entire album off you will not hear a more cold-blooded song opening up a rap album this year I promise you that and it's not just because of the dreary piano loops and the fat beat it's John Wayne's stone fucking cold delivery on this track is move but measured flow and the bars on this thing there's one line on here about being in the china shop spitting that bull shit another line about never forgetting like elephants on 4chan that that that one goes deep van go um pretend I don't know them even in the casket I'll be the one to close it my parents built me on straight IKEA is probably the corniest line on the whole song but it's still hilarious almost every bar on this track is quotable like who gets away with being this fucking smart witty and and just lyrically entertaining on a rap song so there's this side of the album and then there are the tracks that deliver some really potent and raw emotions John exposes some really personal deep problems on this record and he conveys them in such a way that I think is really compelling garnering a boatload of sympathy at least for me and the connections between the short comings of the album and John Wayne's shortcomings as a person are I think maybe a little intentional pretty obvious I do like this album and I like what John Wayne is doing on here I think he's improved upon what he delivered on his previous record but I still think he has a little ways to go the talent is clearly there the ability is clearly there but what's also clear is that John Wayne is working through and struggling with some demons at least during the recording of this album possibly I'm not entirely sure but whatever the issue is it's clear that it's driving him to kind of hide his full potential in a way and I would just love to hear him be able to hit that hit that Zenith hit that peak because what's delivered here as I guess all over the place as this album can be it's it's really good and it's impressive I'm feeling a life 7 on this

Jr9jPD4nUBI,hi everyone Ethan II II tell her you're nice biggest music nerve as time for review of this new future album new church self-titled I'm still not 100% right now excuse me for that future is an Atlanta rapper singer auto-tune addict how long at this point it's been two years since the release of futures most definitive project yet ds2 an album that is my favorite of his thus far kind of a spacey intoxicating experience an album that tries to capture the essence of being high out of your mind on lean in song and on that front I think this album succeeded a future typically brings a very strong vibe a very stylish aesthetic on a track on an album that's nothing new the issue with this new LP though is that futures weaknesses also continue uninterrupted on this project to the lackluster song structures which are pretty uninspired pretty redundant a lot of the time of non-existent the lack of versatility and variety across the album lyrically sonically melodically then they're all the effortless flows that just stream out of futures mouths as if he's not thinking about any of it they sound really stale like this would be left over from any number of projects that he released in the past or could have released in the past some of which get really old really fast but future doesn't even seem like he's trying to write anything refreshing or remotely career-defining with this album because at this point he knows how this works if future fans on the song Draco don't like the goofy mirrored sounding synthesizers bouncing off of one another in the beat or you know the flow that he drops on parts like reddit dad got a new gig back then most likely something else on the album will because feature has delivered an hour of material on this thing it's likely you will find at least a few tracks that slap it's like as he's putting this stuff together he fully aware of how repetitive and replaceable and unmemorable and non-essential all of this really is at this point is kind of hard for me to even think of future as a human being who's putting individual cogent thought into a song into an album considering his virtually unchanged flow and lyrical style and his warbly robotic vocals great also considering future's very worldly robotic auto-tune vocals which sound almost the same on every single track I'd be more willing to believe at this point that he's a computer program that just randomly generates songs with the same five to six variables which you can make subtle adjustments to again and again and again with each new track there were a couple moments on this album that stuck out to me as maybe taking a little bit of a risk or having a human touch to it the song when I was broke which features feature more singing than then rapping and it's a more the introspective side of future when you read into the lyrics as he kind of a you know goes into a bit of a bit of a thing about when when he when he doesn't have money the song feds did a sweep is also very emotional sad and a kind of sparse closer to the album I also love the very airy and beautiful woodwinds that are sampled throughout the track mask off though I guess my attraction of that track has more to do with the instrumental than anything future does on top of the instrumental also kind of the case for the song rent money I love how hard the beat on this thing bangs I think it's a great kick-off to the album and some of the lines on here that future get it getting this dude's girl to sleep with him because the rent monies do I don't know listening to the album I think it's kind of funny but actually like reciting the scenario out now in front of the camera it's actually kind of depressing the song super trapper is a very grimy dark kind of nocturnal trap anthem that I thought was pretty good and poppin tags goes hard as fuck that is me trying my hardest to compliment this album because even the spots on this thing that I like I feel like I'm still kind of listening to something that I've heard future do before just with some subtle tweaks here and there to keep him from literally rewriting the same song truth be told at this point on this self-titled album future is unbearably formulaic which is part of the course for a lot of his Atlantic contemporaries whether it be young thug or migos but each of their most recent commercial outings have been the most adventurous albums yet so what's future's excuse even me goes for trying like a couple new things the biggest change of pace this album offers are the really bad trashy barely funny radio sketches that are all over this record where you have like a really nasty radio host who's like hosting a podcast and giving out I guess prizes to listeners that they're calling in or they're contacting him or something I don't know how but they sound like they're in the studio with him kind of kind of seems like an oversight on the production side of things you know the thing is passable it has the bare-bones elements that make a future release listenable make it decent as like background music but after listening to this thing I don't know I'm not sure if there's a more uninspired rapper walking the planet than future right now because with every new release he drops whether it be something potentially career-defining like this as he self titles it or even a release like you know with drink what is time to be alive you know it seems like there'd be no better opportunity to you know kind of get yourself out of your comfort zone with every new release he drops you just folds his arms and he says I'm gonna do the same thing I always do I'm pretty indifferent towards this thing feeling a light decent 5 on this one work one more thing then feature is not lyrical this album is not lyrical don't don't pretend like it's lyrical I mean sure future future may reveal some of the gritty realities of the lifestyle that he raps about you know it's not all it's not all money and and and women and and all that stuff you know they're they're obviously some some lows that complement those highs but but you know he's not fucking lyrical whatever grim realities he is exposing he's not you know really putting it out there for all to see no is paying attention you know nobody listen to a future song where the lyrics seems like a gross mischaracterization of of how people consume futures music sort of go into the song be like Oh May he really says some real shit on this track it's really not how it goes down so while he may try here and there to to say a thing and be a little emotional it's really not one of his strengths it's really not a selling point of his music it's just a window dressing attempt to get the listener the impression that oh he's he's a multi-faceted guy man you know he's got different different sides to him dude when in reality it's very apparent how shallow future is I mean how deep could he be he tries to write the same song over and over and over that being said sure ran and those are my thoughts on this new future album future what did you think in this album did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it future future links next to my head subscribe to the channel social website - you're the best stay hydrated eat your fruits and veggies don't get sick forever 
ySP4iNetZqU,hey everyone having a bath Denis de pano here the Internet's busiest music nerd lock myself out of my car broke a camera lens couch esta still alive but hey you know we're going to tough it through this video anyway you know what we don't even really gotta tough it through this video because it's it's a very nice album we're talking about here as you can tell it's the new Sun Kil moon record common as light and love our red valleys of blood now Sun Kil moon if you didn't know is a musical project masterminded by singer-songwriter mr. mark kozilek who you might remember from the Red House Painters or the film almost famous or that one song where he told the band the war on drugs to suck his it's it's no secret that the third act of Mark Cossacks musical career has been eventful polarizing some of which seems to stem from his naturally sour and curmudgeon II demeanor though on his last album universal themes it was painfully clear that he was trying to elicit some of these reactions from his actions and his lyrics whether it be through insensitive stage banter or his adversarial stance that he's taken with a lot of the music press for which he's been labeled an asshole a jerk a sexist on the song lone Starr on this very album he talks about being banned or prevented from playing a show in San Antonio because of this sexist label being thrown on him and I don't know if I fully agree with that label I mean mark kozilek is certainly rude maybe his biggest flaw is that he doesn't have a filter but this is simultaneously his greatest strength on this album and this is nothing entirely new at this point for mark I mean this is what people love about records like the recently released Benji an album filled with very sad songs about getting older and mortality laced with tons of personal stories about Marc's life and his youth but then with the next Sun Kil moon record Marc presented a challenge a change of pace getting even more roar in Rambler with his storytelling I couldn't quite tell if the lukewarm reception to this album was due to this being more difficult to digest in comparison with Benji or if it was because of all the enemies across the music world that Marc had made over the past year I wasn't totally crazy about the record personally it felt more meandering than Benji a lot of Marc's diatribes which felt almost stream-of-consciousness a lot of the time lacked conclusion some of the linear groovy instrumentals got stale after a while a couple of them went ultra aggressive with distorted guitars and mark shouting or screaming at the top of his lungs making the lyrics kind of unintelligible but uncommon is why I think this is the album where Marc refines the formula that universal themes was testing again we have songs on this record that are very story centric very narrative heavy but this time around I think Marc's musical monologues have more focus they have more purpose and mark bring some diversity here kind of performing in a mix of singing spoken word and tracks where he's almost rapping the instrumentals I think are more interesting to each track being more patient and linear than the next with a slew of different musical styles crashing into one another whether it be folk music which is painfully clear from all the acoustic guitars and the storytelling indie rock which comes through in a lot of the groovy twangy instrumentals which have a bit of a an early modest mouse flavor to them hip hop which pours through in a lot of the looped and very groovy beats a lot of the beats are instrumentals on this record are heavily centered around the drums and the bass not quite as much electric guitar or acoustic guitar leading the way on some of these cuts and I would say there's almost a post-punk vibe to some of the linear songwriting and raw energy behind these tracks kind of reminds me of a band like the fall now the lyrics on here also have a nice range we tracks that are painfully personal just introspection to the extreme as it seems like Mark delivers every internal thought he ever had throughout 2016 and then to match that we have tracks that are about a wide array of larger more public topics terrorist attacks technology Donald Trump is president that Malaysian flight that went missing and even transgender bathroom rights overall I think this is a more lyrically compelling album a more musically compelling album the only thing that makes this record a challenge is that mark is done with these tracks when he's done with them may take five minutes may take seven minutes may take 12 minutes for him to get off his chest what he needs to get off his chest on a particular track and with there being 16 songs on this record that runtime adds up to over two hours so while I really do enjoy this album as a fan of marks recent work people who are outside the kozilek loop may have a hard time connecting with this thing still though for me personally there are highlights abound on this thing instrumentally on tracks like god bless Ohio which feature a very sad set of descending acoustic guitar chords and a very tight drum beat the instrumental of Philadelphia cop which has more of a hip-hop flavor to it from its drum loops which are very punchy and it's a very deep dark bass line it's like a rap tune but it's a played at a slower jury or your pace I also love the very wintery window sash weights which has some very icy icy guitar chords played throughout then there are other cuts like that steel day and I love Portugal and and vague rock song which seemed intentionally hokey kind of playful a little warmer and of course a lot of these instrumentals they don't just stick to one sound or style throughout there are plenty of tracks that feature acoustic breakdowns or mark either digresses from his many digressions throughout a single song or he gives more detail to what he's singing or talking about on a track or the track chili lemon peanuts almost the entire second half half of that track is this weird spacey ambient passage with these sad keyboards again there's some good instrumental diversity across the record but some important consistencies to the fact that many of the tracks feel very linear feel more like a musical foundation four marks spoken word or story if there's any clear progression across the record it's that as the album moves along it's like mark gets more and more meta with his lyrics the salon 70s TV show theme is so playfully self referential that if I don't know it's uh it's it's unique as Mark is literally rattling off a bunch of TV shows from that decade whose theme songs or incidental music remind him of the very song that he's writing because there is kind of a funky drumbeat and some persistent guitar soloing at some horns that work their way into the track but there is kind of a messy a stream-of-consciousness looseness to the cut that I don't know that doesn't quite remind me of the music from that era lyrical highlights on this song include mark talking about Millennials not potentially getting the references that he's making on this song there's a moment on the track where he says it reminds him of Barney Miller and it wasn't intentional he's just trying to add another track to the album some filler and the song vague rock song is exactly what mark labels it as as he sort of cycles through these nonsensical refrains urging people to sing along with his vague rock song it's kind of a parody of the exact opposite type of tune he wants to write or at least wanted to write for this album he makes a similar point on the track window sash weights we're right after sort of going into this obsession he has with true crimes serial killers Richard Ramirez and this need that's driving him to go to this hotel connected with the unsolved death of ELISA Lam he kind of trails off into these vague rock lyrics before he goes into them he warns us that they're coming and he sort of gives us a bunch of easy to digest refrains to I guess kind of softened the blow from all these weird preoccupations that he has that he sort of went into detail with for a majority of the track mark even visits the hotel he's alluding to on the track Misha premieres and goes even deeper into the ELISA Lam story like I said mark may be really long-winded on this record but for me it's kind of entrancing just how obsessively he sticks to a topic on the song and the more detail he adds to a narrative that he's building on a track the more compelling it becomes what he's saying I'm attract becomes funnier grimmer or even sadder whether on a track it'd be him interacting with college kids on the Sarah Lawrence College song asking them what they're studying how much they're paying a moment where he's reading a letter that he received from the promoter of the show or going to Las Vegas to see a Manny Pacquiao fight that he lost a dead on or a track where he's poking fun at phone obsessed Millennials moment on the same song where he's kind of going through this hilarious satirical conversation telling this a snooty la la la moron that he's a music journalist and she's like oh you got a South by Southwest he goes on to say he knows all the bands he knows a dr. John misty that that's some serious music nerd humor right there also a beautiful moment on the record where he's tributing a friend named butch who passed away this is probably the most detailed tribute he's given anyone on a song as he goes into grave detail about Butch's many habits and personality quirks and marks personal interactions with him at one point mark creates this funny fabricated murder story about this guy who kills a dude because his voice is really similar to Eric Clapton's a moment where he says that in the future when he does a show at Chapel Hill he will invite all transgender people to come in for free and they can use whatever bathroom they want because for him it's about personal dignity and respect he glorifies Portugal as an idyllic getaway from the insanity of the United States of America and on the track Bergen to Trondheim this is an incredibly unlikely but very essential track about the pulse nightclub shooting or at least Marc's reaction and feelings on that this thing is a really odd long and emotionally complicated record but I think it's also very raw and beautiful and personal and thoughtful and move it and super evocative - I love the direction Marc took with the lyrics and took with the instrumentals on this record I love that he didn't give up on some of the ideas that he had on universal themes I think he improved on them greatly and while I don't think this record is is widely accessible as Benji I think in many respects it's every bit as good I think what Mark has done here is pulled together a boldly different and refreshing reinvention sure there are a few points on the record where I think a point that Mark is trying to make or a joke that he's trying to make has gone on a little long or worn it's welcome or mark gets so meta on this record that it's hard not to roll your eyes at what he's doing at least a little bit sort of like how when Mark is singing about how his back catalog is on amazon.com because this particular person who he's referencing said that he likes his older song but again as I said earlier this is really the strength of this album mark is just breaking the fourth wall so hard that he's made a really unique listening experience in the process and not just lyrically because you know the stories on this thing are supremely detailed they're supremely intense they're supremely engrossing but I think the album is musically interesting too I think mark does a lot of cool things fusing these elements of hip-hop music of rock music of folk music into this linear and winding mix I just have to give it to mark cause like again because deep into his career again he's coming out with an incredibly challenging adventurous and inventive album I'm feeling a light to ds9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you radio the best you the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please drive please don't cry leave an angry comment if you're angry and links next to my head now you should check out other videos and subscribe to the channel fish a website you're the best some kill moon common adds light forever

yeah so that Apple linked to that app is down there in the description to check that app out check out discogs comm because they sponsored this video they're good people now let's get into the worst tracks of the week the horrible music gods shined on us this past week hahahaha they delivered unto us many horrible songs in this it was hard picking the worst one this week but let's get into it Kodak black with tunnel vision this track is ridiculous not only does the the music video feature like a really overly stereotyped straw man sort of depiction of this redneck white guy who's just running around looking for a black man to shoot his gun jams and then it becomes this like tumble this fistfight between both of them it's kind of weird there's like no rhyme or reason or story to what's going on other than this slow-motion battle and just like this really weird dance that Kodak black is doing in front of like some burning crosses and it is kind of drawing almost unintelligible delivery is is worse than ever just really nothing redeeming about this song it's god-awful moving on from there I do TJ the amazing atheist came out with a rap song under the name cringe fire this week and boy does he deliver on the cringe at least he's self-aware about it the title of the track being cannibalism gets a bad rap so here's a worse one and he's well aware of his abilities on on that front - because he he raps about eating body parts sucking dick he uses a chicken pot pie which is a word that I had not heard on ironically or maybe a little ironically in this case but ironically or not ironically I've not heard that word used in a legitimate rap song since or at least like a legitimate rap verse since I was like in junior high or something or at least hear somebody try to you know market that word Phil hey man here's a dope dope rhyme chicken pot pie bully yeah so um yeah that that track sucks but at least TJ knows it sucks but if you want something so horrible that you can really just gawk at it give that that tract a shot maroon 5 has a new track out with future it's just as terrible as the song they just dropped with Kendrick Lamar I have no idea what maroon 5 is doing right now I think they're in a bit of a artistic crisis because it seems like they're doing as much as they can just to sound like some bland background pop music that has a feature from a relevant rapper on it somewhere so yeah that track is a pretty god-awful and forgettable pitbull has a wonderful song out featuring Stephen Marley the track is called options and this track sounds like some really bad pop music with a bit of a reggae twist that would have topped the charts in the 2000s I don't know how pitbull does it man he's so relevant and he's so popular and yet he makes music that's so painfully dated it's truly a talent what he does moving on from there I got a shout out the new Linkin Park song heavy I don't know what it is about all these rock bands all these mainstream gigantic rock bands that are left over from the 2000s and still making music now I don't know why it is every single new song if they come out with they have to try as hard as they can to either sound like imagine dragons or just sound like they're writing EDM music because that's what this stupid Linkin Park sounds like it has pretty much the exact flow and the build-up that an EDM song would but with like you know one of those like crappy guest singers on it to make it sound like really epic and meaningful like we're not just writing a dumb dance song here we're going to put some lyrics and a really dramatic singer on top to make you feel like you can connect to it emotionally instead of just like doing drugs and dancing and fucking to it I would much rather you know the latter there rather than feel emotion when listening to EDM but that's what Linkin Park's essentially trying to do here they're trying to write really emotionally EDM music and it sounds like trash but but those tracks all those tracks not even the worst tracks of the week not even the worst in my opinion the worst track of the week comes from Cee Lo Green under the name little fun I think or is it like gnarly Davidson he came to the Grammys recently dressed in like this really weird outfit that no one seemed to make heads or tails of I don't know what this song is a part of but it's a cover of the song Jessie's girl but the production is shit and he's changed the lyrics to be about Beyonce so the song is called jay-z's girl and so he has this um little person kind of dancing around in the music video and he sort of projects his creepiness onto this actor who sort of dances around his room and gazes at Beyonce and is in love with Beyonce and it's thinking about how he wants to be with Beyonce and he's jealous of jay-z and so on and so forth and it not knowing Cee Lo's past you know especially his recent sort of you know accusations against him it's it's it's really creepy I get creeper vibes off the track and it makes me a little sick to my stomach so not only does it sound that it's a corny ass cover and it's got a very high creep factor to it so all of those things added together makes it the worst strength of the week this track is shit I have no qualms with just coming straight out and just saying that all right let's move on to the songs that I wanted to shout out I wasn't crazy about but they were certainly worth mentioning because some of you guys you know you might dig them a little bit more than me rae sremmurd has a new song out called swang that is absolutely boring it's pretty much wallpaper trap but if you check this song out for anything please watch it for the music video they go buckwild on a golf course the part where they're doing putts and they're like throwing money down on the green and like you know there's old white guy throws down a big fat lot of hundreds and it's really funny net then Lana Del Rey has a new track out titled love that just released and it's okay chord progressions bland lyrical topics pretty much the same things that she's always singing about I think the one thing that sort of struck me about this song is slightly different in a weird kind of move for her is that the instrumentation which was like really soft focus on the instrumentation of course like whimsical arranged strings and stuff hanging in the background or it sound a very grand like a very big presentation to it but there was something about at this time around which was much different than anything that she's released so far they kind of made it feel like a like an adult contemporary piece of pop music to me like she was doing a little bit of a Celine Dion thing I'm not exactly sure or that sort of direction is coming from and it's kind of ironic that you singing over and over in the song that she's young and in love despite the fact that this sounds like something that like my mom would have listened to back in the 90s and the 2000s if it were playing on the radio or something it's it's okay it's it's really one of her more forgettable tracks there's nothing terrible about it but I wouldn't really say there's anything all that special about it so far either if you you know sort of compare it to anything else you put out so far a bit of a shame because I feel like she was kind of turning a new leaf with her last record but I digress little dragon has a new track out titled hi which I thought was very forgettable not really a strong melody or dance beat or anything really tangible about the song it just felt like you know a lot of navel-gazing and the you know very soft polite dreamy pop music that I feel like little dragon is certainly beyond you know they have the instrumental talent to do something that's a little more punctuated and interesting but yet they don't they just kind of hang back and just make a I don't know the most unintrusive pop that I've been hearing for a while now because you know their last record I felt was kind of a letdown for me too but whatever I digress there - Louis campesinos has a new little ballad out which isn't too bad called the fall of home Colin Stetson has a new cutout titled spindrift which is attached to a video which if you're you know into the saxophonist music you're probably going to dig but there isn't anything really to novel or interesting about this track that he hasn't sort of explored before in my opinion at least nothing like bold or wildly different but you know it is a solid track why is new cut one-mississippi and I've never really been a wife Anne is actually a pretty good song I'll just I'll just leave it there I'm not going to get too deep into it it's a decent track and it's kind of making me interested to hear this why album again never really get a wife Anne but the balladry and the really crisp production the keyboards and the drums on this thing we're really great Joanie's vocals which are usually kind of turn-off for me we're good as well so props to that song odyssey's new song and nge was actually pretty good track I'm not really a huge fan of them as a wrap more into his production but this is like a really captivating beat to me moving on from there artificial brain synthesized instinct I really loved this band's last record but unfortunately I think the production on this new track over here while I do think the performance is really awesome and raw and intricate you know there's a really good technical death metal over here with kind of a you know an indie experimental edge it's not you know cleanly produced to the point where it's sanitized but I feel like the production on this tracks a little lackluster because this song sounds kind of muddy unfortunately I think Colin Marston produced their last record and is he doing this latest one I'm not entirely sure Chaz bundok meets the Matteson - apparently a Chaz of Toro y Moi Fame is coming out with a record which may mostly be instrumental at least this track is mostly instrumental with the Matteson - who I guess are a couple of twins who uh do little jazz music and together to come together with kind of this soft rock pop instrumental thing that sounds like it's from the 70s you know it just kind of sounds like some 70s background music it's okay you know it's smooth its soulful it's sweet on the years I wouldn't exactly say that the performance is all that electrifying or anything and it seems like it's composed to just be as easygoing as possible so you know it's not really going to get your blood pumping and so going to get your excitement going or anything I don't think but it is a pretty little track and it does make me interested to hear what they may do on the rest of the record because maybe if all the songs come together in a really strong beautiful intoxicating vibe could be a really good album body-count with ice-t you know fronting them if you're not familiar with the band please go back into their back catalogue because they do have some interesting stuff they are cool all metal crossover metal like a crossover thrash sort of band they have a new track out called no lives matter where they're sort of diving into the whole you know racism police brutality black lives matter sort of a thing and it's an interesting track you know there's something like really cynical and nasty and in-your-face about it you know but there's also something kind of corny about it as well because it seems like ice-t kind of takes the politics of the situation and boils them down to the most basic idea is despite the fact that this is a very complicated situation and I think just kind of hearing him sing or scream or rap about these things over these sorts of alt metal riffs is inherently sort of comedic even if it's not intended to be but you know do check this song out there's something kind of entertaining about it and this new magnetic field song 81 how to play the synthesizer which apparently is a part of their forthcoming record 50 song memoir each song being about a year or at least a point or something that happened in a year that's being referenced this is not really all that memorable of a track for me though it is a very sensitive e song seems more conceptual than anything I've heard from this record so far not really the best tune but the song is filled with sense and is literally about you know playing synthesizer kind of so check that track out it's a pretty sweet little track let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best tracks of the week the song is stuck out the most to me and here we go I got to give a shout out to parquet courts captive of the Sun remix featuring bun B this is the weirdest most unexpected but also most successful rock crossover that I've heard in a while like Bundy kills it on this track parquet courts sort of revised this song from I believe their last record to have a bit more of a hip-hop funky vibe to it coming from the rhythm and the bass groove of the track and you know they sort of slow the lyrics down or you know the flow of the lyrics has changed a little bit so that fits the beat a little better and I don't know it's just kind of a really cool hip-hop revision of one of my favorite tracks from their last album and I don't know what else to say other than I'm just floored by how well it went over Passion Pit has a new track out titled I'm perfect which I'm actually pretty enamored with I've never really been a big Passion Pit song for me their music has always been so sweet that it's almost felt cultish like you know I always have to have a smile on my face or something if I'm something I think to it or that you know the other people if I go to a Passion Pit concert or something and this is just a you know a stereotype or an idea in my head everybody is wearing like mom jeans and the same like you know brightly colored yellow shirts with a smile on it and more room like you know that's always kind of been a turn-off for me for passion pits music but this track over here does not seem overly sweet you know the drums have kind of a gritty snappy punchy quality to them and you know the keyboard sound really great and kind of raw and natural as do the vocals you know the it's not gussied up like I've heard a lot of passion pits music B in the past and it's actually really good tuned there's something kind of Postal Service ish about it that I like quite a bit thundercat has a new great track out titled friendzone which has a great great bass groove to it great drum beat to it Thunder cats vocals kill it as well I actually like this song a little bit more than the last single that came out from this record which was a little too smooth at some points in my opinion but this track over here a lot punchier a lot more fun pharmacon who continues to be one of the most horrifying artists working today has a new track out called no natural order and it's absolutely fucking frightening and every single time I see a picture in promotion of this album this this one over here with all these like greasy fucking fingers like rubbing all over her face it's just like something out of a nightmare you know she just does such a great job of like getting pictures of things and using the remoter work that are just really gross and just like turned my stomach or something whether it be like the maggots or you know whatever other shit turns up on her music I don't want to look at it it's gross it grossed me out all these greasy fingers all over me like god I want to take a fucking shower if you're looking at this picture but the song itself is of course you know that really heavy rough in-your-face nasty high volume death industrial power electronic shit that she's in doing so well up until this point her last record was a little bland in my opinion at some points but this long felt like really heavy really in your face just like everything was so crisp and clear and animalistic on this track it was amazing and I'm hoping to see that sort of on her next record only hear anything obscured I don't hear anything tucked away in the background I don't hear anything that sounds pink or phantom I want it just like all just super high definition just horror auditory horror in my face and that's what the song brought so I'm hoping to hear more Laura Marling has a new track out titled next time which is smooth beautiful it is fucking um what I'm looking for is relaxing and it's gorgeous it's well-crafted she is one of the most gifted singer songwriters out there today he's got a lot of great things going for her last several records have been pretty solid so I'm looking forward to her new album over here I'm also looking forward to the new Mount Erie album Phil L from has a new track out titled Ravens which is another supremely depressing song from this forthcoming album do the research you'll understand why it's so sad you know I've already talked about it I don't want to get too much into it now because I'm going to talk about it in the review and it's really upsetting to talk about you know so of course this track is soul-crushing as well and you know it's just like a beautiful acoustic cut a lot of great things going for it believe me and finally I'm going to leave it on Animal Collective kinda bonkers kind of bunker as a kind of bomb gars Animal Collective have a new EP out following up what I think is probably their most lackluster album so far in their discography unfortunately but I like this single quite a bit not only do I like the lyrics and I kind of like the story and the theme of what's being you know told in the song kind of reflecting on the world at large and sort of what makes it so crazy and all the things you know around you so crazy but I kind of like the kookiness of the instrumental here because it doesn't seem as I don't know I guess part of my issue with the last record was that some of the sounds were off didn't really sound that interesting and some of the tunes were just like really under written this felt like a well-crafted sharp pudgy tune every sound and the track sounded awesome you know really vibrant really colorful really overwhelming and really interesting you know sort of that wow factor that mmm how do they do it factor is sort of back in the fold I would say and you know I'm just kind of excited to hear this EP you know some people I've heard or kind of a underwhelmed by it but you know I'm hoping to actually be surprised by enjoy at least more than the last record because I don't want to be in the position where I'm like I don't like animal collectors anymore because you know they come out with so many great records so many records that I like I don't want to feel like I'm in a position where I'm just like you know not interested to hear their music anymore because you know certainly in the past they've proven themselves to be one of the most creative and boundary-pushing artists working today and I still think they have that potential within them to continue in that fashion into this decade - and possibly into the next so you know kinda bonkers definitely loving this track and those are my favorite tracks of the week that is the weekly track roundup and I hope you guys enjoyed I hope I made some recommendations for you here that you can check out and you know get into and all that shit and you're the best remember Discogs app Amazon Associates link t-shirts are also down there in the

L-H9kLomfwQ,hi everyone music-industry tanto here the music industry guy and it's time for a very late and a very lazy set of hot takes on this year's Grammy Awards the Grammys are a long-running American Music Awards show where the music industry gives itself a series of gramophone shaped hand jobs in front of an audience of people who watch every year I don't know why I have made it no secret that I have a distaste for the Grammys because they suck but you know what I already made a video sort of talking about the the releases and the artists who I would have loved to have seen get Grammys of this past award show so let's let's go into the list of winners here and see if any of it panned out without further ado let's just jump right into the mud with the album of the year over here you know I remember saying in my video that I wouldn't mind if Adele won this category and I thought Adele would win this category because she moves those units she gets those sales man she gets those sales I don't know what else to tell you but now seeing that she got it Beyonce came out with the better record she came out with the better album it was more conceptual it was more thoughtful it was more adventurous musically and sonically it was a challenging album for her and her fans whereas Adele's last record just kind of seemed like more of the same with a few songs that sounded a little more radio-friendly for sure it wasn't that bad of a record but Beyonce came out with the better album come on it's so frustrating and then looking down at song of the year I mean Adele hello I probably would give it to her over formation and over the rest of the tracks there I mean my mother-in-law she's been singing that song ever since severs the day at the radio and the amount of songs she's been singing off that Beyonce record zero that song and Adele are just so omnipresent even though that track didn't come 20:15 did that track not come out in 2015 but you know that just kind of goes to show you that the Grammys are so desperate to celebrate Adele at any opportunity that they get they will just put her on every pedestal that they can because again they just want to be like hey guys remember buying records this person sells records please buy this person's records and then going down further and a Hello also one record of the year like Beyonce got snubbed at all these categories Beyonce couldn't get one of these she of one of these Grammys the only other person who I was kind of pulling for in these categories with Sturgill Simpson you know he did come out with a great record although I did not think that was going to win Album of the year it was a good album uh adele also won the Best Pop solo performance Jesus Christ gimme a break shout out to chance the rapper you know he got Best New Artist hopefully that doesn't end up being for him sort of like a a clinch on his career as it ends up being for so many other artists who end up getting labeled with the best new artist a title a lot of these people you don't have appeared from for a little bit which again is kind of weird calling chance the rapper best new artist he's been pretty established for a while now the Grammys are acting as if like coloring book is like his first project or something as far as best pop duo and group performance 21 pilots and I guess that's the best one there that's the best one there I mean I pretty much despise every other track here yeah every other track here oh Best Pop Vocal album Adele swish bye get out of here of course the chainsmokers would get Best Dance Recording but goddamn foon won that dance an electronic record category and that's good you know I wasn't crazy about that record but it was certainly the most creative in the grouping that was presented that's rap performance so happy chance one in this category because you know I do better one but it would be it's the best song there it's the best song there I mean panda no pops I'll know all the way up that schoolboy q song is okay but it is not as hot as that chance but what is ultimately disappointing over here is that Drake one in the best rap song performance against Beyonce so Beyonce subbed again dran and little yachty broccoli probably would have went with that song or Kanye West with chance the rapper on ultralight beam and then Kanye West with Rihanna on famous not only is hotline bling the weakest of the songs in this grouping but this is not for best rap song this is best rap song performance and what about Drake's performance on this song is all that great he's just monotone and emotionally flat for the duration of the track it's not one of Drake's better performances Kanye West and chance the rapper come off way more exciting and passionate on ultralight beam Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar on freedom are fucking incredible and draymond little yachty that was one of the most fun combinations on any song of the year so how does drink get away with best rap and some performance I really don't know because if we're talking performances that was the most boring out of all of them but the thing is hotline bling most likely got the most buzz and sold the most copies and is obviously the most accessible across a wider margin of music listeners I mean I like hotline bling but it's the blandest song in the bunch there of course they're going to be older listeners who probably aren't going to get down with DRAM and little yadi the beyonce track is maybe a little too radical and political for some listeners and you know the kanye west songs the it's Kanye he's going to rub some people the wrong way the Drake song is the friendliest it's the least polarizing so of course the Grammys are going to give it to that now we're talking best rap song and hotline bling wins again despite the fact that there are tracks that are better no problem is also in this category ultra light beam is also in this category I mean I could sort of see hotline bling competing in this category a little better because I do think it is a good catchy fun tune but there were tracks I would have picked instead I'm so happy chance got best rap album of the year I would have been absolutely depressed if it went to Drake's views because that record was god-awful shoutout to pentatonics for their collaboration with a Dolly Parton on Jolene because of that that best country duo/group Performance Grammy sword went to them so that that's good on them best country album Sturgill Simpson I thought that that was going to happen I'm glad that it happened but Best Rock performance I mean it went to David Bowie black star and David Bowie actually got category after category after category in this year's Grammys Best Rock song and the best alternative music album and it's good to see that he's getting Grammys for black star because it is a great record it is a great album but the thing is David Bowie has been released in great music for years and I don't know you know the Grammys what their takes were on his earlier records or if his early records were even submitted for Granny's again I'm not really sure but I don't know it's just annoying that it took David Bowie's death for his music to actually start earning some Grammys I know he has like a Grammy for a music video like from back in the day so obviously the Grammys have been aware of his music for a long time now and the fact that again the dude had to die it's upsetting and also upsetting is Megadeth winning best metal performance against periphery Korn Gojira and Baroness Baroness obviously being the best of them god I would have been less upset about this if Korn won the goddamn Grammy this topia is Megadeth's worst album period it's their worst record I would rather listen to periphery do the same thing that they do on every song and every album with the price is wrong and at least Gojira they're a little more cutting edge I don't know what's going on the metal performance category is totally fucked Cage the Elephant tell me I'm pretty for Best Rock Album it's not bad but we all know that Weezer records better oh here's Beyonce she got best music video for formation it's a good music video and the best urban contemporary album basically the category where they just group in the black musicians and like okay you can win in this category here's the category you can win in which now that I look at it is sort of weird category to begin with because gallant and Anderson pack their music doesn't even really qualify to me as being urban contemporary I don't know man the Grammys they screw it up every year they screw it up every year so I guess I shouldn't be surprised and I'm not I'm truly not surprised the Grammys bad picks bad choices over here disappointment again the best thing about it is all the you know the awards chance the rapper won but the and I'm glad that Sturgill Simpson got some recognition but it's hardly it's hardly a consolation but there you go those are my thoughts on all these Grammy picks all these Grammy fails of 2017 and let lets let's just cross our fingers and hope that the next Grammy Awards is less disappointing transition have you given these Grammys a listen now what did you think about all these works picks at the Grammys had I'm livid that the chainsmokers accepted what a date at Bowie's posthumous Awards and all sorts of

awesome forever 
WcuNF95EUls,Queens anyhow tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new quali crisp album being you is great I wish I could be you more often Kweli chris is one of the Troy true weirdos he's back with a new album following up one of his shortest and oddest releases yet innocent country and a little instrumentals album that he put out not too long after that lullabies for the broken brain now if you're unfamiliar with Chris's music he's always had a bit of an odd streak which can make his music a bit of a difficult pill to swallow I mean whether you like this guy's music or not song was like super and drug fests mm - you just don't forget these songs because sometimes chris writes songs in such a way where you're listening to something that's equal parts alternative hip hop song and dark comedy sketch chris is certainly an acquired taste to say the least a lot of his beats consist of very simple loops very simply structured songs lots of obscure in these instrumentals too and as far as his rapping his flows read more like spoken word a lot of the time than they do rap and his voice has this really nasal tone to it that throws a heap of cynicism and and tongue-in-cheek humor onto his lyrics and it's so dry God is it dry like Chris's music is not very visceral or aggressive it's very very heady it's like watching the most fraser iasts episode of Frasier or like one of Adult Swim's early programs that was more fascinated with entertaining itself than it was anybody that was actually watching it and if you're not enjoying it if you don't get it the joke's on you and while being you in some respects is quality Chris as usual I do think this is his most difficult and most ambitious album yet because you have well over an hour of material on this thing and Chris's eccentric tendencies continue to drive him to make songs that are really standoffish and emotionally complicated like the weird mantra like repetitions on the song in case I lost myself and a crowd and ka la la 9r a crowd and Kato - I lost or the full one-minute of quality Chris pretty much saying my heart go on my heart go at the very end of the song Popeye it's like trying to have a frustrating conversation with someone who refuses to make eye contact and only responds in in one word replies and sometimes the hooks on these tracks can be kind of unengaging or not that well organized so they leave the verses feeling uh Nemus eyes and this happens even when the verses are good even there are elements of these tracks that I like in the case of Popeye I just am in ambered with just how beautifully sad and downtrodden that song is and while the mood of this album is difficult there is something about it that is just so intriguing I can't kind of take my ears off of it I can't quite put my finger on it there was a tension within me while I was listening to this record kind of like I was listening to a really obtuse Captain Beefheart album but instead of really complicated free out-of-control instrumentation we're talking complicated free out-of-control emotions and that's what makes this album kind of a tough chew rather than Chris just merely rapping about having an existential crisis on the song birthdays he sounds like he's smack dab in the middle of one which in a way makes it kind of a weaker song because the performance is kind of off but then again it's so emotionally potent it's like a piece of performance art or something but a lot of the time though Chris does make this album pretty easy to listen to for at least an alternative rap fan with a strong subject matter in a really great sense of humor like on the song buddies which kicks the album ah the song about self-love and he's basically just spitting on this song about being his own best friend and taking himself out to dinner and the song dreamer in the den of wolves which has the most vibrant and bombastic beat on the entire album with these loud blurting horns and heavy beats these chorus vocals that are so manic and wild can't even begin to explain them it's just like a bunch of shouts sort of multi-tracked on top of one another in the track is basically about all the naysayers kind of turning chris away from his dreams of being a rapper this track just has an emotional intensity and an instrumental quality to it that's just insane this is kind of an energy level that I wish the album approached more often though I still do find very sparse cuts on the album like fascinating grass pretty intriguing which is a bit of a posse cut featuring rock Marciano and 87 as well as big tone and even though the song features this really dark Spacey kind of industrial very skeletal beat it's all these funny and very gritty rhymes that are on top of that instrumental that make it so entertaining then there's the awesomely creepy learn to love hate which kind of finds a middle ground between the subtle and the very aggressive moments on this album we're over a boom backbeat and some really eerie instrumentation chris is rapping about like voices in his head hearing the devil in his head it's like listening to Madlib write a song about mental illness under his Quasimodo persona and while I'm mentioning rappers if you're a fan of MF DOOM open mike eagle or like some early Danny Brown I think there's a lot for you to like on this album a portion of this record does kind of lean on these glazed-over jazz rap tracks that if you're not really into Chris's bars and his really soft-spoken kind of ham hiding away in the corner sort of Damir these tracks may not really speak to you but even with a couple of tracks here not really leading a strong impression on me this album still has an incredible flow to it Chris keeps things really engaging and interesting with some cool instrumental switch-up surprise verses from the alt rap elite like lzi and Jean Grey and homeboy Sandman and toward the end of the album the song it's great to be is a reprise of sorts where we have Chris revisiting the hook from the song buddies and in the verses of the song he kind of touches back down on a lot of the themes of self-esteem and self perception explored throughout the album and on the act encore which is a bit of a bookend it's a bit of a closing track for the album Chris introduces that he's going to be playing a couple more songs which in my opinion was a really smart way of sort of sneaking into more bonus tracks and the track listing here that might not have made so much sense earlier on the record All Things Considered I think this is Chris's best most ambitious biggest and most epic album but it's also the most challenging listen I think he's ever pulled together too so it may not be for everybody but not necessarily because I think there's some lackluster tracks on here really it's because of again the emotional complications of this record with pretty much every track here just violently ripping out skeletons from the emotional closet that Chris is just rifling through for about an hour on this thing and while I did take a little while for it to click not just because of the length but just because of what this album is about the tone of the album there are so many good things going for it all the introspective and very personal lyrics pretty focused topics on individual tracks and on the album itself a range of emotions from incredible despair to hilariously smart humor quality guests good production an interesting flow track to track to track I'm feeling a light decent 8 on this album if you're an experimental abstract or alternative hip-hop fan highly recommend that you check this thing out and let's transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just just get angry in the comments if you're angry

mubiVMY-EpM,hi everyone - the knee much tan oh heater the Internet's too much music too much and it's time for a review of the new Jessica hoop album memories are now Jessica hoop is an american-born singer-songwriter who has been at it for a while now she just pretty much hit a milestone with it being 10 years since the release of her official debut album kismet and reading into her back history because truth be told I I didn't really know that much about her going into this album I guess she was put on by the one in the only mr. Tom Waits when my favorite songwriters walking the planet I guess he and his wife helped her grow her career which is pretty funny because I can hear his influence creeping in a little bit on this album especially in some of the rickety and rootsy folk tunes with very raw and noisy recordings this album genre wise stylistically and if you go back into hoops discography you're gonna catch elements of folk music and rock music with kind of an experimental edge you can also catch some punchy electronic beats with kind of a pop appeal to them on the album the house the jack bill or on her debut album kismet there's a you know just some lavishly arranged baroque instrumentation surrounding a lot of those tracks and who also has her sheriff's trip back acoustic cuts - now this is Hoops first solo effort on the Sub Pop Records label following up 2016 s collaborative album with iron & Wine's Sam beam which actually slipped under my radar somehow but listening back to her older music her new album over here certainly stands out in her discography as her most stark and bare-bones effort yet it's cut down it's stripped down it's everything you need nothing you don't the barest of the barest of essentials most of the songs on this thing consists mostly of just Hoops voice with some added vocal harmonies usually tracked by herself I think at least it sounds like her voice and just some guitar may be a little sparse percussion here and there but I don't want to just label this as some kind of just just another folk album because it's it's certainly not that it's not just another songwriters acoustic indulgence going on here this is actually very text satisfying record despite how little sound is going into it with the distant drums and the way that the vocals have been recorded so it sounds like summer very up close up front others are sort of happening in the distance a lot of the guitar tones on this thing are dirty they're blemished they're distorted they're beautifully flawed this album has not been gussied up to sound super clean really the opposite as songs like unsaid and connection it seems like Jessica and her producer do all they can to add as much filth into the mix as possible and this is not surprising considering that she's working with Blake Mills on this album and his production credits the people who rank among his production credits people like Fiona Apple Conor Oberst Alabama Shakes and Laura Marling hoop delivers a very nice variety of sounds on this record we have the very minimal title track memories are now that kicks the entire record off most of the song is anchored by these steady thudding Basie notes that are coming from I don't know a muted guitar or baritone guitar bass I'm not entirely sure but these rough gum gum gum gum gum just very deep and very patient root notes are a rock-solid foundation for the wonderful vocal acrobatics that hoop does on top of them and I like the lyrics of the song too as hoop is singing about sort of kicking somebody out of her life go find someone else's life to ruin telling this person to get moving and this segue is really nicely into the very chilly and close vocal harmonies on the second track which are propelled by these persistent plucked acoustic guitars things take a somewhat routier turn on the song animal kingdom chaotic which features a lot of hypnotic vocal refrains and guitar licks and and rhythms it's almost like a chant of a folk tune in a way because it's so cyclical it just kind of puts me in a you know in escapable kind of endless loop state it's a decent tune but I feel like this track sort of exists to provide this bridge where hoop can just kind of dive into the even roots ear and while they're Simon Says which has this kind of really dirty recording really distant recording maybe the move lo-fi recording on the entire record it has kind of a backwater folk feel to it and I love how in the lyrics hoop starts talking about more modern things despite the fact that the song sounds so old and archaic standout lyric on the record to me www don't forget about life before the internet going on to talk about our pixelated generation I love when an artist doesn't use older sounds as kind of a refuge to get away from the modern world instead comment on it engage with it the song cut connection is the middle point of the record and seems to bring some of the smoother cleaner chillier sounds at the very start of the record together with these roots ear noisier recordings funkier sounds that she was introducing deeper into the album distant drums distorted guitars and background vocals that sound like they were all recorded at once all kind of bleed into each other in a very chant like state again we're sort of hit with this moment where they're putting together this really linear moment in the song where things just kind of loop and loop and loop and kind of hypnotically collide into each other creating this really primal kind of cerebral experience it's kind of this weird lo-fi echoey folk rock that reminds me quite a bit of some of the recordings PJ Harvey has put together on her two recent records OOP turns the clock back even further on songs of old like maybe a few hundred years as this track has like this baroque Fulk quality to it with just this archaic chord progression and a very whimsical vocal melody I'm not really sure if it complements the indie folk and the country twang sounds that we've heard thus far on the record but I can't deny that hoop does this sound just as much justice as she's done almost every other sound thus far on the record as the track is pretty much stunningly beautiful from the harmonized chorus vocals to the subtly arranged instrumentation hanging in the background there is a really a strong sonic thread pulling every single one of these songs together on this album but it's really more of the tunes than the sound that makes this album compelling as a whole case in point the song pegasi which features a chord progression so beautiful and warm that tract doesn't really need anything else other than hoops vocals and some finger picked guitar to sort of carry the track so when there's a beautiful burst of a range instrumentation kind of swelling toward the middle point of the track and kind of complementing the rest of the song throughout it's just an added bonus I'm not quite as convinced by the dodgy demeanor and the sort of loose pacing of the closing track the coming but this is definitely one of the saddest songs on the entire record who definitely finishes this album off in a very dismal display and I'm still left kind of wanting more you know this is nine tracks it's 40 minutes it is satisfying on the whole but I'm really curious as to see where Jessica who posed from here because I love this record I think there are a lot of great things about this album and what's so weird is even though this is far from being Jessica hoops first album I feel almost like I'm recommending a new songwriter here to everybody because going back and listening to her records it's like she reinvents herself almost completely with every new album so listening to this even if this is your first album with her it's kind of like listening to a songwriter artistically reborn in a way and no matter where she moves stylistically at the core of what she's doing especially on this album because this album is very much the core because there's not a whole lot of bells and whistles there's not a less surrounding these tracks at the core of what she's doing she's bringing great songs she's bringing quality lyrics she's bringing tasteful instrumentation she's bringing some good production there's so many great things about this record it is a little bit of a mixed bag and there were a few tracks that felt somewhat redundant in my opinion as they just kind of echoed the same country or the same indie folk vibe that many other tracks did but still feeling a strong Simon to a like eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best was in I reviewed that's HIPPA like if you like please subscribe and please don't don't cry just get pissed off in the comments if you're pissed off okay okay all right it's not a good place to do it please links next to my head other videos subscribe to the channel official website too Jessica who or Jessica who I'm a moron forever 
ZHndE4sxrh4,hi everyone Chinese hound handle healer the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Bey Fiasco album control guys light Lupe Fiasco is a Chicago rapper and someone who you should be familiar with by now as being one of the conscious sorts of lyricists out there a lyrical miracle if you will you might also be familiar with Lu Bay's somewhat shaky trajectory from album to album from his awesome food and liquor to the cool and then to the very disappointing lasers in 2011 Lupe is attempt at a pop crossover here a really huge headache of an electro rap album Lupe was aiming for top 40 on this one but it ended up in in the bargain bin and it wouldn't really be into Lu Bay's last album Tetsuo and youth where I think he really redeemed himself and brought back a lot of the things that made him such a compelling artist in the first place the conceptual 'ti how thoughtful his rhymes were how great he was sort of sticking to a topic telling a story sure there were moments on this album that were a little too cryptic but it was an enjoyable and a very listenable experience on the whole and pretty uncompromising at points too but Drogo slight sounds more like a compromise sounds more like Lupe Fiasco going back into a poppier direction into a more commercial direction it's a part of a weird pendulum swing that he has in his discography where as soon as he drops something that's kind of heady or a little out there he has to go back into okay now we need to do something that's going to appeal to a lower common denominator and I don't know why because if anything is clear from watching Lupe Fiasco fans on the internet and I've interacted with many especially when I do a review that they don't like it's that they love it when Lupe challenges them or presents them with some kind of surprise but having said all that this is not a terrible album it's not a really disappointing album in my opinion who pays attempt appealing to a wider audience goes over much better here than it did back in 2011 and he does it in a way where I feel like he doesn't completely abandon all the things that made people attracted to his music in the first place the first third of this record consists of all of these bouncy track beats and sticky choruses sounds very contemporary very now the song dopamine lit that kicks the entire album off is of course loaded with drug references to sort of play into the title of the album and the title of the song I love the moment on the hook where a Lupe is talking about how you can stream this album on Silk Road and the very hypnotic drug ads rode acid grow guys grow bass hook is a really great ear worm then with the song jump one of the lead singles from this album another banger beat hard-hitting and we have a story song here Lupe is hilariously strong-armed by a female street rapper into sort of boosting her career writing raps for her procuring instrumentals for her there's a feature on here from an artist so I believe his name chiseled she does a fantastic job of kind of personifying this rapper who Lupe has been talking about for the entirety of the song it's one of his best tracks that I think it's released in a while as far as a song that has a story as I'm strong narrative to it the song made in the USA is a banger with a message it's powerful its immense it's tense I love the somber and very epic vocal harmonies hanging in the background the strings working of the track what sound like strings are really great to loop a lyrically is mentioning and diving into all these things the cracks the underbelly of the country the drugs the gangs the violence the racism the police the system at large really but then he goes back to bringing things into more like a personal sort of responsibility perspective on the song GNL where he talks about how points of view and behaviors within the black community continue to self-sabotage idolizing drug dealers or figures like Scarface for the penchant toward violence and the lack of unity also ty dolla sign on this track provides some vocals and he does a fantastic job super smooth super passionate beautiful and the song promises sounds like a really good Drake single now it's at the middle point of the album from the song city of the year all the way to song kill where the album falls into a bit of a low like we have all be very smooth middle-of-the-road tracks that are okay but they're not as urgent as the five songs that preceded them the track kill is a strip club anthem that tried to say something reflective about the strip club without actually being reflective about the strip club like it doesn't say anything smart about the strip club despite the fact that it's kind of giving off that vibe it's giving off that air and there have been much smarter tracks on this topic in my opinion city of the year and the high interlude or head-nodding they're passable but there's nothing all that memorable about them and the song tranquilo obviously an overt drug reference there which features Rick Ross and Big KRIT is just such a mess of a track it's kind of disheveled and organized it's not the best use of these features not only because Rick Ross does nothing whatsoever to enhance Lu Bay's verse that he kicks the album off with because so positive it's still uplifting he's rapid about nutrition he's happened about friendship he's wrapped about being a good person then Rick Ross comes in and does his usual kingpin shit and it's like the the track just loses the narrative so he sounds decent on this instrumental though however big credit this is not really the kind of instrumental I want to hear Big KRIT on it does nothing to play toward his Southern roots or his style so really it's kind of a mess of a track the last third of the record is where Lupe really starts to lose consistency and throw out some of his worst songs on the entire record these are exactly the kinds of choruses and instrumental Lupe fans don't really care for have expressed that they don't care for on numerous occasions and yet he continues to gravitate toward them even though he puts out his weakest material time after time every time he does this like let's pick up the phone where the hook sounds like something off of a John bel ian album it's like just some bad top 40 edge here and white guy strumming guitar hook that doesn't really compliment Lupe style or at least what the style that we want to hear from them anyway it's not designed and wild child' have these sort of disco flavored dance crews hanging in the background that I don't know what audience Lupe sort of has in mind for these songs it's like he's producing tracks for a dancefloor that doesn't exist not only that but these songs just seem kind of out of touch with reality out of touch with the musical tone of 2017 out of touch with the social tone of 2017 out of touch with the tone of the rest of the record honestly the closer is at least likeable Lupe writes this track about how when you're down on your luck when you're at your worst who's going to be there to help you your mama it's your mama's going to be there to help you at your mama who's going to love you unconditionally and I like Lupe sort of writing this endearing track about that and he does it in kind of a very funny tongue-in-cheek way like he puts together a point he puts across a point without sounding too preachy or overly emotional I love the point in the song where Lupe is talking about a mama of the listeners mama saying hey turn that down and I want to hear that that is Edda de but they're now their responses but but they wrote this song for you mama it was definitely one of the funnier in cuter moments on the song it was definitely a heartfelt finish to the record it left the album on on somewhat of a high note even though there were corny moments on the track where he's like you know say you better love your mama more than your your car because Mom mamas love being compared to vehicles but having said all that it did at least somewhat save the finish of the record you know overall this is a decent album I had a great start really consistent well-written smart well produced beginning but then you know the thing really lost steam the second third and then in the last third Lupe completely gave up on consistency so it is kind of a mixed bag but at least a somewhat admirable attempt at creating again you know another commercial project a more wider appealing project for Lupe Fiasco because I know if he lets his artistic and his conceptual whims get a hold of him and take them wherever they want to take them he will do like a really weird hard concept record that even though it will be difficult for his fans to swallow so you know in a way I do sort of get that he may use projects like this as a bit of a release or a bit of a break from doing some like that because a record like Tetsu and when you I can imagine takes awhile to sort of drum up not only in your head but sort of actually execute and record so maybe this is a little breezier a little less stress a little less obligation of a still you know very listenable I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing trip trips for a transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best and what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave it angry comment if you're angry okay

t5dsLZ4wXMQ,but hi everyone talk to the talk tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little think piece here where I give a strong opinion about something I've been thinking about for a while I don't know if you notice but over the past seven years or so there's been a pretty significant sea change going on in rap music taking the genre in directions that artists and fans who were alive and coming of age during the golden era couldn't even have imagined of while hip hop music is more popular than ever and it seems to be permeating every single facet of popular culture it's more fractured than it's ever been as well sonically stylistically culturally no longer is the genre one or two or even three cohesive styles or cultures because now in 2017 in the Internet age the genre has been cut up between the countless unorthodox and experimental sounds that have infiltrated everything from the underground to the mainstream from Death Grips to Kanye West to run the jewels and clipping and Kendrick Lamar just to name a very very select few I could list artists all day but the one artist I would like to focus on in this video is one of the most polarizing to break through in the past few years and that's little yachty now little yadi if you didn't know he's a Georgia rapper a little while back he dropped this little boat mixtape which if you haven't heard it will be one of the weirdest things that you do here in the genre of at least modern hip hop not only because of the glitzy sort of blissful upbeat instrumental the weird double personality schizophrenia concept thing going on between the lyrics but also yachties vocals and his vocal delivery just was really kind of odd somewhat silly amateurish he does not sound like a cold-blooded serious aggressive rapper and as a result of that when I first listened to this thing I thought it was kind of a novelty project but as I gave this thing more and more and more time it sort of grew on me and what is so appealing about this thing sort of revealed itself now I'm not trying to re-review this project over here I'm just saying if you haven't heard this thing please do because in retrospect having her this and trying to keep up with what little yachty has been doing musically lately I think he is a sign of hip-hop spunk phase because in my opinion recently the genre has been kind of splitting off again sonically culturally in much the same way that rock was in the 70s in the 80s I really do think this this is not clique be I'm not just saying little yachty is hip-hop spunk phase just to say it I seriously think that if we don't look back on little yachty as as the marker for this era in hip-hop history he will at least be one of the standout moments that's not to say that little yadi is the most counted or the best rapper out right now it's not what I'm saying I'm saying that this man's music represents a cultural a musical shift in this particular style of music now what qualifies it as punk what makes this Punk to me you know oh what we're the Mohawks Anthony where the where the radical politics you know lil yachty is not exactly rebelling against the system and you know we already have Death Grips Anthony and there's they're super Punk I get that you know but what I'm trying to say here is that little yadi is not perfectly mirroring the fashion of punk music he's not doing that at all and I wouldn't even really define punk music by its radical politics either because there were tons of bands that were not really all that political almost apolitical not every punk group that came out during the 70s and 80s had an anarchist or a hard leftist message in their music and it's not too soon after the late 70s that major labels had their claws in the punk movement were selling and printing records and I'm not saying that these bands are less Punk as a result of that all I'm trying to say here is that punk was a musical it was an artistic movement more than anything and that's what makes a little yachty stand out to me because much in the same way that punk did he's taking these established rules within his genre which over time have become more complex have become more rigid have become more obsessed with technical proficiency and he's completely throwing them out the window in favor of a new approach in favor of a more primitive approach in favor of a more raw and amateurish approach little yadi is no more a drop in the quality of lyrics and hip hop then the Ramones were a drop in quality in guitar playing within rock and while this drop has been happening for a while it's been an ongoing trend I could name numerous rappers like little B and Waka Flocka Flame young thug and even me ghost with Versace artists that over the years have been turning heads and especially older hip-hop fans and artists have been just gawking at them like man this is the new low and lyrics how bad is it going to get what makes a little yachty different those is not just that I don't think he's the worst of the worst that's out right now but I think it's his openness to purposefully buck the tradition of all the hip-hop that's preceded in rejecting the rules and an interview after interview telling old rap fans and artists alike that you know you don't need a hot 16 to make a song you don't need to be able to freestyle you don't need to be able to do this you don't need to be able to do that these are not really the rules by which the game is played any more in interviews I remember the Sex Pistols being similarly unenthusiastic when it came to praising their forefathers and talking about their influences or or the artists or whoever inspires them to do what they do what musicians all right all energy say it's a quick sudha time I don't have any heroes they're all useless already and while this also is certainly a part of an ongoing trend in a lot of contemporary hip-hop what makes the ADI kind of stand out is that he seems conscious of the direction that his music is pushing the genre in he seems aware of how his music sort of fits or rather doesn't fit in the grander scheme of things he's not just doing what he's doing because he's a clueless goon who's just going along with the trap trend because it's just the trend of the moment from when he initially broke out to the present and hopefully into the future little yadi continues to be an outsider within the genre on multiple levels not just with his style and his sound but how he kind of conducts himself within the culture of the genre a lot of it just strikes me and a lot of other people who've been following him as strange as unique and I don't necessarily get the sense from him like I do occasionally for little bee or a young thug that some of the weird things that he's doing are just kind of a cry for attention and I realize a lot of what I'm saying about yachty could also apply to artists like let's say Tyler the Creator but one thing that Tyler did not continue to do which he was doing in the beginning was kind of again buck those traditions and kind of write off the people who preceded him sure there's some early forum posts of him talking down on like J Dilla or Kanye but that rhetoric he shut up really quick the moment the limelight was actually on him little yadi on the other hand couldn't give fewer fucks and as he's doing so he continues to just kind of be this regular goofy kid who is writing the script as he goes along and simply just playing by his own rules as most Punk's did now I'm not saying you got to like the guys music I'm not even really making a statement on the quality of the man's music I'm just talking about simply where he sort of fits into this cultural shift that's going on within rap right now and I await your pissed off responses in the comments I guess because I'm not sure if too many people will be all that happy with what I said but I wholeheartedly believe that it is the case for transition have you given this opinion now listen did you love it DJed it what would your a to hear the best you're the best what should i opinion eight next hit the like if you like please

dF_sjtxbeek,Bam Bam Bam Bam yeah what up everybody Antron San Juan here Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick raw iPhone review today of this new call ytp accelerator featuring performances from the one and the only mr. Danny Brown who if you didn't know came out with the album of last year and freaking two traps the exhibition amazing album so uh anyway this EP almost slipped on me because it's it's named after Paul Wight it's technically a Paul Wight EP but Danny Brown is on half of the thing and these tracks sound like songs that could have made it onto a trout to the exhibition but in a lot of respects Paul his beats they really kind of feel the show especially with their being instrumental versions of the two songs accelerator and lion's den featured on the album over here and also you know while a lot of these moments on these songs sound like cups sound like a musical spot that could have been on a track of the exhibition I see why they wouldn't have made it onto the record accelerator lyrically don't really add too much more the album that the other songs didn't already in lion's den features a Danny Brown flow that I've heard so many times on so many tracks that it's it's not necessarily exciting at this point you know III think it was you know probably the best decision to either have these songs just be afterthoughts or just off the album entirely but having said that what really does steal the show again are the instrumentals accelerator has kind of tent but the best of us but but what about the black wizard that just does not let up and they're these weird noisy guitars that kind of I don't know just layer over one of another cascade or over one of another one another in this really kind of psychedelic way there's even a soul at the back into the song which is full rough not the best composed solo in the world you know but it definitely kind of brings a gnarly tone and vibe song that I like a lot there's certain rawness to this track that is like very you that's a really strong rock vibe to it you know so cool that this song and so many other tracks off of atrocity exhibition sort of had this really strong rock instrumentation tone to them but still you know feel like hardcore hip-hop songs still feel like true blue hip-hop songs it does feel like Danny is crossing over genre lies or anything you know and in a lot of that is due to the great production of Paul like I was sort of able to transform these sounds into something that's palatable for another genre entirely for another music listening audience entirely then there's Lions Den which has an equally awesome beat also very tense but I think a lot of the melodies and a lot of the sounds work into this track are a lot smoother there are these really weird sort of playful just odd French vocal samples that are thrown throughout the song they're kind of silly and weird that I like a lot Paul a definitely adds a lot of color to his beats a lot of interesting samples so much so that it just really looks like kaleidoscopic it's just really overwhelming trying to eat it all up but yeah he's sort of really steals the show with his beats on here I understand why this is more of Paul Wight et than it is doing Brown EP but if you're a game Brown fan and you love Danny's last album you're going to like carrying these two songs you're going to like what is brought to the table instrumentally definitely maybe the lyrics aren't the most exciting because again much of what you've heard on atrocity exhibition also kind of explored on these tracks but you know it just because it's not brand spanking new doesn't necessarily mean that it's not worth checking out it's not worth picking up it's not worth listening to so this is just kind of a quick video describing that and just recommending this to anybody who like me this might have sort of flown under the radar because of the labeling because the naming of this EP but good on Paul Wight on getting these tracks out getting these extra Danny Brown songs out there and putting together two more amazing instrumentals which just kind of says to me like I hope they work together again in the future I mean you know obviously I would want to hear something news or the new direction or something refreshing from Paul like and Danny Brown the next time they do work together but still like for them to have come together with so many tracks on atrocity exhibition and then have these two songs over here which are all so fucking awesome and off-the-wall I just sort of wonder how deep that rabbit hole goes because together they just put together some of the most insane hip-hop music I've heard this year so that's it guys just wanted to recommend that to you check out this EP and I will see you in the next video fuller editor

hit up call arts do that Amazon Associates link if you're getting shit on Amazon already and if you're interested in that shirt pick up a shirt let's get into the worst tracks of we kick it off the top of the worst tracks of the week section is this new track from Brooke candy featuring SIA of all people I would not have thought these two would ever end up on the same track especially considering how garish and freaky Brooke Candy's music and obnoxious typically is but this new over this new track of hers it's kind of tame unfortunately there's not really too much special about it it's um I don't know just like some really generic by-the-numbers top 40 songwriting contemporary top 40 songwriting not really too much to say about other than that of course having SIA in the mix adds that epic factor but it's not really enough to make the song all that compelling moving on from there we had this new song from waka flocka flame titled was my dog it's a Gucci Mane disc and it is the camus disc like he sort of goes at gucci mane and the refrain in the hook but like a lot of the deeper lyrics a lot of the deep lyrical cuts in these verses could have been placed into any number of waka songs like it's I'm tired of hearing these half-hearted disses if you're going to diss somebody go at them make a claim tear them down expose something you know that that's that's another horrible thing about this track it exposes nothing that Gucci Mane that we didn't already know you know there's bad blood between you guys I get it and I mean I understand why there is but you're not turning that aggression you're not turning that frustration into a compelling song this diss unfortunately falls really flat but maybe not as flat as the new Coolio song Coolio I'm sorry Coolio he he follows my Twitter account maybe not like technically but every single time I mentioned Coolio or Coolio has mentioned to me he tweets at me he's like are you going to review the track you're going to talk about the track to talk about my music and give me a review Coolio I'm talking about this song over here it's it's not one of your better cuts dude it's pretty lackluster but I don't think it's I don't think it's unsalvageable I could tell that you're spitting fast here you're going crazy you're giving it your all but the mixing is kind of weird I can't really hear you Coolio you're kind of getting drowned out in the beat it's not the best production it's not the best recording I feel like you need to kind of go back to your roots a little bit here and maybe throw some of that pop rap appeal back into the mix you know make a song that people are going to want to you know vibe to have a good time to or something like that I know you've written hardcore tracks before but this is just not one of your better cuts this is not one of your better cuts if you are going to go aggressive like this again it's got to be clear it's got we hard-hitting it's got to be visceral it can't be muddy and sort of you know wishy-washy like this it's just kind of a yes it's like a little bit of nyquil you know it's like fast aggressive nyquil but but you know it's a it's it's salvageable you know keep keep doing it keep doing your thing Coolio and moving on from there what I thought was the worst track of the week is that this new mi a song POW ah mi a unfortunately is continuing on the streak where her vocals her vocal performances her flows are just totally uninspired they're unenthusiastic they're flat they're uninteresting this beat is actually better and more exciting than many of the instrumentals that were on mi A's last album but still she's like in this weird limbo state where mi a her voice just her lyrics are the most uninteresting thing about almost every track she releases and I'm just not sure where the swagger went I'm not really sure where the energy when I'm not really sure where the wit went it's just kind of all out the window at this point sadly but let's move on to the songs that I wanted to mention I wasn't crazy about them man but they're definitely worth getting a nod to they're worth checking out if you're into these artists or if you know sort of the sound I described as something of your interest let's start off with this new designer song outlet not a terrible song from designer and the first song he's released in a while that does not just sound like a future song so good on designer you know it fortunately there's not really a strong of a hook over here but his ad-libs are insane the beat goes hardest fuck and his performance is really amped you know lyrically it's designer you can't expect a whole lot from the lyrical front on this track but it's an okay song it's a listenable song it's definitely better and less awkward than timmy turner you know it's not another panda or anything like that but he's certainly coming closer to pulling together a hit than he was on Timmy Turner moving on from there we have Jenna with the song Bambi Jordana you may remember I think he ended up in my worst segment in the last episode part of my complaint was that I have such a hard time kind of seeing the direction he's moving within his music versus sort of what he puts out there in terms of like here's how I look here's it and not that you know how an artist looks matters but he just shoves it in your face like he wants you to sort of pay attention to him because he dresses so snazzy and da da da da da and it just kind of struck me as odd that like okay you kind of got this vintage classic look to the way that you dress everywhere that you go but your music just kind of sounds like any old contemporary like rap or R&B song that could be dropping today so it's like you know what are you really doing but this new song over you're kind of surprising it's not a perfect song it didn't blow me away but it's the first time I've heard his music and it sounds like he's legitimately kind of mixing the old and the new like we have this kind of strip back trap influenced instrumental here it's kind of a banger and we have a lot of some vocals on this track which have only kind of a kind of an old-school Motown vibe to them I was kind of surprised and it's actually like a beautiful you know set of vocal harmonies a beautiful like vocal lead so I don't know I'm kind of interested to see if he can continue down this road of mixing the old in the new and continue at the same time to drop songs as tasteful and as compelling as this it's really sweet catchy track and you know I'm just kind of waiting to see if you can kind of pull through with this do bigger and better things kind of heading in this direction because this is definitely a step in that moving on from there we have got gotten you this is an Irish rapper I believe from Ireland stand up and this dude is a grime rapper he is kind of eccentric he's a little off the wall with this new song over here shivers and it's kind of nutty it's weird but you know it's a good dry it's a good grind song it's hard-hitting and it's nasty so definitely check that out and that we have montar with the the band the spell or Mantar with the bit with the with the song of the spell excuse me these guys this duo I believe they're still a duo at least when I last heard of them they were still a duo and their music while they did I guess kind of embraced very nicely elements of death metal and a little bit death and roll their music was a little too stripped back for me to be all that excited about you know like just the drums and the guitars and the vocals but now it kind of seems like they're sounding a little bit fuller on this new track over here a little heavier and I like that a lot moving on from there quality Chris with the song birthdays you know I love how eccentric this dude is always I love his weird out there style he sounds like no other rapper that I've ever heard but sometimes he's just he's just so glazed over that it just just punches the wind out of any track that he's recording and this is kind of one of those instances unfortunately I like the concept of the song and the music video of the track is fucking hilarious but unfortunately I feel like a word draw wrong walls kind of overdubbed on top of each other are just a little it was a little much but he does it he does have a new album out give that a shot moving out from there this one surprised me that I put in the met and in the met category considering how much I didn't really care for her last track but that is the the the one the only the great Katy Perry with this new track chained chained to the rhythm featuring Skip Marley I like the instrumental on this track it kind of has a vintage smooth funky groove to it that reminds me of like carly Rae Jepsen's emotion Daft Punk's last records a little bit a new wave a little bit of disco mixed into there and you know it's not this crappy high-gloss totally just like pristine overly sanitized sound that I usually get from like an epic Katy Perry single my one gripe with this track though is that the chorus is awful and it's not like there aren't good elements to the chorus it's that you know you have this dance dance dance portion of the chorus you have this chain to the rhythm portion of the chorus and then you have a third section of the chorus and instead of just picking one of these and honing it to the point where just makes a good hook she decided to throw in every dumb idea that she had and just make this clunky monstrous overbearing hook that like never ends never resolves never really settles into an awesome exciting groove that just like lets off into this cathartic release it just kind of hands you one somewhat unfinished idea after the next and it's like okay that's that's our weird mutant hook with limbs growing out in every fucking direction so it's it's a really weird chorus but like it I like the instrumental vibe that she's going for here I like the the verses are like the best thing about the song I like the grooves on the verses too there are some good things here it's an improvement in some respects but it's it's like one of the most messily written tracks I've ever heard from Katy Perry moving on from there into the best tracks of the week what were my favorite tracks of the week I should give a shout-out to the Jesus and Mary Chain with the song always sad really catchy direct and somewhat the laid-back alternative rock song there that I thought was pretty good Hercules and love affair with controller has this really odd like synth and post-punk dance vibe to it that I thought was really chilly really cool really odd and just kind of off-kilter and off-putting you know sound I'm almost gothy to an extent um yeah I just like how there's something sour about the mood of this track though it is a dance song there's something sour about the vibe of the track that I thought was a kind of creepy and really weird definitely superior Drake's controller or controller whatever you want to call it moving on from there Jen Lachman with the song evening prayer though his last big single I thought was one of his worst yet this track over here kind of takes that same campy silly fun tongue-in-cheek vibe that that song had but actually comes through with a compelling song a fun uppity just very happy-go-lucky groove it seems like he's trying to make like the most upbeat music of his career with this forthcoming album I hope that ends up being the case and that more of the songs fall on this side of the fence as opposed to the other side of the feds that his last single did moving on from there we have Shu Shu with the song get up one of their most spar and weird singles that they've dropped so far but the payoff at the end is amazing so you know definitely go into this thing expecting some very open spacious rhythms and weird weird weird vocal performances from Jamie shoutout to him also power trip song nightmare logic this band is probably going to put out one of the best thrash records of 2017 I'm going to say it even if I end up having to eat those words later look for this album coming out on Southern Lord Records soon because every single time the span drops the track it just sounds great it's so aggressive it's so hard it's so fucking heavy it's kind of bringing back that old-school sound but staying true to the rawness but a head kind of has that new heaviness to it I like it a lot moving on from there we have Jessica hoop who has a new album coming out very soon on Sub Pop Records actually just came out I believe yeah I just came out this past Friday and that this track memories are now is a beautiful beautiful song with this really sparse like Tintin like that is the groove of almost this entire track which is held by what sounds like either this guitar this bass this baritone guitar not totally sure a little bit of distortion on there and she's just kind of playing the root notes of the chords and then over that she has these awesome vocal harmonies that are beautiful and are passionate and are wonderful and the best thing about this track it's a good tune even though it's a strip back as it is the tune is great whether you have this sea of instrumentation in the background or like in this case almost no instrumentation in the background it's so sweet on the ears it's so passionate it's so well written it's so well crafted so I'm really looking forward to this new album of hers sounds like it's going to be this really skeletal but well assembled you know piece of work you know and I love a good album that can do that you know that has everything it needs nothing it doesn't and just the material of source material the foundation material is so great that it just shines so brightly despite the fact that it's not on this huge foundation of you know amazing production crazy arranged instrumentation I love an artist who can do that moving on from there estranged you who is a UK rapper who has a very weird and grimy and nasty and left-field album coming out very soon through high focus make sure you give him a lesson because he does seem like a talented and weird individual and finally I want to mention one more track over here whoever did this was someone at Target I don't know what whatever whatever dude in whatever board room came up with this idea you're a fucking genius because this this weak little yachty and carly Rae Jepson are on the same song and it's a cover of Rob basis though I can't even say it because I'm so excited Rob basis it takes two and it's fucking awesome I don't know what else to say it's not an awesome like not only is my quill made its kind of reproduction of this instrumental nice I like the kind of nasty distorted bass line that he works into the mix but also little yachty for someone who everybody says you know oh he sucks at rapping he can't rap even he himself says oh I'm not a rapper I'm not a rapper I mean that's kind of a cliche at this point but still he comes through here and he kills it not only does he stay true to what Rob bass originally did on that song but I feel like the jokes and the lyrics that he writes are totally true to him you know it's Ortoli been totally put his personality forward Carly Rae Jepsen does a great job on the hook she does a good verse too and there's nothing really about the shots that I don't like you know it's rarely that I hear a cover especially a hip-hop cover like they aren't too many hip-hop covers it's rare that I hear a cover like this and I'm just blown away by it but like it's it's so much more than just the star power you know of course I listen to this because of who's on this track but like they did such a fucking great job of sort of recreating the feel good amped pumped up exciting magic of this song because I remember back in the day when the song was somewhat fresh and now to sort of hear this revision in 2017 that it kind of brings me that same excitement when I was a kid and I would hear the song on the radio it's pretty awesome so uh yeah those my favorite tracks of the week the songs that was kind of met on the worst tracks of the week and again down there in the scription make sure to check out the shirt amazon associates link call arts and the good people over at discogs because they have that fantastic app out which we will be talking about for the next few videos in the best worst tracks because they are sort of doing a sponsorship for us so shout out to those guys again and that's it guys thanks for watching see you next video forever 
ORRDA5YFhcc,federal judge position in the late 1980s he was rejected hi everyone set into the hired hand out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Santha album process Sampat is a UK singer-songwriter who I have been waiting and waiting for him to release a full-length commercial album for a while really since the release of subtracts self-titled 2011 album where he stole the show on numerous tracks with his moody beautiful gorgeous wonderful English crooned that have an eerie similarity to that of James Blake's and and I know some people may not be happy with that comparison and I myself am not completely happy with that comparison either I think they're different artists but the similarities are there and if you don't believe me I was listen to this thing and my significant other walked in and was just like oh new James Blake this new James Blake the similarities are there but but the thing is is that really in the case of Samphan and James Blake it's a similarity in the tone of their voice as far as their songwriting styles their lyrical styles the way that they arrange instrumentation especially with this new album as the years pull on the differences between Blake and Sampha are ever clearer whether or not sample sounds like one of his contemporaries has never been an issue for me with his music it's more been the fact that especially with his EP that he dropped back in 2013 I think the songs were kind of unfinished unfocused the instrumentals way to skeletal to get excited about since the release of that EP I know he's been working with a lot of bigger artists over the past few years sort of doing a lot of Co songwriting but what I really wanted was an album and even though it took a while process is the finished focused and passionate collection of sample songs that I've been waiting for so maybe the weight was worth it considering all of the very tasteful and finely tuned songs on this thing the futuristic mix of soul and R&B that you get out of the instrumentation which at this point will most likely have a larger audience than it would have maybe five years ago the sound on this record or a beautiful mix of electronic and acoustic sounds since patches from another galaxy beautiful sequence loops but you know there's also some gorgeous piano on here Santa's wonderful voice and some live drums occasionally too there is a decent amount of instrumental variety on this album but I will say that the mood is somewhat uniform pretty much for the entirety of the album you're getting all of these songs that are heart broken they're sad it's moody it's kind of lovesick and its fervent a lot of the lyrics on this record are pretty poetic a little dodgy samples not trying to hit you over the head with what exactly he's singing about all the time you got to read into it a little bit and his singing voice while there is a lot of passion and emotional potency I think a lot of power to it there's a shyness to it as well it seems like he's he knows when to lay it on hard lay it on thick get super heated and he knows when to dial it back to sort of build tension or pull the audience into this lull of all the blue feelings he's wrapped this album in and I'm also really enamored with the instrumentation he surrounds these tracks with whether it's the song blood on me which is the most punchy and instantaneous track on the entire record kicks off with these punchy drum loops but which I love it's so hard it's very clunky but then all of a sudden this really ominous piano lead comes in and the track instantaneously goes from funky to moody the chorus I can only describe as orgasmic despite that being a little bit of a corny overused word but orgasmic nonetheless explosive instrumentation and one of samples best vocal performances on the entire record I also love the instrumental fire that's kind of burning underneath the song chorus sings it does take a little while to get going but once it does the instrumentation picks up the pace is really fast a lot of the melodies are really busy and then behind it it's like all this crazy live drumming propulsive fills really electrifying of course Santha also provides some really straight back skeletal slow burners as well like the opening track 100 Celsius plastic a good tone setter for the album the very glossy heavenly closer which I do think is a little under written as it does and somewhat abruptly but I think my favorite ballad on the entire album is no one knows me like the piano a track that is a piano ballad about the instrument that Santa is literally playing on he sort of things about the piano as if it's this a confessional place for him where he can sort of be himself reveal another side of himself tell the truth exposed things emotionally that he might not be able to talk about otherwise but a lot of these other tracks that may start off kind of easygoing do have some surprises whether it be the chorus kind of you know bursting being very cathartic or there's a significant instrumental change in the last third like on the song Timmy's Prayer which originally swings like a beautiful old school like spiritual but eventually we get all of these like tense bustling electronics sort of pushing and propelling the last third of the track into this great finish as Sam Poe's singing so hard he's like crying out about up the song under is another awesome tune on here beautifully eerie I love all the very strange and somewhat unsettling and chilling background vocals that Santa multi-tracks himself singing about gasping for air and about manipulation in this relationship that's kind of the subject matter of the song you know there are a lot of highlights on this record I love Santa's performances on this record love the production on this record love his voice on this record the writing on this record is quality too there are a few tracks that I thought were kind of so-so and blended in a little bit too much into the very same E Moody sad for Lauren vibe of this entire project and there were at least several points where I thought that the electronics or maybe the instrumental changes that we're trying to go a little harder a little more exciting get really visceral could have been a bit more explosive the electronics occasionally do come off kind of stale or stiff but Santa's piano playing and especially his saying does a lot to warm up these sounds warm up these electronics give them a lot of soul and energy so moving forward I mean those are the kinds of tweaks I would love to see in Santa's music but as of right now there are so many great things going for him and this record I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing to transition

jxSVnQed0OY,hi everyone its Holi graham-cracker here me next because he has music there and it's time for review of iron iron Regan's this is new crossover ministry this is the latest full-length LP from this Virginia thrash metal band not their first rodeo and it's their second full-length LP for the relapse Records label and I was pretty excited to listen to this because from the singles that I had heard they sounded like a pretty competent return to the awesome days of punk thrash hybrids in the 80s but I am NOT taking on this album all by myself I have brought on none other than the great mr. Mike C town of deaded hip hop and you know his own YouTube channel as well both of which are linked down there in the description which you should check out because those guys drop some great reviews and we are going to be doing a bit of a convo on this new record over here and let's let's just see where it takes us Tran ok and here we are through the magic of the internet mr. Mike c-town is with me we're going to be talking it out hashing it out over this new iron Regan album crossover ministry Mike thanks for coming on dude thank you for inviting me I'm surprised you came back on here after after our intense beef after how much we hated each other the bad blood everything I didn't realize we hate each other no internet open it never we've never hated each other yeah some internet alternative fact okay well you know it all started with the bowling-green massacre you know that's uh you know we just have really different viewpoints on that and yeah and which will never be resolved so hopefully you know music can bring us back together so let let me let me know what you thought of this iron Reagan album in general you know some general thoughts on this record oh well first off thank you for once again bring me out of my element because I have never really given these guys a fair shot you know I heard different pieces here and there but I just kind of dismissed it but listening to the full album I have to actually say that this is really good I haven't gift given a lot of these retro brass bands a lot of my attention because honestly it's just when I put it on it just makes me want to go listen to the original stuff like you know tidal tendencies or something absolutely absolutely when I put this on all I want to do is I want to go listen to violence I want to go listen to Exodus you know but this was still it was good if somebody gave this to me and I didn't know who it was I would honestly think it came out in 88 you know it sounds off in it it sounds like a bunch of dudes in fucking high top Reebok and sweatpants you know I mean so in that respect I think they did a good job you know the goofy lyrics the dick joke type of lyrics they also have the kind of political sort of lyrics yeah political but it's like it's very doomsday --is-- like it's very negative it sort of takes the current political climate and pushes it into into a sense of extremity that like kind of gives you this urgency like it's really dark yep absolutely just like all the old thrash bands is just like the drug kingpin you know it's authentic in that way that hmm yeah I mean I guess the one thing that sort of makes them stick out a little bit is that it just has this modern production sound that you would expect for most relapse records bands you know like sort of that thick heaviness that you know like a group would be shooting for if they were really into converge or something like that or if they just wanted to compete with how heavy every other metal band sounds right now and in that sense it does leave the album feeling a little like you know kind of a one-dimensional like a lot of the songs kind of have the same vibe for the most part even though the band does kind of stick to that same thrash crossover style for a lot of these tracks many of which are very short so it's not like this this album overstays its welcome I think it's just under 30 minutes or something what did you think of moments like a megachurch which really stuck out which had like the clean vocals and they were obviously singing about like religion kind of exploiting its parishioners and kind of like pushing an ideology but like would you think of them kind of going in that vocal direction on that track oh that's actually a song I was going to ask you about but when I first heard it the first thing that came to mind was to us all tendencies because if he has that same kind like if you listen to feel like shit deja vu era suicidal past those same kind of Mike your vocals and the song being about church I actually kind of thought it was a toss-up to send me your money off of a life camera revolution I don't know if any of that was on purpose but I think them trying to do the mic near vocal plus the topic I think it was kind of intentional ya know most definitely I mean it's it seems like even if it's not intentional to reference that specific point again it's just like they really kind of stick to every single theme and every single like piece of the recipe of a lot of these thrash crossover bands from the 80s you know I feel like a little DRI in the mix in there too for sure like especially during the shorter tracks you know in our members most certainly like some highlights on here I love more war more more more more and you know moments like a fuck the neighbors can be pretty funny and it was like they have a good sense of humor I guess it's just kind of a matter of like does the I know you said that it doesn't make you want to go back and listen to those older bands and I guess it didn't do that for me either like I wasn't sort of immediately scrambling for an album of that era to listen to instead but I guess the question beyond that is did it really kind of stick out to you in any sort of way like would you return to this record like it was fine while it was on but like would you want to listen to this again or do you kind of see yourself sort of sticking to the bands that so obviously influenced them oh no I was actually saying if we were not reviewing this I wouldn't listen to full album I was just turn this off and then well the Nuclear Assault or suicidal or violence give me violence was the first in the Canon when I put this on I still think it's good and I think that my issues with this particular genre are specifically my issue because I don't have a problem with retro hip hop out of a problem with retro anything else but for some reason with retro thrash it doesn't so this album while I thought it was good while listening to it I highly doubt looking once again I mean I think there are some newer retro thrash bands that do add a little bit of their own kind of specific personality in my opinion I think municipal waste is definitely one I think Ghul is definitely one the way that like everything that they sing and everything they do like every album they put out as a story and there's like a strong influence from the comic book world coming through on the narratives and like old horror movies and the stuff that they sang about but for me iron Reagan it's like they do the sound justice but they don't really do anything to make me want to return to it you know not just because sort of like you you're already familiar with the source material that they're pulling from so heavily they don't really put a new refreshing spin on it other than just kind of a slightly heavier sound but that heavier sound is kind of a double-edged sword because it does make the album feel so uniform that it's kind of like all the songs blend together a little bit if you're not paying attention to sort of the funny choruses and the kind of weird repeatable lyrics and refrains that they put together every now and then some of which hit some of which not so much yeah you're absolutely absolutely on the same page for the majority of these type of bands the only two that actually can pick them up at the only two that actually stick out in my mind that ban Spectre oh yeah definitely something different and toxic Holocaust that's only because they do that kind of first wave of black metal type of thing you know they're a bit different but the rest of these bands to me they just all kind of get thrown into a bucket and none of them sound different now I'm not saying that the stuff that I listen to back in the 90s that that old dress all that shit's not the same - but I'm in my 30s man I don't really care to go you know and listen to new bands that are doing the same sound that these bands did way way way back when yeah I hear you and I mean I didn't necessarily grow up listening to this stuff but you know when I go back and I listen to those older bands I kind of sense I don't know a stronger sense of excitement you know maybe because the recordings do feel a little more raw and wild and kind of have more of a human touch to them then I think this one does I mean certainly the risks are there you could fucking mosh to this thing you know but uh once you hear this band and if this sound is new to you I Mike and I would obviously recommend going back and listening to any number of the older groups that we've just mentioned here and also you know I checking out those groups that might just mention as far as the new ones toxic all across yes I've reviewed them too and they're pretty great their last record was great all right I think I think we've pretty much kind of hashed it out on this album I don't know if there's too much more to say other than that this album is pretty meat and potatoes and by the numbers and I think we both kind of set our piece on it yeah I definitely don't want to sound negative I I don't I don't want to put the idea out that the way I'm thinking about this is the way everyone else should I mean you should just consume music and consume as much as you want but just for me personally if this doesn't it doesn't interest me while it's on yeah I'm head-banging I'm fucking through a little a little finger you know hands wind up but when this was when this is when I don't know after about two or three songs I'm just kind of I'm over it yeah I'm a sort of same here I mean I did listen through the album you know several times at least and you know I found myself mildly entertained by it but I'm not really in a rush to come back to it anytime soon I don't really think I'm probably going to listen to it again at any point this year so you know if not now then when so yeah there you go I mean I'm I sort of see the mayor in what the band is doing and again I think that they definitely have the talent to kind of live up to this style but while there are elements that I like overall I'm kind of indifferent toward it I'm feeling a roughly like a strong five to light six on this thing Mike sort of seems you know somewhat admirable of what the band is doing but you know sort of been different too at the end of the day acid and I think we're gonna leave it at that Mike thanks for coming on and I want to urge everybody down in the description box to check out Mike's channel where he does a lot of alternative hip hop reviews and metal reviews and of course you know check out the the great dead end hip hop YouTube channel where they have these fantastic roundtable reviews that sometimes end in bloodshed because guys all have some pretty strong opinions yeah we're definitely trying to fight more in 2017 no morphine make hip-hop reviews violence again entire 17 all right you know who it is Anthony Fantana here it's Mike C town and and thank you for watching guys forever 
yNmta1gFjxU,hi everyone Anthony Santana here you know who it is and it's time for another installment of our stinky series fright react to another culture writers writing or maybe video blog or something like that and today I'm going to be talking about a recently released piece of work by a writer and a commentator for the website Infowars mr. Paul Joseph Watson this guy hails from the UK and he is no stranger to controversy with a lot of his videos being about hot-button topics such as terrorism and immigration and black lives matter and social justice I've been watching his videos for a while I find him pretty entertaining even if I disagree with a great deal of what he says he's essentially the oniy Cian of the red pill community and he recently dropped a video called the the truth about popular culture it's not the first time he's spoken on this topic of specifically popular music but this is definitely his longest and shittiest video on the subject popular culture is more vulgar vapid self-absorbed hedonistic and dehumanizing than any other time in living memory I can feel the red pills raining down on me the red pill rain is coming is that he's about to drop a truth bomb everybody uh from here in the video Paul D cries how much of a talentless shit show popular culture has become and he has a pretty interesting theory as to why that is 20th century omelets post modernist moral relativist critical theory espousing cultural Marxist nihilus began to seize control of society no that's why okay now the post modernists are the Jews helping them do this or is it the lizard people working behind the scenes or is it more of a three pronged approach are they all working together also are they part of this the conspiracy to turn the frogs gay are they part of that Paul goes on to identify postmodern art as less of an art movement and more of a grand scheme to subvert Western values which is funny because post-modernism is born out of the West without the status quo without the culture of the West surrounding it it wouldn't have anything to react to it wouldn't have anything to be ironic for it wouldn't have anything to take the piss out of and the idea of post modernists reshaping society in their image what image are you even talking about one of the most prevailing critiques of post-modernism is that it's so vague and relativist that it doesn't really stand for anything given that even a post modernist wanted to do what you're saying they're doing I don't even really think they could achieve it of course you can be so postmodern that you're just an idiot with its head up his ass that you're rejecting every single thing the mainstream has to offer you but in moderation it can expand new avenues for expression and ideas if it wasn't for postmodern and abstract art movements we all go to art galleries and still look at a bunch of fucking still lifes and portraits you know which are cool but you know variety and evolution and new ideas are cool too plus loads of artists like Lou Reed especially on albums like Metal Machine music or the Beatles number nine number nine have incorporated abstract and post modernists musical and artistic ideas into their works and enhance them made them more intriguing plus there's a plethora of postmodern minimalist composers who have made some incredible music over the years I don't think there's an art fan postmodern or just modern that would argue that Philip Glass isn't an amazing brilliant talented artist and composer plus you know punk music and art rock share quite a bit in common philosophically with post-modernism and we know how much you love punk Paul you're such a you're such a true punk television TV's endless portrayal of broken families emasculated male figures an aberrant nihilistic Droog like use the stars of so-called reality television virtually always narcissistic immoral and borderline insane they have no redeeming trait indoctrinating is with the idea that this is actual reality that this is how we should act - yes Paul okay there's a lot of shitty reality TV out there we get it but your average person just kind of uses this as something to gawk at if what was happening on the screen was normal or normalized as normal as you make it seem to be there'd be no reason to stare at it and the most hilarious thing about Paul's warning of subversion here with these television shows including the warning that pedophilia is going to be normalized real soon guys is that his audience will just not not in agreement with everything he's saying but if you show them a video of Anita sarkeesian saying that video game video games will reinforce sexist attitudes guys and all go no no the truth is it's all bullshit Paul you completely derive modern culture in modern television completely through this lens of shitty reality TV shows despite the fact that in the modern age especially with streaming platforms like Netflix there's no shortage of interesting and engaging and boundary-pushing television that are spinning new narratives and bringing new perspectives orange is the new black Breaking Bad stranger things Game of Thrones just to name a few and also the ever poignant and always amazing and ahead of the curve fucking black mirror you would love that show if you haven't seen it Paul it would do wonders for your conspiracy boner you make some fair points here about narcissism and obsession with celebrity but you know this isn't so much an invisible hand forcing us to think and feel this way as much as it is our hyper obsession with this new thing called social media Paul you know a lot of people don't use it the way that you do they use it to engage in and create a little social bubble around the things that they love and sometimes people make themselves obsessed with you know the Kardashians I share some of your concerns here but you don't really bring any evidence that were spiraling downward into a hellfire of irredeemable narcissism you know other than just your disgust at this part of modern culture now in this video thus far I really had my work cut out for me because Paul says so much dumb shit but he really takes the cake when he starts talking about music music is less diverse and the lyrics are more dumbed down than ever before man rap today fucking sucks bad they're not even seeing words anymore they just got a hard-ass fucking beat the trick dumbasses like you to make you think he liked to shit okay no no that was that was not an edit that was not me editing this to make Paul look stupid he literally one of the craziest fucking rappers walking the planet as evidence of his shitty point here later in the video Paul even assert that Hopson never quite made it to the mainstream because he he just he's just way too truthful he'd be dropping these truth bombs on everybody he'd be red pilling everyone which couldn't be further from the truth not only because Hopson has the mental capacity of a fourteen-year-old atheist but also because Hopson is not really doing too well his career is on the skids because of his failing relationship with his independent label which he has wrapped about on numerous occasions because his business partner was doing shady things with the money okay here here's a bold point we've hit a brick wall that hasn't been a single authentic movement in popular music for the last quarter of a century the last quarter of a century Paul you realize that would include Oasis and Nirvana and a lot of the other artists that you cite in this video as being good examples of modern popular culture right like you know that right is it that you can't count backwards from 25 or are you just that fucking wishy-washy on the history of modern music are you completely writing off the 2000s here Paul like Radiohead tool the rise of indie music not only artists who hit the mainstream like Modest Mouse and Arcade Fire but acts that remained a little more underground but are still beloved and are still seen as fantastic amazing creators people like Animal Collective or joanna newsom also there's been the recent growth in popularity of conscious hip hop and jazz wrap through artists like Jay Cole and Kendrick Lamar wild and crazy and out there and experimental acts like Danny Brown for example a lot of these artists talk about social issues a lot of these artists make rebellious music a lot of these artists talk politics and you'd be a cultural layman to completely ignore them also many of them are way more relevant and interesting than fucking Hopsin also this idea that there are no alternatives and they're fewer alternatives is completely bunk sure maybe alternatives seem like they're harder to find because the Internet kind of blurred the lines between the underground and the mainstream creating this two-way street of popularity and influence creating the meteoric rise and fame of artists like Tyler the Creator and Frank Ocean people who are certainly unique you may not like them but they certainly have their own sound their own style and would not have made it as big as they are now had it been like 15 years ago and while a lot of cultural trash has been created in the Internet age one of the great things about the internet age is that you don't need to rely on one certain media outlet or a handful of certain media outlets to get your music at your news get your anything you can turn off these pieces of cultural trash if you so choose you're about my age so you should remember a time when it was almost fucking inescapable things like boy bands and fucking hair metal and bad Europop these days you don't hear one direction unless you're fucking looking for some one direction and I don't know if someone wants to hear that I wouldn't begrudge them some one direction whether it be fashion all music literature comedy toldja has been completely sanitized there is no counterculture Paul that's because the Internet has given alternative expressions and points of view a seat at the table you are here on your YouTube channel getting silly uninformed opinions about art and you couldn't do this 15 years ago Paul there's no reason to bitterly rattle your sabers at the castle walls of the mainstream anymore because the walls have been torn down and we're all just kind of free-flowing Lee commiserating and consuming the art and the media that we want to at the pace that we want to when we want to where we want to however the trade-off there though is less tangible counterculture because we're no longer as organized you know it's not the insiders versus the outsiders it's kind of this weird gray scale now everybody is kind of amorphous ly appealing to their own little niches you should know this better than anyone and yet you're being really intellectually dishonest to your Paul actually throughout the entire video also how are you going to shit on Miley Cyrus for her raunchy stage show but then put Marilyn Manson on this pedestal like oh he he was counterculture he was God I watched that man in high school on stage at Ozzfest sodomized himself with a water bottle may was doing edgy nasty disgusting things on stage too the only difference between then and now is that back then it was a little more taboo what Miley is doing is just what her predecessors did she's pushing boundaries she's poking at taboos maybe she's doing it less with her music and more with her stage show but she's kind of doing it all the same and Marilyn Manson I love the guy but he's not a musical genius either the sound and the writing behind a lot of his albums depended on the musicians that he surrounded himself with many of his contributions to modern music added up to some edgy lyrics and a kind of cultural boogeyman who poked at the sacred cows of conservative culture and we know how you love conservative culture Paul have you ever visited Tate Modern in London it's a giant building full of scrap metal concrete blocks your anal zap-zap stop Paul stop do you even know the history behind this piece do you know the history behind this piece fall if you knew the answer you behind this piece Paul I don't think you'd be calling it just say your Arnold just fuck and yaw right now of course that's technically what it is but originally this piece which there are many copies of it now was submitted to a 1917 art exhibition where it was claimed that if you are an independent artist and you paid the fee no matter what your piece would be shown and the submitter of this piece was testing that rule the submitter and the artist knew full well how people would react to this they knew what they were doing they knew how this piece would be viewed in the in the grander scheme of the modern art world it wasn't just some turn-of-the-century hipster saying that who but this urinal that I've put Dover is totally I you just don't get it man it's essentially shitposting before shitposting even existed and that's a beautiful thing and you're a fucking moron for not realizing it or researching it have postmodern artists kind of belabor this point with the submission of cinder blocks and turds sure but like with any revolutionary idea in the art world it's going to get repeated again and again and again until something more cutting-edge comes along you should be able to appreciate that considering your endorsement of an M&M ripoff earlier in your video and to your issue with this Turner Prize nod to this giant sculpture of an ass are you such a humorous dimwit that you don't see that how amazing this is popular culture as it exists today actually represents a direct threat to Western civilization since it provides our enemies with a justifiable reason to destroy us all I'm glad you saved this statement for last in your video because not only is it the dumbest thing that you've said in this entire video but it's the dumbest fucking thing you've ever said you fucking idiot really because there's art and music out there that's raunchy and maybe you don't like it because it's really shallow that's justifiable means for religious extremists to attack people in the West are you serious so if Isis orchestrates an attack because of Miley Cyrus you're just like if hyper sexualized music videos are reasons for Isis to attack us why not other things that they don't like what if a gay person wants to write a song about being gay or what if a woman wants to write a television show about going to the grocery store by herself Paul if you really think what you just said here you're just as stupid and his extreme is the terrorist boogeyman that you dangle in front of your audience every other video okay to finish off this video let's recap you don't know what postmodern art is you don't know what what Punk is but you you don't know what happened 25 years ago you don't understand how the Internet has fractured popular culture you don't understand hip-hop because you completely wrote off gangsta rap despite the fact that artists within that genre like NWA spoke truth to power and then the rapper that you do endorse is cringer than the sjw's that you whinge about in almost every video you drop and whinging about sgw spall it's shooting fish in a barrel it doesn't make you smart to point out that safe spaces are dumb and that anti-shah sucks it doesn't make you some kind of brilliant cultural Authority don't let it trick you into thinking that you know anything about music or popular culture so shitty video let's see that it doesn't happen again Tran position and god I am done with this video but I still feel like there's so much market it said a pulse defensive Kanye despite the fact that Kanye embodies almost everything about pop culture that Paul hates so much the fact that Paul constantly conflates art that has no meaning and is nihilistic in nature and intentionally has no meaning with arc that is shallow doesn't necessarily mean it has no meaning or that it's meaning less but it's just a very shallow meaning and there's been shallow popular art for decades now but do that.i I digress the videos over maybe if Paul says some more dumb stuff in some future videos I'll respond to that we'll see from what I understand he has he has a video coming out about how conservative is the new Punk that should be a gold mine other links videos next to my head subscribe to the channel official website - you guys are the best forever 
6UMi-SFv064,keep a bank up [Music] anybody came from pain hi everyone it's hard only you can hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another episode of the I'm sorry this is late it came from bad can a band can band can band camp where I go over a series of releases that were released hopefully not too long ago on the band camp platform because they're weird their eclectic their strange they're fun they're intriguing they're worth talking about and they're all linked down there in the description we have quite a few releases on Bandcamp lined up for you guys today this first one comes from a group by the name of the pablo collective down here on their band camp you can not only get a free download of this but there's a lot of contributing artists to this thing cow 9b fax and stahl a friend and so on and so forth and apparently this project is one long epic four song endeavor and all these tracks are like 13 to 17 to 25 minutes long and all the material on this thing is inspired by Kanye West's recent album the life of Pablo this of course being kind of a response in a way is titled the death of Pablo and I don't know man there's there's just a lot to this thing and you really it's like this weird collage music art project that is so many genres coming together and just crashing into each other violently it's really hard to make heads or tails of but it is it is interesting and it is actually really like artful and um and really stimulating I'm just going to play a little bit of it and react to it actually like this part a lot it sounds like some weird experimental industrial like instrumental or something that that's the track washed up then we have other songs father stretch my hands part three so it's like you know they're actually in a way trying to extend these songs or create the sequels to these songs ow you there's so many cool weird passages shitty things it's so blown out and noisy and while it is abrasive like there's clearly elements to the rhythms and some of the chord progressions and melodies that sound Kanye West inspired like this sounds like if Kanye was legitimately making like the most experimental thing that he could without you know any sorts of concessions toward anything pop anything mainstream just completely whacked out an off-the-wall not sure where that would fit in the Kanye's discography though holy shit it's there elements of the thing they're haunting they're beautiful they're weird it's unsettling it's the death of Pablo and apparently there's like an alternate cover to this thing that featured like a picture of Kanye West and his mom that some people sort of took offense to found not tasteful I don't know I mean I think I think it's an interesting sort of idea to sort of use that picture and the cover especially since that event in the Kanye's white hood and Kanye's life the loss of his mother had a pretty huge impact on him emotionally personally artistically but you know I digress that is the death of Pablo project if there's one band camp in this episode that when you walk away from this episode you should check out it's this one because it's completely nuts moving on from there we have a new release from the people over at heart the hard vapour resistance front we have featured these guys on the on the it came from band camp series before and this this is probably my favorite concept project from them yet this is a this is world war 2020 episode for 2016 version WikiLeaks versus DNC and this is a created by Fox six and fresh it's the various artists compilation and it's a lot like some of the other hard vapor that has been on this Van Camp before it's very aggressive it seems very industrial inspired but still having some of those vaporwave qualities to the production it's all weird home brewed electronic music that seems to have very little in the way of stylistic boundaries and if there's anything kind of linking a lot of these tracks together is that they're clear sort of nods to the recent political climate of the 2016 election that just occurred and I don't know it's it's it's pretty nuts like the diversity of sounds and musical styles on this thing but what's just and there are so many different people in on this thing I don't know if it is I mean there are some names I recognize like like mesh for example mesh shout out to shout out to you what's up dude you know but there are other people on here who I don't know could all of these people be a uniquely different artist each single one of them or is it multiple people I mean or is it just like a couple people under multiple pseudonyms I don't know all I do know is that it sounds like a lot of these tracks are coming from totally different places and you have references to everything this past election from Hillary to Trump to my Pence to WikiLeaks and pizza gate and you know even though this Henry Wong track is titled spirit cooking let's let's give that a shot keep in mind there are 31 songs on on this monster [Music] Toby Myrtle sorry I had to there's actually kind of cool [Music] next track is from an artist named Treadstone Treadstone [Music] that's unsettling yeah okay that is that is an intense fucking drone I don't know if I could sit through that while it turns into okay I feel like I'm crossing over to the other fucking side listening to that like I'm just see this bright shaft or sort of I'm traveling a million miles down this bright shaft of light oh Jesus okay that's that's actually pretty fucking intense there are so many songs here I can't reach one of them but there you go world war 2020 episode 4 2016 version WikiLeaks versus DNC Fox and Friends that from from hard vapor resistance front shout out to you guys keep it up alright this is a next album is completely fucking wack it comes from a band by the name of those darn gnomes and these guys are like a metal it's been like an experimental metal loaf I bet quartet and there are tons of additional musicians on this thing please show that that personnel list right there and apparently this thing was also recorded at a what is marked here as Apollo's crotch Apollo's crotch hopefully that's you know more literal than it is just a crazy name for the the rank stank basement that they probably recorded this end now this album in the tags is labeled as being avant-garde death metal experimental free improvisation mathcore noise rock post metal progressive metal and they've also labeled it as being from San Diego to and god this is such a beautiful serene cover it's like I'm just looking at some beautiful flower paintings over here but as you will hear the music that is delivered on this thing does not quite match up with the serenity of the visuals on the album and this track is a one of five songs on this thing which are very much mistress a lot of them 15 minutes seven minutes 14 and change on the last track but this one this special track over here is titled Seinfeld Seinfeld much of the album is like this it's super disorienting it's very aggressive it's very brittle and noisy the recording is in technical terms ass but there's something weird about the way that this was put together like I can kind of hear every single instrument and make out everything that's happening so it's not like it's so blown out to the point where it's unlistenable it's almost like the harshness of it wasn't you know just some kind of bad home recording mistake it's like intended to be is nasty and disgusting as it is and there's definitely a lot of technical ability to what these guys are doing which definitely shines through despite the recording being as smudgy and chaotic as it is moving on from there we're going to be talking about a guy who goes by the name of mile Webb on Bandcamp this is a guy whose page I've been conscious of for a while and this album that we're talking about here did come out in 2016 but it served in the fall and this guy is a crazy zany multi-instrumentalist sort whose tracks are you know mostly like beatbox and singing but he plays a ton of different instruments like so many different sounds come out of this guy even on his front page over here there's this ridiculous photo of him holding horns and stringed instruments and everything just it's all over him he's just wearing his instruments like a like a some kind of sign to say I'm crazy help me put me away in prison crazy prison please all jokes aside though this guy's music is quite colorful it's fun it's silly it's playful and again he just does a lot like all of this coming out of one single man half the band something but the guy with the microphone intellect or the mic and demands a number [Music] so you know it's fun it's like hearted it's cool let's hear just one more one more taste over here the song oblivious man [Music] obviously the guy is a sharp sense of humor their element sadistic I remind me of you know those youtubers who you see like just layer tons of instruments on top of each other and they all play them themselves and you see them in those silly quirky videos where they're doing bad pop covers but this guys are writing original music over here there's also something about this that kind of reminds me of They Might Be Giants - you know there's definitely kind of a nerd sort of playful innocent appeal to it - that's very cool shout out to this guy you know all the props in the world it seems like he's doing some really cool stuff and seems mess massively talented tremendous you wouldn't believe it this guy every instrument plays every instrument totally totally genius high highest IQ of any musician on Bandcamp want to give a shout out to mr. James Ferraro he has this burning Prius project out on Bandcamp that he followed up is a human story three album with a project that I didn't review last year I've been meaning to sit down and listen to it in four more times though I have found through my initial listens to be a little more intriguing than his Skid Row album person editing this video will probably not like that opinion but hey I love you anyway having said that this new burning Prius project over here is like this 21 minute - piano concerto that's actually quite epic has a lot of highs and lows on it and it just continues to amaze me that James Ferraro just has so many trick stuff his sleeve like he's really just a jack of all experimental music trades there's really just nothing he I'm not going to say can't do there's really nothing he hasn't done because he's just all over the map [Music] so you can hear already here he's really setting the mood it's dramatic and he's playing a long man's game here like he's not you know hitting you with something super accessible right out of the gate he's not hitting you with something that's really busy right out of the gate he's building tension and again Lord is he taking his sweet time doing it but you know there's really a strong mood to this track already with the handful of spacious and very sour dark chords that he's playing so far and let me tell you from what I've heard so far there are a lot of interesting passages that follow this just sort of stripping forward a little bit but it's kind of thin midi sense here but you could get here's doing some interesting things compositionally so you know if you're looking for something kind of experimental classical then definitely look this thing up because you know it is an interesting follow up in a very epic follow-up to his human story three uh project so Jane James Ferraro forever and we are going to finish it off with one more Bandcamp from the great the prolific the talented mr. Mick Barr he has this new project together that he has recently released an album from the band's name and look at this band camp this is this is this orange blue sort of scheme over here is it like picks in my eyes like just looking at it is looking at the the color sort of clashing on top of each other over here just is giving me eye strain but anyway the the band's name is Frank thinnest Frank Frank Frank cenarf and the album here is pencil Vanakkam pensylvanicus levine iike and we have three untied old tracks here they are 10 18 or 11 18 minutes long and listed here we have elements of classical music death metal black metal experimental music free improvisational music as well and certainly pretty much everything there shows up from what I've heard so far it does seem like you know very improvisational very sort of in the moment kind of performance here and of course you know we have Mick Barr guitarists who I mentioned we have Alain Corp on piano and Evan rip whore on alto saxophone so a trio we have a trio here and let's let's just give it a shot here's the recording here's the performance I love that VanCamp is kind of given stuff like this kind of a home [Music] what we were just listening to there is this was the second track although it didn't really have that much difference of a vibe than the first track but it seems like you know there definitely some performance themes here you know there are moments of very quiet and somewhat spacious tension on here you know mixed guitars kind of dominating there with these diddling flowering strumming patterns kind of ascending and descending down these keys or whatever key they've kind of set the song and if they set it in any key I mean if they haven't they're actually playing off of each other very well considering that maybe they didn't establish kind of okay it's in this key or we're you know any kind of ground rules or anything I don't know what the ground rules would be for these improvisation but it sounds like they're doing a really good job of playing off of each other and listening to what one another is doing and sort of you know performing in the moment and sort of leading each other by ear into certain levels of intensity because while you do have kind of those quiet tense passages they do eventually kind of give a little bit of a release bring some kind of catharsis with these noisier more chaotic moments during the performance so yeah there you go you know some cool free improv music with some incredibly talented musicians very clearly and that is going to be it for this episode of it came from band camp guys it came from band camp I want to give a shout out to hot dad for writing the theme song to this band camp series and the the fantastic animator of the intro card for this series will also be linked down there in the description box too and yeah that's it guys okay again all those band camps are down there check them out buy their music support the artists if you happen to like what they're putting out and I'll see you guys in the next video transition have you given these band camps to listen you should because there's a lot of interesting things on them and you're the best other videos that you could check out next to my head actually probably a playlist of our previous episodes in the it came for band camp series subscribe to the channel official website too and I'll catch you guys in the next city Oh forever 
jbxpNHEWfao,hi everyone knows me wait a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review review a real review of the new Big Sean album I decide Big Sean Detroit rapper he's back again with another album his fourth full-length commercial project an album that again I am taking seriously especially since my last review of Big Sean's music was a glorious cop-out for the album dark sky paradise where essentially for about four minutes or so I just said the word no and for 24 amazing hours if you googled Big Sean my review was the first thing that would pop up now why why did I do this my reasoning behind putting out this anti review is that in my opinion a big sean is hip-hop's most non-essential character right now up until the point of this new album Big Sean has had a couple mixtapes a bunch of singles three big commercial projects and since releasing that music not a single sound rap style that he hasn't borrowed from somewhere else or at least saw a contemporary do better and not a single hit that we're going to remember ten years from now except maybe to recall some of the low points of hip hop in this decade but I do have to say that Big Sean kinda came through on this new album over here and that's not to say he's turned a new leaf on this album a lot of the time on this thing he still sounds like a poor man's Drake but at least I guess he's making good Drake tracks as on this album Big Sean is mostly making use of the very moody nocturnal trap vibes that you caught on Drake's if you're reading this it's too late mixtape a sound that Drake almost immediately abandoned to put together this total mixed bag of a project with no themes running through it whatsoever save for a handful of whitewashed dancehall songs so if Sean wants to focus on a sound and a style that one of his biggest influences abandoned then sure why not and that's pretty much what he does here I mean it's not hard to imagine Drake recording any number of the songs on this album and actually coming through with better results especially in the case of the tracks where Sean is mostly relying on his very flimsy singing voice to carry the tract Shawn even writes the same kind of woe is me I'm dissecting my fame and how it impacts my personal life bars on the song Sunday morning jet pack and the same clever cute observations without the relationship that never was bars on the track jump out the window now these songs aren't terrible I definitely give Sean credit for how earnestly and smartly he pulls apart this relationship that is failing but he's desperate to repair it on the track Oh me but we heard this before now despite Sean's severe lack of originality for another album there are some things on this record I legitimately enjoy I love the song bounce back stellar single I love the catchy cold-blooded hook on this thing the nocturnal laid-back beak from Metro boomin there are some nice flow changes on this thing some standout bars like my daddy was a G it's genetics there's one line about people like changing more than wishing wells or more change than wishing wells that was pretty cloning the song though favors is OK but the inclusion of Eminem on the track is really odd I get that Big Sean probably wanted to tribute this guy who essentially put Detroit on the map in a lot of ways but they're pairing is really odd their Styles don't exactly mesh together and I really questioned whether or not mmm added all that much to the the theme of the track even though I do find his verse to be very funny very self-aware very nasty as usual but it kind of sounds like he phoned it in from the inside of a meat locker somewhere as there's like really weird bouncy echo on his voice but this moment on the album doesn't feel nearly out of place as a stick to the plan stick to the plan one of the weirdest transitions I've heard on a rap record this year is Sean kind of put together this voices in my head stick to the plan half two-part multifaceted track it just seems really sloppy kind of weakly put together and with big face like Zordon there's a fucking Power Rangers reference the song moves is OK I like it for a lot of the same reasons I like bounce back though it's not nearly as infectious and the song sacrifices with me ghost goes over way better than I generally had anticipated it is a grind anthem about all the things that you might need to sort of cut back on in order to make to your goal achieve your dreams Shaun's verse has one of the most fast and intense flows on the entire album his most fiery performance on the entire record migos their contribution is OnPoint the vocal harmonies that they pull together are pretty cool and I also like the beats hypnotic piano loops and that one bar about focusing on the inner me and never my enemy and the closer bigger than me is actually a very luscious finish to the album with the inclusion of the Flint chosen choir their vocals make the track really gorgeous and the track highlights what I think Big Sean does best on this record and that is deliver some very personal and impassioned lyrics he seems admirably humble at times on this project though I mean I would be too if I somehow it made a career out of being behind the curve I think I can agree with what a lot of people are saying about this record that this is Big Sean's best album so far but Big Sean's best album is a decent Drake album opened up with the track that features the kind of intentionally corny but very smart wordplay that you would catch on like Kanye's the college dropout so I mean while I did enjoy a lot of this record there's only so much that I could praise it because yet again Big Sean continues to be the most non-essential artist in hip-hop today because he doesn't really bring anything to the table that his contemporaries aren't already with every project he puts out it's just like he's bringing seconds for people who haven't had quite enough of what's already out there I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition and have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry cool cool Anthony Fantana Big Sean other videos

qcDGjCZZuFE,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here it's time for our weekly tragg or rubber where I go through the best and worst tracks of this past week all the songs sort of stopped me in my tracks ha

shirt so far you are in the running to win one of those vinyl copies once I close the sales on the shirt I'll be picking winners for those records cool cool all right let's get into the tracks over here let's start off with the worst tracks of the week kicking things off with this new Jenna track let the let out featuring quavo quavo his performance was decent on this track but it was not enough to save this generic completely non-essential song I I don't know how this guy continues to get away with just dropping such forgettable music I know he's a very eccentric dresser you know very very sharp sense of style but his music really could use that same kind of I don't know personality or Flair because here it just does not have it it's just some generic modern and you're trapped with not much in the way of originality to it moving on from there imagine dragons believer yeah imagine dragons continue to be pretty unbearable moving on from there I got to give a shout out to this next track which I originally thought I was kind of met on the but the more I listened to it the more kind of aggravated me in the worst tracks this week unfortunately I had to put this new Mastodon song show yourself Mastodon used to be one of the most trailblazing bands in modern metal every band out there was copying them and it seems like ever since several albums ago they've just been desperate to not be a metal band anymore and they've slowly been trending toward just making alternative rock or watered down alternative metal and this new track over here takes the fucking cake because this sounds like the Foo Fighters doing a Queens of the Stone Age cover it does not sound like Mastodon at all it just sounds like Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters collaborating on a track so congratulations you you've thrown your sound out you've watered it down to the point where you're not even a metal band at this point I don't know why the fans are freaking out or even enjoying this track it just sounds like some alternative rock some alternative metal that would have come out 10 to 15 years ago that nobody would have remembered 10 to 15 years later so why we're excited about this I don't know because it's not really that good of a song moving on from there we have Depeche Mode with a horrendous track called where's the revolution which a lot of their fans seem to be freaking out about I don't know why because not only is the song awkwardly performed the vocals on the chorus are awful but it's also got some of the preachy astringent oolitic charged lyrics I've heard in a long time if you want an example as to how to not write the lyrics to a politically charged song please use this track as an example because this this song is not going to whip people up into the revolution that you guys are demanding Depeche Mode this song is not only just horrendous on the ear especially as you guys kind of rise those vocals up for that chorus but I don't know it kind of seems like you're almost looking down on the populace looking down on all the peons for like hey how come you guys aren't revolting we welcome you're not doing what we think you should suppose to do we're artists so we know better yeah it seems just a little pretentious unfortunately and moving on from there what I felt was the worst track the week really awkward comeback unfortunately from the band blondie with the song fun which is absolutely no fun at all it was pretty funny of my significant other I was playing for her this song because we both enjoy blondie and I was like here listen to this just try this track out and she was just like what what is this what's going on and I obviously I didn't tell her who it was and I said come on guess guess she no guess no guesses so I finally told her it was blondie Jesus Christ I wish I had a camera on her face because she was just like like it was priceless it was priceless but moving on from there that that was the least favorite track the week for me we saver track of the week just really bad you know some bands if you don't use it you lose it and unfortunately the performance on this thing is really awkward instrumentally I think the mix kind of leaves the groove sort of feeling a little out of whack and Debbie Harry's vocals are not sound too good I'll leave it there but let's get into the tracks I felt kind of met on this week kind of met on these tracks but certainly worth mentioning tracks that you may be into a little bit more than me so Mariah Carey makes a return with this song I don't featuring yg of all people Compton rapper yg and his performance on the track is okay Mariah sounds like she's doing a bit of a 90s throwback here it's a decent track you know for a commercial R&B song with a bit of a nostalgic flavor for it to it it's decent moving on from their pond with three not three thirty thousand megatons this is sort of a more atmospheric easygoing track from pond wasn't too crazy about it but you know certainly I was blissful and pretty at points the magnetic fields had a new record on the way which is I guess a 50 song memoir of sorts with like a song dedicated every year or so and this track the Fox are not 83 Fox and I was maybe a little more lo-fi and washed out for my liking but it was still a decent tune and it has me intrigued about this upcoming record because as usual with the magnetic fields especially when it comes to a concept album like this it's really more about how the songs all sound together on a record more than it is like a here's a single you know both of us so it could it could still be an interesting project moving on from there Mac DeMarco with this old dog the more forgettable of the two singles he recently released just kind of sounds like a I don't know a little bit more instrumentally tangible version of sort of the type of song he would usually put out though I'm sure that makes some of the fans really happy bleached with the song can you deal this band has come through with a song that's pretty much about being frustrated over the fact that the music media and probably music fans on the Internet to have sort of categorized and pigeon-holed the band as being this girl band this female fronted band seems they don't want attention pointed toward that though they point attention towards themselves with this track but still even with the verses being as awkwardly performed as they are this is one of the most enraged tracks I've ever heard from bleached not really the boring kind of washed out drab garage rock that I usually hear from them and you know stuff like this pisses them off then I say bring it on because you know this what they brought here in terms of this track and I'm not saying that you know people should be sexist or the band I'm not saying that I'm not advocating for that but what I'm saying is that the rage they sort of bring on this track has really kind of lit their sound up quite a bit and it's made them pretty exciting on this song and you know obviously with a stronger lyrical narrative there it makes the song more engaging - you can agree you can a district you can disagree with what the band is saying but you know they definitely put together a cohesive theme with what's going on in the lyrics here and you know it definitely fuels the song and keeps it interesting we have the underachievers with the song Gotham Knights this track is not really one of their best written songs like not really a strong chorus - and it kind of has this glitzy very smooth and for mental and it seems like they're kind of trying to put together this uplifting track and when they release the song they sort of labeled it as a being anti mumble rap it's certainly that but not in my own life and you're not one of their best tracks moving on from there Julia halter with the song horns surrounding me this is not a bad song this is actually just kind of a live cut from her upcoming live album which I wanted to give a shout out to so make sure to check this track out down in the description box if you want to hear some live Julia halter and keep an eye out for this upcoming live album she has dropping very soon we have beats flying with a Jesus and Mary Chain cover of the song sometimes always which went over pretty well and gallant her gallant actually gets together with Eric Nam and kpop duo Tablo for this new song cave me in which is a bit of another another 90s R&B throwback which actually isn't too bad you know it's not the most memorable track I've ever heard you know most memorable R&B throwback that I've heard but it's actually not a bad single and you know it's cool to see him collaborating with other artists and hopefully you know not only other artists but other artists from outside of the country you know hopefully through collaborations and singles like this which seem to be doing pretty well America can get you know sort of more attention more than I on what's happening in the Korean scene maybe even the Japanese scene you know of because there's a lot of great pop music and rock music going on in Asia moving on from there we have Faith Evans who believe it or not very soon is going to be dropping an album of duets with the notorious b.i.g now Faith Evans if you didn't know was married to the notorious b.i.g and now it seems that she is taking like a lot of his leftover verses and singing along with them and sort of writing songs based off of his raps and her singing and of course their guests on here Snoop Dogg is on this particular track when we party and it's okay you know I mean it's a it's something that people who grew up with this sound and grew up with these artists will probably hear and be like and that's what I remember that's that's that's what I remember from when I was younger and now I want to hear it sort of redone for today because now 20 years later it's classic it's classic status so you know that's that's pretty much why I think this sort of exists the upcoming project is called the king and I not sure if I'm going to review it because I'm not expecting too much of it other than for it to be just kind of this you know indulgent hey remember this kind of project but you know whatever moving on from there I want to give a shout out to some of the tracks that I consider the best tracks of the week starting off with Toro y Moi with the song Omaha this song was released as a part of the 100 days dumb chump sucks compilation and while this track doesn't seem to be overly political it is a good Toro y Moi song very funky very groovy very catchy and I will take that from whatever direction it comes from moving on from there we have dental visit Vince staples with this new track bag back vid Staples if you didn't know West Coast rapper very talented individual and this new song of his is one of his smoothest and most commercial tracks yet very catchy and it's actually really clean seems like it's a it seemed like he really wanted to do a bit of a crossover with this track it's not one of his grimy or darker more aggressive songs even though there are some elements to the lyrics the same kind of revolutionary in tone very Afrocentric very political but I still think this is like one of his cleanest and catchiest songs like you know really good on Vince I didn't know that he could sort of not only get this political but do something that sounds like this commercially viable so you know some some good track some some good track here moving on from there excuse me I'm disgusting the Brazilian rap trio known as now a Branca formerly Perls Negros they have this new track out called kick on though they assault though with a production from leo Justi and this is a the hangar and I'm looking forward to then coming out with more aggressive music because this is a definitely more aggressive change of pace here more aggressive music on there forthcoming project if they have one coming out very soon mixtape/album I'm not sure because this track is like them going kind of dark so they got this name change they got this sound change they're doing something little more hard definitely trap music inspired and really just kind of off-the-wall turned up to turn up to 11 so you know if you're looking for some crazy Brazilian hip-hop then look this group up because they're doing some cool stuff moving out from their future islands with the song ran goddamn god damn god damn this is a good single this is a good single right here some smooth fun catchy indie pop with uh you know a strong sense pop vibe to it however though however I am somewhat hesitant because what usually happens with every future islands record is you get that single you get that other you get that other lead single and it's it's amazing it's fantastic the vocals are so passionate the backing instrumentation has a good Drive - it's very propulsive the synthesizers are really anthemic and beautiful it's the right balance of like atmosphere but also the instrumentation is doing enough things interesting to sort of keep things engaging keep things you know feeling full not like - skeletal or just like lifeless but then once you get the rest of the record it didn't come together all that well or it's just kind of one-dimensional or there's all these tracks that are just or the recording is kind of off so I'm hoping this is the first time that future islands not only blow me away with a single because they've done that numerous times I want to be blown away by album ah this time so hopefully that happens future islands ran I want to hear the rest of this record I want it to be amazing just like this next song from a Minnesota band who just like sent me an email they were just like hey man we have music and we're band and here are band music will you and I went in that email and I said I didn't say anything I didn't even email him back I just clicked on the like and I was like holy shit this is great so there's this indie rock group and this song you're killing me is like one of the best written rock songs I've heard in a while great chord progression funny and self-destructive tongue-in-cheek lyrics serious tension to the song a certain points and are really great melodies two passionate vocal delivery I love the crescendo where the lead singer singing you're killing me you're killing me he just like freaks out and again and again and the dance is like really good syncopated restaurant they really know how to write a goddamn song at least you know evidence by this track so looking for what this band is doing because they seem like a good young talented band with some great songwriting ideas very hype on this track very well written again pretty well produced energetic performance give this goddamn track a listen do not let it slip by you especially all those emo kids if you're some fucking emo kid if you're some goddamn emo kid then make sure you listen to this track but even if you're not an emo kid listen to this track moving from there we have a video sound machine with song give me a reason and video sound machine enjoyed this group quite a bit very funky very electronic asking music over here the from the UK but they sort of borrow a lot of elements of African music and afro funk put their songs together so it's kind of like you know drum machines and afro funk grooves it's a lot of cool stuff coming together and they've come together with this new song called give me a reason and they're most instrumentally fleshed out and colourful track yet and sounding really ambitious and I'm hoping that they actually they I know before they were affiliated with Soundwave records I'm not so much sure what you know what it was like releasing with them but now that I'm looking over here okay it seems that over here this new record over here they're dropping it on merge record so like that's a bit of a you know a step up in terms of like you know independent label affiliation you know so it seems like you know we could be looking forward to like a you know a sensible push as far as like PR and like you know music dissemination behind this band you know so I'm looking forward to that because seems like you know they're pretty unique group pretty talented group I think of more people you know we're exposed to them they would certainly you know get to gather a larger audience you know change some minds about the style of music that they're playing because I think a lot of people don't tend to venture into the musical style videos Sound Machine tend to cater to so hopefully they get a little more exposure on merge because I'm definitely liking the more ambitious sound that they're working with here moving on from their father John misty Ballad of the dying man not going to talk too much about this track I do like it quite a bit I'm just not talking about it because father John misty his new record is coming out very soon and honestly if he comes out with more singles if you drop some more tracks because even a lot of material live from this album so far I'm not sure if I'm going to you know continue like spoiling it for myself you know what I mean because it seems like I don't want to hear too much for the record because once I hear the album I want it to hit me I want that impact to be fresh and raw I don't want to just have heard half of the album before it's out or whatever so I'm just looking forward to the record I like the political direction he's gone in with the lyrics and musically it seems like he's doing a lot of the same stuff that he was on his last record but you know just just a different songs a different instrument a different instrumental recipes so I'm liking what he's doing I'll just say that a blank mass with the song silent treatment this track is crazy like especially the intro the track it's so bright it's so tense it's so fucking it's like I'm flying down some kind of tunnel with like lights flying by me it's insane and then the way is sort of like Peters out and then goes into this like really primal quiet passage where just kind of builds up into yet another crescendo at a very tense pace I love sort of the spacing and I love the the momentum and I love the the groove of this track I love the way that it flows a lot of cool things about this track in terms of just how it progresses and just how it sounds some really great sound on this song a lot of great textures so some interesting electronic music here very experimental very out-there obviously the fuck buttons fans are already hit to this but anybody who's into you know the odd electronic production do check this thing out I want to give a shout-out to Mack DeMarcos my old man this is the more interesting of the two singles I think he recently dropped some people are kind of you know pointing out the sound change here because it's kind of like a quirky little drum machine puttering away in the background it's got a bit of an electronic vibe to it but it still got that gerini Mack DeMarco sound was sick sad about the track for me though were the kind of telling lyrics about how as he gets older he sort of sees more of his father in him here is my take on the this track and the other track that he dropped the bass these are actually some really interesting tracks for Mack DeMarco this old dog is a decent song you know it kind of seems like Mack DeMarco as usual but with a little bit more instrumental detail it's not as washed out or as I guess kind of atmospheric or is glazed-over I actually like the swelling electric guitar chords the sort of a have a bit of a pedal steel vibe to them that pop up later in the track but my old man is probably I think one of his best songs even even though for a Mack DeMarco fan it may be hard to swallow at first because the kind of rigid quirky poppy clicky drum machine playing away in the background and it's not his usual aesthetic it's not his usual vibe it's more of an acoustic cut but Mack has some pretty great lyrics on this track now some of the rhymes may seem kind of basic if you just kind of surface-level analyze what he's saying here but the bigger picture here lyrically it's an interesting track about him kind of reflecting on sort of seeing these traits of his father turn up in him as he's getting older and older and obviously his relationship with his dad may may not be the best given that when he sort of brings the supper he mentions as he starts it off with an O as if it's like a bad thing or something to worry about one of his more personal tracks for sure and it would be interesting to sort of see him go in this direction with this new project of Izzy as coming out in May looking forward to a Mack DeMarco record looking forward to it and finally the last song that I want to shout out is this new track from John Darnielle or the mountain goats and it's titled the ultimate Jedi who wastes all the other Jedi their bones and it's like the mountain goats Star Wars crossover that I never knew I wanted because it's actually like a pretty beautiful ballad and has you know that amazing poetic visit but very violent storytelling that you get in some of the best mountain goat songs and it seems like he's really kind of done the Star Wars franchise quite a bit of justice with this track over here I would say and those are all the tracks that I wanted to shout out a few other things I wanted to say there is an amazing Twitter account where somebody pretends to be Donald Trump and those record reviews in single tweets it's called POTUS music reviews and it's pretty fucking amazing very hilarious and I will also say linked down there in the description box is a new EP from wiki of Rat King Fame and your old Droog they've collaborated on a handful of tracks and they've released the EP for free give it a shot I'm going to be talking about it in some way shape or form this coming week and you guys are the best all right those are the tracks I wanted to mention those are my favorite least favorite everything that happened this past week and I will catch you guys in the next video thanks again remember shirts down there in the description box Amazon Associates link down there in the description box and all these songs that I mentioned to get turned onto something hopefully we exposed you some some music here that you guys enjoy that you guys like and you're the best 
BDnYIjhaSzc,hey everyone ante Fontana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bed-wetter album flick your tongue against your teeth and describe the present this is the latest project from one of rap music's most mysterious artists now releasing music under yet another pseudonym of course I'm talking about mr. little ugly Mane who I'm glad is still releasing music because after his last album under that name in 2015 oblivion access that sort of seemed up in the air even though if I'm being honest I wasn't all that crazy about oblivion access because on this thing it sounded like little ugly Mane was doing a pretty grand departure from the sound that people enjoy from the project up until that point and not to say that a lot of the releases that came after his legendary mr. thug isolation tape didn't sound different were kind of sporadic unpredictable weird experimental but on Oblivion access it seemed like he was bringing things back to more standard track structures standard track listing more rapping but at this point it wasn't really the little ugly Mane that I and probably many of his fans came to know up until this point the sound wasn't quite as murky or obscured or strange it seems like he was trying to pull the veil back a little bit and do something that was a little more personal a little more him not kind of playing a character however it felt like to me he hadn't totally worked out all the kinks and some of his influences were very very obvious but now with this new bed-wetter album it seems like bed-wetter is continuing with the sound that i and fans had heard on oblivion access but fine-tuning it a little bit and now that I'm hearing this record it kind of makes sense like new sound new direction new name and from what I understand this is just the first volume of what could be a larger album or some kind of ongoing musical series the thing here is kind of scant it's just 9 tracks the intro track is really just kind of a short interlude and it's about 28 minutes long and from track to track it's not really that much more coach and Oblivion access was as far as the flow of the album anyway sonically I think bed-wetter takes things into some pretty interesting directions of course there are less vocal effects on this thing not quite as much effort being put toward obscuring the vocals maybe just a touch a reverb this seems like you know bed-wetter again kind of pulling back that veil being itself being raw the real voice nothing to hide behind this snide nasty cynical tone coming through in the wrapping these vocals kind of getting lost in the abyss of these very sad and grimy instrumentals case in point the song haze of interference which features these lonely distant pianos and very clunky punchy percussion and these waves of distortion or in song man wearing a helmet a good portion of this track is just bed-wetter rapping over this really icy since scape but then the track finally explodes into the satisfying loop of this compressed percussion in these choppy creepy piano phrases I think some of the instrumentals here are some of bed-wetter some of little ugly mains best so far except when he is releasing a track that is just an instrumental of which there are quite a few in the track listing here songs that I think would have sounded cool as interludes in a grand or a greater a longer project but here they just really kind of dominate too much room in this already very short mini album the chilling drone on this is not my stomach is cool and the very wintery and odd guitar acoustic guitar passages on fondly eulogizing sleep are nice as well but I can't help but feel like these instrumentals are just kind of passing the time I was hoping for more meaty more consequential more hard-hitting material on this thing mostly you know the tracks where he's rapping and the songs that he does do that they are quite impactful man they are heavy heavy in terms of lyrical content because if there is a theme that links this whole album together its mental health pretty much every track here tackle some kind of intense depression or self-doubt using drugs and alcohol as a crutch to kind of make it through these mu foods make it through these moments where just cerebrally bed-wetter is just suffering or just the pain and anguish of not knowing how to fix this problem not knowing where to go or who to talk to there's one moment on the record where it seems like he's kind of going down memory lane to describe very vividly this troubled kid who became the manic artist you hear today performing on this record there are tons of incredibly raw and revealing verses on this thing that can be pretty hard to listen to if you've ever dealt with any of the problems that bed-wetter is rapping about on this project making for some of his best material to date but there's not that much of that material here and what is here isn't organized all that well it's not groomed to flow in any sort of logical fashion will it feel that way if we get a volume 2 of volume 3 I'm not really sure I'm not all that excited to hear two more projects like this you know again while there are highlights on this thing there's nothing about this project that feels all that together and maybe bed-wetters throes of depression which do seem very real as he mentions them in a Facebook post I think which he released along with this album that is very sad and very telling maybe those throws of depression are make are making that task difficult I'm completely sympathetic to that and while it would be nice to hear in albums sort of dealing with these issues that a feels a little more holistic a little more complete a little more cohesive I guess I am more concerned with the emotions and the problems kind of fueling this album I hope he gets better if and when that process starts maybe there will be a bit more harmony and unity amongst the tracks on whatever such as when albums drop in the future I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing transmission have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate here

WxnEgULiE90,hi everyone can't any name tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a monthly segment great album where I go over a bunch of Records releases that I really enjoyed this past month January it's been a fruitful 2017 thus far if any of these releases slip through the cracks for you it's ok I'm going to mention them right here links to the reviews and music from these releases down there in the description here we first I want to give a shout out to a technically my first favorite album of 2017 even though it did not release in 2017 digitally it released in 2016 that would be even you run the jewels album run the jewels three or rtj three they released that this past Christmas for free download for everybody enjoy the hell out of this thing their most versatile and politically charged album yet while still bringing that hard grimy futuristic hardcore hip hop sound that run the jewels does so well the lyrical and and flow chemistry between a killer mic and LP on this thing in my opinion is just as good as it was on our TJ - I do think there are some moments where it is a little rough leaves a little to be desired as they kind of make this transition into making more socially aware music hopefully that is something that they sharpen a little bit for their next record if they continue down this path but a lot of the same characteristics that made our TJ to great also make our TJ three great just expect this one to be a little more mature next we knew Nine Inch Nails EP not the actual events this thing was a surprise from Trent Reznor because this EP is super raw it's dirty it's grimy it's visceral it's almost animalistic he really kind of throws it back to his his early industrial rock days but he's doing it a little more experimental a little more textured a little more rough around the edges this time around and I like that hopefully with his next album he's taking similar risks he's playing with similar textures he's just as adventurous with texture and he kind of brings back that dark moody angry emotional flavor that I love so much about Nine Inch Nails early music next the new code orange formerly code orange kids album forever this is one of the most inventive metalcore albums I've heard in a while for sure people who do not like metalcore will probably not take to this record a lot of those same basic elements the heaviness the guitar riffs the breakdown they're all here and people who think they're cliche in other contexts will most likely find their be cliche on this album but the way the band incorporates other genres incorporates other sounds and sort of experiments with the production a little bit and puts together this really apocalyptic vibe it's a metalcore album that in my opinion is like no other you know they're definitely taking some risks with this style of music that is typically very meat and potatoes still though at its core this is still a very primal and angry and very rare monstrous and beastly album but the band does do a great job of working some interesting subtlety into the mix and I applaud them for that because it definitely brings a new dynamic to this typically one-dimensional style of music next the first time I have hyped up a grime album this much and grime has been a doing a pretty great thing lately you know Kino and skepta and a lot of other artists who have been big names in the genre for a long time have been putting together some of the biggest releases the genre has seen in years this decade and I think that is also the case now for Wiley with this new album Godfather Wiley is also one of the most celebrated artists in the grime genre and with this album he gives us this totally unadulterated pure raw in-your-face grime sound for one track after another it's just bangers on bangers on bangers and what's interesting is once you dive into the lyrics on this thing not only does Wiley say some funny and cool personal stuff about himself but he sort of gives fans this sort of spread out grime history lesson a little bit because you can go into the locations and the brands and the artists and the various pieces of culture from the grind seem that he references throughout this album and actually get a great understanding of the world that this music comes from or at least you know piece together some kind of research where you can kind of see that the web of culture that kind of a grime was born out of of course Wiley's performances is flows all over this record are great instrumentally the album is very sound and very heavy and incredibly powerful and punchy and bacey so a lot of good things about this record love love love it and the last album I want to shout out as loving this month was Neil sisa Regas latest mashup album mouse moods this thing is hilarious its strings together some of my favorite and least favorite songs into these eerily natural collisions of music some of which are beautiful some of which just have my side splitting some of which make me kind of a recontextualize and appreciate tracks that for a long time I have outright hated and Neil just kind of has that that knack for for mashups and his approach to the mash-up is much different than any other artists out there I love how he served primarily works on tracks sort of from a more melodic perspective it's not like he's just kind of throwing some rapped verse that you've heard from some of your favorite rap albums or something on top of an instrumental from a rock or a pop band or an indie band that you're familiar with no this is like you know he's throwing the vocals from YMCA on top of the tie in the string section from the inception movie you know which somehow works it's crazy the stuff that he does with these mashups some people might write this album off is just beaten mean but I actually think it's a lot more than that there is quite a bit I think that go into Neil's mashups and I just think this thing is incredible and also you know shout out to the new Fox urgent album hang definitely two two scant and flawed and album four to be on my love list for this year but definitely a musical highlight for me this year hopefully the band continues down this more ambitious instrumental road keeps the recording value high on their next effort but deliver some more material deliver something a little bit more cohesive and conceptual and flows a little bit better from track to track on their next one but this was this was definitely them bouncing back really well from there and star power album and those are the releases that I am recommending to you guys this month again they are linked down there in the description box thank you for watching this video thank you for checking out the reviews and I will see you guys in the in the next one cool cool Tran in some listen albums recommend you some of them linked next to my head subscribe button fish website you're good get some sleep 
oDEEOvaaBNE,ah hi everyone Jerome Finney strike tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tie Segal album its self-titled the ever prolific one-man rock and roll machine ty Segall II as a new album out releasing a project just a year after his fantastic emotional mugger album in 2016 one of his most fuzzy noisy experimental and left-field projects yet this new one is self-titled as I said which takes me back a little bit to 2008 when ty had originally dropped a self-titled album at the time he was releasing this really rudimentary fusion of punk and garage rock he was pretty legendary for performing while playing guitar drums and singing all at the same time and now about ten years later Ty's new self-titled album showcases a much more refined approach his music is much more complex than it used to be even though he pulls from a lot of the same stylistic influences of the 60s and 70s but now he's pulling off these really sharp guitar solos sometimes too layered on top of each other amazing beautiful vocal harmonies maybe some pianos work in there - he's more versatile now than he's ever been so maybe ty is kind of taking this opportunity to drop a self-titled album and show how far he's come reinvent himself or redefine himself and as exciting or as interesting a concept as that might sound and I hope that's maybe the intention behind this thing this album still just is a 30 minute mixed bag for ty this record kicks off with tracks like freedom and break a guitar song that in my opinion are kind of by the numbers for ty Segall at this point they're not terrible but nowhere near as refreshing as I think they would need to be in order to be cause for a new album however some more adventurous writing and significant risks do come later in the album like the 10-minute monster warm hands open parentheses freedom returned this thing is an epic and multifaceted song with these blazing guitar solos weird vocal harmonies and a build-up risk that brings us into the chorus that sounds like the exact way on the hook to collective soul shine nananana nanana Menem yeah but sped up and more brittle and punky er and more intense the song progresses into this strange disjointed Jam that eventually collective eise's into this loud riff and crazy refrain that swallowed up in these brittle walls of distortion ties vocal melodies sort of sliced through the noise like a thousand degree knife through anything I love the heavy menacing presence of the song the only one even if the slow lumbering groove of the song makes the pace kind of tedious but the true highlight in the tracklisting here is Thank You mr. K at Rapids built off these fast punky riffs that sound like something that could have made it off of a Ramones record if you played it at 45 rpm then these risks are elevated with these wild pianos being hammered away on in the background it ty embellishes on these little tiny basic riffs beautifully sometimes and it just adds way more to the track than I thought it would the piano is played just so this really especially during this chaotic crescendo after the middle point of the song which just hits me like a rush after like a line of coke I don't do cocaine but really where ty surprises me on this record is with the ballads on this thing and there are quite a few and you know not these atmospheric sparse kind of lifeless acoustic tracks that I know he's recorded before there's actually like some tangible colorful beautiful instrumentation on these cuts even if ty does tend to wear his influences very obviously on his sleeve specifically on the track orange color queen but I do like the slow saloon piano on the song talkin which is a kind of a sad track really downtrodden and I like how the lyrics kind of our little abstract but they're building toward this moral of projecting one's own problems on to others and talking behind the people's backs and papers is a beautifully odd song with some very strange lyrics some tense sour vocal harmonies it sound like something off of age a retard single but back with this piano sin patter dun dun dun that has been the foundation for many many many vocal pop tunes from the 60s and even music today that likes to emulate that music the melody on take care of your hair makes the tune a somewhat fitting finish for the album even though Tie guides the song into a set of riffs that sound like they could have been on any number of records that he's put out since I don't know like 2010 I feel like he's written so many risks like this of course the ones he has on this track sound super flaccid kind of lifeless and overall while this is not a bad LP there are certainly some great highlights on this thing tie try some new things none of these tracks really connect in any significant way which makes this album read more like a compilation when you examine the overall lack of flow between these cuts on top of that I think a good chunk of this album is kind of safe and predictable for ty which is a shame because this thing is already so short I can't help but feel like if he had sat on this album for a little while longer and cut out the redundancies then we could have had a more refreshing project rather than just kind of complacently going along with the same wash rinse repeat cycle he uses to pen so many tracks on his ever-growing discography still though I'm sure the hardcore fans will like this thing and it is one of his more diverse projects yet I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing for tranching have you given this album to listen you should let it did you hate it what would you rate it as was rather the next head to light if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry all sorts of videos next to my head that you could also check out subscribe to the channel fishing website two types of golf ty Segall ty Segall types of golf forever 
WVuO8d3fgOc,hi everyone misa-nee goes tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new migos album culture me ghosts are in Atlanta rap trio has their latest commercial project now migos if you're not familiar with them and you should be because at this point their rise to fame with meteoric after the release of their versace single which is certified gold and even though for a lot of people this single may have turned stomachs it also turned a lot ahead mostly younger music listeners who saw something unique in what quavo offset and takeoff we're doing with their relentless triplet flows which are so tightly coordinated it's like the three of them are rapping inside of each other's heads they're like the Borg also each of them have these incredibly bold and distinct voices really amped ad-libs they also kind of back up and reinforce one another's lyrics so no need for one single artists to kind of overdub their own lyrics on a track just have one of the other members of the meego sort of over dub or add a little ad-lib or reinforce a certain lyric by repeating it collectively they rap as if they are one rapper like one well-oiled machine or like some kind of drum circle but instead of hitting some sort of percussive instrument each member of the migos are hitting on a word now as far as the lyrics go on this thing it's track music you're going to catch those usual themes of drugs and sex and money and violence maybe with a theme or a track concept here and there but you know it is what it is but let me go slack in unique substance they sort of make up for in unique sound add to that sound some very glamorous production from the trios usual musical plug Zaytoven and you have some of the biggest mixtapes of the past few years the issue that I've had with much of migos material so far though is its bloated with all of these similar resounding songs because truth be told me goes while they do have a unique sound it's not a very versatile sound I wouldn't say there is one dimensional as future or as young thug can occasionally be but migos haven't really done all that much in the past few years to evolve their sound and in a way that's totally understandable I mean there really hasn't been all that much pressure for them to change not only has one project theirs after another been pretty well-received by their fans but their sound is so in demand that pretty much every up-and-coming rapper bites on their style in some way shape or form this is something that even migos contemporaries do artists who overshadow them in popularity are taking ideas from their music so much so that the trio sound has kind of become a standard in modern hip-hop which is why naming this album culture isn't exactly an exaggeration because migos have been helping to guide the sound of the mainstream for a while now most recently with another viral hit the song bad and bougie whose opening line has become one of the biggest music memes of 2017 range wrap trap top rain drop drop top rain drop drop top rain drop drop down now I do like this single but I wasn't really expecting this album would be all that amazing I wasn't really thinking migos would turn a new leaf with this record or anything the most I could hope for is just that the trio delivers a tighter more concise take on their usual sound a more direct album where they throw out the redundant tracks throughout the filler tracks throughout the songs they clearly didn't put as much writing effort into just boil it down to the essentials and that's kind of what they do with the very straightforward 13 song tracklist here even though the opening song is kind of a glorified freestyle with an annoying feature from DJ Khaled I was kind of hoping for a bigger and more specific intro but instead I'm getting the song that was clearly released in promotion of this album as the refrain says again and again and again culture album coming soon that can't be the case it's here it's literally here thankfully there were some deep cuts on this record that were not only good but also reflected a slightly different approach for me goes the songs t-shirt and get right witcha and slippery with gucci mane are all reflective of this darker moodier more minimalistic and stripped-back migos which is kind of actually a really cool approach for them because it makes their vocals pop all that much more and their flows their voices are kind of the selling point of the trio obviously the strip Mack approach also applies to the bad and boozy single which is a track that I love because it's equal parts eerie and grimy and nocturnal up to the point where little easy vert appears on the track which is really where the song ends for me because whose appearance doesn't even fit with the cold-blooded vibe that me goes execute so well on this track up until this point the song what the price also adds to the moodiness of the album it's one of the more ballad like songs on the record one of the more melodic songs on the album where me goes are very clearly nodding to the instrumental style and the vocal style of Travis Scott which isn't necessarily a bad thing because Travis Scott up until this point has borrowed so much from me goes now it's a bit more of a two-way street Travis also features on the song Kelly price later on the album unfortunately though this song is one of the more lackluster cuts in the track listing it sort of sounds like this belated and boring answer to Travis's antidote single as it's very airy and atmospheric and has these other tune lead vocal melodies all over and it's very Spacey and somewhat sad but me Josas track over here doesn't really have all that much punch or memorability but the song is nowhere near as disappointing as the closer on here out yo way which is migos trying to do I don't know a bit of a pop crossover here it's just this really no glitzy auto-tune ballad that's very light very vanilla very glittery and kind of obnoxious the songs call casting and big on big sound like me goes as usual they could have easily made it onto the group's cast few mixtapes but now on this album it sounds like the production has a glassy or finish like the the sound is a little more dynamic but to that point the song brown paper bag also sounds like a track that could have been on I don't know no label 2 or something like that but actually it would have been one of the more forgettable songs in the track listing they're one of the tracks I would have easily taken off of the tape and I'm not really all that crazy about the song all ass either but given the lyrical topic of the song and the melody on the hook sure to be one of the biggest strip club anthems in 2017 unexpectedly though me goes do kind of go ambitious on the song Dead's with 2 Chainz which features this Hornbeck intro which kind of builds up a lot of tension and has this chance on the hook the verses are backed with this banger beat I wish there were more tracks in the tracklist thing this gnarly and this aggressive it would have been a nice change of pace from these moody or cuts rather than giving us more of these melodic very drab very lifeless songs that didn't really bring much momentum to the album it would have been nice to hear more risks on this album too though still with many people probably enjoying this record amigos hardcore fanbase loving this record and most artists out there borrowing ideas from this album and the trio I'm not really going to be holding my breath for them to reinvent themselves anytime soon still though I'm happy to hear more focused me goes though their style still sound somewhat one-dimensional on this record it is still very unique it is still very bold it's still very colorful it's still very energetic and it is handed to us with relatively little in the way of filler and BS on culture I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I argue next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave

Cf3ywGG90UE,hey everyone new cine music here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm doing a video here that I almost didn't do if it wasn't for the fact that one of you guys hit me up I think on Twitter or something it was like hey man what are you going to tell us what albums you're anticipating for 2017 I was like god damn I almost forgot to tell you guys what albums I was anticipating for the cherry even better almost forgot to make a list and this is going to be a list of the albums for about the first third of the first half the year that I'm pretty sure coming out that I am anticipating and then later in the list some albums from artists that haven't gotten dates yet and artists that haven't announced or anything but I'm hoping they drop something this year I'm hoping I'm going to hear something from them this year so we're just going to take a pretty casual in this video not too many goofy edits or anything like that we're just going to go through this list of albums I am anticipating let's kick it off with February because January's pretty much over at this point Big Sean has a new album coming out though at the very start of February not to say I'm excited for a Big Sean album but I am definitely going to be listening to it and most likely giving my thoughts on is titled I decided pretty interesting title for Big Sean for the rest of February I'm definitely gonna be looking forward to the new Surfer blood album Snowdonia definitely wondering what's going to go on there leann rimes --is latest record remnants not saying like I'm promising a review on that but I am curious as to what's going to go on there because you know I remember when I was a kid a lot of people were making a big deal out of a LeAnn Rimes Lupe Fiasco has a new album coming out soon Drogo slight that's also coming out in February I'm curious as to what to be going to be going on over there we also have teen days dropping a new record themes for dying earth that I am a morbidly curious about though I've never been like a hardcore fan and thievery corporation a group that I don't remember people talking about like since I was much much younger the temple of I and I they have a new record coming out in February as well February just dense dense with album releases it seems coming out in the middle of the month we have a gentle Ekman has new album coming out in February we have Ryan Adams Tim Darcy of aht new record Saturday night I'm actually looking forward to his a solo debut they're looking to see if he kind of stands a well on his own he does seem like a very quirky and sort of eclectic frontman when he's in front of ought but it seems like he's playing a little more straight on the solo stuff so far also in February we have Dirty Projectors dropping new record King gizzard and the lizard wizard are going to be dropping one of their four or five albums of 2017 that they have said they're going to drop the first one is going to be dropping in February Louis campesinos sick scenes I'm actually looking forward to that record and the feel is morbidly curious about that record pissed jeans while of now having a having an album drop in February some noise rock there some post hardcore there why not Thunder cat and Shu Shu also dropping in February Thunder cat with a record drunk Shu Shu with forget and Sun Kil moon at the very very end of the month the common as light and love are red valleys of blood album so those are pretty much our February albums as far as March Blanc mass of but insane has a new album coming out granddaddy is making their return with a new album titled last place moving on from there - the bear haven't heard from them in a while but not really like all that curious honestly never been like a huge fan of the Sleaford mods English tapes they have to do project coming I was wondering if they were going to do something this year temples I'm curious so I've never been a fan why with the album mou-chan they have a new album coming out though I've never been a hardcore wife and I am curious as to what is on that record also in March we have Laura Marling and Raekwon Laura Marling with a semper Femina Raekwon with the wild square pushers Shobha leader one project is dropping an album called elec track and The Shins with the album heartworms that's at the start of March moving on from there to the next week it's spoon hot thoughts their album I am very curious about the title the lead single the title track the lead single from that album was so good moving on from there we have Mount Erie a crow looked at me that's going to be a dark record that's going to be a heavy record I'm looking forward to that album but I'm also not looking forward to that album because I know it's going to be a heavy heavy album you know some very sad themes on that record for sure Paul bear with the album heartless I am kind of curious that they pull through on this one and the Jesus and Mary Chain are actually making their comeback in the month of March - with the record damage and joy and Wolf Eyes with the album undertow maybe it'll be one of their more aggressive outings and the noisy and experimental outings this time around I found their last record a little odd adventurous for them but you know they were just trying something a little different for them you know didn't seem to be anything all too new in the grander scheme of things but Wolfe is definitely looking forward to seeing what they're going to do on this undertow record a me man hopefully she's going to kill it on her latest record mental illness a very bold title there very bold choice of title at the end of March and British sea power was wondering for a while with what's been going on with British sea power let the dancers inherit their party is the name of their new record is coming at the end of March Goldfrapp with silver eye and Julia halter is coming out with a live album at the end of March which could be very beautiful pharmacon with contact that'll be harsh and abrasive as hell and why are silver lead though I'm not really all that excited about it because a lot of wires newer material is pretty mediocre in my opinion I'm not anticipating anything really from this new album and Jamiroquai is making their return with the album automaton so maybe that'll be kind of I don't know decent I'm not sure and also Chas bundok meets the Matteson - I know nothing about this project I know Chaz's name is on it so I'm just I don't know I'm sitting here like what's going to go on here what's Chaz doing I'm kind of weirded out for the month of April we have father John misty coming out with a new here comedy really looking forward to that because I loved his last record so much and the lead single from this record is so I don't know it seems like he's trending towards some more political themes in his music which could be very polarizing we'll see guided by voices though excuse me yeah they always drop a lot of material they're pretty prolific but you know just letting guided by voices fans know they're still at it they're still doing it and timber camber they have a new record coming out though I thought the first single they drop from it was kind of uh you know underwhelming you know I don't know it makes me really sad but you know I am still curious as to what's going to go on with that record that's pretty much it so far for like the the solid album release dates the concrete album release date I will say also Drake has promised he's going to drop his album before the end of February from what I have seen so you don't anticipate that Drake record very soon also Mew dropping in your record very soon though I've never been a huge new fan I will probably get that album made a shot most likely now as far as that was all stuff I was looking on my laptop over there I have a list over here as far as artists who I know should be dropping this year they're they're heavy heavy rumors of particular artists dropping records this year let's see we have Alice glass people been waiting for Alice glass to drop her solo debut ever since he's been a new Crystal Castles record she said she's going to drop solo stuff hopefully end up being better than the last Crystal Castles record because that was very mediocre Arcade Fire new singles Mavis Staples though that was more in reaction to Donald Trump there's still you know rumors of Arcade Fire dropping a record this year Charli XCX Depeche Mode they're dropping the record this year though they have not put it on a date yet and Sheeran same thing his division record is coming out this year and the gorillas album - people are anticipating that gorillas album though I'm not sure where it's going to fall within the year Gucci Mane I'm sure is going to come out with 15 projects at some point this year GZA has a new album slated to release this year as does the band higham I believe some people been talking about them dropping something this year and also it's not just Sun Kil moon dropping records not just mark kozilek dropping record this year it's also another Sun Kil moon and jassu or yaesu collaborative project I guess they saw you know sort of some fruitful collabs coming out of their last joint album together and they decided to do another this year Joey badass has a new record coming out this year and will Kanye drop turbo graphics 16 I'm not sure you know he said he was going to drop it at some point last year and maybe it was just an idea in his head maybe it's something he had been working on and had almost finished and he wanted to put it out last year and it just just wasn't in the cards and it's being pushed back to this year I don't know he hasn't really talked about it a lot the turbo graphics 16 I'm still waiting for it I'm still crossing my fingers for it Mastodon has a new record coming out this year people have been talking about modest mouse dropping a new record this year though the last one was pretty lackluster I'm not really sure what modest mouse is going to do on a new album hopefully Queens of Stone Age comes through the new record I've been hearing some people reference Queens of Stone Age putting out a new record this year Spiritualized I hope they drop something Saint Vincent I hope she dropped something this year Vampire Weekend crossing my fingers your old Droog a New York rapper your old Droog has told me that he's dropping something this year so I'm waiting for that album to come out and Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine has dropped some solo material and will that lead to a new full-length album I'm not entirely sure and that's it for like you know what people have been sort of rumored is dropping this year as far as stuff that I'm hoping comes out this year you know personal favorites of mine I'm hoping I hear some music from igloo ghosts this year that fantastic EP that he dropped the year before last is still stuck in my head and I'm hoping for a new album this year also I want to hear something from Flying Lotus I know we have some work on that film that's dropping this year other people have been sort of very hype about it would be cool if an album or an EP or something came out as well but you know if not that film will suffice and it'll be an interesting project Milo my boy Milo before the flies come is he gonna drop something else this year I mean for sure if not under his own name there probably would be some you know more scallops Hotel stuff but I'm wondering if there's going to be more Milan material this year open mike eagle bus driver I don't know I don't know moving on from there the underachievers are they going to drop something their last record that doubles sort of conceptual album that they put out was pretty decent actually very good and sort of wondering where they're going to take things from there fka twigs the queen of alternative R&B is she going to draw something weird and left-field and crazy and psychedelic this year I don't know the mountain goats are they going to drop something this year really like their last album beat the champ quite a bit interesting concept for a record and will they follow it up with another great album and here's here's question numero uno will Death Grips be silent in 2017 will Death Grips be quiet in 2017 are they going to drop something because I mean I know they had a pretty incredible 2016 that EP drops at full length album dropped every year up until this point they've dropped something so I don't think it's very likely they're going to be quiet for the entirety of 2017 but if they will drop something this year if they're going to drop something this year what you know well they just come through with another sort of traditionally released kind of measured and somewhat predictable new full-length album sort of like what bottom list it was or are they going to find a new way to sort of with their fans again and just do something completely insane and off-the-wall and reinvent their PR campaign once again and sort of you know continue to break the rulebook of how artists disseminate music in the modern age so I'm actually pretty excited for Death Grips to do something in 2017 not just because of the musical potential but because of that way that they continue to push the envelope as far as like being a band in regards to performance art some pretty increase interested to see what's going to go on there Clarence clarity I want to hear some from Clarence clarity this year certainly was hinting you know towards something with that same EP he dropped last year will we hear a new album I would love to hear a follow-up to know now I've been banging that record still and it's still an incredible pop album still an incredibly progressive and imaginative pop album he's really ahead of the curve I think everything everything are they going to drop a new album you know really like the last record Fleet Foxes have a new album coming out of this year they've been talking of releasing a record Robyn Peck Knoll has been writing and writing and writing and sort of worrying what's going to happen with their new stuff Dean Blunt is there going to be a new Dean blunt record this year not just a new dean Blunt album but a new dean Blunt album the sort of reaches everybody his last project was sort of a more of an exclusive project on Bandcamp and then he had that baby father project I'm sort of wondering what he's going to do in 2017 there would be a bigger wider release that more people will sort of grab ahold of and will sort of gain more buzz Ariel pink he has a new EP out with wise blood but will he drop a new full-length album a solo project this year a perfume genius would love to hear more perfume genius music would love to hear new ice age music new music from Ice Age would be amazing liars would love to hear more liars wondering what mad lid is going to do this year maybe MF DOOM will do something this year and finally what's Freddie Gibbs going to do this year because Freddie Gibbs sort of had a lot of his 2016 dominated by these legal issues he was having over in Europe and now he's back over here in the States he's been released what's what's he going to do is you know Kyle the new album soon is going to be collaborating with a producer for the length of an entire album is he going to work with a bunch of different reducers like what's going to happen here so yeah that's it those are basically the artists that I'm looking forward to hearing something from this year and yeah that's it let me know down in the comments what you are anticipating musically in 2017 and next time I sort of see you guys in this kind of anticipation music video album song artist capacity will probably later in June or July and I'll sort of do a list of things that I'm looking for for the second half of the year and that's it oh and also at the drive-in at the drive-in should be dropping the record this year at some point and I'm wondering what that's going to shape up to be like so Furman in that last one on and I'm sure there are lots of other artists and albums that have been announced or been announced saying that if sort of you know flown over my head here so please you know throw those down in the comments because I do read them the stuff that you guys are looking forward to this year that you know is either in addition to what I'm anticipating stuff that slipped by me or stuff you're sort of agreeing with me on like oh yeah I'm looking forward to that new gorillaz album as well mr. Antonio Fant ownio and that's it you guys are the best transition have you anticipated it yeah for 2017 if you have let me know what they are okay all sorts of links next to my head other videos channel subscription official website click on one of them or leave a comment telling me your favorite thing about anime forever 
OsVtqDxhFcw,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerds you know who it is and it's time for our weekly track roundup at the best and the worst tracks of the week along with some of the songs that I just thought were kind of meant and yeah so we're going to plow through these tracks they're all listed down there in the description box along with ahem our amazon associates link if you hit that link and you live in the US anything you buy on Amazon after you click on it we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price supports this segment yeah you're the best alright let's move on to these tracks with the worst tracks for the week of course we we rip off the band-aid here we get to the worst tracks first in my opinion the worst songs that I had miss pleasure the displeasure the non pleasure the no pleasure of hearing kicking it off with the new Major Lazer song run it up this new Major Lazer track is the collaboration between Major Lazer partynextdoor and Nicki Minaj that I never knew I never wanted and I never want to hear it again it's another piece of whitewashed boring vanilla dancehall that just sort of seems to be dominating the charts right now and I can't wait until this trend is over moving on from there Missy Elliott with I'm better featuring lamb unfortunately this track is not as good as I wanted it to be and when I first heard I was like yeah you know what yeah but look the more I listened to it I was like move this is act this is actually really rough track and I can sort of see what miss Lea Missy Elliott was trying to do on the song and I have enjoyed some of her recent singles that song WTF so much that it ended up on last year's favorite singles of the year list and the list the year before that because I'm a moron but this new single over here she wanted to make one of these kind of whisper-quiet minimalist quirky bangers with a catchy hook some of which have been very iconic over the years like you know that that one yin yang twins song where or uh you know beatin the pussy up or that Pharrell song with Snoop Dogg drop it like it's hot or you know even bitch you guessed it you know these iconic hip-hop singles that they're so stripped back they're so skeletal and she tries to do the same thing over here but the lyrics are subpar they're not that memorable the beat is kind of forgettable Lam's contribution of the song is ridiculous so I don't know what if you're working with so few elements in the song they've all got to be great it can't just be the strip backtrack and then it's it's amazing just because of that you know you have to make sure everything that goes into that soup is high-quality ingredient didn't end up being in case is this time around unfortunately moving on from there we have the band wire awesome art rock art punk and post-punk band wire with short elevated period this is a rough track this sounds awful I mean wire ever since I want to say like late 2000s every recording the band comes out with is badly recorded it's badly mixed it's badly produced it's muddy as hell and this song for me is really kind of the straw that breaks the camel's back the camel's back why is it wire cannot come through the clear recording why is it every time they come out with a new record it's muddy it's flat the production is terrible I was it just baffles my mind because and it just makes their music so unlistenable and I love wire I love their early recordings I think they're very creative band and I think there's certainly potential in their newer material but consistently the production just ruins it over and over and over so I'm just here I'm just saying why are please just like better mixing on the future stuff better mixing on the upcoming stuff because this is just this is this is not what the fans deserve this is not what fans want moving on from there we have a noni who has a new track out titled Paradise which apparently is going to be on a new EP which is a follow-up to her album that dropped last year which was a pretty interesting art pop album very politically charged songs on there that I like quite a bit too however this new track over here is a weird awkward flat and no very subpar in terms of writing like trap ballad you know there were elements of trap production to some of the beats on her last album but now she just like goes full in all in on this new track and it's just kind of like a boring trap instrumental with I don't know just like a weak ballad thrown on top of it just do not get the appeal of this track unfortunately and I'm hoping that this is not sort of the trend of this new EP these songs sort of sound like the barely finished demos of tracks that could have been on the last record because that's certainly what this song sort of sound like to me moving on from there we have to give a mention to what is my least favorite track of the week I guess this new Koko Rosie song smoke them out featuring an open e as well majoring making two appearances on the list the worst section this week unfortunately Koko Rosie never been a big fan and this song is pretty much an example as to why because just this really awkward bad rap music art pop that just sounds really awkward and is just as I don't know you know if I were to liken it to tasting something it would be just like taking a big fat roasted turkey leg cutting the meat off of it and then throwing that into a blender with some apple juice and pretty much every sugary kids cereal that you could imagine and just slurping that down and that's like that's that's what this feels like to me it's just like a bunch of non complimentary tastes just all blended into a bowl of slop that is completely unappealing and unappetizing but let's move on to the tracks that I thought were sort of met this week the songs I was kind of indifferent toward we had this new Lupe Fiasco single which is titled tranquille and or tranquilo and the Lupe Fiasco joins up with bit with Rick Ross a big crate on this one it's kind of a vanilla track from Lupe unfortunately it's not one of his hard-hitting more interesting tracks more poignant tracks these corny bars about him surrounding himself with nutrition it's not really that interesting there's not really that strong of a theme running throughout all the verses here though I will say Rick Ross and Big KRIT they do do a decent job when they do show up on this cut the instrumentals really glitzy and glamorous I'm not really that into it you know it's decent there's nothing terrible about the song I think Lupe fans will love it of course but I'm not really that into it unfortunately moving on from there we have a Tim Darcy of the band OTT with the song still waking up Tim is trying his hand at being a crooner on this new track and I imagine that'll probably about that'll probably be the case on so many of the cuts later in the deeper sort of a bowels of this new record he has coming out and then I don't know it's not bad it doesn't have the herky-jerky quirkiness the eclecticism that i liked so much about Ott's last record that i like about their music in general but it certainly seems tim can can hold his own as far as the songwriting style goes I'm just hoping that the material outside of this track is a little more compelling moving on from there Porter ray a rapper that I believe was brought to the Sub Pop label has a new record coming out over there by a palace fear Lazaro of Shabazz Palaces who actually appears on this track not a bad cut marrying the believer with the song crust over here Marian Lieber of wild birds and peace drums Fame I also loved her debut full-length album solo debut and then this new song over here it has a lot of the elements that I love about her music sort of the mysticism the beautiful vocals the kind of esoteric lyrics but this track structurally is really a mess like it has no momentum whatsoever it just kind of jumps from one idea to the next with no fluidity or segues moving you from one passage to another so it just kind of feels like really disorienting and like a bunch of spare pieces that aren't really put together so I'm hoping that the other songs on this upcoming record are a little more cohesive because while there were moments of this track that were really beautiful there wasn't much to it that felt like it was in really stitch together all that seamlessly moving on from there Corrine Riggins with Corrine Riggins excuse me with a for ease and oddness for EJ for ease J and oddness odd title but unfortunately not a very odd track sort of a team that'll be an instrumental here from Kareem knowing what I know about his music how sort of jazzy and left-field and interesting his beats his production tends to be because he is a sort of multi-instrumentalist and a hip-hop instrumental producer this track search seemed really a I don't know really colourless for me you know not terrible certainly had a lot of the elements that you would want in a beat from Kareem Riggins but not really one of his more memorable pieces of production unfortunately we have mastered on with Sultan's curse sound in a little Dada rock on this new single over here and you know because some of the cleanly some vocals on this Jack sounded like something out of like a really bad 90s alternative rock billboard hit or something was was hoping for something a little harder for Mastodon but it sort of seems like that there passed several records has kind of been defined by this desire to find this balance between you know the sludge metal the progressive metal of their older records with sort of a more accessible and tuneful and radio-friendly sound not really sure why radio is not really dictating the direction of rock as much as it used to be but whatever so this track it's okay you know I do like elements of it I just think some of the cleans on the track are somewhat ridiculous Paul bear with the song thorns if you love your doom metal if you love your sludge metal if you love your stoner metal do give this a shot as usual with Paul bear the vocals are lacking there so in the distance they're so buried and then we'll bring that much to the table and finally we're going to kick this section off with real estate real estate this song is definitely an improvement I mean real estate their music is always in way too sleepy for me way too disengaged for me way to just wallpaper for me but this track has a really interesting instrumental - I love how bright and kind of easygoing and pretty the guitars sound all over the track the basis of smooth the drums are crisp and the groove that they play on the song has a really odd feel to it I love that a lot but sort of like with that pallbearer track the vocals are lacking don't bring that much to the table and eventually the band doesn't really progress the song enough to the point where it stays engaging for the duration of the whole track so it does kind of end up being forgettable before the song is even over so you know that's sort of the med section let's move on to my favourite tracks of the week bustin these out Mount Erie with the song real death definitely the most powerful song I've heard all week I don't really want to say too much about it because it's such a painful track to listen to knowing recently what phil has gone through with the passing of his wife you know he pulls no punches on this track not only in that he describes in great detail the sorrow and anguish that he's been feeling and sort of his experiences but also kind of bringing up this idea that death when you're singing about death real death death that has affected you in a way personally in a really immediate enclosed way it doesn't make you want to write a song it doesn't make you want to be poetic it doesn't make you want to create an album it's not something to make a piece of art over I mean even though that's in fact what he's doing he's sort of making a comment on that whole process as well because in a way you know that's sort of what the fans are expecting at this point that's what the fans are probably dying to hear about on this new album Phil's music tends to be so personal and of course fans are going to go into the record like oh what is he going to say about you know what just happened to him I'm curious about it so I feel like in a way he's sort of commenting on that in an interesting way with this track moving on from their father John misty with pure comedy this song has been one of the more polarizing cuts of this entire week because of some of the politics of the song here is my take on that track this new father John misty track is awesome it's this piano ballad that is very socially aware but has a dark sense of humor to it it's very much in the same tone as that song board in the USA from his last album but this song is is not as funny and because the the topic the things mentioned in this song the shitshow that I think this past year really was politically and socially is so grim it's a very grim image of not just what's been happening recently but kind of just the human condition at large I think father John misty put some very interesting poignant phrases in the lyrics of this song and I think the song progresses musically in a really nice way a lot of good things about this track it may be a little preachy to some people but it doesn't read to me as him taking a really cliched political stance on anything more just kind of being above the fray and just commenting on this orgy of fail that's been going on good fuckin track moving on from there the band's show me the body the New York thrash hardcore punk rap experimental band has a new banger that dropped this week I will trash it is rough it is abrasive it's somewhat Death Grips inspired I think but they come to a different conclusion like it doesn't sound quite like a ripoff or anything like that but it is definitely doing a noise hop thing I think a little bit with some strong rock elements mixed in there to me not you the song relief this is actually like an interesting piece of very melodic female fronted indie pop if you could even call it that you know it seems like there's a lot of elements to this thing certainly bit of 90s nostalgia mixed in there I think is one of the most prominent pieces of the recipe and these two tracks that a stereo gun premiered are actually pretty catchy and I'm looking forward to seeing what this band drops this year Pond if you're a pond fan they are treating fans to a new album this year and this new single is titled sweep me off my feet one of the quirkier and more bright and the I don't know somewhat poppy songs that I've heard from Tom you know I've never been a huge pond fan but this sort of seems like a new direction that they're going in over here seems like they're kind of riding on the coattails of you know what tame impala have been doing lately a little bit but not so much that it's like you know a terrible track or anything like that or distracting seems like a decent single Thunder cat with the song show you the way featuring freakin Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald you know of course they do a bit of a throwback R&B thing and you know it's definitely totally 70s totally AZ 80s it's got those jazzy chord progressions in there too it's somewhat tongue-in-cheek and corny but I actually like the balladry of it a lot in Kenny Loggins and and Michael McDonald actually kill it on their vocal features so I'm actually pretty happy with the track moving on from their young fathers with only God knows young fathers killing it on this new single these guys went from being this crazy lo-fi rap trio to really playing with every genre thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and now they're touching down a little bit of gospel with this new track over here with some awesome background vocals from the least congregational choir if I'm pronouncing that correctly I hope I am and it's actually a pretty beautiful track with some very bulky punchy drums very shouty in-your-face lead vocals they've kind of got that lo-fi thing going on still like the vocals still seem a little rough around the edges some other elements of the production seem kind of rough but the chorus set the choral group sounds beautiful some of the elements of the instrumental sound beautiful so young fathers continuing to do really interesting mix of textures in their songs playing with sound in a really interesting way writing songs that sort of piece together different genres in an interesting way to young fathers really just kind of an amalgamation of a bunch of different things that come together into a pretty cohesive and distinct sound so I'm loving to hear them continue to mature you know keep it keep it going young fathers you're doing great stuff this band who I'm not even going to pretend to know how to print their name they're an Icelandic black metal band they have a new track out titled HOF which is rough and progressive and epic as hell I love this track this track is hard hitting this track is exciting it's blood pumping its cults as fuck and I'm hoping hear more from these guys soon and Aristophanes who is a rapper who you might have caught on Grimes last album has a new track out produced by Grimes I believe dropping an album this year - that's going to be a stateside and this track is total banger the track is titled humans become machines and it's colorful it's off-the-wall it's insane it's everything that I liked about her feature off of Brian's last album of a sort of you know put into a full-length track and is a very eccentric and yeah I'm just liking all these tracks so there you go those are all the songs I'm recommending those are my least favorite tracks those are my met tracks enjoy all those links down there in description box

sj-0ya-ePq0,hey what up everybody it's jeans mini-jack tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new William Basinski album a shadow in time this is the latest full-length album from composer ambient music composer multi-instrumentalist avant-garde music composer William Basinski most well known for his four-part series the disintegration loops and while shadow in time doesn't seem to be connected to those works his most legendary works in any way conceptually Williams familiar style of layering and looping all of these sounds hypnotically on top of each other is very much present on this new record he does so for about 40 minutes to 20 minute tracks on this record both of which have their own distinct flavor on the album the opening track is titled for David Robert Jones obviously a David Bowie tribute which sticks out mostly because of its distorted ghostly melodies and distant reverb so sax loops the repetitions of these loops are very clear but Williams sort of warps and makes the mix very woozy on this track in such a way it just kind of puts me in a lull where while I'm listening to I'm really in no rush for it to finish as the song nears its finish he adds some deep sub bass into the mix so there's like a nice even basic Rumble going on in the track the title track on this thing features a much smoother more even drone with layer upon layer of a cereal airy tones kind of cascading over one another slowly gently sliding into the mix popping out of the wall of sound that's behind it and then kind of slowly fading back into it William progresses the drone into a series of movements where he emphasizes different frequencies the drone itself eventually evaporates and gives away to this very lonely distant piano passage which is very beautiful and is not just a good ending to the track but to the album itself this album doesn't seem to be as bogged down in process as I've known previous Basinski albums to be and if it was it's not really all that apparent because it does feel like on these tracks he was legitimately trying to compose music and what was driving that composition his heart his emotions his creative mind not so much an experiment he had in mind or or a weird experimental rule because the movements that these tracks made felt very conscious like he was trying to give these songs just enough progression to the point where on a cerebral level it's very clear that you know there's movement happening something's going on there's a reason to stick around with this even if on the surface level what you're listening to appears to be incredibly minimal there was something about these tracks that I had a hard time placing though and that was the emotional quality of these songs and not that Basinski is famous for the most emotionally charged music ever to be recorded not really the case but I feel like what he's provided the listener on this project is an emotional canvas of sorts with both of these tracks there's an even balance of sounds and texture neither of the two tracks or the movements within the tracks are so gloomy and dreary that they could be misconstrued as depressing nor are they so airy and bright that they could be called purely blissful either I think the feeling is you pull out of these tracks are the feelings that you project onto these tracks which is kind of an interesting accomplishment from my point of view as most ambient music I hear either sways clearly in one way or the other or is trying its best to be emotionally neutral live up to that Eno ideal of musics answer to furniture but since keys efforts here feel a little more engaging than that his approach to texture is far from bland and both of these tracks feature clear elements of progression and tension without straying too far away from those tenets of ambient and drone music those tenants I would say are what William lives up to best on this project because the way he layers and loops sounds on this thing it gives the satisfying feeling of endlessness sort of like I'm using my ears to stare into infinity again what's here is a little emotionally ambiguous but not to say that there's a lack of emotion here what you get out of this thing is what you want to pull out of this thing or maybe what he's given us is not just a canvas as I said earlier but maybe some kind of emotional mirror because as far as interpretation goes I think you go a lot of different directions with these two tracks I like this album I think it's pretty good I wouldn't call it the most innovative or unique ambient or experimental music I've ever heard in my life certainly not and while I do think there is a strong element of emotion to this record it's also quite methodical too there is something kind of cold about it for sure I would encourage any fans of experimental and ambient music to give this project a shot it's most likely going to go down as one of the more notable projects in those genres in 2017 and not just because of the name attached to it also because it is a quality project and even people who aren't familiar with Basinski x' work I think could easily get into this because a shadow in time a rank is one of his more accessible albums - as it's 40 minute runtime doesn't really demand all that much from a newbie but also I think that leaves the the flow and the overall I guess satisfaction rating for me on this album a little lower than I would like it to be - as the impact of this thing isn't really that great to me and I know I'm saying that about an ambient release but I'm considering that I know I'm feeling in light - decent 7 on this album chore transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate

Q2pDv4E6RpY,hey everybody in San thony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music dirt and it's time for another y-you know review where I deliver unto you a gauntlet of short brief opinions on a series of albums that I didn't get a chance to review in a full length review in the past thirty days or so this one is for January and I figured I would get this one out before the month is completely over and you know this is a part of the new format that we're doing where it's like a bunch of videos that I shot sort of in front of a green screen that I placed a first on Twitter twitter name up here at the needle drop follow me over there please and without any further ado here is the y-you know review enjoy newsflash I'm going to die having never been an AFI fan and that's totally fine that's totally fine no reason for me to make that jump if I don't feel like making that jump especially since I think a lot of their early punk releases were not that great and the more alternative and somewhat dark goth emo goth II releases they would come out with afterwards didn't really win me over either and their last record burials was one of my least favorite albums of that year when it had dropped this in the record that was is not really that bad it's not the bland washed out alternative pop rock that burials was this is actually a little more energetic a little more throttling a little more exciting fighting so if you're looking for some pop punk with the somewhat dark edge a little eyeliner and some kind of clean production then give this thing a shot not really for me but I see the appeal in it for sure why why boring album boring no memorable songs or personality finally made the time to sit down and give this thing in in depth listen and I don't know man I mean while some of the funky rhythms and the drum machine beats they're kind of loud and punching and compressed they're still there I feel like civil civics embrace of atmosphere and reverb and some really weird glassy synthesizers have kind of taken the punch away from their sound you know it's not as visceral it's not as exciting it's not as hard-hitting while in a sense it is more dynamic I guess they wanted to make a sound that had a little more body to it not as much meat and potatoes as was the case on their Devi rules album I feel like the end result here is just kind of a little underwhelming here comes Kidz Bop again fixing the pop music industry's numerous countless unrelenting mistakes honestly I've never heard a rendition of 24-karat magic performed with so much conviction same goes for their rendition of Charlie Poots we don't talk anymore as I'm listening to the song my heart breaks because it feels like they're really not talking anymore I think music in general would just be a lot better if we took by kids bops example if we just let them shine a light and show the way then maybe we'd actually get like a good a good pop record for once you know okay Pizza and cunnilingus both give me heartburn maybe the lyric of the year but this thing is so terribly tuneless and awkward and unlistenable it's like every cliched stereotype of experimental indie music from the 2000s just relentlessly delivered non-stop for the duration of an entire album and it [Music] and it's a bone state it's a bone tape uh but between this and the Hyperion EP and you her that dropped not too long ago I can't help but feel like even though these releases all have their moments the original appeal of Krauss has kind of been lost and without it even being formally announced it's like they become a completely different band like the triumphant melodies the tension building chord progressions have all kind of been thrown completely out the window and the black metal influence too and the band has essentially become another hyper-technical dense and somewhat noodley Colin Marston project which I mean he has so many already to to mention you know I mean if I wanted to hear something like this I would rather just listen to the old the octopus because they take this sound this level of technical ability down to such an extreme that it's like mind-blowing this to me sort of seems a little middle-of-the-road and compare some of other Marsten projects because now it's kind of falling more in line with some of what he's already recorded in the past with other bands of the project so I don't know I mean a while I don't mind this it's not really what I go to Crowley's to hear I guess and you know maybe a the American side of atmospheric black metal has sort of had its day in the Sun and bands and artists or no longer that interested in pursuing it you know maybe fans as well so this is a part of the natural progression I guess but you know I'm not really as enthused about this new evolution of the band I guess oh I can't believe this succeed so these guys are writing tracks that sound like Drake they sound like Drake clones they're totally ripping off tons of ideas from the Drake song book from the Drake playbook but then then you look into the lyrics and there's all these like subtle but also very obvious nods toward Christianity they're like Drake clone doughy Christian burrows that are trying to bring you the message of God through the sound of Drake and it is hilarious no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you know personally I'm not really crazy about it but if you're looking for a very chill semi ambient collection of very serene electronic beats with kind of a mix of synthetic and acoustic sounds that come off very pretty much of the time though I wouldn't say it's like urgent I wouldn't say it's the kind of music that really pushes itself to the forefront of your mind kind of falls into the background but it's very beautiful background I guess occasional strength section and vocal guests here and there to sort of break things up and add some variety but to me it's really just kind of a constant it's wallpaper it's just kind of atmospheric and it's not really all that demanding that kind of turns me off a little bit you know but for those of you who are again and there are a lot of you you know who are looking for that really relaxing sort of serene experience with your electronic music give this thing a listen hey this is a pretty cool art pop album from 2016 that slipped through the cracks for me but it's cool so give it a try what do I have to beg you to try what do I need to do just start lifting artists that you might like to Bjork Ollie Herndon freaking Laurie Anderson is going to try it's pretty good I wanted to like that so much because it sounded so hard and heavy and noisy and aggressive you know it's definitely got some strong old-school industrial and noise rock influences going on but compositionally vocally there's nothing really memorable about it you know it's just kind of like this aggressive blur [Music] no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm not gonna no no no no keep it up sartorius keep mixing Frere Jacques with some real track shit and you'll see what happens MattyB is going to come by and put you in the dirt boy MattyB has got this MattyB runs this game he's running it and you're this is Maddie B's world and you're living in it okay Big Eight kind of okay is okay I don't really see the big feel it's okay it takes kana okay go change I don't think we'll listen in a year it's okay it's big kana okay okay I don't really see the big feelings okay it ain't trynna okay ago we probably won't remember it in a year he's kind of bringing it back old-school that old-school ambient sound but you know whether or not it's needed in 2016 I'm not really sure I guess that's up for the listener to decide a and there we have the latest episode of the why you know review hope you guys enjoyed it and I'm sure there's a playlist linked next to my head right now where you can check out other why you know reviews that we have put out in the recent past or maybe even the distant past you're the best I believe in you have a nice day forever 
w_jO52l-8ok,ah the flannel it's the foil hi everyone and instead of LAN ello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Neil assist serega album mouse moods Neil is a content creator of many talents and and mediums but in the music world he is a singer he's a songwriter he's a multi-instrumentalist he's a producer he is a mash-up master this is one of his mashup projects he's coming through with yet another album of popular music collisions that I never thought were possible all of this broke out about three years or so ago Neil was turning heads with this meme that filled mashup record called mouths sounds which took a slightly more refined approach to a lot of the sound clown tracks you might catch on the sound cloud platform or on reddit where home producers regularly post these sonic torture chambers that string together clips lifted from smash mouth and bare naked ladies and Shrek and Death Grips Skrillex and migos and Will Smith the music from video games vaporwave kids cartoon shows and basically anything else that sounds inappropriate unnecessary annoying or hilarious and Neil was certainly down for all these memes to I mean after all this mouth sounds album is loaded with one sample after the next of Smash Mouth all-star there's even a Daft Punk revision on this thing topped with the lyrics to the band's hit song walking on the Sun the point I'm trying to make here is that this album wasn't just some assembly some mess of audacity edited nightmares Neil was putting together tracks that were silly but felt like songs had structure and could compete with the likes of some of the biggest and most notable mashup artists out there but with a distinct personality and a strong sense of humor Neil would then go on to release a prequel album - mouth sounds mouth silence which we at one time thought was a smashmouth free mashup album that saw neil bringing together the worlds of Kate Bush and Katy Perry Jimi Hendrix and Hanson and even Elton John and System of a Down and doing it fluidly and cohesively now there were moments on this album where it just sounded like two worlds were colliding that really never should have gotten together in the first place not only because the tone of the vocals don't really match the instrumental but also they might be slightly out of key or the chords don't quite match up most notably tracks like close to the Sun and sexual Lion King but mostly this album was a unique fusion of sounds that no other artists on the planet was taking quite this far or executing this skillfully now the missions set by the previous two albums here pretty much continues on mouth moods there's nothing conceptually different on this album for Neil but it sounds like he's refined his talents a little bit he's worked out the kinks and the result is his smoothest and most fluid and consistent album yet not only that but I think he's gotten better at making these very unlikely combinations sound eerily natural like these mashups were just meant to be whether its tracks like starting line or annoyed grunt where the song is more of a menagerie of a bunch of different clips single bars of tracks or pieces of vocals sort of assembled like a Frankenstein monster with spare pieces of cake and Montell Jordan and m.i.a and The Simpsons and Austin power and Smashing Pumpkins and disturbed and the home improvement theme song and then there are other songs where he's seamlessly assembling two tracks like a really intricate puzzle and it somehow sounds really good and while he's doing this I feel like Neil it advertently exposes just how many hidden similarities there are between some of our favorite and even least favorite tracks prime example the song floor corn which might have taken a lot of tedious editing but the final results a combination of hot butters popcorn song with drowning pools bodies hit the floor is nothing short of amazing breathtaking really because I can't stop laughing at the song too then there are other cups like dear dinosaur which is a really amazing fusion of the beetles dear Prudence with was not was walk the dinosaur the track that was a pretty huge meme on 4chan back in the day but you know it's still a really great funk song the final result is smooth it's funky its soulful more somber moment in the tracklist here is the song bustin which sees the vocals from TLC's no scrubs on top of the legendary guitar intro to Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven never in a million years what I thought that these things work together but somehow they do and it's kind of gorgeous meanwhile the song time is a combination of the time string sections of from Hans Zimmer off of the inception soundtrack and the village people's YMCA somehow putting the vocals on top of these powerful orchestral strings brings a hidden sadness to them that was probably not apparent to most listeners over the tracks original disco beat I found myself just like listening to this lawyer this audio so bad [Music] meanwhile the song the end does kind of the reverse for Linkin Park's in the end where the edginess and the sadness of the lyrics is singing from that song it's sort of taken off by a very funky Doobie Brothers instrumental which somehow also works like uh it's just smooth as butter and speaking of smooth that is the next track which is a marriage of the Barenaked Ladies one week with goddamn smooth criminal' not one of my favorite mashups on here because goddamn I hate that bare naked lady song I hate those vocals I hate that rapping I hate those lyrics so much one week is on my least favorite pop songs of that decade and of course Neil brings those vocals on again with the song stand by meme which is obviously a reference to the joke the fact that he is repeating the barenaked ladies song on to the next track but he's just putting it over to the standby me instrumental so I see the sense of humor seeping through there I get the joke I think it's funny in concept but what I'm actually listening - I'm like God I'm listening to the Barenaked Ladies no on the song tiger we get a combination of the eye of the tiger within excesses need you tonight the very funky sexy sleek pop rock instrumental there and the vocals are actually edited so that they're about a tiger the where tiger is constantly being inserted into the lyrics so that the song is a more about Tiger than it is the eye of the tiger or you know triumphant or competing or succeeding or advancing or whatever and what's funny is that this song is complete with loads of vocal samples from Frosted Flakes commercials so you got tony the tiger going great all over the track and i still can't believe the you spin me round' instrumental somehow fits underneath Oasis's Wonderwall of course with some very heavy pitch manipulation to make the choruses work but god damn is this an amazing remix and the song busting is a track that I loved hearing pop upon Neil's SoundCloud a few years ago it's an amazing centerpiece to the record and a great revision of the Ghostbusters theme song to be highly danceable and highly sexual as the word busting takes on an entirely different meaning that of course neil has to bring Smash Mouth back into the fold again with the song mouth pressure where we hear all-star with some pitch shifting placed on top of the under-pressure instrumental from Queen and David Bowie and at first it seems like kind of an inconspicuous combination like kind of a basic assembly of these two moments with a little editing of the instrumental though I will say that by the end of the track the driving and very rich guitars and pianos make the lyrics feel almost triumphant it's kind of like this song in a way is a real closer a bit of a victory lap here and an acknowledgment that what we're listening to here conceptually is like a real thing and it's fun and it's entertaining the final track is a bit of an anti-climax and I imagine that's kind of on purpose because really in all ways it's like the opposite closer to the song piss off of the mouth silence mashup album not only in the fact  piss dichotomy you get it but also it's just so much more terrible of a track it's just a jock jam like it's just a jock jam instrumental with some Spice Girls samples and fred durst samples and Gwen Stefani samples the most glaring issue with this track is that Neil's fantastic sense of humor doesn't really pour through if you took this song and you brought it back in time to 2005 and played it to a club of pop music fans people would normally hear these songs on the radio they would most likely think this is like a really cool remix it just seems like a really tame moment on the album and while it may have been intentional it's still kind of disappointing as an ending though I do have to give this track some kudos on its lyrical editing where it seems like Neil is making some very subtle references to pooping and feces the act of pooping and hence the title  and he also doesn't really interesting lyrical edits on the wow-wow song which is a an edit of wolf Smith's wild wild west where they're actually some pretty absurd lyrical edits where you have will now saying lyrics like you don't want to see you my hand where my hand being at and while I am complaining of the song 300 megabytes is really nothing more than an overextended interlude for me though I do think a lot of the vocal clips on the track are funny of the woman sort of ranting on not about how a computer with a 300 megabyte hard drive is like this new amazing like technological advancement which at the time I'm sure it was and then with the song a CVC this track is proof just rock-solid proof that Bryan Johnson's vocals should not be heard over anything else other than angus young's guitar because it really sort of balances out of his weird raspy squeaky voice which has nothing to compete with over the pumping strings and glittering pianos on lisa Loeb's stay though still i do stand in amazement of the fact that the vocals and instrumental here are assembled so well because melodically and rhythmically they really come together taking Neil's past mash of efforts into account I think a lot of my favorite mixes a lot of my favorite combinations from him do still sit on mouths silence but this is easily Neil's most consistently entertaining album most fluid project most accessible project I think most tasteful projects there are some amazing combinations on here like that Hans Zimmer and the Village People well there are some moments of conceptual genius like starting line having the starting lines to all of these other tracks layered on top of each other and it seems like Neal really paid attention to how these songs moved into one another because this really feels like a cohesive experience I love this record I think in time I'm going to warm up to it even more because there's just so much good material on here and I am blown away by Neal's fantastic effort on this thing as much of a joke or is Meany or is silly or is it served this album may seem there's an incredible amount of effort in detail going into this to make this album as entertaining as it is I'm feeling a strong 82 a light 9 on this thing your transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I were you next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and hit one of the videos next to my head because there are some videos next matter you should check out okay cool all right make sure to you know give this album a shot to forever 
Su7lhOHdGEY,see hi everyone papa mini popped an arrow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Fox legend album hang Fox Egon who I have reviewed on a couple occasions in the past are a singing songwriting duo consisting of Jonathan Rado and Sam France - West Coast boys on jag Jaguar records this I believe is like their fourth their fifth album at this point and for me personally through all of these albums it has been an interesting ride from the fantastic lo-fi and kind of ambitious take the kids off Broadway the songs on this album were sporadic constantly shifting and sound and in style it was like listening to a band suffer from musical schizophrenia Fox again on a dime would turn and hit you with some Bowie some kinks some stones some Beatles maybe a little bit of Velvet Underground - then on their breakout follow-up album in 2013 we are the 21st century but a lot of the same stylistic influences came through on this record but the band played them way straighter not changing every few seconds or you know constantly shifting in style it's like they would stick to a sound and just carry it out through a whole tune let's quirky and eclectic at the end of the day but still a pretty compelling album but then it was like the band completely went off the deep end with the super lackluster Jonathan Rado solo album and then the record and star power a near 90-minute headache that was badly recorded badly performed and barely written I'm amazed this thing made it onto the jag Jaguar discography like the label didn't you know turn it back and just feel like hey you should go back to the drawing board on this one I don't think anyone would have blamed them I could rant about this record all day I will not now that brings us to this new record hang and album that fortunately I did not go into this thing anxious or expecting a bad album because I thought the single leading up to this record were so great namely the song America this track was politically charged it was epic it was triumphant not only is this track a captivating mix of critique and tribute but it also is a bit of a return to form for Fox again as they brought back their Restless compositional style that throws in everything but the kitchen sink stylistically and instrumentally this song features elements of piano rock and glam rock and symphonic instrumentation a touch of carnival music - at one point there's almost an old-school musical theatre quality to all of it which is kind of fitting considering the band is going back to the sound of an album titled take the kids off Broadway but the difference now between hanging and that older Fox urgent sound is that here in 2016 they are working with immaculate production the piano sound great the drums sound great the guitars sound great the symphonic instrumentation sounds awesome the one weak link in the chain though I would say is most likely the vocals sometimes they do get buried in all that instrumentation and in other occasions the apparent Mick Jagger or Lou Reed influences are a little too apparent like it's as if they took let it bleed Mick Jagger and threw him on to this record aside from that everything on this album is balanced and mixed incredibly well and sure while in a way it does kind of take away from that rough-around-the-edges lo-fi quirk from the band's early years the rich and wonderful and inspiring instrumental passages on hang are a good exchange and it feels like foxes and songwriting has matured a little bit on this record - while there is a lot of complexity and density to this album the compositions on here are always looking for another direction to shift in those shifts those progressions feel a little more fluid a little more logical not quite so random considering how much just happens on every single one of these songs even the shortest tracks on here no wonder that this record is just like 33 minutes long it must have taken an incredible amount of effort just to compose a third of this album and record it so it sounds just right especially since it sounds like the duo went through the trouble of making this record sound as old-school as possible I'm not saying that the nostalgia is going to bash you over the head like a bat wrapped in barbed wire but you know there's certainly a bit of a vintage feel to the sound of this instrumentation you know it does feel like Fox agem gives us a lot in a short amount of time I still do wish it was a little longer a little longer might be greedy of me but I wish it was a little longer on the whole with this record there's a lot to celebrate a lot of good things going on and especially a lot of improvements from and star power but if there is one glaring flaw about this record or something that I think is going to rub some people the wrong way is that the band plays it really really small see on some of these tracks they turn the camp up to 11 could be the theater vibe going on in these songs could be the symphonic instrumentation I'm not completely sure what's feeling it but it's there and it makes some songs like Avalon a little much especially as the band suddenly transitions into this show tune jazz and connect with the track but I can't deny that the unbridled fun that Jonathan and Sam are having recording this album didn't sort of wear on me a little bit and warm my black cold music critic heart even when it comes to some of the corniest moments on this album and you know I would be omitting an important fact if I didn't say that it's very apparent that Sam and Jonathan are self-aware about the sound that they're creating here they know how this type of music is going to sound to an audience in 2016 so as a result they decide to just go full throttle and totally off-the-wall I love the intro track on this album follow-the-leader the very sexy smooth bass lines and keyboards on the verse are great the hot bright horn intro of the song is fantastic too and the way the strings fly in and soar over the verse is some incredible inspiration the background the Motown flavor background vocals are great the band tributes this old of rock pop and soul with some serious class although this is one of the moments on the album where I think the vocals kind of compete with the instrumental a little too much the song on Lankershim is one of the shorter tracks in the track listing but still packs a punch the vocal harmonies and the driving groove on this track and the first half kind of has a Fleetwood Mac kind of vibe there's also a country flavoured pedal steel hanging in the background it's very beautiful but then the track ends with the kind of horn back pop rock that a Bruce Springsteen fan could appreciate peppered with these catchy refrains of who walk away walk away the even shorter upon a hill is just full musical theater with a classic Broadway finish with these ascending chord progressions and like this tight horn arrangement this almost feels confessional like a monologue from a character in the middle of a story arc and the song rise up is an immense and a proper closing track sounds like a goodbye feels like a goodbye the lyrics and the saying turn super sentimental making references to the 1960s children's book where the Red Fern Grows the lyrics also hit the listener with all these weird cluttered cliches of singing for love and everybody wanted to change the world there are also some blisteringly loud guitars over the instrumental finish of this track it's like the band is trying to subvert their own end it's like they're trying to sour the mood of their exit stage left the one track that really didn't leave that much of an impression on me has to be the song trauma easily the most under written track on the entire album as it just kind of rehashes this one idea this one groove and propels it ascends it toward a very noisy chaotic finish it's all right but not as intricately written or composed as many of the other tracks here and with the album being so short a moment like trauma doesn't seem so necessary seems like the band should be hitting us with all killer and very little in the way of filler still though lot of great tracks on this album great compositions great instrumentation very ambitious songs lot of detail a lot of complexity and a lot of fun and a lot of personality to sure it does get buried a little bit in oxygens influences a little bit or the heavy dense instrumentation and I do wish the album was a little longer and maybe a smidge more conceptual to kind of tie all these tracks together because while they all do reek of the camp that foxes in has doused this album in they do still kind of feel like a bit of a mixed bag overall very good effort from foxes and feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which would I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry foxes in hang all sorts of other videos and the channel

dPd6iYPtwCA,hi everyone grimes inning time tan oh here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wiley album godfather this is the latest album from UK grime legend wiley one of the genres longest-running acts in the UK hard-working prolific and a major player in the grime scene so far this decade has been an interesting one for Wiley he kicked it off with his 2011 album 100% publishing where he not only wrote the entire album produced it and mastered it as well and then he spent his next few records trying to infuse like some pop appeal in his music to I guess kind of create some commercial crossover success I think he came the closest to sort of balancing that hard grind sound with a bit more of a commercial appeal on his snakes and ladders album but for me Godfather is the most exciting thing he's done in this decade so far because this is just so pure unadulterated  grime it's just banger after banger after banger with little to no compromises and not to say that this album is going to be exciting to everyone grime is a very particular genre of music it's instrumental style is greatly influenced by genres of electronic music that are huge in the UK as well as dance hall to the BPMS are a little faster than I think most Americans are used to the groove patterns are much different than a lot of music Americans are used to especially when it comes to styles of music where you have artists rapping over these instrumentals the lyrics on these grime albums are loaded with slang that you're either going to have to look up or read into or just try to guess the meaning of because you're probably not from where Wiley is from and the rap flows especially in the case of why we are super nutty just punctuated heavily with hard consonants and vowels and the flow style which is relentless a lot of the time when it comes to a wily track come off almost robotic in comparison would be smoother or more laid-back or maybe even animalistic rap styles that you might catch in America and Wiley is not some genius storyteller or anything like that he's not I spin in narrative yarns over here on these tracks he's not this conscious rap prophet either a lot of his lyrics typically give off this very bratty self-promotional aggressive tone so you know don't go into this album unless you're ready to hear some serious British attitude now once you've got a grip of exactly what grime is and what Wiley typically does on a Wiley album it's pretty easy to see just how hard knows how pureblood of a record this is just how consistent and hard-hitting it is nearly every track and the track listing here come through with banging bass energizing grooves the song Holi grime comes through with these heavy buzzing bass notes epic choral vocals and like some chimes - the song speaker box is not nearly as straightforward but just as visceral with its stuttering high hats and sort of off-kilter grooves song back with a banger has a bit of a two-step vibe to the beat some very tight since sequences that are almost dizzying and the beef for the song Joe Bloggs almost has like a bit of a trap thing going on it's sort of cool to kind of see that cyclical influence going on here with the minor chord progression and the heavy kick drums and the rattling high hats of course they're only a couple tracks from the track listing that I would say go kind of easy on the listener for one the song laptop which swaps out some of its heavy bass for some weird bleeps and bloops and it's actually kind of fitting because lyrically the song is a bit of a tribute to the laptop that why we use is to create his music he raps about this thing as if it is a tool that he uses for his craft which it is but it's kind of funny just how promotional and tone the song almost gets at some points we're just like MacBook Pro forever I got a MacBook Pro for a while I've been a MacBook Pro and the song you were always part to which is a bit of a cliched on the on the rocks love song which God shows some of the lyrics from this from the song it is so cringy the lyrics on this track are so awful in that they are incredibly plain you know there's a point at the beginning of the track where Wiley is like oh it's so easy to rap about this because it's true but the thing is like despite the fact that it might be a true situation you bring out absolutely no specific details about any of it to the point where it just really could have been anybody's experience and it's kind of hard for the listener the reader whoever to kind of appreciate what's going on or see any I don't know anything to really relate in it because it's just such a run-of-the-mill story the one specific in this story that stuck out to him was the moment when while he talks about having a fight with his girl and mandos which had me have horriffic flashbacks to the time when Drake was fighting with his girl at Cheesecake however though I guess I can give a slight nod to this track for being one of the more conceptual tracks and a sea of just non conceptual tracks with maybe the exception of the song Joe Bloggs which sort of takes us back to this point in grime history where grime is young Wiley is young he's going out to raves there's certain elements of fashion and music about the culture that he kind brings up in a really interesting way and that's actually kind of a recurring theme throughout many tracks on this album Wiley and grime are at a point where on this record he kind of gives us a bit of a grime history lesson making all these nods to other seminal artists in the genre certain points in the genres growth and history specifically moments that involved him other complaints with this record maybe a few songs on the back end like the song face feel a little muddy or just mixed a little weird with the vocals overpowering the instrumental ever so slightly and every version of the album that I have heard thus far features mistake in the tracklist the song birds and bars flows right into what is supposed to be the first half of the second track bring them all but instead we kind of get silence and then it continues and is six minutes long instead of just being that one half of a track that we're supposed to get bring them all it's supposed to fade into holy grime because the next track is titled bring them all / holy grind though that's really more of a technical complaint than it is a complaint about how the album sounds I mean if you're not paying attention you would just think you're kind of listening to another track but it doesn't skip over to the next track that's all a lot of the hooks on this record - are very solidly written from moments like lucid where Wiley is legitimately singing and comes through with a solid sticky hook - moments like Bang where we have guests sort of bringing through these nutty sort of very aggressive shadows at the top of his lungs flows where you just kind of interrupts with that very violent very crazy very off-the-wall one other glaring issue I have with this record is just that it seems to be that there are different lyrical standards in the UK versus the US and again that's not to say that we're like all lyrical miracles over here because obviously there's tons of trash rappers from America but there are a lot of moments on this record where I think Wiley comes through with these really basic rhymes with absolutely no word play or deeper meaning whatsoever and maybe that has a lot to do with the fact that he's rapping so fast on these tracks it's really more about the sound of his voice it's really more about the vibe of the tune than it is you know a need and urgent need to like rewind the track to be like whoo did you really say that  but like with a rapper that people take super seriously over here you're not going to get a bar like like if an emcee breaks down I told them like a car which kind of just made me imagine like Wiley's head on the top of like some Thomas the Tank Engine style tow truck as he just like drives rappers away or used to blaze weed eat food get the giggles see me in a sweet shop looking for the skittles like an emcee who's trying to sound hard and sound super serious like we would not say these things but having said all of that Wiley's real powers found mostly in the fact that man sounds sick on a rythm bro not only that but a lot of his lyrics are incredibly personal real and they kind of give you a full portrait of the man who he is I do love this album I think it's one of Wylie's best I think this album makes for an exciting moment in grime and I think in a way it could be a good introduction to the genre in general because not only does it just have the trademark sound of the genre I think Wiley brings so many exciting tracks in this sound I think you bring so many different varied styles in this sound and if you dig deep into the lyrics she kind of get a bit of a grime history lesson because all these points that he's referencing all these artists that he's referencing you could easily go back and look them up and learn more about the genre here more records that are of interest I'm feeling a life decent 8 on this record tritscher transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave it Angry comment if you're angry this Wiley album thought it was great there are some albums videos next to this video next to my head but I think you should check on if you're into this album my brain isn't working right now that's why I can't talk so Wiley Wiley Wiley please check out this album forever subscribe to the channel goddamn 
NSYTd1OEacM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here you know who it is and this is our weekly track roundup where I give you the best and the worst tracks of the week as well as some of the songs I was just kind of indifferent toward cool cool before I get into this let me say that down there in the description box is our amazon associates link anything you buy on amazon if you live in the US after you click on that link we get kick back from it does not add to your overall price if even if you're going to reuse it you need to click on the link again I feel like I need to say that because there's probably somebody out there who is confused by what I just said but I digress a couple more things I want to mention new live track from the upcoming sleater-kinney album what's mine is yours that is linked in the description box check that out also a trailer from a new movie that flying lotus has his hands all in which looks absolutely insane that is linked in the description box please check that out and finally an L an ACLU benefit album released around the inauguration of Donald Trump actually features some pretty great artists and while I'm not very happy about the need to release this compilation I'm glad that we have it and I feel like institutions like the ACLU are going to be very important moving forward in the next four years so you know why not hear some good music and support them in the process all right let's get into the best horse tracks of the week but this is the okay let's rip off that band-aid get through the worst tracks of the week first Big Sean this new track half way off the balcony Big Sean this sounded like a poem and Drake please put a clip up in front of my face is how terrible the lyrics are on this track God are they bad and Big Sean sounds as awkward as ever he had a few songs that came out around like that point where Kid Cudi and Kanye were beefing that sounded really good and I sort of had my health operably well he was I finally getting his shit together and it seemed like since then he's just totally fallen off again so I don't know not not expecting much from this new Big Sean record next on my worst tracks for the week list is this new Connor over song napalm to me what comes down to with this track despite the fact that I loved Connors last album brass strip backhand folky and well written it was is he sounds completely awkward over this funky what does a keyboard organ Rock instrumental he just sounds so out of place does not say his character or his style whatsoever so I just don't know why it's there moving on from that angel Olsen with a song fly on the wall one of the songs added to this 100 songs for 100 days anti-trump compilation and this song isn't even vaguely pancit like political or anti Trump or anything I mean maybe these songs will be going to our charity and if they are that's good I hope that that's the case because so far was dropped in these 100 songs is not doing much for the culture in my opinion it sounds like one of the worst tracks from her last album like not my woman the one previous to that really drab just draws on and on and on not really a significant conclusion to the track either just was really kind of let down by the song unfortunately moving on from there we have this new song from Tim Heidecker which seems to be in response to that white supremacist Mimar Richard Spencer getting punched in the face which I laugh at because I think it's funny but I do not openly advocate using violence against people who use violence historically to push their political agenda because that really makes me no better than them but moving on from there and that's sort of what I feel like the song in the way kind of excuses also it's just terribly recorded bad lyrics badly sung sounds like a terrible Randy Newman song the piano playing is pretty weak but I feel like I kind of continue to give 10 high deckers music a bit of a silent pass because I don't know if it's being like ironically bad I can only hope that that's the case moving on from there it's from first to last Skrillex bring this his old band back from from the dead from back from death excuse me I'm a little flustered right now whenever I think of Skrillex I get like that and this track is like such a throwback to all the reasons why west coast scenester screamo and emo like died and it just needed to stay back there and it this is just a reminder of why that era of music is kind of dead and gone and yeah so so at least we have that reminder and then I will finish it off by saying the worst track that week in my opinion was easily this Mike Tyson song if you show up which is Mike Tyson inserting himself in the midst of this like 50 cent Soulja Boy Chris Brown beef thing with some really awkward flows awkward lyrics but goddamn the music video on this thing the music video probably the best thing to come out of this whole thing although I will say the track is is hilariously bad at least in a sense it is entertaining moving on from there let's get into the met tracks we have me goes with the song what the price a very sad song from the me goes about something every every dealers for a Lorde about having to raise prices or pay higher prices although was sort of my disappointing with this track is that it sound like a Travis Scott song just sounds like a leftover Travis Scott song sounds like they're ripping off Travis Scott just sounds like a Travis Scott left over from birds in the trap or something not really sure what the point of doing that is but uh just kind of lackluster song for me goes that just sounds like somebody else from there it's king gizzard and the lizard wizard with the song asleep drifter not a bad track if you're into experimental psychedelic garage rock just not one of the best singles from the new album not a song I'm crazy about but I'm sure it may sound good sound better in the context of this new record we have this rapper named cuz with the song pots and pans I'm sure you know what that songs about featuring killer Mike I've run the jewels and killer Mike Fame because he's just fuckin awesome on his own and this track awesome beat awesome killer Mike feature although I will say that I don't think cuz really came through and like left that much of an impression on me with his lyrics and delivery although you know I will look out for another cuz track because I mean the track is certainly well put together and you know I'll just leave it at that and you may see this guy live because I hear he's opening up for run the jewels with some tour dates moving on from there Kimber Tambor with sewer blues did not want to put this track in the mess section but unfortunately I have to because kind of the throbbing drab flat instrumental here is just completely lacking the finesse and the whimsy and the eeriness that I typically enjoy hearing from timbre camber sure the trademark deep kind of nostalgic who booze and vocals are still there and they still sound pretty good but this is not an interesting song from timbre tambour in my opinion really kind of lackluster track and hopefully the deeper cuts on this forthcoming record are a little more electrifying and emotionally enthralling too because I really wasn't kind of getting that that feeling of horror sadness or sorrow that I typically get from timber timber wasn't really registering anything emotionally on this track it just felt like very despondent and cold kind of like a cold fish of a song I guess in my opinion moving on from there Arcade Fire dropped a new track this week featuring Mavis Staples and reaction to the Trump inauguration and here are my thoughts on that but bamboo Arcade Fire song featuring the legend Mavis Staples and actually not that bad of a track apparently all the proceeds to this track go to the ACLU obviously for a good cause and obviously this track is in response to the election of Donald Trump doesn't really take too much reading into it to get that and while there are a lot of things that I like about this track it sort of has a grime enos to the production I especially like how dirty kind of the drum machines feel on this track the very heavy fat monstrous bass line is awesome I love the lumbering groove of this song and the way that made the staples is incorporated into the track is actually really good actually fits pretty snugly into the sound of this song I guess my one problem with the track is that it's so goddamn repetitive it's just kind of the same refrain being hashed out and hashed out again and again again although the band and Mavis do approach it in different ways with different levels of intensity it's a decent track it's just a tad under written and instrumentally just kind of sounds like a leftover from the band's last album but you know I guess hopefully Arcade Fire comes through the record this year and this song in a way is is teasing toward that even if it is just kind of meant to react to this one political moment in in the now gorillas also dropped a new track this week new single first single in like six years or so from what I've seen and it featured none other than benjamin clementine on the song and hear my thoughts on that i don't really know what to think of that single I love it when gorillas challenge themselves by bringing in new artists fresh blood people who are up and coming people are doing something interesting and Benjamin Clementine ticks all those boxes but I'm not really sure whether or not his whimsical and very dramatic singing style which I do like on his own albums is complimented all that well by gorillas very quirky electronic production on this particular track I do like the tune at the core of this song I think the choral vocals in the background are really uplifting and triumphant and beautiful and awesome I'm just kind of questioning whether or not the marriage of these two worlds came together all that well most likely not going to go down as one of gorillas that singles but I guess a reason to be excited for the forthcoming album rapper John Wayne has a new single out titled out of sight this track was okay wasn't that crazy about I've never been a big John Wayne fan although I am going to give his new record the old college try but sort of the uneventful delivery and flows on this track and just kind of how subdued and you know very monotone sort of the whole song feels in a way is part of what has turned me off about his music in the past hopefully I end up getting a little bit more out of it in the future and finally I will close this section of the video with the new types of all track breaking guitar certainly seems like a well-put-together track for ty though it's more of a run of the mill you know instance of psych and garage rock worship more than it is inventive or you know sort of challenging or experimental or adventurous like many of the cuts off his last record but ty Segall he's all over the map you know you can't define him by one record you can't sort of say oh yeah I'm not a fan of him anymore because he's always got something new under his sleeve he's always got a different project coming out he's so prolific so this may be one of those projects if all the songs kind of follow suit with this track this may be a song that or I guess an album rather then maybe I kind of sit out or I'm just like and it's not for me I'll wait for one of his more clear and punchy or adventurous records I guess but yeah this one was all right let's move on to what were my favorite tracks of the week quite a few quite a few we have your old room New York rapper with that raspy smooth flow once again great instrumental lots of wordplay in the bars and this track GK AC has me psyched for his new album moving on from their spoon the new single from their upcoming record hot thoughts this track has loads and loads of sexy visceral dance grooves all over and a kind of sour dark corporation that I thought was really good too moving on from there J Cole hi for hours but best Jay Cole song in a long time what a J called best songs Pyramid J Cole what you did on this song you closed those lyrical gaps who actually came through with some thoughtful commentary on the world at large especially with how people deal with oppression as well as revolution and just I guess kind of the challenges that people face as a result of an unfair system this is the Jay Cole I want to see more of even though instrumentally and sonically the song was still kind of subdued still is probably going to put a lot of people to sleep but I think this is one of his more thoughtful tracks and hopefully in the future he continues to drop songs of this lyrical quality no you know bars about farting or anything on this song is just a good quality thoughtful hip-hop song from Jay Cole and I just hope to hear more of these in the future because I do think there is potential there it drives me nuts when he falls short of it Aimee Mann has a new song out which is a beautiful ballad with lavish instrumentation hanging in the background very I want to say heartening very heartening tune powertrip this crossover thrash band has a new record coming out via Southern Lord Records very soon awesome riffs awesome energy and I mean obviously the lyrics on this thing are really grim and really dark and violent but I find the title of this track executioners tax swing of the axe hilarious yes you taka Nakata of Kyary Pamyu Pamyu fame has come through and I guess is with a new single and is stepping out past the curtain behind the scenes putting his face on the cover of this new single and has orchestrated the song with Charli XCX Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and it's this fun colorful eccentric bouncy bubbling little pop tune with lots of lots of kaleidoscopic intricacies worked into the production a lot of j-pop appeal to the songwriting and Charli XCX even though I may find her vocal little obnoxious on this song it is still a decent track and I don't know actually I think one of the better pop singles I've heard so far this year might end up on my my year-end list so I'm moving on from there we have United Nations with the song stairway to mar-a-lago another one of the better songs that are in reaction to the Trump inauguration this has a bit of a post rock post hardcore vibe to it it ascends beautifully it's got a heavy climax it's super intense never lets go that momentum not for a second it just plows and plows and plows and gets aah it's more and more intense as it goes along I love the chord progression of this track too it just reminds me of like some of the awesome you know post hardcore and post rock fusions of the 2000s Hort of like envy or something like that you know if you're big Envy fan I think I'll probably get into this track moving on from there Kirk Knight with the song set up featuring ASAP ferg banger but banger awesome instrumental on this thing ASAP ferg kills it can't wait for him to actually drop a good album once again and Kirk Knight actually comes through with like one of his better tracks hopefully he delivers some more distinct and memorable cuts on his forthcoming album rather than kind of drowning in his influences a little bit which I think he did on his last Joey badass was land of the free another one of the better anti-trump songs that dropped around the inauguration some very thoughtful political critique on this track also iron Reagan these guys are another crossover thrash band they have a new album coming out very soon and this track is a part of the new flexi disc that they have released that is also in response to the whole Trump inauguration thing and of course you know it's a very grim apocalyptic dark in-your-face energetic crossover thrash you know those risks are awesome that punk energy is there which is why I can't wait to hear the new record because I feel like it's done so well we need some more good crossover thrash in 2017 and finally I will end it off with Dirty Projectors the song up in Hudson awesome little ballad here very subdued but beautiful and a track that sort of maintains those original qualities of the Dirty Projectors that I like so much while pushing it a little bit toward that alternative R&B sound that David long strength is obviously going for it doesn't seem like he's compromising so far that I don't even know why I'm listening to the group at this point it still sounds like I'm listening to a Dirty Projectors song but sort of a newer braver Dirty Projectors updated for 2016 that sort of sounds like the freshness and the familiarity the mix of those two that I really want from this record but who knows you know maybe those cuts those singles that I will dislike from the album thus far maybe they'll grow on me I don't know we'll see but this is a decent track in that upcoming record in my opinion do give it a shot and those are my best and worst tracks of the week guys all of them are linked down there in the description along with that Amazon Associates link along with those other

s_uW6a9xwmo,hi everyone ban theny ban tan oh here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new yucky duster EP dusters lament yucky duster brooklyn band new EP their first release for infinity cat records if you're familiar at all with the label and you love your indie rock you love your lo-fi garage rock then you should sort of have a vague idea as to what to expect from this new EP here this thing is just five tracks and those songs are basically some quirky fun indie pop and rock with some solid songwriting some angular guitar leads that kind of stick out very sharply and some pretty sweet vocal harmonies - it's a little punk it's a little twee it's kind of rough around the edges it's got this admirable amateurish Ness to it but it still seems like there's quite a bit of effort put into the songwriting it's tuneful it's fun and in that amateurish attitude there is earnestness sincerity and the musical vibe the emotional vibe of this EP is a little bittersweet while it does seem like the little tiny cute indie rock tunes going on here are shy but also a little friendly but the musical vibe the emotional vibe of this EP is somewhat bittersweet because while these cute little indie rock tunes may come off as as pretty friendly the lyrics speak on some dark sad topics sadness depression life's ups but mostly downs certainly the case on the title track the opening track to this thing or we get this refrain about not wanting to get you down this person is just having a bad year maybe just in reference to how turbulent 2016 was for a lot of people however this song is just kind of a very short intro more of a motif I wish it kind of progressed further and then we move on to the track thaw which is probably my least favorite full-length song on the entire EP I think the instrumental is okay but the the songwriting itself is about as directionless as the topic of the song which is just kind of I don't know about spending the day with somebody kind of an income sequential day I guess and some of the lyrics detail their activities together one of which is talking about gentrification Brooklynites talking about gentrification that's rich although I do love the following track the ropes a track that I read to be about rolling with life's punches and finding comfort in what you know or in what's familiar to you the track features these strange ascending and descending vocal melodies that grab my ear and what makes the vocal melody pop even further is the guy singing this tune sort of delivers it in this very tense way sort of like he's on the verge of either an emotional breakdown or his voice is coming like this close to cracking in this contrast really well with the song slick guitar leads and very sweet female background vocal harmonies adds this interesting contrast the song different people is a sweet enough tune where our protagonists is kind of stuck in this box of sadness where they see the outside world as being happy or happier than them and this sadness or this difference in mood sort of seems to be separating this person from other people the world but elementary school dropout the closing track on this EP my favorite track on the EP to me really the heart of the EP in a way kind of a mission statement for the band in general on this track the band truly shines and if there's one side of the CP I would love to hear more of it's this side this track is this really funny tongue-in-cheek but also very sad and honest underachiever anthem with these emotionally flat but melodically sticky vocal melodies delivering lyrics about love about life and kind of using school specifically elementary school is kind of a metaphor to sort of paint this portrait of our unheroic heroine being the bad girl in the corner because she can never get to school on time and her brain is fried and this person who she has on her mind is the only person who's ever gotten her in line or gotten her to sort of focus of yada-yada-yada you know what I'm saying while I wish this thing was longer there are some good tracks on the CP and I guess it has me looking forward to lucky dusters future especially if there more tracks like different people like the ropes and especially like elementary school dropout in the in the future it's good to hear a band do indie rock some justice do indie pop some justice with some personality with a sense of humor but also you know some serious self critique and introspection I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this EP tritscher etre transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry yucky duster duster those dusters lament all sorts of videos and links next to my head other you know other videos the subscribe to the channel you know forever 
m8rY_gfWOsI,doesn't in the Hat Han and Amir Internet's busiest music nerd don't need to wear be wearing a hat or anything and it's time for a review of the new code orange album forever this is the third full-length album from this Pittsburgh band their first though for Roadrunner Records a label switch that I was kind of skeptical of going into this album especially considering how snug of a fit Death Wish seemed to be for the band considering they're very aggressive blend of metalcore and hardcore punk Roadrunner on the other hand has always been sort of a true-blue modern metal label for me and it seems like code orange has kind of stepped up to the plate in terms of delivering and uncompromising ly heavy album certainly their most metal effort to date I guess now this thing is one of the most brain battering and invigorating metalcore records that I've heard in a while at least you know a metalcore record that nails didn't write breakdowns and all this record is actually very good it's fantastically visceral gargantuan in its size and its power and it's actually pretty diverse too there are moments on this thing where the band works in some a lot of guitar leads or some rhythm guitars into the background of these bone-crushing riffs or some electronic or industrially tinged percussion hanging in the background that make things really punchy and digital and occasionally we get some clean vocals from bassist Reba Meyers whose voice I have also enjoyed on adventures albums she actually kind of steals the show on this record on the song bleeding in the blur a sinister alt metal throwback that sticks out in the tracklisting like a sore thumb because it's not a metalcore song but still the menacingly loud guitars that encase many of the tracks on this album also turn up on this song so it does make it feel at least a little consistent the band also goes slightly alt metal on the course of the song ugly too but to go back to those guitars no matter where the band goes stylistically on this album those guitars are the common thread that weave this record together even when the band goes kind of darkwave on the song hurt goes on the first two thirds of this track sounds like it could have been on the last Korean album like really icy scents that are just throbbing really tensely and then all of a sudden we get this explosive heavy guitar foundation finish I've heard some people complain about how often this album veers away from that metalcore sound and in my opinion it doesn't do it that often at least not so often that it disrupts the flow of the album and even when the band does veer away from that in a bold way there is at least some note of heaviness somewhere to be found if anybody is going to have a hard time getting into this record I think it's people who are generally not metalcore fans and what I'd like to say to those people is that this is not just your average meat-and-potatoes metalcore album these songs are loaded with some really weird intriguing and experimental details as well as subtle references to other genres outside of the metalcore circle it's just kind of a matter of whether or not you're going to stick around and listen to the secrets that the band are kind of whispering through these experimental edits and sound effects amongst these roaring guitars and bombshell drum hits and not to say that the core sound of this album can't be appreciated it certainly can because for a metalcore album this thing is painfully dark it is apocalyptic it's not just this dick hardening show of machismo except for maybe that one part on the song and real proceed to the breakdown yeah it sounds pretty funny when I put it like that and I don't mean to write off this breakdown or any breakdown on this album or the art of the breakdown in general for sure the breakdown had been overdone and over simplified to the point in the 2000s where I just wanted to banish it to hell a code oranges approach to the breakdown is so invigorating and visceral that I'm actually excited to hear these sounds again on a new album these sluggish heavy staccato risks especially on tracks like the mud whose final moments are some of the most hellish on the entire album and the song structures on this record are kind of odd - you know this isn't just a your normal verse chorus verse affair over here a lot of these songs are these twisted labyrinths of explosion and viscera and heavy breakdown or gasma I'm just making up shit to kind of get my point across here even though these songs are a little difficult to pin down structure wise each of them remain powerful and exciting from start to finish and potent to as this album just stands at over 30 minutes the band doesn't really give themselves a whole lot of room to insert filler here or there although I will say that I thought the song dream 2 was kind of an unnecessary epilogue to the entire record as the track herte goes on already sounded and felt like a pretty fitting closer dream to felt like just the semi interesting motif it was cool to hear Reba Meyers vocals on the lead again on the record but maybe it would have worked best as an interlude at some point on the album especially with so many heavy tracks going back to back to back and if I am being honest the song no one is untouchable it doesn't really bring anything that a lot of the previous tracks didn't already except for another invigorating performance especially on the vocal side and the vocals generally on this album across the whole record are so animalistic and so incredibly guttural and in-your-face and energizing and enraged this is hands-down without question code orange is best album yet while I did love the heaviness of their last record I feel like they were still yet to fully come into their own and I think that they have done it or at least they are their closest to doing that on this record over here sure maybe they couldn't settle entirely on one single sound for the entire album here but at least the moments where they veer outside of that metalcore comfort zone they're bringing elements of that sound with them and the way the band experiments with this traditionally basic genre on this record gives me hope for the future of metalcore because all over this thing they take some real risks and fuse the genre with some really interesting and unlikely influences and without compromising its uncompromising sound this thing is a killer album blood-pumping album deadly album kind album that rips your head off in your heart out could have stuck the landing a little bit better at the end but I'm loving this record definitely going to be one of my favorite loud rock records of the year I think I'm feeling the light decent eight on this thing church or church Fortran music real prescription drug use oak description that could easily be Ximena sad only all began trash all these things put on scription he's different - they all fucking - all these bitches tell me what for the position these Democrats - if all trash all his vision these Democrat trash they all in - how is tell me what what a prescription and use it against separation why what's wrong with it it's just fucking drugs in Kansa Alec on the same fuckin safety regulations mean what are you a retard like you're actively moving against the affordability of Medicine pieces delicious dipshit we very interested in food even Ted Cruz the fucking Zodiac killer voted YES on this shit 
7jxJ-R8w5ro,and here we are proud of an Iraq and here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of this new Flaming Lips album oxy Lobby legendary neo psych outfit The Flaming Lips are back with a new focused conceptual commercial album you know not some weird one-off project or an album where they ruin Pink Floyd songs or an album where they collaborate with every musician on the planet this thing is twelve tracks and 58 minutes of the band I guess with the exception of one track that features Miley Cyrus at the very end of the album and sonically it seems like the lips are kind of taking off from where they left off on the last full-length album the terror which was very much a spacey vast atmospheric and almost formless experience but what this album lacked in structure in meaty groovy beats and instrumentation it made up for in texture and some really strong dark moods and now it seems like the band is continuing this trippy and semi ambient aesthetic for another record and even though there's nothing on paper wrong with the band continuing this trippy and semi ambient aesthetic for another record I think with this project they end up with less results this time the songwriting doesn't really seem any more decisive than it was on the terror and when it does seem like the band is trying to write a track with the clear structure - or maybe a slight pop appeal to it the track we are our family case in point the song comes off almost silly as this cut sort of feels like a bit of a leftover headache from that last Miley Cyrus record that The Flaming Lips collaborated with her on a lot of the lyrics come off pretty subpar on this thing even by the band's absurdist standards the vocal and lead melodies are kind of redundant and the electronic sequence - everything on nearly every cut here leaves the album feeling really stiff and stagnant or even out of whack like on the song the castle where the hard trunk knockin kick drums don't even sound like they're apart of the same song that's just kind of quietly humming away in the background in a sea of reverb as it seems like everything but the kick drum is so soaked in reverb that the body of the sound is just sucked out of it and it's just kind of this Airy tinny ethereal trebly piece of tone that doesn't really have much body to it and while there's nothing in theory wrong with adding more synthetic percussion to an album adding more sequence percussion to your music if you are in fact a rock band The Flaming Lips don't really add enough subtleties to these beats to keep things interesting they're kind of happy to just copy and paste ideas until they just get tired sort of like the intro title track to this entire album which really wears its welcome before it's very short two minutes and 50 seconds even up a lot like with the Radiohead's King of Limbs this album doesn't so much feel like a band effort as much as it's almost like the the group's frontman splitting off from the band and creating some kind of solo electronic project on his desktop and then coming back and then just saying it's a band album now there are exceptions to this moments where it does seem like there is a significant amount of instrumentation added into the mix outside of those more synthetic elements moments where some string sections pop up and really elevate the mix and and give the music this eerie beauty like listening to the frogs with demon eyes or galaxies I sync two of my favorite tracks in the track listing here I also like the very meaty and kind of fuzzy distorted and funky bass and drum jam at the second half of mig dina it was a nice change of pace from yet another beat driven dreamy wave of tones the very cerebral and linear grooves on one night hunting for fairies and witches I believe that's titled the track the beats on this cut how they're kind of primal and weird almost reminds me of the last knife record oddly enough there are some highlights here and there on this record and overall I think this album has a cool aesthetic to it but on a bulk of the other tracks it seems like the band's usual quirk and in vivid sound play just gets washed out by this reverb heavy mix I appreciate the band trying to stick to the sound and really see it through but in my opinion they've kind of exhausted everything that they could possibly do with this they didn't really add anything to the sound other than some goofy Basie beats that could have easily been assembled in GarageBand it's kind of cool that they were able to make a lot of these tracks segue into one another though without a doubt this album is a kind of holistic experience you know it's not a mixed bag it's it's very much got a single uniform idea and the band executes sit for one song after another not a single track really stuck out to me as a sore thumb like it didn't really fit in to the track listing but most of the material here is plagued with textbook reverb abuse and some of the band's weakest writing to date I'm not really sure what to say about this record outside of that it just seems like there was a lot of potential kind of lost in this album unfortunately the lead singles were some of the worst that I've heard on a Flaming Lips album ever the band wanted to toy with more electronics and sequence beats and synthesizers but didn't really put in the effort to keep these electronic compositions enthralling and intriguing and a lot of the album just came off as drab to me unfortunately feeling a light to decent five on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment if you're angry this Flaming Lips album hope you enjoyed it a little more than me all sorts of other links next to my head other reviews you can check out subscribe to the channel official website too and you're the best forever 
j2ngzOddzew,hi everyone exa neeext an out here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new XX album i see you this is the third full-length album from this london indie pop band easily one of the biggest acts to come out of the UK in the tail end of the 2000s in 2009 they had originally broke out with this very minimal stylish sound on an album that i had a difficult time kind of seeing the merit in this record in my opinion was just too straight back to bare bones to be anything but drab which is kind of a vibe that the vocals on the record only added to as they were just relentlessly breathy and moody forcing this awkward sadness and sensuality onto the listener that I just could not vibe with and sadly history has kind of repeated itself on this latest record over here as row me and Oliver singing on this album is still not a selling point for me their chemistry is about as exciting as an ice cube melting especially on the song say something loving however I will say that this is the most musically engaging album that the XX has put together to date or at least the most instrumentally detailed album ICU does not go down the same minimal road that the xx's debut album did nor is it as blissful and is atmospheric as their sophomore full-length LP coexist I wouldn't call ICU exciting or exuberant but there are some legitimately lively and danceable beats that seep their way into the tracklist here maybe crossing over from Jamie xx is surprisingly good debut full-length LP in colour that dropped back in 2015 case in point the song on hold featuring these awesome hall & oates samples and very rigid funky rhythms and the song I dare you to attract that to me smells like the band's clearest attempt ever at writing a steady pop tune if not only for the fact that the chorus does absolutely nothing it seems like they're trying to do as little as possible on the hook the instrumentation just disappears and then you just get these boring whoa-whoa vocals which is kind of disappointing because up until that point the track been great there are even some surprising moments in the tracklisting here where it seems like the band is using some string sections to elevate the very skeletal beats and warm baselines and twangy echo drench guitars and the strange choral vocals on the song lips we're actually beautiful and a nice change of pace the song replicas even struck me as pretty with it's very icy synth chords and glamorous pianos I can easily say that this is also the band's most diverse album so far - and most dramatic - as their tracks like brave for you for example that feature some pretty climactic instrumental builds a shame that this track and several others on here feature very abrupt endings that leave the track feeling kind of fizzled out so in one breath while the XX are bringing more vibrant and punch your ideas to the table on these songs they're also kind of failing to seal the deal during a couple of pivotal moments unfortunately one other thing I would like to know about these tracks is that it seems like there are moments where the band are stretching outside of their comfort zone lyrically not just singing about love and desire and lust and heartbreak but also anxiety a little bit or at least references to that as well as the challenge of being yourself and just having emotional strength these themes come through on songs like replicas and performance and brave for you all of which added up to another nice change of pace for the band in my opinion overall I like this album I think it's the xx's best album to date but I don't really love the record so what is that really saying and from the look of the reception of this album thus far it doesn't seem like fans are putting this above the band's debut so my perspective on this record is most likely not going to be in line with that of a lot of people who have written with the XX up until this point and have loved much of what they've done still I think the band has matured a little bit on this record they have made some advancements they have made some improvements they have taken some risks and they have filled out their songs a little bit instrumentally lyrically compositionally more at least than they have been in the past it seems like they're doing a better job of balancing style with substance unfortunately though a lot of my same issues compositionally and vocally from the past records do kind of carry over onto this album too not so much that the experience is completely devoid of enjoyment as you know albums of theirs in the past have been for me but you know certainly enough to keep it from being one of my favorites of this year still though I'm feeling a light too decent six on the cell P Tran -

2cx5XI8cjiA,ooh hi everyone's plans in a jam pan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new little Sims album stillness in Wonderland little Sims is a UK rapper and songwriter this is her latest full-length LP she has a few projects under her belt at this point she had a couple great tracks off her last full-length album which made me curious about this upcoming one thought she would come through with something big conceptual and interesting on this one and in a way she did now I'm not going to be taking on this record solo I'm actually going to be talking about this album with a fellow YouTube album reviewer mr. tabby you can check out his youtube channel down in the description we're gonna hash it out over this record right after the transition and here we are through the magic of the internet it's cabbie fellow YouTube music reviewer and we talked about this new little Sims record give me your general thoughts on this album please sweet so yeah I've never heard a little Sims before in my life so it's like to research he's a British rapper and so I got into the cell with like no expectations at all because I didn't know what to expect the album cover drew me in first because it's like really well Illustrated so it showed a concept to me already so I was kind of interested and then I got into it and I was confused the whole time I think and I listened to it again her journey is just a little weird to me I guess and it's hard to follow sometimes when she is in Wonderland which is kind of the main theme of the album that she goes to Wonderland to escape her problems is what she developed and it's just hard to tell when she's in it in which he's out of it and then there's these interludes that tell you when she's about to go in and when she's leaving and it's like I don't know it it's it's as indecisive as she is on the record to me like the flow of the story I feel that she doesn't know what she wants the whole time and because she doesn't know what she wants she goes to Wonderland still doesn't know what she wants and then leaves with the prerogative of not letting her people down with just how the album starts with that song let my people down and that kind of threw me off too because that sonically is completely different from the rest of the record because a lot of the record deals with a fusion of like trap and jazz kind of and still alive I mean that indecisiveness you were talking about I think runs also through the album from a musical standpoint - from a stylistic standpoint a little bit yeah exactly um but that's what I liked about the instrumentals at least because those were interesting how indecisive they were because it carried that theme I just think she personally didn't execute it as well as the instrumentals did if that makes sense um I don't know if I mean I I will agree to the extent that I enjoyed the instrumentals on the album more I mean then I get I enjoyed her vocal performances especially from a singing standpoint tracks like let my people down were particularly rough as far as singing on the album I feel a little since her last record while it wasn't that it has it had its moments I feel like she impressed me a little more consistently on that album as far as her rapping but I feel like on this record over here she's kind of given into that pressure that I feel like a lot of rappers have on them right now to sort of be a jack-of-all-trades you need that songwriting you need to be writing lyrics you need to be rapping and you also need to know how to sing or you need to be singing - and I feel like she sort of dipped her toes into that water without being as skilled as singers maybe she should have been and there were also moments on here where I wasn't really all that impressed with some of her vocal guests but maybe the exception of Sid on the song shotgun I like to sit on shotgun quite a bit there was that one track I can't remember which one it was the dude on the track who was singing was singing this really redundant chorus about like how he wants to make this top 40 hit or this song you really love and he sort of sounded like this DJ the Chicago kid clone and that logged me as a West error one rotation or as yes yes that's exactly thank you for bringing um you know I'm sort of feeling the same indecisiveness that you were throughout the record but there is at least a whiff of a concept here yeah I mean I didn't quite see it as a story album as much as it was just kind of a general ode and and maybe this is because she doesn't sort of assemble it in kind of a logical flow type of way sort of saw the record as was general ode to becoming woke I guess in exact because I seem like there were those moments where she was like you were saying letting her people down sort of ignoring these issues that were sort of glaring her in the face and then as the album finishes she sort of has this I guess epiphany that she should be I don't know taking part in sort of saving the world or I guess putting more effort toward fixing what's wrong with the world how exactly she is going to go about doing that I'm not really sure and and that's what i think that the album isn't really a solution or like a silver bullet to any of the issues that sort of work it at her it was more of just like a this process of like actually starting to care you know actually starting to put the shards to the forefront of her mind as opposed to just kind of ignoring them and let them just go in the background unannounced and it's sort of addressing the elephant in the room I guess sure and that's that's why I grew to appreciate the first track because her and the feature chronics with the double X that they point out a lot of leaders of different movements in like history and and then her saying all these legends are looking at her to like make a difference so that that's why I grew to appreciate the first track more exactly for that point that she is getting woke and realized that she could be one of those people and yes I agree that this album is not like this is my solution to help it's just like maybe music is her way so this is like her album to say my music will eventually help I'm not sure yeah I mean yes there are moments where it seems like there's a little bit of illusions of grandeur as far as fixing things or maybe or no the pressure to fix things is like oh these legends want me to do this or it's my music that's going to do it you know which does kind of bug me a little bit but I mean overall I do like the idea of the concept of this album in general it's just that when I say we get deeper into the tracklisting and we get down to the nitty-gritty of the record and what's being said we do have and I don't know if you agree with me I'm not particularly familiar with your opinion on this artist but I feel like you'll understand where I'm coming from here there is like a bit of a Jay Cole effect going on where it's like you could tell he's you could tell little Simms is trying to get to the heart of these really important issues and she's certainly concerned and is aware but the lyrical content is just kind of weak like it's not like she's saying anything all that poignant when it comes to some of these issues or you have like one rotation or doorways I mean one in rotation both of which are kind of like these half-tracks where you sort of get this beat change up and it turns into an entirely different song at one point which it kind of loses the momentum a little bit in my opinion yeah it just feels like there's concern there and she's certainly aware of the world not being as great a place as it could be but there's just kind of a lack of lyrical content to create any urgency or just make you feel like well I'm like really wrapped up in this or you know she's really saying something significant about this stuff exactly no I actually had that exact same thought when I was listening about Jay Cole on the style and I think it's just because she's so to the point with her lyrics like they're pretty much just sentences there it's barely any wordplay there's barely any like you know things that make you have to go back and re listen to it because she's just saying to the point bars the whole time yeah so yeah I think I completely agree with that statement yes sir I mean the lyrics are little meat and potatoes which is why I'm you know a when I do get impressed by her it's usually her flow she can't rap pretty fast and she's like you know certainly on tempo and she you know got some really tight flows going for her I asked but then it's like when she works in her singing voice it does like kind of drop off for me a little bit not to say that there weren't tracks where lyrically or I guess as far as like her performance rapping that didn't impress me there definitely were tracks like picture-perfect I liked a lot track oh yeah three I thought was really great in the song King of Hearts that kind of posse cut that she had going where I feel like she really kind of stepped up her lyrical game a little bit because she had two other like really great lyricist on the track and those were songs from her first album that was like wow you know she's going to probably come out with something great around the corner you know but I feel like she sort of come through with this I don't know somewhat indecisive concept album that some of the tracks are just like really weak and underwhelming meanwhile there are other cuts where it seems like she's going hard sort of like bad to the bone but just struck me is like really corny unfortunately not only because it was just kind of a lack of interesting lyrics on the track but just the course of that song was really weak in my opinion I don't know I agree no I when you said picture perfect that's my favorite track of the album for sure like it's just in your face it's a banger like the only banger on this project I think to me but that's the track that made me like really it snagged my attention right away but it's you know it's the halfway point of the album so I was kind of disappointed that that was the track that got me going oh shit here you go but you know it's halfway in the album but and King of Hearts too like that's the that's the track that made me think this was a story album because it seemed like she was taking on she was taking over Wonderland like she got there and the Cheshire Cat was saying watch watch out you're going to like you're going to get into some bad shit and then she became like the leader the Queen of Hearts and said the king isn't going to rule any more I'm going to rule and I'm going to like smash off heads and I really like chips feature I think he fucking killed this track like when he when he got that that Henry the eighth bar at the end that shit was awesome and his flow was really good the whole time I thought Getz was kind of just though like I do thought some of the stuff he said was corny at the end like I thought sweet but I said corn or whatever he said and like his voice is a little jarring to me you know you if you're familiar with gets you kind of come to expect those kinds of are a little bit yeah I'm not really familiar with any British rapper so I that's just me not researching so it was really like the way he was rapping it just sounded like a car that wouldn't start tonight I was just like whoa where'd this guy come from and he was just saying these really weird things after the two really good verses that ship and sins had so I was just kind of thrown but I can definitely see why he has like a fandom why he's viewed as a good rapper because he's got like a very different sounds but yeah his feature was the one on this album I was just like uh what did I just hear as far as other highlights for me I mean like I said shotgun would Sid which is not one of the harder tracks on here you know more of a neo soul kind of vibe to that track a little more pretty as far as the instrumental goes a little jazzier the song poison ivy to which was I thought a pretty good like love song or at least kind of struck me a love song those are two tracks that that to me were like okay she's not going aggressive like some of my favorite tracks from her last record but these tracks are like good melodic rap tunes that could you know potentially cross over and that was sort of another point about the record for me I felt like there were so many moments here where she was trying to write a track where it was like this will appeal to people who wouldn't normally listen to my music you know and it seemed like in so many attempts at doing that we're left with so many tracks that are just like you know so so uninteresting at least to my ears it felt like this album was trying to do so much you know yeah unfortunately the best parts were the moments where that would have just been good moments from her last record in my opinion you know those moments were it felt like she was just playing to her strengths rather than trying to stretch herself in with the singing and the pop fusions and the concept you know maybe only if she had worked out a couple of those then we would have had maybe a stronger concept and stronger tracks throughout I don't know you know I feel like I'm just kind of making suggestions at this point the album that while it does kind of tie up the concept a little bit toward the end aside from poison ivy there's not like a whole lot on the the end of this record for me musically you know again the concept is certainly there she does kind of tie it up and at No More Wonderland you do kind of have that realization or but a you know aside from like a couple of verses on those more aggressive tracks a couple of those crossover cuts and the instrumentals on this thing and you know I'm not taking away from the beats the beats on this thing are lavish they're immaculate least the unfortunately a little sins is just not the one stealing the show a lot of the time it's usually the instrumentals that are a little more interesting than her and the interludes while you know some of them do add to the story you know there are others that just kind of sound like a total mess unfortunately you know so I wouldn't say the interludes were like you know all that necessary either for the most part as far as like making the album entertaining you know certainly they add to the concept but the concept itself could use some work so so yeah I mean this record I was really kind of torn on it really a mixed bag for me and it seems like you kind of feel the same way yeah I completely agree especially with the interludes because like yeah it just made me feel like this was supposed to be a story album and it just wasn't and like the whole time I thought the story was you know a trying to avoid problems and go to an imaginary land where problems don't exist and there was like the relationship element of her talking about how she doesn't need a man but then she was talking about how she's in love with a man so that was another layer of indecision so yeah and I kept I listened to this thing I don't know three four times before doing this with you and each time I'm like you know I'm just missing something there it'll click and it just oh no it just didn't yet and I don't know if it will because if she did picture perfect and King of Hearts if she had that swagger that confidence she has between the behind her voice behind her flow because like her flow like we said is present the whole time like he has good blow but not that as good of a delivery of those two tracks in my opinions and if she had that kind of delivery that confidence an explosive in-your-face stuff the whole project I don't I don't think I would have been as confused I think I would have really liked this project you know you know not to have that one tone the whole time to just I know I just seem like that's the only moment she had like okay I got this guy's we're good because every other time she was just like the beats on I guess I should rap now I don't know that that's just being said Nicole but you know yeah yeah I mean it sort of sounds like you're little torn on the project like me I'm feeling a strong side to a light six on this one unfortunately didn't it didn't go into this didn't leave this album as excited about it as I was going into it I don't know with you know if you want to sort of you know put a stamp on this as far as you know your overall feelings on this yeah I guess I just I don't have a rating system but I would suggest people listen to it at least at least give picture-perfect to listen I think that's a really good track I think it's a good party song I think I think this album as a whole is a good project to just leave on the background maybe I like a party get together because it's not bad music but it's music that you necessarily don't have to pay attention to I don't I don't think it's a good introduction of British rap I think there is definitely other artists to go to you know sceptic amici wah was really good for me and that thing is awesome but yeah this project I don't know you can you can listen to it you can avoid it I don't think I don't think you're going to miss out if you don't listen to it but if you want to give it a shot go ahead I'm not going to stop you all right I want to thank my guest tabby for coming on and talking about this new little sins album with me his

tracks here now a few shoutouts to a few projects glutton before grace has a new project out that came out last year on Bandcamp as a very good punk and post-hardcore record to sort of slip through the tracks for me please give it a listen very good also rapper cleaner who has collaborated with Cal Church esta on a track at least one track has a new project alcohol Clunes Coupee get data listen if you want some hip-hop with some personality in your life and then we have aqua and nick bars aqualen project a very experimental avant guitar project that has a bit of a metal tinge to it nick barzakh Willem give it a listen very solid project lots of cool experimental guitar all over this thing let's get into the tracks worst tracks of the week just a couple because this week has graced us with quite a few good tracks want to give a shout out to afi's latest track get hurt don't like this song at all AFI over the years has done a fantastic job of watering down their sound to the point where it has no conscience whatsoever moving on from there we have temples with strange or to be forgotten which is so blandly blissful that I really got nothing out of this track unfortunately Big Sean is back to keeping it corny on his new song with chance the rapper track a relationship track for him where he just sounds like a poor man's Drake once again got to give a shout-out to why for the song proactive evolution another one of my least favorite tracks this week why continues to be one of my least favorite acts in hip hop and I feel like there's sort of another group that the more that they continue the less it seems like their original peer that their original appeal kind of just dissipates for some reason and then finally what in my opinion was the worst track that week least favourite track of the week new single by the chainsmokers these guys continue to put out some of the worst electronic dance music pop that I've heard in my life and the morbid curiosity got the best of me had to listen to this thing and now it's my least favorite Chinese Christian alright moving on from there the songs that was kind of indifferent towards but want to get him a quick shout out the song and the song slipping through the cracks from a Burum very avant and very theatrical metal here that I was not anticipating to enjoy as much as I do it's weird give it a shot blank mass of fuck but insane comes through because the solo project over here of the song hash this is a really interesting mix of sort of the distorted and experimental electronic music that you would expect from this project but there's like a strong like house like pop house vibe to this thing especially on the other lead vocals on this thing it's really weird granddaddy of all bands has a new album coming out the song at Nevermore know evermore sorry about that hey what are you doing in here puppies in here the song evermore is sort of a weird synth pop ballad that I didn't expect them to go in that direction with that it's okay nori can it come here hey they got a bit of a synth pop thing super Sugarfoot bro they got a bit of a synth pop thing going on with that track that I did not expect them to do it's it's okay also okay was this new Kid Koala track collapse sir but if in an ambient music direction for Kid Koala wasn't crazy about it but you know for ambient music it's okay mature or one half of the band zombie is back at it with a new track a few more pieces of eight if you're into some progressive since stuff give that a shot scissor drew barrymore single it's okay Lupe Fiasco's new track jump I actually like his flow on this track quite a bit though it didn't quite blow me away I'm just sort of waiting to see if he comes out with a new record I mean I guess he is I've heard the release date a few times in a few places but he had that whole hissy fit on Twitter about people calling him an anti-semite because he talked about his a record executives calling them dirty Jews or whatever and then he had a hissy fit and said I'm quitting I'm done I'm not putting on your mom music sorry why so I don't know what maybe he was quitting for just that day I don't know then we have wolf I have a new track out a very noisy very abrasive of course it's wolf Iseman pharmacon there's like an industrial noise track that lives up to the title transmission because it feels like I'm listening to this weird experimental noise piece over like a really bad radio signal can't say I'm crazy about it but the concept is there and it's I guess an interesting concept for a track slow dies new track people been freaking out over this new slow dive song Starr roving unfortunately it wasn't like fireworks for me like it was for many other people just seemed like kind of a bland song to me didn't really have too much in the way of like a captivating composition or anything Laura Marling this wildfire was a pretty decent track you know again not one of my favorite singles she's released so far from this upcoming album but you know if you're looking for a good soulful singer songwriter with a great voice do give a listen to this Laura Marling track and DMX is back with a new song with Swizz Beatz of the song banging is back actually he doesn't actually sound bad on the song he sounds like that junkyard dog DMX that we all knew and loved in the 90s and the 2000s all right as far as tracks that struck me this week that I really loved that I got to blast through we have quality Chris over here with a hilarious concept track called buddy's song sort of all about him loving himself you know of course it's in his laid-back weird left-field style so you know do kind of go into this thing expecting that but the lyrical component of this track and just kind of the idea of the track is very funny iron Reagan crossover thrash band new album on the way this lead single bleed v is an amazing hard-hitting track with tons of mosh friendly riffs king gizzard and the lizard wizard come out with a new song from this a new micro tonal tuning album that they're going to be dropping soon so of course there are all sorts of weird rips and jagged angular lead guitars all over this new track over here that are very fun very weird Fox again on Lankershim oh I love all these new foxes and tracks I want to get too much into it because I'm going to be reviewing their new album soon and I love them so much at least the songs I'm hearing from this new record I pretend like their last one doesn't exist shoo shoo Jenny go go shoo shoo continues to drop heat from this upcoming record loving that post-punk sound love that experimental rock sound shoo shoo continues to be one of the more interesting bands in indie and moving out from their aerial pink and wise blood collab that I did not know that I wanted but now that I'm hearing this track I want it and I got it and I'm loving it this song tears on fire is a beautiful kooky ballad I feel like on the song wise blood and aerial pink bring out the best in one another pile with Texas this band from Boston bit of a post hardcore thing hard to sort of put this song in the words the riffs are really weird I'll just say that and it is one of their more aggressive cuts so of course you know that excites me and finally I will end it off with the new grails song Pelham did not expect these guys to go in kind of a prog rock direction with this new cut over here which was cool lots of flashy guitar solos and leads all over this thing and a really tense groove to this track as well good jam on this track good jam and I'm going to leave that that those are all of my favorite tracks of the week the men actually the week my worst tracks of the week the album's that I wanted to recommend the the you know various projects I wanted to recommend the t-shirt is out the amazon associates link is down there and that's all i want to let you guys know you're the best thanks for watching preciate you my pepper is still here and we we love you forever 
wQ3EDk6Ku5M,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and we're changing up the format on the channel today for a different kind of video with a guest typically my guests are over the Internet or maybe more music related today my guest is Chris Regan who runs one of the top top 10 reaction channels on YouTube kompis tapas the compus the timing reaction chain that's why he's not around anymore and obviously I don't I don't think Chris is very funny that's why I had him on because this is why we're going to be doing a very serious video here I've been getting a lot of comments and tweets thrown at me over the past couple days some of them say hey hey dickhead review that at song original from uncle Adams now uncle Adams is an artist too on very unfamiliar with an artist that the moment that I saw you guys suggesting him to me and I saw the album cover the planting seeds album cover that a hits you right in the face once you google this guy I was like no please God no it is perfect it's beautiful it's really man have it in front of us right now but we have the image of the cover just burned into our brain the echoes him standing gigantic on the globe he's pouring water down onto the earth which which is growing G cleft sleeves off of a vine it's pristine and I'm a 15 chapter he has this music video out the the psalm is called original I feel almost bad talking about this track because almost a year old at this point but you know this is um this is just one of those moments where you know you think in the Internet age that like anything that's good anything that's worthwhile anything that's worth talking about just gets exposed right away because they're on the internet you know evidently not yeah because I decided had no clue that this was buried this was in the shadows yeah and now it's come to light a year almost a year later and I'm ready to be in the show and even still right now it's kind of still in the shadows because the video currently sits at like 50,000 views I feel almost like I'm in on the ground floor of this thing and Chris and I are going to react to this amazing song and music video we haven't even watched the whole thing yet because our initial experience to this thing was just so delicious you too full it really is a religious experience really religious yeah why you moved let's let's just start the video it'll be playing in the background and we're we're gonna we're just going to give some hot takes on this thing and the mr. uncle Adams original alright that's a killer logo every time I see a cgi intro like that I think oh it's going to be 480p video when I first saw this I just right away knew that there was going to be heaps of cringe here because we have the oldie time black and white image the record player even though it's not really that old of a record player like this is the kind of team out that you would see on a record player in the 80s so we're out going back to the narrow to the century gear right I didn't even notice it this is not a this is not like pre-war jazz here you know we're not like it's not flapper era no it is a it's like having like yeah like one of those old brick nokia's 220 exactly the film so grand a film so what what did he does roll roll over backwards skinny is he just doing his own stunts there we're right right here look at him he rolls over decades huh I was like at night that wasn't even like a roll it's like he dropped his key anymore I need to stand up all we can make it look like a Filip dude it's all make this book he hired the best editor I'm going to make it look like you're doing flips and shit like this is parkour it's gonna be like one of parkour montage you're in California you probably see a lot of parkour out there is this a parkour move which is written right here this that is that that's more of a spirit cooking Oh free ritual the larvae oh gotta get that's that's when you're in on pizza gay that's kind of a thing you do to show other people that you're the politician and all the connected people over in DC that's how you show that you're in on the whole thing that's why he's dressed I mean it's a very politician all the politicians just like yes home the kind of character didn't mythology living in the present days in my house you know the more I watch it the more than hat aggravates me like it didn't bother there's really go no it's not even the same color let you know it's not ray get the fuck out of here Mack and identification yes so that doesn't even go and whatever dude it's free it's a free country it's a free session for him in this period of time I guess it is a free country and we're not paying for the music video either also is some ikea ikea lighting over here going on in the background this lamp well you know he only the best only but what is that Jurassic Park thing that spared no expense yes exactly vitality right in my family is ambiance and laughing you can learn from whoa whoa cinematography here whoo I want to point out is immaculate hmm because shooting him through the glass shooting and probably the glass as if you're kind of not you kind of think you know what he's about but you don't really because you just look at him through through the lens of whatever biases you already have towards 1920s hip hop's flapper flapper rappers blue the way that I see it is it's quite symbolic um we have a bunch of things going on here okay just follow me on this okay I was going to point that out okay just follow me on this all right we have this glass barrier between us on the artist which to me we're on one side of the glass barrier reality and on the other side of the glass barrier we have the artist enclosed sort of in this little bubble of his where he get sort of braggadocious Lee deliver all these rap lines where he sort of builds himself up even though us on the outside of that barrier we just see it as ridiculous me meanwhile I think those RCA cables back there which should clearly be plugged into something because they are coming from the turntable I assume symbolize the fact that he's unplugged from that real world with the relevant sophistication and our invitation I mean it's about and I would I would agree I think that's exactly what he had in mind when he when he shot this that is terrifying this is a terrifying vision right there that little hop that he had that Esme's that is a terrifying vision that's a mess imagine waking up in the middle of the night and he's just looking at you like that and only to reveal that he has a bunch of like tentacles when he's flow during a clock across the floor you ever see Adam Abbadon no but that is far scarier yes then then that duck and everything uncle Adams this is the Adam scene sounds kind of terrible Adams family it gets creepier this is a reference it's just a reference fascinated by the song and there was there something else than another probably I probably I'm gonna get ready here it's delicious it did sustain the character time this guy's family holy shit it was it was subliminal yeah I didn't suck him back on my own I had to think of that on my own that was clearly put there to get in my head I'm perfect you know what's funny is that that is not the kind of piece of decor that somebody who is a music video director places back there that was clearly there before because this might be his aunts place or something or like his grandma's place it's like a like a plank that says be yourself yes exactly or no board respecting human with them and live laugh love back to mama which is my favorite piece of tacky yeah sort of like home goods you know peace of like let's decorate the house with with this thing that liveth love it's just this shinny motivational place exactly it's a motivational poster for baby boomers pretty much fascinated by huh he's just into the stars into a luminosity time you just this guy has he's a diesel jack-of-all-trades there's a lot of interest master oh my gosh now we just passed a frame of his haircut which which we will get into later because it's actually an even rarer form later in the music video my hands been calling in a rather not wait what was that light about pottery not not often you get a rap line about pottery well she molds your mind pottery similar to pottery mold young minds similar to pottery that's fucking terrible like that like everything up until now was like it's according it's not good yeah at least it's not molding young minds similar Tim lawyers I can't think similar some about that war that's very unwrapped Potter pottery is also I'm getting too technical here but uh I'm just going to leave it I'm going to leave it I'm not going to get too deep into that line because it's it's really just it's not worth it I'm just gonna probably is go weave it oh my god look at the debate you know yes you got two people in there yeah special effects up in JJ Abrams this guy's a whiz family plaque back there again so Larry until their family plan at least he knows continuity it could be symbolic of the fact that he is his own family you know he's very lonely guy he only has himself to depend on yeah I like that both of them are pointing at each other just add this to say look fuck is this guy in my mind nobody is topping me see that adds again to the narrative in his own reality you know inch TV he's created a synthetic version of the 1920 or they have 1980 technology and clothes it probably weren't even around this is probably an observation but he looks like the penguin from the series Gotham yes for some reason I don't you know you look like all the Penguins she done count like all the Penguins I brought up to you that he looked like Adam West penguin he does kinda look like that other penguin - he doesn't like a Batman supervillain like he doesn't look like he looks like a surly character although his face is really too goofy to completely pull it off yeah yeah yeah he looks very non friendly but in a threatening way but in a threatening way exactly interesting oh damn alright now this part is important now we ever watched the whole music video yet so we don't know what the ending is but I think this part is significant because he's clearly warped in the future here yeah he has electricity and this is clearly a post Edison era well although I'm sure he was probably referencing a post Edison error anyway but would follow me here we have a colorful little hoodie over here with striped his hairdos is out there for all to see he clearly has a bit of green in his hair yellow in his hair you know he's a got the dad bod going and as we'll see going later he has to hipster girls kind of dancing with him at this point in the video to see a great shot of him yeah I came to see if the light was a bit still bearing yes yes oh yes this might still work whoever did this hair man they just mmm it is a work of art you could say that there's definitely a if anybody wants to screenshot this there's definitely a barbershop meme in here the barbers like what do you want and then it says me just just fuck me out fam and that's you know there's a meme in there yeah is that like it like says oh yeah let me get my mind but my mother's last heartbeat on the side of my head it's symbolic mm-hmm very lumping clearly clearly cared about his family hmm yes maybe we'll see a family plaque placed in the background here some more family ruffle things aside maybe he's related to these two girls who are dancing around him what kind of a funky kind of a funky chicken back yeah this fucking bubbles whoa he's very aware of the Internet he's very self-aware you know he's like he's woke she got stopped using woke you fucked up you got to erase this whole video now and start over that's not a weird scene there that I pointed out earlier there's a scene where there's just a light switch flicking on and off but clearly the lights aren't working and I'm sort of wondering what that symbolic of like maybe maybe up here the lights aren't on I think he's got that's another thing is like he's halfway through the video right he's halfway done yeah and he realizes that it just doesn't fucking work mm-hmm everything's wrong it's broken but he's still trying if you notice you still you went back and trying to go at it he's still at it he hasn't learned his lesson plug the fucking thing in hmm he's just wrapping into that bulb yes which is the fucking worst light I've ever seen yes exactly like that ugly sort of commercial-grade orange sort of yellow glowing light off of the face I mean for a real director that probably just makes the scene look like crap I mean evidently it does yeah as well I mean it does I mean if you were gonna if objectively so yes I mean if you're going to do this I don't know you get you'd get a lower wattage bulb different different color just don't have a fucking just don't sing into a light bulb my idea you know there's all sorts of good edgy music videos where they do that where it's like it's dark all around the singer except for the one light bulb and really the other thing yeah there's probably couple out there and then maybe they at the end they smash the bulb and look really cool that's hard maybe he'll do that at the end maybe this could turn into you know I still think this has hope but we got a minute or so left to turn into a very David Lynch Ian kind of experience you know I think I'm a good I practically won at the highest Rosen for this it's possible it upon anything possible oh sure what'd I tell you it's gonna do it right here he's gonna open this door and it's gonna be it's gonna be the black lodge like poltergeist is looking at the because see but was this the person trying to flick on the lights or that was the mom trying to flick on the lights and shawl going out the flashlight now they really hear that clear what's going on what's going on the lights are out in my house my son is here but the thing is if the electricity is out on your house how is he watching on an iPad or some kind of you know like tablet device if there's no Wi-Fi because the lights are out maybe he downloaded it and saved it as you do in in 2017 you know you've never done you've ever downloaded app example only when watched it only when it's a video of this caliber because I know if the lights were out I know if the Wi-Fi was out this is the first thing I'd want to watch damn it is like he possessed them that's yeah she's molding a young mind went live alert apartment would be similar to pottery this is actually a horrifying image because it's weird because it's like it's oddly foreboding but it's everything's in focus like it like a sitcom yeah so I don't know how to feel about this like part of me wants to be like oh it's that's cute and the other part of me says stop it now put play she dropped the light she's like drop the light run away in horror yeah exactly [Music] whoa whoa I wasn't close keep going I thought the end I thought it was the end to I mean I knew we had like a minute left I was like oh maybe there'll be an end slate or something yeah like he's brought it back now he's a chef uncle Adams the chef Raekwon the chef clearly a deep crew it clearly knows his hip-hop history and making a deep reference here let's see what uncle Adams cooks up at this point in the video so Jesus Christ you're not supposed to be and that's me it's a bonus if they notice me nowadays anemic wife ovaries I've got a Nikoli and Ali nobly depression and anxiety about sad depression and anxiety I talked about him openly Allah Allah okay so what just happened here can you describe what so he said first thing I know I'm known globally which he evidently is not because this is the first I've heard of him as 50,000 views a year so he got globally I mean I agree with his line but only in the most technical sense like there may be two people from France who's CMAs there maybe that's one person from Brazil who see one person from like a coal mine and me and Ron Dax yes exactly you know so only in the most technical of senses you know but the moment worries like do you say uses rap money to buy groceries but he only have like three apples there as he pointed to his groceries again it's signifying that he doesn't have one right have a lot of life question couple apples my rap career all is added up to my rap career is off off the chain guys I can afford three apples now and then what depression and anxiety I've talked about them openly as you doing this kind of like I'm a little teapot sort of arm funky chicken yeah sort of wave seems very happy as he's talking about all of his men exactly in which this video maybe again this kind of like Mad Hatter fever dream yeah of this guy you know who's in his own little trouble in his own little world where he just morphs into he he is some kind of turn-of-the-century oil baron with a pocket watch connected to a chain which he holds out of his best recent readies in his pocket and his oil because then he turns into a millennial with a funny little striped hoodie and hipster girls dancing all around him and now he's become a chef so the natural progression of the man oil baron millennial chef so they are sounds like a winning script Wow okay stop shows okay en look this are yellow Jerry ha ha what I mean now hold on a second the nun please stop this we're just going to stop this he um colitis has many more music videos on YouTube we can't react to all of them today nor do we want to you know this is something that Chris and I from here on out are probably going to save for the moments when our depression and anxiety are acting up prepartum I feel some fear if we need something to pull it out of that and I'm fighting I'm fucking sad we gotta we gotta bring up uncle Adams again yeah I need to be pulled back into the 21st century from the pack B maybe maybe maybe that'll be saved again for another time you know name it but but original is clearly a clearly a standout clearly a original original that you at the very least you can say that we're just going to leave our reaction there because I think we could probably react to uncle Adams all day you could write a fucking script about this yeah you know that movie that's coming out about McDonald's hmm is it like the founder they could do something like that look this mmm like what the how do you even how a shock you mentary shock you man a shock you memory I'm going it could it would probably more offensive than that a and E KKK documentary that got pulled off a and E probably more offensive than that that happened yeah it did I'm tipping you to this you picked me Oh hip-to-hip i'm woke well ah ah no I'm at damn stop saying lo hit my guest in this video is the mr. Chris Reagan you can find his YouTube channel in his Twitter account down there in the description please follow him please subscribe to him he's a nice man and has very funny videos in my opinion ah thanks man no problem I'm depressed at least you talk about it talk about it okay even thing trash "
pH1hWAuQv4I,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here you know who it is and it's time for a vital update where I get into a bunch of Records and releases that have recently made it into my little personal album music record collection over here I have a bunch of things to go over here sorry it's been a while since the last vinyl update my receiver my amplifier crapped out and I couldn't even listen to records for a while and I've just been really busy with lists week and the holidays and everything so finally I got around to getting everything back up and running and now I can actually listen to records so when I actually pick up a record I can listen to it and then talk about it in this video over here so let's get into what I have here the first few things that I have are actually not records at all hit up the local record store shout out to red scroll over here and they have a bunch of tapes over there recently because tapes have come come back in a big way and they've been taking tapes people have been trading tapes in and I saw this tape of this faith no more tape for the real thing and hopefully not a there we go yeah looking good and this tape actually sounds excellent even though this tape is uh years old at this point god it sounds real good I don't know just I just got a good tape deck for my buddy second hand and really happy with the way that it sounds and this thing not only is the album great also contains two extra songs so I was really happy with the picking this up for just like a couple a couple dollars so damn goddamn and you know that's why I like having my options open people are like oh do you like vinyl more than CD do you like CD more than vinyl the legatee three tapes buh buh buh you know I like just having different decks for different physical mediums so that if I find something for a couple dollars that is would be really good for my collection then sure you know buy it pick it up and you know and I'm going to buy this for ten bucks on iTunes and I'm going to buy this on vinyl I've gotta buy you CD or anything like that I'm going to pirate it I paid a couple bucks I got a nice tape sounds great it's the whole album and so there you go but BAM and gotta give a shout-out to these guys whose project I haven't been able to listen to until recently because again the whole receiver thing and and I've also been busy but this group local to me this hip-hop group called political animals they come out with a couple of good singles over the past couple years they recently released their album last year the thing is titled ego beefs and you're going to love the packaging for this thing I can't fuckin believe this shit this is their album it's a fuckin Sega Genesis cartridge box yes and on the back it's like you know as if the video game was here but this is the tracklisting and you know you see like different screenshots of the video game over here and these guys they're a live band it's not like you know that I believe they work with a DJ as well you know so I mean there's an element of production to what they do but you know it's mostly live instrumentation the the bars are pretty great the verses are great though I will say the recording on this is a little rougher than I would have liked it to be didn't really live up to the quality of the recording of the singles that led up to this project unfortunately but the packaging is still incredible so obviously Sega Genesis cartridge you open it and it's like you have the manual over here the lyric manual with all the lyrics listed which is pretty hilarious and then you have the tape itself which fits snugly in here again as if it were like a Sega Genesis cartridge and it's it's a cool little orange tape and oh damn I'm sorry guys it fit not break didn't break didn't break didn't break so so yeah over here you have the tape is this nice cool bright orange tape side a and side B obviously pretty cool little packaging idea really fun a concept to put together in albums so you know if you like hip-hop and you want to try a group that's local you want to try a group that's doing something different and obviously put together one of the most ambitious packaging projects for any album that I've come across this year recently give these guys a listen give these guys a shot look them up again their name is political animals ego beasts is the name of the project over here good job guys this is this is really fun idea not anything would that would dawn on most most artists most bands they even have that idea moving on from there just want to give a quick shout out to the CD compilation that I got The Cramps file under sacred music this is all of their early singles from 1978 to 1981 I had a compilation CD of theirs that had like an album or an EP and some of these singles but then I didn't really like that EP and I went like some of the tracks on and I got rid of it and I ended up picking this up because this was a more complete collection of all of their singles so it's kind of like it's not an average CD sigh it's a little bigger so it looks like a vinyl record sort of package because as a gatefold and you see the inside there you pulled this out the the CD and it's in a black sleeve you pull the CD out and it's got like you know a record sort of sticker over here labeling rather and over here the the booklet itself has pictures of all of the singles that are featured on the on the CD itself so it's actually a really cool package and you know if you're a psychobilly fan a rockabilly fan if you're a post-punk fan I definitely recommend checking this out even if you just haven't heard The Cramps in general and you're not familiar with any of these genres they are a crazy off-the-wall gutsy and kind of gothic rock and roll group with a lot of crazy fucking songs tracks on this include their cover of surfin bird' which is an infamous track the way that I walk human fly Domino loved their take on lonesome town fever and garbage man a great TV set loved that ak drug train love that track the their cover of twist and shout and uranium rock that's a good track googoo muck is one of them are legendary tracks as well very funny track and I love the crush' that's an amazing song so lots of great tracks on this thing this is like you know some of their some their hottest tracks this is like The Cramps pure fucking Heat over here so if you do run across this compilation do give it a shot if you don't own it because you know I don't have any of these singles personally I don't have any d7 issues any of these 45s and it's great to have them sort of in one place alright moving on from here actual vinyl want to give a shout out to the Australian band flower truck they opened up for me at some speaking engagements that I did down in Australia this year and they put on a great couple of performances and this is a fun little EP that they have hopefully there are more copies of this thing around or you know after mentioning this you'll at least go out on YouTube or somewhere and sort of look their stuff up this is like a five track sort of deal over here and if you're in a post-punk if you're in a new wave that is a pretty heavy on the sense and feature some very shouty etc Cocles you're going to like this this is really fun a lot of personality good grooves high energy and some good pop songwriting too if you're in a new order maybe a little camper van Beethoven I think you're going to be into this again grooves are nice productions pretty tight at least for the tracks it seems like the songs are recorded in different ways or at least by different people because it seemed like the production varied from track to track a little bit I think side a hit me a little harder than side B but definitely you know a lot of potential with these guys and uh hoping they come out with an album soon or hoping that when and if they do release something else I actually hear about it you know keep keep in touch hit me up moving on from there one of my favorite EPS of the year but has become even more of a favor of mine this new Tony Molina confront the truth 7-inch if you do recall from my review I like this but I thought that toady going in sort of more of an acoustic direction didn't really fit his songwriting style all that much but for whatever reason listening to this thing on 7-inch actually hearing the vinyl there's a nice picture of a church sort of featured on the back of this EP there's a four songs on here but if you know Tony Molina's songwriting style very short songs so you know what eight songs could mean anything but but anyway I guess what I'm trying to say is that Tony's music on here didn't really hit me until I mean hit me with I think the potency that it should have until actually listened to the 7-inch when I actually listened to the 7-inch it sounded a little more full a little more beautiful the instrumentation was a little more vivid I don't know I think the loaf I sound that he had on his previous record which I actually picked up at the same time as this EP because I pre-ordered it I have his a distant dismissed album over here which I ordered via Slumberland records I was like well I'm going to preorder this I'm gonna finally pick this album up because I've been like listening to the sing so constantly so on and off it is an 11 minute breakup album and it's not like some kind of crazy hardcore punk grindcore thing you know because the whole thing is 11 minutes no it's kind of these really weird lo-fi ballads that when I listen to it you know digitally like it really kind of complements that sound because you know the sound was broken down a little bit because of the audio quality the general ascetic of this thing is so rough and it's so low fine so dirty this confront the truth EP is way cleaner and I don't know for some reason again it just kind of hit me on vinyl just kind of sounded great on vinyl and the fact that the songs were so brief didn't really mind it because again some of the tunes some of the melodies some of his a harmonic layering with some of the instrumentation on this thing so beautiful even though the tracks are so short one thing I do love about both of these projects over here though is that they sort of both feature these cool little inserts and they each have like some kind of Dobby picture of Tony like when he was a kid I think he's a was probably some some some Catholic thing going on over here and as far as the insert on distant dismissed have a nice a nice very moody moody high school pic over here maybe junior high pick with an exploited t-shirt right there it's a pretty pretty pretty epic packaging right there thrown it back to the to the to the Junior High days or the high school days whichever one I'm not I'm not totally sure I can't uh Tony Malina looks so young I've seen him live once before and he seems like such a young guy seems like such a cool dude and as far as the you know the the two records here themselves I mean they're both black pretty standard you know though for an album that's just eleven minutes long and is low Phi as dissed and dismissed is Slumberland record certainly did put in for a pretty thick record I have to say that listening to distant dismissed on vinyl I didn't really pick up any on any musical nuances that I didn't hear already but I still do like the album and I did want to pick up a copy that because I think the record is great and you know as probably didn't rank as high on my albums of the year that year but it's it's sort of become a bit of a sleeper hit for me moving on from there one of my favorite albums of last year the new map most record ultimate care this was a bit of a Christmas exchange over here my buddy Jeremy who helps out with the show and does some editing he got me this I got him a copy of the new Radiohead record and my buddy Austin who you guys have heard me mention on multiple occasions I got him a copy of the new swans album and he got me copy this new Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds record so uh so a bit of a Christmas deal over here because me and my buddies we take care of each other we do some vinyl exchanges for the holidays and really glad Jeremy hooked me up with this because this album sounds great on vinyl god damn does it the the sounds of the washing machine on this thing are so vivid and fun and crisp and clean and clear just sounds real good and you know nothing nothing else to say about it other than that pretty standard packaging over here single sleeve black record one thing that I do like though about the picture over here is I love how we have sort of the credits depicted on the the door of the washing machine when you flip it up and you normally see like you know the the warning sign and instructions on how to use it and so on and so forth instead we have the credits and the liner notes and all that which I thought was pretty funny idea for the packaging we sort of have depict it over here another image on the other side of the sleeve so uh really happy with this record sounds great on vinyl I do highly recommend giving this a listen on vinyl if you have not heard this album on vinyl if you are a fan of it and this Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album sounded fantastic as well I'm not familiar with the recording process of this album but I was much more impressed with it on record than I was listening to it sort of over Apple music listening to it digitally though you know nothing much to report about the packaging over here and in a way sort of to be expected I mean the sleeve is a little larger than most sleeves that I have in my collection by just a by just a little bit I'm not exactly sure why you know you sort of have that little nuts it's just like a little it's like an extra centimeter or half a centimeter on each side so it is a little bigger and it is a super thick piece of cardboard this is not a flimsy cover over here and the packaging itself given that the album is so dark and is so minimal also pretty much follows suit you have the tracklist over here and some liner notes on the inner sleeve over here picture of Nick Cave on the flipside sitting at the piano and just kind of the record itself is just kind of sitting in a black sleeve with a little bit of a minimal labeling over there too so um I am very happy with the sound of the record itself really happy I got a chance to have that on vinyl thank you to Austin and Jeremy for a hook me up with that and just you know being good Christmas buddies I have a copy of the Jesus and Mary Chain psycho candy debut album from these guys finally got a copy of it for myself I have like a single from these guys in the past that you guys have probably picked up on on a vinyl update I didn't realize this is kind of there's like a fucked up thing here that's like a sticker on here this was clearly there's like a bullet hole punched here this was clearly a copy for a promo copy for a radio station or something I think though there isn't really any labeling on it that would lead me to believe that though it does seem like there was a sticker here maybe there was a label removed on it or anything or something you know I'm obviously not a mint copy but I didn't pay too much for it and the record itself is in fantastic condition so I've been given a listen to it last night the Jesus and Mary Chain always been a band that I've I think I've respected more than I've been totally head over heels for I enjoy some of their later stuff and I know that their sir massively influential to a lot of bands that I love like crystal stilts and many of the other like you know very reverb II garage rock bands of the 2000s and even today you know but the thing about this record is even though it sort of has a sound that was unlike any other for its time it's very much an album that timmy is sort of like a studying album like you listen to it you're like okay I'm listening to this to sort of understand what was happening back then you know we're sort of where this kind of comes from the origins of this because even though the sound of this record is unique I wouldn't exactly call the Jesus and Mary Chain at least at this point in their career like sound Smiths I mean the sound throughout this record is pretty uniform and you know I wouldn't say that the the distortions that they're working with we're all that novel or sort of you know um uh I I guess so so great and so dynamic that you'd want to hear it again and again and again album after album and you know and I'm going to say one more thing here I don't think this is a secret or anything but the songwriting not really that substantive you know like a lot of the songs are pretty plain and very basic and not really all that like I don't not many of them stick in my head you know it's an album that I enjoy more for its aesthetic then I do its writing or even its performances which across the record can run pretty stiff maybe that's an opinion a lot of people don't really want to hear but uh but it's it's my opinion of the record you know it's an album that again I think it's cool I appreciate it you know I like its style and you know it's definitely an album that sounds pretty cool when you've got it on you just turn it up full blast and you can just kind of feel that sound that they're bringing but it's it's you know it's not really an album I would listen to quietly or an album that I would a you know parse the the details of or anything like that but you know moving on from there this one I can't really show you the inside of because I I have made the executive decision not not to open this one this is a sealed fresh copy of Death Grips --is Fashion Week instrumentals and the interview 2016 EP that they put together I already know how both of these things sound I don't assume that listening to them on on vital will really reveal anything you know Death Grips --is albums so far all of which I have sound pretty pretty close to how they sound on CD anyway so you know and not that I don't like listening my Death Grips records I do but you know I'm not really like chomping at the bit to open this thing up so you know this is a one of only a couple records that are hanging out my collection that are just going to be sealed and that's just going to be that and so there you go you know and it's obviously you know limited pressing Record Store Day pressing so and that's part of the reason why I'm just kind of keeping it as is all right and the final thing that I'm going to mention here give a shout-out to the good people over at vinyl me please for hooking me up with this copy that's repressing this exclusive pressing that they did this amazing Nina Simone album sings the blues' this is not only a great package there's also a great inserts leave with wonderful photos of Nina you know someone who I've seen many pictures of in the past but it was actually photo over here yes this photo of her say next to the piano which I actually found to be the most intriguing because in a lot of ways it just kind of gives you an idea of her stature you know um just uh just her kind of her size as a person sort of how she kind of handled herself or filled filled a room this kind of interesting picture because it's like you know you see pictures of people that you're like how how big is that person you know it's it's sort of weird it's probably the same thing like with that I've had people watch my videos and they comment in person if they meet me like oh I didn't know you're that tall or I then just kind of struck me in a way and kind of grabbed my attention that that particular photo so great lyric sheet great a photo over here and the cherry on top of this package thank you again to finally please for sending this along is the awesome I mean not only does the record a thick pressing sounds great but it is this great baby blue pressing over here god this is a nice baby blue color it's like a powder blue and really nice color guys really nice interesting color to pick for this because I mean it matches exactly the front cover so really awesome package really good job and album itself sounds amazing god the performances on this thing are not only great I love her take on House of the Rising Sun it's not really that kind of slow-mo very dreary ballad type you know of take on the song we usually hear it's very fast-paced very it goes it moves it has a pace to it also some of her best songs over best recordings on here I want a little sugar in my bowl since I fell for you day and night really great Nina Simone tracks on here one of her best albums and a really great package from the vme people V M P people so again thank you for that and that has been this vital update everybody these are the records that have again recently made it into my collection and you'd best transition and that is the vinyl update everybody thank you for watching I appreciate it also down there in the description you can see a playlist of all of my other vinyl videos hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this video some records to check out all sorts of other links next to my head and I hope everybody is doing well hope everybody's our tables and amplifiers are not shitting the bed forever 
KPfcEVcvpsQ,I hate to break it to everybody but punk music it's not coming back just because their presidents a dickhead over the past couple of weeks since it's been announced that Trump won the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton there's been this growing sentiment that genres that are typically known as being super politically charged like punk music are going to have a bit of a comeback over the next four to eight years or genres like hip hop were just going to start just dropping super political music left and right or even that music is somehow going to become better over the next four to eight years because the artists making the music are going to be suffering which is a in a way actually kind of sick and I'm here to say that not shits going to happen look not only has punk music not really gone anywhere there are still lots of punk bands putting out Punk records but as far as punk music being a cultural force at least in America it's a thing that happened it's a thing that came and went it's not going to happen again just because we don't like our politicians or just because there's some kind of injustice going on in the political system I don't know if you've noticed but you know despite the fact that Obama is probably going to go down in history as much less of a horrible president than george w bush which she rightly should it's not like the past eight years haven't had their share of in justices or its share of political blunders like the NSA spying on us or all the bombs we've dropped all the foreign interventions that we've gotten ourselves involved in and the number of notable albums recorded and written by notable artists that have made songs dealing in these topics i can probably count on my fingers and toes and i have the feeling that it's going to be the same thing for donald trump and that's not to say that this new generation doesn't care about politics they most certainly do but the way that that manifests itself in their actions and in their art is most likely going to be very different than that of generations who live through the 70s and the 80s and the 90s for one thing social media is an absolute game changer and I would say probably more effective tool at delivering your political opinions than let's say a 7-inch record featuring really loud blaring guitars and vocals that you can't even make out because the singer is at the top of his lungs so if this new generation does want its political opinion to be heard it doesn't necessarily have to rely on the DIY scene or aggressive self released music and if Millennials do manage to start releasing more politically charged music over the next four to eight years its most likely going to take on a different form a different sound a different shape it's most likely not going to be a punk record probably not a metal record it may not even be a hip hop or an EDM album so going forward let's not prescribe to young people how they should go about expressing their opinions in this new presidency I mean not to say that we can't debate but how these conversations are going to be head into the future it's probably not going to happen in the way that it did when the back in my day when we were mad at what the president was doing we had a punk show and we went to the coffee shop and we strummed our acoustic guitars if things like punk music do come back to cultural prominence it's most likely going to be because that's just a sound that people want to hear again and it's a sound that for one reason or another artists are doing really well I mean when we go back to the origins of punk it's not like bands such as wire or the Ramones or the Stooges were formed out of political unrest or even the misfits for sure some of my favorite punk bands take on a myriad of political topics on their records but that's not the case for every punk band so much so that I wouldn't say it's a requirement for you to be in a punk band that you're deeply engrained in the politics that every song that your release has a political message to it so if you're a young music fan and you want to hear political music go seek that out find political music that identifies with you if you're an artist a young artist and you want to make political music do that but do it on your own terms don't feel this pressure to copy what people of the past did to say things that you feel like need to be said in the present and can we stop directly associating good music and art with tragedy and personal anguish and suffering for sure there are many points in the past where that has been the case but it's gotten to the point now where we almost expect it and we think that because there's there's some hard times there some suffering right around the corner we're going to get some good me that's just kind of stupid so Punk is not coming back just because our president is a moron and music is not going to become super political just because the political class is unlikable they've actually been unlikable for quite a while and you know if you want to hear a certain sound if you want to hear a certain message in music now is a better time than ever in the Internet age to just go out there and make that music yourself record that message yourself don't just expect the change that you want to see go out there and make it if over the next four years you want to hear the greatest punk music that's ever been recorded because you using President Donald Trump is it is an asshole then just you know go out there and make that music then and I think that's all I want to say right now transition what did you think of all this stuff that I said do you agree to you disagree are you too distracted by my ugly hoodie to actually respond to the video that I just recorded let me know and all sorts of links next to my head other videos you check out subscribe to the channel official website and you're the best forever 
UY5cqI-Nhu8,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here you know who it is doing a quick video talking about this new David Bowie no plan EP a posthumously released EP that contains a couple of songs that were originally on David Bowie's Lazarus soundtrack afore that Lazarus off-broadway musical and now are on this EP they did not make it onto the Black Star album but they are certainly songs thematically and sonically musically could have fit on to that record originally I had a video recorded where I was talking about my David Bowie death theory that I alluded to in my top 50 videos of 2016 however the more I come to learn about David Bowie's passing the less validity my theory actually has and it just kind of seems silly and I've spread enough fake news for today my dumb theory was basically maybe like a few days before David Bowie may have passed away before the album released that is and album was released afterwards sort of in a time capsule fashion but I don't really stand behind this theory anymore it was just kind of a whimsical notion that I had in my head whatever but anyway as far as the songs that are on this EP that are not Lazarus because you've already heard that track we had this no plan track that I will talk about a little bit in brief this song is a track that also sort of sees David Bowie in a position where he seems after life but instead of being in heaven which he mentions on Blackstar he sort of in this really weird I don't know void of a place with the sound scapes no plan no urgency no nothing really going on he's sort of in this space of nothingness not that he says that there's nothing there whatsoever but there's no reason to do anything there's no reason for things to sort of progress forward there's no plan there's no progression there's no direction and the very soft and gentle guitars and percussion and horns on this track are actually pretty beautiful David Bowie's vocals on top of the song are sort of weary warbly as they were on many cuts off of Blackstar and they're actually pretty haunting as a result moving on from there the next track over here killing a little time is one of my favorites here probably my favorite and tract that I really wish had made out on a Blackstar I love how heavy this song is and menacing and dissonant it is it actually is kind of a metal tone to the guitars and the drums and the bass like there is something really humbling about this track and as the song progresses these very sour dissonant horns come in and create a bit of chaos make the song intensely sour the track is powerfully unsettling and I'll leave it at that then with the closing cut over here when I met you a song that I wish musically varied up a little bit more from beginning to end but I still do kind of like the dissonance and how unsettling the song feels at the very start the track as it moves along what really kind of strikes me about this song are the lyrics David Bowie seems to be singing about a person or a thing it seems like a person but maybe that's symbolic for something that sort of enters his life at this point and creates this kind of harmony the sort of clarity that hadn't been there previously and even though this is just a mere four song EP and there's not really a strong arc to it or anything that Trek still does kind of feel like a fitting closer moment of closure on the EP at least when it comes to the narrative or the story on that track and all in all it's not a bad EP you know at the very worst I would probably give this thing a life 7 you know it's not a whole lot to speak of in terms of material but I am glad this collection of tracks came out is a very collection of tracks and again cool musical moments that could have been on Blackstar certainly you should hear if you're a fan of Blackstar and if you're a fan of David Bowie you certain you certainly should not miss because especially since the fact this EP is essentially kind of celebrating a what would have been his 70th birthday so uh yeah there you go those are my thoughts on the CT those songs those tracks and I will catch you guys in the next video thank you for watching and thank you for hopefully understanding why I sort of made this decision executive decision to sort of you know change paths on this video in the video I was planning out planning and coming out with today and that's it guys 
J_EXmjacmOc,hi everyone Tran thony zant anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new pink guy album pink season pink season is the second full-length album or mixtape from pink guy aka mr. George Miller aka mr. filthy Frank a youtuber famous for playing these depraved obnoxious offensive characters in these viral Internet videos because he's too much of a loser to just be himself gotta learn to love yourself buddy just just when I think you're gone forever you you come right back hey bu you know you everybody else is taken with themselves by now you're welcome get Cal Church acid rappin knowledge okay well pink eyes last project was a pretty hilarious and ambitious undertaking it dropped three years ago and it's it's not every day that you get a rap project with bars on it about your dog licking peanut butter off of your scrotum my one major issue with this project and sort of what made it hard for me to enjoy this thing long term was that it felt like to me it didn't go far enough like through pink guy George was just merely dipping his toes into just how raunchy and awful of an album that he could possibly make because it was pretty clear beyond the character that we were just listening to a guy who was toying with some dick and pussy jokes a little nasty playground humor just for shits and giggles and for the entertainment of his Internet audience but with pink season the idea that I'm listening to a character sort of gets subtracted out of my head for almost 90 minutes and for 35 tracks this thing delivers objectionable and offensive in a potency that was not previously reached on the previous project and while in one breath this is exactly what I was asking for in that self-titled review but in the other breath the issue now with this project is that it is so gross and so dumb and so lowbrow that a lot of what's here is is near unlistenable definitely unsure about unless you're a kid who's passing this album around to your friends at school I mean it's not 35 year olds blasting this on one another's Facebook walls that climb this thing up the iTunes charts I will say I have no issue sharing the song STFU though that that track I truly identify with when I want someone to shut the fuck up I send them that track but the rest of this thing is very cringy and I don't use that word lightly I mean this thing is a 5-point cringe on the Richter scale we're reaching down on cream but seriously though the 35 tracks on this thing they are kind of a mixed bag you do have tracks like the opener which are kind of redundant and very quiet very demo quality the vocals sort of clip and distort at numerous points in the track some of the mixing is off and it feels like this track and again many others exist solely for the purpose of being able to say pussy a million times and there's nothing particularly great about this opening track that makes it a fitting opener for the record either and there are other songs on here that are obviously more aggressive turn up the volume George is caught on tracks like are you serious with these cracked yell P vocals that remind me kind of Jimmy urine of Mindless Self Indulgence Fame but except over a trap be in between nasty bars about coming in your sister's mouth and playing with your bitch's clit we have filler lyrics about not having time for a little bitch right now that very same bar is being wrapped in the hulls of a junior high school by some dude named Cody and him and his friend Zach are embroiled in a rap battle in their Midwestern town which is 50% cornfields now that's that's not to say that there aren't bars that there aren't tracks on this album that I like or find funny the songs I have a gun hand on my gat and gaze for Donald are so excessive and deal in a subject matter so preposterous that it's hard not to at least chuckle of these tracks if your humor has a dark side and the song highschool blink 193 is a pop punk parody that I laugh at every time it plays about hating high school and being bullied and the track in reference to David Icke is pretty hilarious to wear sort of goes in and makes light of and satirizes all these various conspiracy theories about you know not believing the Holocaust is real or lizard people not going to the moon etc and when this project gets really ridiculous and yes there are moments that feel more ridiculous than others are on tracks like Nickelodeon bitches and Dora the Explorer wear pink guy dabbles in blatant pedophilia even though he sort of seems to excuse that on the Dora the Explorer tracks saying that it can't be pedophilia because Dora the Explorer's is a drawing it's an animation and believe it or not in the mosh pit of dick and pussy jokes on this record there are a few moments of nuance of subtle satire like the choppy annoying beats on the song club banger 3000 which is obviously parroting EDM or just kind of dance music you'd hear at the club or the song be inspired that closes the entire record off sort of making fun of the idea that you have to come out with your most meaningful track at the very end of the record and I think the whole sound the whole concept of the inspired the motivational the meaningful rap song and the song small dick isn't just a semi racist song about having a small dick in a way it's almost kind of a comment on people who feel inadequate and insecure about their penis size as the person that pinkeye or George or whoever is playing on this song is rapping about how seven inches is a small dick and you should kill yourself the joke isn't really the dick or the size or anything else about the track other than this person's obvious insecurities then in the tracklisting here we have some 4chan anthems like meme machine which is a track I actually find pretty funny as well as the song hentai which I wish was more of a rap driven track I mean it's actually very cool meld of ukulele licks and beats at the first half of the song but then it kind of melts into a ballad a straight uke ballad and I wish I kind of you know stuck to that banger formula for at least a little bit longer now there are some tracks in the track listing here that George had previously released had been construed as him making more serious music these songs for the most part are all named after food on this record though there is the song pink life which to my year sounds like it could have been a rich chigga single but there's also the songs fried noodles rice balls and dumplings to wear Jorge is singing and rapping in a more natural tone of voice kind of a deep monotone he sounds cool as a cucumber very laid-back but when you get into the lyrical content it's still pretty ridiculous tongue-in-cheek off-the-wall lewd rude he's clearly not taking himself that seriously even though his fans seem to think so he makes fun of this at the very end of the song rice balls where he's parodying people who follow his videos follow his music begging him for oh please come out with serious music but he's come out with serious music his audience again I feel he mocks them on the song I will get a vasectomy where he makes fun of dumb kids or this new young generation is being so stupid and being annoying and being just like dim and I have a feeling he thinks some of these criticisms apply to the audience for this very album too so there are touches of self-awareness and parody to this project here and there especially on songs like help which in in my opinion reveal some deep personal issues that are most likely fueling the vile content on the rest of the record it's a kind of beat driven quaint ukulele ballad that has a sad streak to it there are a few other songs on this album like that like directions to the dog show or whatever but these moments didn't really strike me is all that memorable and there are other tracks in the track listing here that I could address although I don't I don't really feel like songs like please stop calling me gay are uh you know we're really in need of explaining although what I will say is that the goofy's trial skit is one of the weirdest skits I've heard on an album ever I will not spoil it I will just leave it there this album is fucked up it's stupid it's retarded it's idiotic and did I say retarded it's almost 90 minutes of bullshit I will most likely never listen to it again especially in sitting maybe a song here or there for a quick giggle but this whole album never know but still I'm so glad it exists because not all music needs to be so serious not all music needs to be trying to impress us with its artistic acumen for some people comedy and music just doesn't go together I don't know why some of my favorite records have a strong sense of humor to them my favorite artists too that's why I like artists like Frank Zappa so much or anal contour the myriad of artists who we featured in our recurring it came from band camp series on this channel I think art needs balance and should reflect every aspect of the human spirit and humor and absurdity I think are integral parts of that now I will say this album is not going to be for everybody I totally understand if you're offended by this record or if the language on this record is just way too dumb or annoying for you that's the totally fine no guilt in just tossing this fucking thing in the trash if that's how you feel I wouldn't look at you funny or even try to pretend like oh you're you're really missing something here but buddy no I will not say that but I will say that at least I found this album somewhat entertaining I do like that it went further I do like that it was more excessive I do like that it was more in-your-face and I think in a funny way it's Jorge kind of showing his versatility as an artist as well because while there are some tracks on here that are somewhat tongue-in-cheek there just seemed to be a certain level of skill to his rapping to his lyric writing into the production on this thing too but that doesn't show up consistently throughout this project because you know he often switches that out for something totally ridiculous totally off-the-wall the musical equivalent to stripping down naked and filming yourself jerking off while fingering your butthole but that's how I really feel I'm feeling it have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next I got to go shave because my hair is getting long on the face again long my face facial hair is getting long I'm more on anyway all sorts of links next to my head subscribe to the channel official website all that stuff Oh pinky guy forever 
g89__xEK_mw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is I said I wasn't going to do one of these videos but you know I looked at the past week and decided actually quite a few tracks would come out that are worth covering worth talking about so let's do it the best and worst wrecks of the week roundup you may have noticed 2017 upgraded the microphone Baba booyah if you want to support this segment then hit up our amazon associates link that is linked down there in the description box if you live in the US anything you buy off of Amazon we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price and again helps the segment cool cool all right let's get into these tracks they're all linked down there in the description box we're taking them the worst the tracks that were just kind of I was indifferent toward men and the best tracks of the week again like like usual let's rip off the band-aid let's get into the worst tracks that there were quite a few um this new Flaming Lips song featuring Miley Cyrus of all people they're working with her again they just keep coming back to the pain shack on their well we a family is the title of the track and not only is this another underwhelming cut from the lips because they're sort of continuing to put out these really Spacey blah be formless synthetic really Aryan atmospheric psychedelic tracks but Miley Cyrus's vocal sounds so goofy on the song it's pretty much giving me PTSD just like flashbacks from her dead pets record one of the worst albums of that year when it had dropped so didn't want to be reminded of that and and yet I was so moving on from there we had Jen's Lachman Jen's Lachman he has a new track outcome what's that perfume that you wear and it is the dance East silliest corniest song that this man has ever recorded I'm not all that excited for the new record if the rest of it sounds like this I mean I get that he's trying something a little different here and I can appreciate that but I'm not really so sure this style suits him all that well I'll just put it I'll just put it there and I'll leave it there moving on from there we have snake ships and mo mu mo about as cliche and generic is as danced me as it gets right now she's merely just plugged into this track that really could have been produced by anybody so painfully forgettable that I'm going to try to avoid this track like the plague whenever it comes up in the future moving on from there we have a new track from Dirty Projectors little bubble Dirty Projectors from the first track that had been released in promotion of this new album that they have coming out in 2017 it was pretty clear that they're taking things in an alternative R&B direction and this new track kind of confirms that too and in my opinion this new track is only slightly better than the previous one only slightly better and that that's really not saying all that much it's still one of my least favorite tracks that I've heard this week David long stress in my opinion he sounds completely goofy trying to sing in in this style trying to create this kind of music I mean not that I think that Dirty Projectors should be coming out with the same album over and over and over and over until the end of time but it seems like they're kind of ambulance-chasing a trend here I mean I get that he contributed to that new solange album and the moments on the record that I could pick up were you know sort of his melodic compositions and everything we're really cool but trying to pull this off just under the umbrella of his own band it's it's not working out too good in my opinion but this is not the worst track the week in my opinion that would go to the Dropkick Murphys the song paying my way guys it's it's time to take rock out of the pub that that's why rock is uh obviously having some problems right now it spent too long in the pub had had way too many pints and now it's just got a beer gut hanging over its pants and it's it's just not in good shape it really needs to hit the gym it really need to start eating better this song is evidence of that because it is the most cliched pub rock I've heard in a while to the point where just right away migraine headache I can't I can't take rock out of the pub rock needs to hit up an AAA meeting I guess after after he during this track just clean it clean up your act rock music get your shit together let's get into the songs that I wasn't crazy about but still definitely worth mentioning we have a new track from the band Code Orange firmly Code Orange kids of the song bleeding in the blur on this song it's not as hard in this heavy as some of the tracks that you may have heard from these guys previously this song is a bit of an alternative 90s rock throwback it's not that bad I'm hopefully going to I don't know here some more impressive cuts on their new album though something that hits a little harder something a little more memorable something that's a little more distinct or maybe they'll actually do this sound a little more justice on the deeper cuts moving on from there we have a entropica the awesome sort of collective Latin jazz Latin music band whose debut album on sound wave records was one of my favorite albums of the year that had dropped amazing Latin jazz record and they're going to be coming out with their second full-length album so I am psyched for that however this track over here not quite as fresh modern and punchy and vivid and vivid and vibrant as some of the material on the first earth truth just kind of sounded like I don't know a nice funky rhythm but with some kind of smudgy psychedelic vocals just kind of shouting over the top didn't really strike me as that memorable of a track though the groove was certainly tight seemed like there was a good performance we've good energy good chemistry going on there but there wasn't much in terms of like composition or vocals on the track that actually like won me over stuck with me or anything so I know they typically drop albums or their albums usually have a lot of musicians a lot of input comes from a lot of different places and a lot of songs so I'm hoping this is just kind of the one dud among a sea of amazing tracks on this sophomore album again it's not bad it just didn't like blow me away as much as I was hoping like an introductory track to this album would moving on from there the shins with a song named for you I actually like this song quite a bit and I've never been a shins fan although this track even though it is one of their sacks ear and fun tracks they've ever released period it just merely kind of sounds like an old of much song so it you take what you can get I guess moving on from there Kalani with the song undercover not a bad you know sort of pop R&B track the slick acoustic guitars and the beat are actually really nice really well performed really a beautiful melodies and chords coming from there the song is well produced instrumentally but Kalani still kind of fails to prove to me that she has any real salts as like a singer I mean sure she can kind of do this generic aren't contemporary R&B trapped soul sort of thing that a lot of different artists are doing but she's not really doing it in a way where it's like oh wow this is you know really striking me as memorable this is striking me as special it's just a little run-of-the-mill you know especially given that the the opening melody of the song which is one of the best melodies on the song is borrowed from another track so I don't know whatever it's it's okay it's decent it's okay and finally uh the the new Michi Darko song with production from Eric Elliott the song gotta Michi Darko may be my favorite member of Flatbush zombies because his voice is so huge so grimy there's so much presence to his voice so hearing him on a solo track I'm like hell yeah let's do that shit and then all of a sudden when I listen to this thing it's just kind of this mid middle-of-the-road a kind of low-key song of a hey I got a girl here I got a girl there I got a girl there and she does this thing and I got a girl there and I got a girl there and yet II gotta get it you kind of get the point um yeah you know I was just hoping for something a little nastier I guess something a little more exciting than what was actually presented but the song has produced really well his vocal sound pretty decent you know his flow is obviously there the song is structured well you know so can't take too much away from the track just was hoping for some fire and I did I didn't quite get it now let's move into my my best tracks of the week Secret Circle satellite featuring despots Secret Circle rap duo featuring Wicky and Antoine this is an awesome New York banger and I hope that spot drops in album this year where's album despot stop it dude stop not putting out an album and start yes putting out an album please so uh it's it's a good track a lot of chemistry between these guys and I'm glad wiki is linked up with Antoine hopefully they drop an album this year under this name because they actually work pretty well together really dark really grimy nocturnal nasty rap music but BAM moving on from their uniform killing of America one of my favorite uniform tracks thus far I mean so far they put together some pretty nice industrial and noise rock for the sacred bones label nothing that's really stopped me in my tracks with the exception of this track this is like them kind of turning a new leaf a little bit this is like some really powerful heavy hard stuff and an awesome guitar solo at the very end of the track just like really slick shit coming out of the midst of this like hellish soundscape of distorted drums and pummel I mean a distorted and pummeling drums and a roaring guitar so I'm loving this track moving on from there the song adult or the duo adult they are a Detroit based electronic music duo and they have a new album coming out this year a lot of different vocal features from a lot of different people even michael gira of swans fame is on this album this particular track features Douglas J McCarthy the song is titled they're just words and this is like a really weird left-field electronic music track I mean the beat itself is really rigid and some kooky techno shit but then the vocals on top of it are kind of this weird wild post-punk I don't know just just really eccentric it's it's difficult to put into words this is a weird song is one of the weirdest songs you're probably going to hear this month and even though it's kind of hard for me to anticipate a lot because every vocal guest is going to be different on this record if every track keeps up this kind of general oddity then it could be really interesting albums so keep a look out for this record it's coming out in March so so yeah just wanted to shout that out definitely one of the oddest and stranger songs I've heard this week moving on from there David Bowie with the song no plan don't want to talk too much about this track because going to review the new EP that it comes from David Bowie I believe is also an have an album released this year rather the Lazarus project like we're going to be celebrating David Bowie's music or some unreleased stuff posthumous early release stuff obviously this EP is also postured mistily released the but uh you know what I'm saying they want to get too deep into it don't want to talk too much about the song got to talk about the song and more with the EP review but check out this song great track from mr. David Bowie couple more the avalanches have a new track out featuring Freddie Gibbs Freddie Gibbs is back I don't know if this is newly recorded or anything like that it could have happened before that whole prison debacle over in Europe or after I'm not really sure but the song is fantastic so good I actually wish it ended up on the avalanches album that they recently had released because it sort of has that kind of psychedelic jazzy and I don't know kind of kind of muffled and uh old school kind of Stones Throw production quality at some points on it you know if you really loved Freddie Gibbs collaboration with Madeline on pinata there's a lot to like on this track but there are moments where it kind of turns into that whole sixty psych pop esthetic like many songs on the latest avalanches album do which is actually pretty nice transition so it's pretty cool to sort of hear them you know working in that dirty Stones Throw jazz rap sound with some of the more psychedelic sounds from that wildflower record and they actually pair really well and finally the last track that I want to mention is this new yucky duster song the ropes these guys continue to put out some really like class and very funny and personality-driven indie rock and pop infinity cat records has really nailed it on this one you know they sign a lot of bands a lot of them are hit or miss for me and this is definitely a hit for me from what I've heard so far really excited to give a listen to this entire album give a listen to these guys they have a funny sense of humor a lot of personality very tuneful vocals as well but the production and the guitars and the drums the performances the playing a sort of has this admirable I guess kind of a Trishna stew it that's that's really cool really fun I'm going to stop jiggling my microphone over here because that's probably not good and that is the weekly track roundup best and worst track of the week thank you for watching hope you got some good recommendations out of this thing and I hope everyone is doing well again everything down there in the description along with that Amazon Associates link hit that up too and I will see you guys in the next video forever 
avhktqd82tg,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of this new Nine Inch Nails EP not not the actual events this is a new surprise EP from Trent Reznor & Company surprised because I didn't expect it to come out I didn't expect a new EP from Nine Inch Nails and I didn't expect to like it given that Nine Inch Nails past couple of LPS have been okay though somewhat toothless and going into this EP I I wasn't really expecting too much from a one-off collection of five songs that rounds out at about 20 minutes but after hearing this thing I hope this is a direction that Trent goes in again on his next LP this EP is the Rost and wildest thing that Trent has released under the Nine Inch Nails name in a while not only is this thing like really textured and chaotic and aggressive but the production is admirably messy at points loaded with these strange little imperfections some of the vocals and guitars are oddly mixed or placed in the mix there are a lot of loose ends and abrupt edits at certain points - this is a tone that's set with the branches bones introductory track of the album which features these lightly pulsating sequence drums with this wall of wailing guitars kind of creating this very eerie atmosphere over that Trent is singing in this kind of clenched tooth thanks that he hasn't really pulled off that well since the 90s on the chorus we get these fight riffs roaring away just really tumbling at the mix and then Trent comes in screaming it feels like I've been here before don't really care anymore it seems like he's consciously referencing the fact that he's moving backwards a little bit to an older sound a more aggressive sound this thing is definitely bringing back that industrial rock sound with a vengeance but I would argue that Trent is doing it in a dirtier a slightly more experimental way this time around his first several records fantastic albums and very aggressive albums very heavy and hard-hitting albums but these records especially downward spiral are meticulously produced whereas on the CP it seems like Trent is throwing more caution to the wind a song dear world I feel like we get a sound that is more typical of Nine Inch Nails more recent releases way smoother we more synthetic moodier music though it's not a bad tune there is a certain kind of gruffness to it that I feel like runs as a thread throughout all the other songs here and the beats the sequenced beats on this track kind of have a rigid robotic funkiness to them that reminds me of LCD soundsystem strangely enough then there's the really heavy slow and monstrous track she's gone away which is the most massive track of the bunch I mean these guitars are slow they are stopping all over this mix like a giant the grooves are hypnotic the walls of guitars on this thing are noisy as hell the instrumentation builds up is tread sort of screams into this instrumental abyss that he's created here it's tortured it's dark again it's it's been a while I feel since nine inch nails has sounded this compelling when doing something this dark this full of despair the idea of you is a great change of pace it picks up the pace picks up the momentum again with the speediest beat on the entire record the track features these drum fills and and speedy guitar riffs that are militaristically tight Trent sings all over the track with these really breathy distorted vocals that there's a lot about this song that reminds me of like some pretty hate machine era Nine Inch Nails or like early marilyn manson and the song burning bright is a great piece of closure for the entire project again while it wasn't that long this feels like kind of a powerful massive ballad to bring this thing to a sort of nice concise finish uh you know I really like this EP it's it's been a while again since nine inch nails has sounded this aggressive this hard-hitting this textured this sound rich this vivid this mad as hell it feels like Trent is lighting a fire under his ass but also it feels like Nine Inch Nails as a purpose has a direction has a mission on this one you know that there's nothing wrong with the past couple of Nine Inch Nails records but the thing is in a way it kind of feels like for the most part Trent has just been kind of indulging in any artistical when the sort of flies into his head without really crafting them into a concise well groomed album and in a way it's completely fine because in the 90s Trent came out with career-defining Records changed the face of rock music I could understand if for the next decade he's like you know what I want to do some soundtrack stuff you know I just kind of want to do whatever I want to do but for whatever reason I have no idea why it seems like on this new EP this new EP of all things of all places the Kraken has been awoken again and it's like Nine Inch Nails a new feeling a light eight on this EP really enjoying it first favorite release of the year guys so I'm pretty excited 2017 s already off to a great start transition have you given this EP you listened did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're pissed okay okay all sorts of links next to my head other videos subscribe to the channel official website and have a good one guys see you in the next video forever 
_L1-ltHFmEw,hi everyone Knuth in a year tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our monthly segment the why you know review where I go over a bunch of Records that I didn't get a chance to review this past month over the past few months and sort of attacked them in a gauntlet with a series of badly shot and edited videos which originally go up on Twitter at the needle drop follow me over there it's good for you and I shoot all of these videos using this green screen over here so here we go without further ado the why you know her review hey it's more dark moody R&B yeah except this project over here tries to play a little druggie a little grimy a little weird belly is both a rapper and a singer on this thing though I don't think he does either entirely well and Consuela is easily one of the worst songs I've heard this year so I don't know what else to say just toss it onto the ever-growing pile of alternative R&B records that aren't that great can we just stop and admit to ourselves that this is this is basically hip hop's answer to bad new metal music I mean even Jonathan Davis is on this thing tec-9 once again just does not know when to stop there are 30 tracks on this thing this thing is two hours long and over the course of that run time obviously there gonna be some duds and this is maybe one of Tech's most duddy albums yet and he's just jumping all over the place so he needs these tracks raised rapping fast and he needs a club track - he's just so quantity over quality he takes that approach with his songs and with his lyrics - because the faster he raps the more weak bland cringe ly hilarious bars he drops I found it I found it I have found it everyone a major discovery got it people we found it proof that God hates us God hates us God hates us God hates us cupcake is actually a pretty unique rap artist I mean this album is odd and it is really rough around the edges and and that alone is going to turn most people off of it but her stories of sexual abuse which he personally had experienced which stands shoulder-to-shoulder on this album with some of the raunchiest songs in rap music that I've heard this decade certainly make this album a sort of interesting experience Plus that one LGBT track is a pretty intriguing to some weird hip house tracks on here her flows are kind of clunky and and awkward occasionally but she kind of has this deep raspy tone to her voice that makes her sound pretty distinct I guess I can say this is a diamond in the rough the the very rough Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha could have gotten together and created a pro-capitalist polka album with lyrics about their favorite items on the McDonald's dollar menu and it would not have sullied the memory of Rage Against the Machine quite as much as this album here does [Music] [Music] that's some good scream oh this is actually a pretty cool compilation I like it maybe even a little bit more than volume 1 of PC music for one the crop of songs here is more diverse a few my favorite singles from the labels on here like hi from Hannah diamond and the production generally is definitely not as gimmicky or as obnoxious as it was on volume 1 PC music on the whole is definitely sounding more mature and are coming through with some legit and well-crafted fusions of dance music and pop and I'm not saying PC music has lost their sense of adventure on this thing there are a few wildly experimental cuts in this compilation I like a lot still though maybe the label has lost a little bit of their quirk on this one but I think this project is pointing in a fresher in a newer in a more interesting direction I don't know I don't really get the appeal or at least it doesn't appeal to me I mean it's just kind of like another helping of suburban malaise with sort of a hip-hop twist to it now it's not awful but it's just sort of inconsistent a lot of these short intermission tracks don't really add to the album all that much the LP is already short as it is and I don't really feel like it's that distinct either I mean after listening to 16 tracks of Kevin abstracts music I feel no closer to really understanding who he is as an artist and considering how many times he changes from guitar ballads to dreary pop songs to indie hip-hop to sunshine pop I'm not even really sure if he knows and I'm just kind of indifferent toward it at the end of the day even though there are tracks like empty and miserable America that I think are true standouts and if there is a musical direction I would like to see Kevin abstract go in in the future it's it's definitely there either that or he needs to make these spoken word tracks these guitar tracks a little more compelling because they really aren't as is sure there are some points on this thing to get a little redundant but I would rather dance to this than more than half of what passes is Adm in 2016 plus those textures those sound effects on the song deus ex machina good production good touch there Joel and some of those 80 progressive since the sort of pop up here and there throughout much of this album also really nice well honestly it's it's better than warlord so that's a good thing can't deny that so he's like improved in a way you know you can take an album like this and use it to make an effective argument against freedom because how can we live in a truly great country when people are allowed to do this this thing is artsy but it's not too artsy you know there's a bit of a personal sort of struggle to some of these songs but it's not to struggling or preachy it's very mature it's very responsible I'm doing my taxes ah I know this thing is just a covers album but how did this end up being so grimy and gritty and good God for a Rolling Stones album at this point in their career really at this point in any bands career this is this is so good such raw energy coming from this thing and they they show such an immense amount of appreciation for the vibe the sound the tone of those original blues songs and recordings God Pat they just did it so right it's not a perfect album it's not an amazing album most people probably find it to be sort of dated but god damn it they did it the right way I like cakes the killaz club tracks quite a bit I think there's some of his best tracks but he just went so hard in that direction on this new project that there's not really that much variety on this thing and I think he's a really talented artist who could be doing a lot more than he is doing on this project what I liked so much about the eulogy when I first stumbled across his music is that he seems so eclectic and so left-field and was you know willing to hop on top of instrumentals that I think most rappers just wouldn't even have the technical ability to even think about touching but this new project over here just goes is so much more of a predictable direction and I'm not really digging it all that much you know if you were like me and totally skeptical of Odd Future when they originally dropped and you didn't you know really give their music all that much weight maybe it is time to kind of realism to Hajis music because he really seems to have progressed a lot over the past few years and has become an entirely different artist matured quite a bit all of that annoying brattiness of his early Hagi beats music has completely disappeared I don't think he's necessarily coming to his own or has delivered something all that distinct on this new record over here like I'm not really all that crazy about the album but I do think he is worth visiting again I do think he is worth giving another shot because again he has he has really kind of recalibrated quite a bit and this it's not all that bad this was actually a surprisingly good EP very classy very peppy it has a few revisions of songs from the Last Shadow Puppets album which actually prefer to those recordings because on the CP they play it a little less straight a little more loose wild dramatic and then after those two tracks there's a whole series of covers on this thing these guys take on a fall song which they do a really good job with really energetic really intense then they do a Leonard Cohen track on here which they do a very dramatic rendition of there's also a their take on Jaco Duke honk slick get this which is our really swanky this thing just like some quality Brit rock and has a vibe and again a looseness to it that I wish was on the Last Shadow Puppets album that they just came out with and um I'm not give it a listen I like it I've had a lot of people this year asking me what I think about this record why haven't reviewed this album and I don't really have too much to say about it I mean there's nothing really all that bad about in my opinion there's nothing really amazing about it in my opinion it just kind of sounds like some emotional alternative rock stuff that would have been popular when I was a kid that's that's really how it comes off to me at least some of the lyrics seem pretty personal and all aren't all that bad it's a you know just okay to me it's it's okay and a and a and a and oh damn Frank you did a good job on this one hey buddy proud of you man you did a great job on this album I think this is Frank jab C is the best guy yes it's good it's good ashin have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please

review forever 
7K38cdHSdMY,huh hi everyone I'm livin volcano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of Emperor's in the Nightside eclipsed famed Norwegian black metal band Emperor this is their big breakout album released in 1994 a landmark record for black metal for a handful of different reasons it is one of the records that helped evolve the genre past it's very obvious heavy metal and thrash metal influences for one bun bun bun which were still very apparent in the music of black metal originators such as Bathory and Hellhammer as well as early mayhem and venom and this LP actually arrives after some of black metals most notorious albums of the 90s like dark Thrones ablaze in hand in the sky berzins self-titled record and immortals diabolical full moon mysticism this band would actually return to a more heavy metal and melodic sound in late 90s so at this point in black metals timeline you have a lot of recordings that are very rough they're very low fi they're very noisy chaotic you're getting these brittle guitars these retched shrill growled vocals generally a lot of this it was music that was simultaneously loud and attention-grabbing but also was kind of saying get out of here get out stay away stay away often music fans who watch my show will approach me and say hey man like what's some easy black metal to get into I've heard a lot of black metal and it's just really tough and it's really noisy like you know give me like a bit of a softball over here historically black metal has not really been that inviting and welcoming of a genre it's only been until recently where a lot of American acts have taken on the sound and popularized it in North America that a lot of people have been kind of taking to it the sound is supposed to be challenging it's supposed to be discordant that's part of the reason why black metal had such an insular community throughout much of the 90s that and some of the extremist views and acts of violence that some particular artists were notorious for plus black metal just flows and grooves differently from other styles of metal it's not quite as visceral it's more dramatic and theatrical and overstated it's supposed to be the soundtrack to you freezing to death in a monstrous blizzard or falling down a pit into hell but I will say this emperor album over here for black metal albums released in the first half of the 90s this one is relatively easy to get into it's kind of accessible in comparison with other black metal recordings it's not lo-fi it's not super noisy it's not super difficult to get into the instrumentation and sort of decipher what's going on this record brings a lot of the bass elements of Norwegian black metal but just with a higher fidelity recording not only that but there are more pronounced melodies and harmonies with very symphonic keyboards being thrown into the mix there kind of working with this patch that's very frosty it's icy it's smooth it sounds like maybe a chorus of dark angels or a string section or maybe some kind of devilish organ and it really elevates the black metal guitars and drums in the mix so even though the recording here is clearer there's still a level of mystery to what Emperor is doing it's still shrouded but it's not shrouded in noise or just a rough recording it's shrouded instead in reverb which causes all the instrumentation to kind of melt together into this wall of sound which creates a pretty atmospheric experience which I think a lot of American black metal fans will get into considering how atmospheric black metal is sort of like the predominant style of North American black metal now I don't want to totally paint black metal as this one-dimensional music community or artistic style there were plenty of artists immediately right after Emperor that would go on to experiment a lot with the genre bands like Oliver and even the band amou Borger was doing similarly symphonic black metal music around the same time this was released but Emperor statement on this record I would say is particularly huge the whirlwind of sound the band presents on this record is so vivid I just get sucked right into it I'm enveloped in it it's like an eye of a tornado that is just squeezing in on me as I listen to the album more and more sort of like a boa constrictor just tightening around a little animals crumpled up body and the band is pretty consistent in this sound and in this intensity throughout the entire record they're not really kind of baiting you with pretty sounds and kind of pulling you in with maybe a few moments where there's some easy to listen to melodies or anything like that the band just kicks off just kicking your ass from the beginning of this record to the end it's a very physical recording I would say very physical for black metal and dramatic to now across this record even though there is a similar vibe on a lot of these tracks there are still highlights again I have to praise the synthesizers the keys on this record be very nimble and dynamic melodies they provide over the guitars and the drums add a lot to this record they give this very savage genre of metal music a bit of refinement and the vocals at times can kind of make my skin crawl or maybe they sound a little creepy like on the burning shadows of silence here we have a bit of a recurring theme on the record where we have these very deep ominous spoken word vocals that kind of echo out into the wall of sound that's being created by the guitars and the drums we also have into the infinity of thoughts where the singing gets absolutely animalistic especially at the five-minute mark where essentially the vocals devolve into something that doesn't even feel like in control of itself it just kind of just goes oh and I'm just amazed just how many intricacies I find in this record as I listen to it more and more and more especially in the drums because a lot of the fills that kind of carry the songs from one bar to the next our killer one thing I want to highlight a little bit more is how dramatic this record is how theatrical this record is how big its how it sounds kind of otherworldly in a way I think black metal consistently is metals most dramatic and theatrical genre the face paint the get-ups the weaponry it's all about building this fantastical dangerous violent blasphemous image it's no wonder that loads of black metal bands are heavily inspired by fantasy book series like the Lord of the Rings the highlights on this record continue like on the track cosmic keys where the song opens up with some of the heaviest and just most head smashing riffs on the entire record it's worth noting that a lot of the song structures on this record are pretty progressive as the band transitions from one moment to another across these six or a minute track lengths towards the pantheon has this nice little soft opener and then it all of a sudden explodes into this flurry of guitars and drums I feel like I'm witnessing a dark mass of some sort and during the high points of the keyboard melodies on Majesty in the night sky the guitars and the drums just sync up and go super just balls to the wall fast that's a very technical term in the bass guitar on this track sadly it's not that audible on a lot of the other songs but for whatever reason here it's weirdly dissonant and I kind of like it it adds a weird harmonic character to the track that no other song on here as the album finishes off with an incredible stunning track that is short but it is so fast it's so to the point and not only is it one of the most hellish moments on the record it's also one of the most harmonious and I think in a way pleasant to listen to especially since it has these chorus vocals sort of hanging in the wall of sound that are very clean and they sound kind of pretty but still in another breath the music does sound very devilish very ritualistic especially when you get down to the lyrics where it seems like the band is singing directly to Satan or some other kind of God and tag nest and the track opens up with these fantastically fast layered guitar harmonies that sound wonderful it's kind of hard to pick out a lot of these intricacies as you're listening to the album for your first time your second time it's that wall of sound that you've really got to kind of dig past and listen through I mean you're sucked in by it and you're you're just encased in it and that's kind of an enjoyable feeling in and of itself but beyond that there's a lot of little musical nuggets and a lot of little interesting performance nuggets especially with those drum fills especially with how the guitars lock in with the drums so tightly that are worth kind of lapping up as you kind of acclimate yourself to the very hellish soundscape that this album delivers I don't really have anything else to say about this really fantastic black metal record it's great record and I hope you check it out I hope you give it a shot and you're the best transition I hope you have a good day you're the best what's the bus the bus uh smooth nuh forever 
Wn3qNbJgRJU,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of Tom Waits Rain Dogs Tom Waits is a California singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist but the instrument he is most known for is his voice his deep smoky monstrous gravelly voice which is something that took time for him to cultivate I mean if you listen to his debut album none of the crazy very cartoony and expressive roars show up that you might catch on an album such as bone machine but if there is one thing that has remained consistent throughout Tom Waits 'iz career it's that he is singing on his records as much as he is acting if he's creating a song if he's performing a song Tom is most likely in some kind of character in the early days of his career he played a somber piano man and then eventually a stubble faced barfly who had some pretty sad stories and clever poetry but as his vocal work got Wilder his tails got taller and cd-r the characters in his stories and the characters he played in his stories got more colorful and dynamic as well just listen to the album swordfish trombones and compare that to a record like Blue Valentine now tom was sort of progressing on this kick until about this album over here Rain Dogs and not to say that he didn't continue acting in his songs and playing characters he did but this album was most definitely like an aha moment which would guide much of Tom's career afterwards the thing about Tom Waits is that he's always under construction to some degree always evolving keep in mind at the point of releasing this album over here he had already been releasing music for over ten years imagine you're 10 years into your career and you drop your most seminal album and from there on in your career only gets more fruitful with Tom Waits --is weird movie soundtrack screenplay project Frank's wild years and album Blood Money and mule variations now in 1985 with the sounds of synth pop and New Wave in full swing this album can seem kind of like an enigma or maybe an anachronism it's just out of place for the decade but even though this album seems like it's coming out of nowhere Tom Waits does have his influences which are all pretty well documented at this point for one poets and writers such as Bukowski and Jack Kerouac of course Captain Beefheart blues man Howlin wolf and rock-and-roll in general jazz music and musicians such as slow Gnaeus monk a little Frank Sinatra and he is a huge Louie Armstrong fan as well of course he is big into gospel music which is reflected hugely on numerous albums of his and Tom has always taken hints of influence away from folk stirs and storytellers orser's and Tom's music also kind of has this knack for sounding older than it really is I don't get the feeling that he's showing me something cutting-edge or new as much as he is exposing to me this shadowy world that's been there all along and you just didn't know about it because like your mom told you that you shouldn't like gogo over there now this thing is nineteen tracks and it features easily some of Tom's best best songs and creepy vocal performances and vivid lyricism the song Singapore the instrumental on this track that kicks off the album just Huff's and puffs from beginning to end with this oompah drum pattern and blurting horns so these really sour guitar leads all over the track too the instrumental is so clunky and it's so rudimentary but there's so much character to it Tom's voice over this instrumental croaks and roars and essentially tells us this tale of late night debauchery being had by a bunch of sailors that are basically on the shore of Singapore for night so they're basically spending the evening raising hell now we get a vocal change on the very next track clap hands Tom Waits is delivering to us a very raspy whisper on here and not only that but he seems to have picked up a lisp out of nowhere cat hands but that's kind of the thing with Tom Waits it's like he has a different character or person in mind for each track so as he dives into each song he changes his inflection a little bit he might change his accent a little bit depending on where he sort of sees the person he's singing as being from the percussion on this track is clunky as well but it takes a much softer approach and there's kind of this very resonant long-lasting chime in the mix that just reminds me of like a clock like a clock striking one which makes sense to me because this track just feels to me like a moonlit night loaded with some dangerous decisions but even though there is an element of danger to this track Tom also adds an element of innocence as well as he borrows very heavily from a morbid nursery rhyme he makes me out with no phonemic Tom gets even more theatrical on the song Cemetery polka with these very sour quirky synthesizers and more blurting horns and but the percussion basically sounds like just whacking on this really flat drum and some wood boxes so you're kind of getting this and the track is about all of these nasty family members that this person has I mean he's essentially related to a bunch of adulterers and cheapskates & bookies and bull it's like the worst family tree ever and all these people I guess according to this track are sort of on death's door and this isn't the only track on here where we have themes of greed and money running throughout it the song diamonds and gold to the song jockey full of bourbon is the first track that the instrumental the percussion is actually smooth like there's actually some slickness to the way the instrumentation is performed here the bass line and the hand percussion takes on a little bit of a Latin flavor mean why the Twain guitar leads very confidently playing over this instrumental sound like they could be placed very snugly into like a James Bond theme song and here once again Tom Waits borrows from a morbid Nursery Rhyme this ladybug ladybug rhyme where a part of the chorus is essentially you're saying that your house is on fire and your children are gone and the track is essentially about the chorus kind of reminding our very badly behaving protagonist here that maybe he should go home maybe there are more pressing matters going on over there but instead as the verses paint he is out at night drunk with a two-dollar gun that doesn't even shoot on the corner in the rain on the lawn with someone else's wife doing just all types of horrible one of my favorite characters and stories on this entire record comes through on the song tango til their sore and this is a track that I feel like the story is told musically as well because the piano that opens this track up it's so slow and it's got swagger to it but it's also kind of got this clumsiness to it like it's being played while drunk and this sets the foundation for a character who essentially to me sounds like a New Orleans jazz man who lyrically is giving us instructions here for his death kind of his send-off these are his death wishes this is how he wants to be treated once he has passed away this how he wants people to remember him area celebrate him and we need to send him off to bed forevermore and he settles on daisies as the flower that will be there because I guess no other flower is available and of course we have to play his theme song as well it's a really interesting track for numerous reasons I mean not only is the character and the story here really compelling and charismatic but I think it also plays into this idea that humans need to have control even once they're dead even once they've died we need to be there sort of influencing and and deciding how people remember us and how people treat our passing once we've gone away it's got kind of this whole Arius narcissism to it that I think is really entertaining this song is contrasted with the track big black Mariah which is a really low down and dirty track more rickety percussion where there's kind of this weird snare cymbal combo that sounds like a gun going off and then there's some mean blues guitar on here as well and Tom Waits vocally is alternating between this just sandpaper falsetto and monsters growl it's kind of nuts and if this track does not make you feel at least a little filthy the song Union Square later into the album definitely will a strong old-school rock-and-roll flavor to it with more banging and clanging percussion the guitar licks on this track are really slick and some of my favorite lyrics on the entire album turn up here stand out line on this on this track Sako drinking whiskey choice and I also love the similarly filthy walking Spanish which goes at an easier pace has a little more I guess composure and swagger to it but still the story at hand here is no less drenched in hard liquor the song hang your head is one of several tearjerkers on here and it's just a ballad about what else about love about being heartbroken because the person that you're interested in has found another unfortunately a piece of information that our protagonist here was given secondhand and Tom's vocal delivery on this track to me is stand out because during the verses he's way more subdued and he sings with a quiver and then once he pulls into the course he strains a little bit more hang down your head folks oh the song time returns to a very patient ballad writing style that seems much more reminiscent of Tom's earlier earlier records but it's still you know very welcomed tuned as it you know provides a little bit of variety from some of the angry aggressive clunky hard-hitting raspy mean filthy alcohol drenched disgusting songs that are littered throughout the rest of the album and the song blind love out of nowhere pulls out this jukebox country-style instrumental that actually goes over really well the one moment in the track listing here where I think the album dates itself is on the song downtown train which to me the rhythm guitars on this track are just so painfully 80s and to me the production on this song doesn't necessarily fit with the rest of the record even if you know there is a moment where Tom Waits is just pulling out a surprise country song to me the track just seems aesthetically so much more slick than every other song on here I've always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with this track I know it's one of Tom's bigger and more well-received singles and I do like the tune at the core of this track but again I just don't really care for the drums and the slick rhythm guitars on this song I'm just always going to have my reservations about this track I guess the track 9th and Hennepin is one of many strange spoken word pieces that Tom would deliver throughout his career and this one is no less engaging than all the other ones he sort of again kind of describing this very urban and odd I guess landscape where there's a donut shop and the donuts have names that sound like prostitute names he's also talking about jailhouse tattoos I guess the song is sort of a testament to the fact that Tom's voice is so great and his delivery is so compelling that he can literally just talk on a track and it will be entertaining the song gun street girl longest track on the entire record I do think it is a little overly long among many of these tracks which are pretty short and direct by comparison but I do like the instrumental flavor that this track brings it's a it's got a bit of a backwater banjo vibe to it very simple very rudimentary it's it's interesting how on this record Tom just needs so few elements to get across a good tune a great messager story a point and a good vocal performance and I think the song anywhere I lay my head just kind of ends the album off perfectly it's a great jazzy send off with these slowly swelling horns that really follow his vocal lead and he delivers a hell of a vocal performance on this track I mean just really pulling down deep anywhere I lay my head bar he's all over the place vocally on this track and again it just feels like a good send-off feels like a warm goodbye even though we've kind of gone through all of these hellish landscapes on this album through Tom's storytelling this track essentially tells us that everything's going to be all right there's always tomorrow there's always another chance there's always another day there's always an opportunity for the characters that Tom plays on these tracks to kind of clean up their acts and fly right I guess and that's rain dogs man there are so many great instrumental styles songwriting styles characters and stories on this record though they all kind of seem to have a similar string of seediness running throughout all of them Tom touches down on a lot of different sounds and I guess points of view on this project it's an incredibly diverse album that I think comes together very well and that's been a very consistent element throughout Tom's career he's never really stuck to just one musical sound or style he's always been again in ever-changing and ever-evolving artists and this album itself is kind of like hearing him evolve throughout the entire album because in comparison with much of his past material heart attack and vine and Blue Valentine and even swordfish trombones he took a lot of risks on this record risks that later down the road would just become established sounds and ideas that he would kind of safely come back to again and again and again as he released more music which is why again I refer to this album as very much an aha moment in Tom's career because there are loads of tracks on his subsequent records that you could reference back to many songs off of here but the difference between this record and swordfish trombones in my opinion is that this album not only the establishment point are not only an establishment point but super great songs throughout super great vocal performances throughout very catchy and very instantaneous - whereas I personally see swordfish trombones is a little more obtuse so great record classic record make sure you listen to it if you haven't listened to it already and you do best transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it it is a classic you should you should love it you should love it you have to like all classic albums you know that's a law right you know that's a rule right you know you'll go to jail if you don't like all the classic albums right now you know so now you won't go to jail forever
