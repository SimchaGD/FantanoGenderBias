icib8b4GYlI,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new park GEHA album communion this is the full-length debut album of South Korean composer and multi-instrumentalist Park Ji ha who is handy on reed instruments such as the piri and mouth organ but also the hammered dulcimer and also on this album respectively she also features Kim okie John Bell and Kang - kin who bring tenor sax and bass clarinet and vibraphone and percussion now going into this record originally I was intrigued by the advertised clash of genres coming together on this thing Korean traditional music and jazz and minimalism and certainly all of those influences apply to this album the issue though is just not all that consistently to the point where across this very short tracklist the record wasn't entirely sure what it wanted to be there are seven tracks on this thing and and what mix of genres you're getting really kind of depends on which track you're listening to there is the stunning and sprawling opening track where just these gorgeous Reed's skate majestically across an icy bed of vibraphone one of the truly seamless fusions of Korean traditional music and jazz accompaniment on the album the performance on this thing is transcendental and features some really great improvisation in the second half and I think the only track and the track listing that came as close to being this exciting and having this much instrumental density had to be the song All Souls Day where Park isn't playing a reed instrument but instead the hammered dulcimer along with a backdrop of similar jazz instrumentation the track is a very meditative progression but hits an incredibly chaotic conclusion with these crashing dulcimer notes and wailing reeds and kind of dissonant vibraphone it sounds like heaven crashing down on the earth and it's a total bloodbath it's it's completely worthy of the title All Souls Day now while not the nail-biters that these songs are there are some surrounding tracks that are quite decent slightly diminished in terms of genre crossover and instrumental density I enjoy the early droney Cerebral introduction to the album which I presume features the mouth organ which has an incredibly otherworldly sound it comes off almost synthetic and tambour and features these strange stuttering vibrato z' which sound like they were drummed up in like a digital audio workstation or something it just sounds like completely not of this galaxy the track in general is a great introduction and is just gorgeous mysterious and strange then there are these solo hammered dulcimer pieces in the tracklisting which admittedly underwhelmed me quite a bit the dulcimer playing is a lot more pensive than a lot of the more Reed centric tracks on the tracklist tank both tracks feature super subtle progressions and reach similarly noisy and kind of aggressive finishes the second of these two dulcimer pieces sounds heard from the moon sounds eerily similar to that of the last track which it pretty much just sounds like the same exact composition but now we're hearing sax along with it which I love the addition of that sax I think it brings so much to the composition I just wish that was the only instance in which we heard this composition in the tracklisting like dis hearing it pretty much a second time but with another instrument really add that much to the record in my opinion not really you know I think this record has a really interesting combination of of stylistic and musical ideas there are some great performances on here there's a good recording but the album just has a really odd flow and it's not that consistent there are some great ideas here I would just love to hear them fleshed out into something that is just a little bit more cohesive though I can say that a lot of tracks on here individually are fantastic I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantino forever 
z605Rm7lFTM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new push a tea album Daytona the latest album here from cocaine cowboy mr. Pusha T president of Kanye's good music formerly of clips you should know who the hell he is by now if you have it please listen - hell hath no fury in and get a grip please please you're embarrassing me Pusha T's artistic high-water marks in the 2000s are our thing of legend and even though he may have found himself a steady paycheck at Kanye's good music let's be honest push his solo efforts since breaking off from his brother in Clips so far could be better he was severely punching under his way on fear of God - my name is my name had amazing highlights amazing high points like numbers on the boards and nostalgia but was also painfully inconsistent and had a lot of lackluster tracks in the track listing - King push was pretty good but not really the splash that you expect an artist of Pusha T's magnitude to be making the thing was also titled as a prelude but what it was a prelude to I I don't know I kind of had the the feeling at the time that this was just gonna be a taster to something bigger coming around the corner but whatever that thing is it doesn't seem to have happened 2015 the year that album dropped was also the same year push was named president of good music so who knows maybe maybe that's been dominating his time which brings us to Daytona which going into it I admit I was a little skeptical the announcement of this thing pretty much felt like a surprise suddenly there was that album cover change to the Whitney Houston bathroom photo which just kind of felt like an attempt to grab headlines it may have been on the part of Kanye West but still it's just a scant 7 tracks in 21 minutes and Kanye is on the boards on every single cut which it it's it's been a while since Kanye has so thoroughly produced a project like this Kanye's beats on this thing are dark heavy luxurious their artsy and loaded with great grooves and sharp soul samples also nearly all the instrumentals on this thing segue into one another pretty effectively so it kind of makes these 7 tracks play pretty seamlessly now of course when it comes to push he's back on his a game lyrically and ex Tooting in his trademark very expressive mid-paced flow something that he's kind of grown into over the years where he just really makes you feel every word coming out of his mouth he is really one of these artists who tries to make every single bar count and puts this fear in me that makes me just pay very close attention to everything he's saying out of fear that I'll miss a double entendre or some kind of coded simile he's truly a rapper's rapper and even though this thing is just 21 minutes I would say pushes efforts here are as valuable as 60 minutes of music with how much play I'm gonna get out of this thing across the seven tracks here I would say that Pusha and and Kanye just kind of bring out the best in one another the opener if you know you know features of course these really dense drug raps sharply cut guitar samples wailing away against some delayed vocal samples and noisy effects it's psychedelic its industrial its trunk knocking features quotables that are equal parts of gritty and extravagant like the company I keep is not corporate enough child rebel soldier you ain't orphan enough the if you know you know mantra on the track is really telling as well because it essentially communicates that if you've done his dirt if you've lived his life if you've been paying attention to his trajectory you know what he's talking about because Pusha is one of those artists who truly kind of puts a bit of a veil over a lot of what he's saying and you have to kind of put in that extra effort to peel it back to get the full meaning of what he's on about next track the games we play feels incredibly raw and straightforward it's live and direct like like a freestyle over a set of really twangy guitar leads and vintage horn hits one verse after another on this thing about excess extravagance it's pretty much an ode to all things that drug money buys with the vivid verses on this track and push a tease really evocative word choice like the track just feels lawless it feels powerful it feels kind of evil then comes maybe the only real weak moment in the tracklisting hear the song hard piano which features a pretty big eye roll of a line right at the start Rick Ross's feature on this thing is just okay and even though the hook on this thing is epic I feel like the dreamy piano samples and droney scents and super faint percussion just kind of wash into each other in a really bland way just not as much push to this instrumental as I would have liked we then have the infinitely better comeback baby which has this subterranean super civil bassline very minimal drums on this thing - it's so little but it works so perfectly and transitioning from the intro and into the chorus kinda just has these really generous soul samples of George Jackson and the mighty Hannibal taking what sounds like undoctored chunks of their songs and just plopping it into this song in a way it comes off kind of low effort but I won't deny that it is catchy picking these tracks is pretty symbolic as well as both of them deal in addiction reflecting back to push a tease depicted addiction to drug dealing kind of painting this picture of a drug kingpin with a bit of a heart of gold blew through thousands we made millions cocaine soldiers once civilians ba hos Honda's took care children let my pastor build out buildings I also love that white on white tester and black on black Tesla line that was sharp that yin-yang line talking about how real one's bring balance to the game he's in was fantastic - then we have the eerily beautiful Santeria which features these weeping guitar samples ghostly backing instrumentation heavy bass a chilling hook some in Spanish and one nasty beat switch up in the last leg that sounds like just some really sinister funk it's a more forlorn moment on the album as push kind of drops in numerous lyrical references to the recent death of his road manager davon Pickett the track generally just kind of feels like him portraying more of the downsides of this life that he's led ya and pushed me lyrically on the track what would meek do push his references to meek on this track are absolutely perfect talking about having an angel and a devil on his shoulder what would he do then he's portraying himself kind of popping wheelies on the bike and telling the judge okay put it in your mouth Kanye's appearance on the track I guess I'm a little torn on it I mean is it one of his best features no not necessarily it just sort of seems like him trying to stoke more flames in this recent drama that he's been embroiled in it's kind of goofy and off-the-wall and I enjoy that characteristic about it the surrogate child line was interesting the 7 pill Nightline was interesting the beginning pulled over with a Matt a hat line was interesting also talking about how he's showing the scar so so he's he's seal yeah the song infrared is the closure of the album and has probably generated the most conversation around this record given the track is this huge Drake little Wayne Birdman disc with Pusha T saying it was written like nas but it came from Quentin which is a smart line I like Drake's response to the song too but it makes me wonder because Pusha has been throwing bars at Drake for years while this track was really good why respond now and unless what he said really kind of got to you I kind of saw push a tease attack on little Wayne is even more savage than that of Drake which of course could have motivated Drake as well but just portraying Wayne is this guy who's stuck in the industry you can't retire and he has all flash no fires pretty nasty the beat to me didn't really steal the show on this one but it didn't really need to because it really just kind of pushes lines and his viciousness and his monstrous delivery that kind of made the track and overall I mean this thing is a tight little project it's kind of an EP masquerading as an album it's it's a secret EP or maybe a mini album or something but it's so solid it's so watertight I can't really hate on any single moment of it sure the lyrical content the substantive content is nothing really new for Pusha T this is pretty much the stomping grounds he's been inhabiting for years now and quite honestly a record that was longer but consistently of this quality would have made for a better listen but still you just kind of have one great lyrical banger after another just very good writing very good flows very good delivery very good production and I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that upworthy link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantino forever

weekly track Road rope first I have to mention our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there in the description box if you head over on that turntable a blink get yourself a colorful vinyl pressing of maybe an album I reviewed on the channel we get kickback from it and let's get into the worst tracks of the week other way all right first oh Jesus Christ this this new collaborative underworld and Iggy Pop track don't have a lot of background on this cut because I don't want a lot of background on this cut because I I dislike it that much it's sort of like underworlds usual hard pulsating very I guess cold and futuristic electronics thumping away underneath Iggy Pop doing what sounds like just a bunch of random diatribes that are kind of cringy about a myriad of other things a lot of the themes running through it sort of sort of speak to like this this good old days mentality like oh we used to be able to smoke on their plane you know it's when I rethink the glory days of the past one thing that I just really truly missed we used to smoke cigarettes on the airplane that's that that's truly what was great about the past it's truly truly what was great cancer yeah it's a pretty awful track let's move on from there uh this new ghost song it's it's so disappointing Danse Macabre but yeah the last goat single rats was pretty underwhelming but I feel like the album could have been redeemed the band's forthcoming album could have been redeemed with another great single like it would have given me something to anticipate but this song just sounds like an awful hair metal ballad but with it kind of that creepy ghost vibe but not really it's it's sort of there but it's in a diminished capacity it's it's just a bad hair metal power ballad yeah quite quite really one of the worst tracks they've ever put out so I'm just gonna move on to the next one Drake I'm upset dude just drop that fired up II freestyle um sorry about that with the black Peter the Black Keys popping up prematurely their premature shout-out to the Black Eyed Peas though Drake I'm upset he just dropped that fire duppy freestyle and then I feel like he owns himself by dropping this trash you know Drake is nothing if not consistent dude has amazing high water marks in his career some great high level stuff but he just can't seem to deliver that consistently like if he cut his output down to a third but every album is fucking fire like there would be no question that he's legend status but even though he is incredibly influential even though he has really kind of changed the game in a lot of ways the few other artists have or ever will I feel like continually his legacy is going to be dogged by the fact that he was just inconsistent I mean thankfully time usually heals most wounds and we're most likely going to remember the best of Drake rather than the worst of Drake I don't really think anybody's gonna think back to a track like I'm upset where he's essentially like sipping and getting all emotional over like this relationship type situation really not one of his best tracks and in this vein but yeah even his uh his cadence his flow on this track is really tedious and repetitive and on top of it just his lyrics just seem really bitter and indignant and whiny and overall it's just like a really gross track just no no vibes come from this on at all okay yeah Black Eyed Peas ring the alarm part one two and three God listen to the song watch the video it is so fucking political man it's so revolutionary so revolutionary dawg the black eyed peas is a really fucking woke right now this song folks fuck this is the woke a shit I've ever heard like you guys were at your relevancy peak the worst years of the Bush administration the worst years of the Bush administration war in Iraq Patriot Act torture all that shit the worst years of the Bush administration and you were putting out my humps and let's get it started okay those were your singles okay those were your artistic statements during the Bush years okay I don't want to hear you all of a sudden get political because his fucking Trump okay obviously he's like one of the worst fucking things to happen to this country but as as we were on the downturn as we were going in that direction y'all were saying shit okay y'all are saying shit look let's just let's just get that clear okay so now all of a sudden whoa whoa ring the alarm ringing the alarm was like before war on terror let's invade this country that country the other country and this that and the third y'all are like hey guys let's get it started i'ma beat i'ma beat I know that came out a little bit later but still I'm just busting balls here yeah this track is corny III have nothing for this track and it's just ridiculous that black-eyed peas are coming back and they're all sudden guys guys it's you know it's it's just too important of a time socially for us not to be releasing music and for our music now not to be addressing really important political issues in a very vague way yeah this is this is like Mick woke you know it's it's not it's not very deep it's not very interesting it's it's Mick woke I'm moving on from there let's get into the tracks I thought were men not amazing not terrible but certain certainly worth mentioning a big bank yg 2 Chainz Big Sean Nicki Minaj all in the same song and it really could not be a bigger snoozer yeah it's just okay productions super bland I mean I love a YG's last record you know I like a 2 Chainz feature Big Sean can be good on a feature if he's clever and if he's funny and generally I generally I don't mind a Nicki Minaj feature either but but the thing is like nobody on this track is really a powerhouse in my opinion nobodies are really kind of carrying the song nobody's really truly the anchor of the song and as a result it just kind of feels like slop just feels like slop they're just not really any strong direction to it just kind of feels like each artist on here is just taking like a little bit of a piss-take so whatever moving on from their new Tyler the Creator for 35 freestyle Tyler's getting real fucking cocky ever since it came out with flower boy okay it's it's a very good album alright it's a very good okay it's it's very good record but it's not ill Matic okay it's it's not Illmatic let's let's let's try to make the next record a 10 out of 10 and and and then just keep flexing you know then flex but for right now you know flower boys great it's great it's very good okay but uh you know let's let's let's let's just get into the next album mode or something you know let's make that next record uh a real true blue unequivocal classic some tea pad level shit okay and then we'll be talking alright moving on from there I'm breaking balls I'm moving out from their sleep has a new Adult Swim single out leagues beneath 17-minute cut from sleep the sound of it isn't that much better than a lot of the stuff that was on their new album you know you can kind of take it as like a lengthy single type track like their clarity a single song that has a very wonderful astronaut edging on it by the way if you pick up the vinyl you know it's decent you know it's it's a sleep song just sort of sounds like an average cut of there's you know sort of seems like they're kind of going back a little bit to what's typically expected of them resting on their laurels you know I really admired on their latest record how they kind of cut things down we're a bit more straightforward with it and we're a bit more ferocious with some of the guitar work kind of changing up and the vocals a little bit this one just felt kind of average for sleep but still you know they don't have that much material so a 17 minute sleep song is is still a momentous occasion so moving out from their Death Grips flies another death-grip single and and yet again I feel kind of underwhelmed in one sense I feel like this is one of their more experimental cuts with the kind of bustling very frantic and difficult to decipher rhythms which are very sporadic and strange emcee rides performance on the chorus is very nutsy and animalistic and there's almost something kind of like raw and slightly low Phi about the production of the track that reminds me a little bit of like money store era Death Grips but I don't know the descending sort of cycling arpeggios that combined with some rides vocals as well as the very messy transition into the hook and vice-versa to me just kind of makes the song feel like a a bit blobby and not really that exciting you know still loved black paint and in I do like the fact this song seems kind of experimental for them but not one of their better Tunes not some of their best writing and I just find the instrumental just a little a little obnoxious and not necessarily in like a super abrasive or experimental or super way out their way you know just kind of seems like a little tedious with that chord progression but I'm going to leave it at that moving on from there let's get into the best tracks of the week the songs I really enjoyed really loves definitely want to highlight for you guys vein another vein song this band is kind of a really killer up-and-coming metalcore and mathcore outfit with some really crazy guitar work on this cut super aggressive vocals you know if you love that early botched stuff love that early converge stuff early Dillinger Escape plan's stuff you're really gonna like what this band is bringing to the table I think it remains to be seen once I hear the entire album what it is exactly is is going to separate themselves from a lot of those groups who clearly influenced them but I really do think that they're putting together some good stuff and the two singles so far I've just been fucking killer so moving on from there tricot has a couple of new tracks out new music video that we're linking you to down below the track pota jour pottage this outfit is a Far East math rock band with very pretty and I don't know I guess just a lovely lead vocals great grooves quality layered instrumentation not your usual generic American emo infused math rock that you typically catch over here this is while it is very melodic I would say there's a lot of instrumental muscle that I like quite a bit and it's not just needless soulless noodling it's actually quite tasteful and very very thoughtfully put together moving on from there are and are equals now is this sort of new jazz supergroup that you should most definitely check out you know if you're into terrorist martin christian scott is involved with this thing who else off the top of my head it's I'm having a bit of a brain fart here but check it out check out the personnel list this particular track over here and also I want to mention that they have a few songs out so far new album on the way this year and this new track over here resting warrior is this lovely like 10-minute Spacey almost kind of psychedelic very funky jam that's really invigorating very relaxing and pretty cerebral too and if that other name comes back to me I will most definitely say it hold on a second I'm gonna I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it Robert Glasper I think is also an involved with this project as well which again you know it's it's that's that's a pretty good um that's pretty good roster for you know a new group of kind of a this this new wave of jabs artists who are kind of infusing elements of hip-hop and pop into jazz music so you know respect to that hold on a second let me get into the next one over here next track next track next track oh this new cut from the Oh C's God is it fiery it's noisy it's abrasive it's heavy it's a actually quite devilish and certainly traumatizing in a way it's so nasty even though it's not like a like some kind of extreme heavy epic metal song it kind of matches the front cover over here quite perfectly the song is titled overthrown and it's man it's it's one of the nastier songs I've ever heard the group put together again it's not a metal song but there is something like really sinister and devilish about it even though they say pretty firmly in that whole garage psych punk lo-fi realm definitely an interesting a sound that they are hitting upon with this new cut over here let's move on from there next one oh this names James James Blake track don't miss it I don't know if any of you guys saw but he had kind of a negative reaction to some of the coverage of this song because I guess some people are calling you sad boy and I don't mean to laugh because I guess he thought that tag that was problematic I didn't quite look into his comments on that but he thought that tag was quite problematic I mean I wouldn't say the song is any sadder than usual for James Blake not the saddest I've ever heard from him to me it kind of feels a little bit in line with his last major single which I loved as I do enjoy this one as well where it feels like he's kind of fusing those elements of piano ballad jury that we have come to know him for since he's kind of blown up onto the music scene and fusing it really effectively with you know elements of electronic music some really strange electronic edits that I find add a lot of texture and add a lot of personality and add a lot of beauty to the track so you know the ballot itself seems really solid James singing is great the piano chords are very rich and tasteful and moody and all those extra edits are just kind of the cherry on top so really kind of diggin it moving on from there Drake's duppy freestyle I've already kind of praised it earlier on in the video I think Drake Vicious takes down Pusha T on this song I'm gonna be coming out of the video soon on the Fantana channel explaining all my thoughts on a lot of the bars on that track and basically my hopes going forward for this Pusha T and Drake beef so please do be on the lookout for that and subscribe the needle drop com slash Fantana the needle drop comm slash Fantana but all around I think Drake kind of clears the air a little bit around the Quinton Miller thing I think he tears Pusha T a new one with some pretty solid bars calling out the hypocrisy on the Kanye thing clarifying the Quinton Miller thing basically making fun of his waning relevance and so on and so forth so I think I think he's got some nasty bars on this one you know were they written by somebody else you know maybe possibly not gonna deny that that's a possibility but still yeah I feel like he kind of came at him pretty nasty so I mean that excuse me and that's gonna be the weekly track roundup alright again usually you guys know the drill but just to remind you all the songs that we talked about in this video are linked down there in the description box check them out down there again along with our link to the forthcoming tour because we have tickets and everything on sales so get them get them get them get them get them get them get them get them get them you're the best love you love you love you Anthony Fantino weekly track roundup [Music] 
cFanGXSGDWA,
HMIUSLOR350,Oh Panera theny brevet Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled Mark kozilek album this is the latest full-length album from the singer-songwriter Mark kozilek the mastermind of I guess his own solo efforts the red house painters as well as Sun Kil moon and artist whose work I've covered on this channel numerous times an artist who had an incredibly prolific 20:17 as well dropping a Sun Kil moon record multiple collaborative albums keep in mind that Sun Kil moon record common is light in love our red valleys of blood was kind of a two-hour opus if 2017 marked anything for mark it was this trend toward artistic indulgence which for me led to some incredible highs and a few head-scratching lows it feels kind of weird to think that just four years ago mark was delivering this perfected balance of balladry and storytelling on one of his biggest and most critically acclaimed records to date Benjy which is probably a sound he could have stuck with for quite a while but instead mark decided to change decided to evolve and in that process begin to hone in on one of the most singularly peculiar characteristics of his songwriting and of course I'm talking about the incredibly detailed wordy and dense lyrics that mark typically works into his tracks with a series of fourth wall breaks and narrative detours and internal monologues mark seemed to strike upon a uniquely meta brand of songwriting through albums like comedies light and universal themes and his collaborative his first collaborative album with yaesu and his new self-titled LP over here seems to be the next phase in that evolution featuring mark recording songs on mobile recording gear in one hotel after another armed with nothing but his voice and acoustic or electric guitar which leads to a very intimate low-key subtly lo-fi recording which will most likely land the hardest with mark's hardcore fans and and maybe not amount to much for those who don't really see much in the cult of personality of his records or don't really see the point to his end diatribe songwriting style maybe it's not as much songwriting as it is song rambling now I personally enjoy what mark is doing on this record but I feel like part of the reason for that is is that have been riding with him for a little while now I mean I haven't been crazy about everything mark has been doing over the past few years but listening to this record kind of feels like cracking open the seventh installment of a very dense ongoing mystery book series and while this self-titled albums 90-minute run is shorter than that of common as light it still feels like more of a challenge to listen to and not in a particularly bad way just more in an artistic aesthetic way because right up front the songs here are not particularly catchy the instrumentation given that it's mostly just guitar and voice played at a very low volume because mark was trying to keep - you know the the requirement of being at a low volume in a hotel room so again instrumentation is pretty light on the ears not really super gripping or punchy or bright or aggressive the gentle and repetitive guitar phrasing along with Mark's very mumbly and forlorn voice is kind of a an ambient effect after a while and as far as the narratives on this album go they really are more meta and rambley and tangential than ever now if you've been listening to Mark's a recent output the lyrical themes on this record should be nothing new his music movies he likes and movie references aging mortality tragedies and mass shootings legendary sports figures musicians who he admires or food or weird personal interactions but despite my familiarity with Mark's stories at this point and his inability to ever filter himself I still think on this album he has quite a lot of interesting things to sing and say whether it's on the mark kozilek museum which is one of the most autobiographical and I think introspective tracks he's ever dropped so far it's a song sung over these very twinkly and meditative electric guitar arpeggios and with like a lot of cuts on here you have a lot of shifts in the chord progression or sounds like maybe even the key to something major or minor depending on the mood or the darkness or the levity of a particular lyrical passage singing about finding a location for this made-up Museum singing about being younger trying to get a start in the music business and people kind of patronizing him like yeah sure mark you're gonna make a yeah sure you're gonna be a famous singer describing his love of aerial pink and a music festival saying that if they had started in the 70s Arial would be David Bowie famous and he would be Neil Young famous saying that you could say a lot of things about both of them but you could never really call them boring and immediately after that mark breaks into this refrain of repeating the word diarrhea over and over again which is not just random it's a referral back to a moment where he talks about how the Porta Potty is at the festival smelled Marc even goes as far as to narrate his own guitar solo and and talk about what inspired it that was just a supremely surreal moment for me on the album like the lengths at which Mark will go to basically tell a story about anything the song my love for you is undying is another one of the longest tracks on this album surpassing ten minutes and actually is has quickly become one of my favorite mark kozilek songs to date if not only for its really weary hypnotic guitar leads that are cut into both the left and right channels and there are a lot of things that mark says on this song a couple of stories but really the highlight for me in this track is in the last leg where he kind of details this interaction that he had with this girl which was pretty negative and very weird at what he described as like a smelly old liberal vegan bookstore at one point in the story he even cracks up which I mean it is a really funny story it's kind of hard to imagine how he kept up the forlorn vocal delivery for so long while singing it live in Chicago might be one of the more difficult tracks to swallow for some fans because it's just so internal it's just so obsessed with minor details and just this really slow hyper descriptive diary like writing style but I still love the devoted descriptions that mark gives in this track in the lead up to a performance that he had in Chicago talking about his dry cough the food that he's getting calling his girlfriend and shadowboxing thoughts of the recent Las Vegas shooting and Tom Petty passing kind of inhabiting his mind inspiring particular tributes during that night show the instrumental is strangely sharp in pitchy features some very odd guitar phrasing but I feel like the track is almost relaxed or brought to a bit of an equilibrium by the very soft bum bum ba ba background vocals that mark provides throughout much of the song the opener to this record this is my town has its themes rooted pretty deeply in origins mark singing about how this is his town and all the things that make it his town and the other great people that came from his town Mart also singing about how this well you're hearing is his sound on this particular track the instrumental features these really hypnotic and plucky harmonic guitar leads on the surface it sounds very light and simplistic but it's layered in a really beautiful in a kind of complex way sometimes I don't feel like I'm listening to a song or a composition as much as I'm listening to sound bed for mark to kind of platform himself on top of and tell these stories much in the same way I kind of felt about that recent Alan Vega album it except that's like an experimental like synth punky noise album and and this is so much more ambient by comparison but even though they're very aesthetically different I feel like both artists make some similar compositional choices in order to create the the instrumental spaces in which they say their piece I also love the really surreal and sublime weed-whacker which features this really warm and welcoming and slightly twangy guitar phrasing it's an odd track where mark is narrating about him and his actions but as if he is outside of himself he's referring to himself in the third person but it's pretty clear that all the sections of this track kind of add up in such a way where it's portraying mark in a particular headspace or a particular mood where he doesn't seem very focused on his art on his song craft not really being dogged by his own sense of celebrity he's just a guy who is buying property he's a guy who's weed-whacking doing like lawn maintenance going to a coffee shop just having a random interaction with a random guy but then he's hit with like oh what's the sound of this music who's this guy rapping on the stereo and the guy says oh you know that Sun Kil moon we're listening to it on Spotify Spotify kind of being this album's Panera Bread as it is the the one major cultural force that for whatever reason on this album is is name-dropped and repeated multiple times generally I just like the portrait that the song paints of mark just of this guy who is on the cusp of retiring and is just completely outside of this world of live performances and I'm writing this song and I'm hanging out with this musician and I'm thinking about this thing that just happened in the news the twangy dark and eerie electric guitars that inhabit the song sublime kinda remind me a really old-school modest mouse there's also a superlight snare drum on the track which is a as subtle as it is a giant change of pace to have some legit percussion on the song now the narrative on this track that was easily one of the most rambley on the entire record but that's something that mark acknowledges really in the midst of the track with him essentially acknowledging that he ran out of words in the midst of writing the track adding to that that's how I work I don't stick around with nothing long now I got a borrow a line from Tupac to keep things moving along he said we don't have the motherfucking luxury to spend this much motherfucking time on this one motherfucking song which could be a part of his usual artistic process but also I think that could be inspired by the fact that he was writing and recording under weird circumstances with limited instrumentation in these hotel rooms so maybe he was kind of giving himself a limitation there to finish these tracks within a certain amount of time but again given how rambley this track is I do think the last leg of this particular cut is is noticeably weaker than a lot of the songs that have come so far and that's the thing as this album plods along like after the middle point I can kind of feel that even though marks words are pretty rambly that there was at least a kind of a sense of what exactly he was going for even if it was a little vague on tracks like this on tracks like good nostalgia seems so much less apparent nostalgia being a track that I really owe the aesthetic of this song has a guitar tone and sound that's incredibly reverb II haunting strange unlike that of any other cut on the record but the lyrics and the tune and the structure itself just doesn't really leave much of an impression on me even with it being one of the shorter and one of the more brief tracks on the record you'd figure with a more condensed runtime it would be a bit punchier because the longer tracks as long as they have more focus they actually have more impact nostalgia though just kind of felt like Marc was flipping through a series of surreal David Lynch esque dream states which is even more so the case on 666 posts but maybe to the point where it actually kind of makes the song pretty unique the guitar sound a little bit darker Marc singing is much more unsteady and sped up and tense and just feels very anxious he goes into very intimate detail of kind of waking up in spaces maybe after a performance or something and not knowing where he is not knowing what he has to do feeling jet-lagged not really feeling attached or connected to any one place because he's constantly going he's constantly moving going into details with particular dreams that he's having while he's out and about and also making like he's really weird mouth noises of some of the things that are either around him or in his dreams like cable cars and pets now the final moments of the record is where I think things really start to go south a little bit the banjo song for me is one of the most obnoxiously meta on the entire album yes even with moments on here where Marc is singing about hey am i singing or am i talking what do you think about these words I'm singing this right now I'm thinking this right now in a way I feel like he's kind of not just breaking down the fourth wall but busting through it like the kool-aid man as he's singing about this being his banjo song but it doesn't have a banjo on it and the guitar on it is a Yamaha I mean as much as I enjoy some of the diatribes in this track about buffalo wings and one of Marc's friends getting a really awful stomach bug it's at this point where the lack of cohesion among the the various passages lyrical passages in these tracks really kind of unravels the potential appeal of them though my least favorite track on the album has to be young Riddick Bowe and not necessarily for any narrative elements of the cut really more of the sound of the song kind of irks me the heavily layered and somewhat aggressive nylon string guitars combined with Marc's very strained and somewhat yell P vocals for the entirety of the track they just really kind of wear on me after a little while especially since Marc's singing or talking or whatever you want to call it on this song has very little in the way of rhythm or rhyme or meter it just literally sounds like he's rambling as much as he can over this very unpleasant guitar instrumental I love that mark sort of over packs his songs with particularly Racal details but I can't even really say that I find the lyrics on this song really gripping here it literally just feels like what he's saying is just really unkempt like there just wasn't as much direction the writing process of this song as much as there was in previous tracks even with using boxing figure young Riddick Bowe is a bit of an anchor to start with and come back to later in the song the closer on this record is decent starts off with some very heartfelt and wonderful guitar chords that are actually pretty striking ones that I wish carried throughout much of the track but really only last for the first leg mark says some pretty compelling stuff about his father potentially passing away missing him his girlfriend his relationship with her he closes the words of the album talking about how the album is over you know again staying incredibly meta but the stuttering guitar arpeggiated entually transition and very quickly after these guitar chords that I absolutely love kind of pack much of the rest of the track out and I don't know just kind of sound like these stuttering guitar riff had used that you would find on any number of tracks prior to this one I guess instrumentally I wish that mark took things in a bit of a dip direction and just did more to prevent redundancy on this album because as specific as this brand of songwriting is to mark toward the end I kind of feel like he was stretching the appeal of it a little thin still though I do think this is a relatively solid record an interesting singer-songwriter release although maybe not one I would recommend right away to somebody who isn't familiar with marks past work but if you're up for the challenge and you want to hear something that's kind of ambient really wordy super thought-provoking incredibly personal painfully intimate then I recommend that you try this album out I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

m1EiUEIdMr4,let's go let's go this is reckless the latest album from Toronto rapper and singer and also producer nav someone who's been having a pretty big past couple of years with his debut album landing on the weekends EXO label he also had a follow up record last year a collaborative effort with a none other than Metro boomin and now he's just staying on that prolific progression with this latest project over here reckless with NAB's last album I I didn't even really give it a big formal review because it just seemed like the most tedious generic off-brand lifeless personality devoid R&B pop rap auto croon record of the year and even though I felt like this album was severely lacking in terms of anything that would make it interesting to listen to I kind of chalked up some of its issues to hey maybe nav is just kind of starting out here and it's gonna take him a little bit to get his footing find his niche find his sound I mean in this more melodic more cloudy more moody brand of rap and R&B I didn't necessarily expect that to be the case because it seems like a lot of artists benefit from just being as generic and is washed out as possible in this trend but surely nav going forward would have to try to drum up something in the way of personality on the next record right no absolutely no that's not what happens here at all in fact I feel like this album is even more sanitary and unless even less human than his last album I can't even describe it I feel like this record I feel like this album comes out of a simulation if I took a hundred records that sound just like this and fed them into a computer and then said computer making album is exactly like this I feel like NAB's reckless would be the record that pops out that would be the CD it burns and comes out of the tray everything about this record sounds so inhuman and robotic I can't tell what exactly it is about his voice maybe it's the way that he repeats his flows so flatly and so tediously every single bar with very little in the way of any changes in emotional delivery or inflection it just sounds like the way a robot would rap never veering out of one single delivery always delivering things the same exact way showing no alterations and speech patterns whatsoever yeah I just don't feel like I'm hearing the voice of a human being after a while it just gets really really numbing to the mind I don't know this this album just really makes me afraid it makes me afraid that the cyborgs are now living amongst us and they're landing record contracts and before you know it they're just gonna they're just gonna be dominating every aspect of our lives and I don't want to give this impression that his voice sounds the way it does just because the auto-tune makes it sound a little digital certainly it kind of lends credibility to that but it's really that his voice just kind of sounds like the equivalency of having a very expressionless look on your face gorilla I'm calling your house cuz I'm poppin my life will never be the same but I'm scared I'm never gonna change I've been going down the wrong path and I'm ignoring the signs I'm having trouble organizing the thoughts in my mind and it's not just his voice it's not just his delivery it's not just the auto-tune all of which pretty much remains the same across the entirety of this project to the point where it all just kind of blends together into this endless disgusting deja vu but also it's Navs lyrics and his word choice that I think contributes to this feeling that I have that this album is somehow computer-generated because I feel like if you took the entirety of all the pop rap lyrics of 2017 and punched them into some kind of algorithm for sure you could come together with verses like this the rhyme schemes on this thing are so basic it's hard to listen to I could sell tags to a shirt asking me if you got tickets for sure I don't know for sure you just got hit with the curve I didn't know that girl is yours she said she don't got a boyfriend but sure I grabbed her ass and she called me a perv what look I'm not trying to run your rap career or anything but bragging about unconsenting women's asses in 2018 is is profit it's probably not a not a very good look not going to get too far in the entertainment industry with that one I grabbed her ass so she called me a perv open her legs so I had to insert make my own beats and I write my own words you know I was just so amazed by the the the content of what was delivered on this song I was like this this cannot this cannot be the the this this cannot be conceived by one man surely it's a God telling him to say these things surely it's it's Zeus himself producing these beats yeah I mean it's I mean damn that that production it's it's fire I mean the piano chords is simply the clap the rattling hi-hats the kick drum I mean I mean who would have thought of that oh I'm slapping myself because I don't want to talk about this anymore but I feel like there's still more to say the pain the pain believe me when I say that everything that's absolutely awful about a single track on this record pretty much runs throughout nearly every track on this record I feel like some of the artists featured on this thing like quavo and little Uzi vert and Travis Scott are almost conscious of how mediocre this project is gonna be so they do their best to try to just blend in with it so they don't stand out so that when they do pop up it doesn't actually grab your attention like what what what's Travis doing on this so yeah while the vocals the singing the lyrics the production it's it's consistently bland so bland it should really be an insult to anybody who chooses to listen to this record but also I feel like there are moments here lyrically that are a bit of a personal embarrassment for him or at least they should be like the song just happened I mean pretty much every bar on this thing reads to me is like very sad bitter boyfriend like you're super successful now from what you say and whatever this person or whoever this person is that you used to be with you should pretty much be over whatever you had together by now but instead you're just kind of going on and on like I just wanna hear you say you miss me I know it hurts you every time you diss me when I'm up you're the one I'm always hitting when I lost you I feel like I lost my kid bees like I lost my kidneys the demise of our relationship has resulted in me going to regular dialysis treatments there are moments here on the song where it seems like he's trying to make it clear to this person that he's that he's putting in the effort to get them back but then simultaneously it seems like he's saying things to kind of get this person pissed to him to make them think that he doesn't want them back it just seems like he doesn't know what he wants but what do you want what is the purpose for this song what are you trying to convey what are you trying to say why are we here what are we doing what is life what is love baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more bitch after bitch got a sickness I'm sick I know your man isn't  I got his car on my wrist don't give any of these girls a kiss most likely I hit it and quit you the only one that I miss I know often there's a conversation about how rap lyrics are really kind of devolved into utter trash these days but more often than not I feel like that change in that progression has occurred in order to emphasize other ideas other artistic choices other aesthetics hey maybe a certain artist delivery is a bit more amplified and excited or aggressive so their lyrics are a bit more simplistic to kind of give the song a sense of bluntness directness or maybe a particular artist is just trying to convey something that's really catchy and straightforward trying to put together a bit of an earworm or be funny or just be really in your face or just be something something at all convey something the simplicity of NAB's lyrics don't seem to come by way of some sort of emotion or idea or concept or hey let's be really experimental or minimal it just seems like things on this record are simple because he's simple there's just not really much on this album that strikes me as having a whole lot of forethought to it also aren't records that are typically this Spacey and dark and cloudy and auto-tuned and slowed-down that these blends of trap rap and R&B aren't they supposed to be particularly moody or sad or depressed or dark or something I mean not that those emotions have to be conveyed but I just feel like in place of that nav really kind of vaise very little in the way of any emotion at all I wouldn't say this album is particularly moody I wouldn't say it's particularly upbeat I wouldn't really say it's particularly anything that's kind of the thing with this record it's it's scary in a way because I feel like I'm listening deeply into a hollow abyss really truly the void of something it's like the auto crooned equivalent of a black hole I feel like I'm listening to music but it's like almost every aspect of this album is trying as hard as it can to not stand out in any way shape or form it's almost like it wants to disappear into the background desperately absolutely nothing about this album commands attention or respect unfortunately for a good part of this decade a lot of albums in this style have been trending toward a more generic sound more homogenized sound and I feel like now we finally reach peak homogenous Asian in these Moody trap R&B blends this is it you can't get more generic than this in this particular genre this is the peak I can't envision from here unless nav next comes out with a triple album someone conceiving of a more cliched sound in this particular trend so this should be absolutely and if being generic is a competition nav has won first place gold medal I'm sorry I know you want every girl in Toronto totally in love with you but you're just gonna have to find another way to rip off the weekend okay yeah this is the snap album it's not good position have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like Lee subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well

4ZZREmYnygU,hi everyone yes that a yes Tanna here the Internet's most chicken the microphone is honored and it's time for a review of the new parquet courts album wide awake this is the latest full-length album from Brooklyn rock band parquet courts who have been steadily dropping album after album EP after EP since 2011 sliding back and forth and every one of their tracklist effortlessly from indie rock to art Punk to post-punk and garage rock and experimental rock and despite a pretty strong devotion to a handful of rock subgenres I've had varying and strong reactions to pretty much every record parky quartz has put out so far of course though I am on the edge of my seat looking forward to their latest over here especially since their last album human performance I think is easily one of their best the closest the band has come thus far I think to releasing a truly fantastic record I also loved the incredibly smart and groovy teasers to this new album over here like wide awake and had to start a fight the band somehow even won over Ellen doing a performance of the song wide awake on her daytime television show which I guess is kind of crazy and it's just great to see that parquet courts peak of relevancy is coinciding with what I think is their best album and for a myriad of reasons the performances on this thing are exciting tight intense and lively the production is really organic and vibrant the record comes off sounding like an in-the-moment studio session but has enough bells and whistles and interesting touches of effects and overdubs to keep the sound interesting and deep thirdly I think it can be argued that this is parquet courts best crop of songs yet versus our great choruses pop and across the length of the entire album there is an extreme lyrical focus on socio-political issues which I mean it's 2018 who isn't getting political in the age of Trump but there's actually a lot of smart commentary on this album about wealth disparity and violence the normalization of our increasingly toxic political climate and some of the lyrics here go beyond the slogan ear and you typically get out of pop songs that try to go political and actually delve into political philosophy like on the opening track total football where you will hear the band shouting that collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive which I mean because it's not you can bargain for your own rights as a collective while maintaining your personal freedom the follow up line to that is incredibly sharp and also the the Tom Brady at the end is a very nice touch you know because of the whole Total Football theme Illustrated earlier in the track it's a very interesting intro these are not points of view that are typically addressed in punk songs even in bands where some of the members have bachelor's degrees and the fourth thing I'll say about this record is that across the tracklist it has an incredible flow it's pretty much one well worded art punk rager after another with seamless transitions and tastefully executed cool down moments and I mean it's just highlight after highlight after highlight the song violence features markedly improved drumming and bass right from the get-go which if there's one huge improvement on this record from any parquet courts album previous it's that man like the percussion the grooves those bass lines they're spectacular the instrumental on this cut sounds like a really solid piece of 70s instrumental rock with a strong funk influence and some very serious and bright organs popping in which pull off a kind of psychedelic solo in the last leg of the song and even though there is that big funk rock influence on this track there are some very jagged noisy abrasive guitars and shouty lead vocals which lead that sound lead that style into a very Punk conclusion I love the lyrics on this track just kind of going in depth about the societal numbness that we feel toward the violence the increasing violence that we're kind of finding ourselves in the midst of I mean I feel like this song is incredibly apt in the wake of what just happened in Santa Fe or whatever happened at the latest school shooting at the time of you watching this video because let's face it our politicians are literally doing nothing about this problem the song before the water gets too high is a great transition out of this track much more dejected nowhere near as intense it really contrasts the previous song by feeling so futile and defeated I love the nimble bassline the relaxed but very crisp drums the cheap Casio chords and the chilling lyrics are all about things getting so bad that it may get to a point where it affects the rich does it need to get to that point almost had to start a fight is an incredible two parter with super-tight syncopated guitars drums and vocals and these opening words kind of being stuttered or repeated at the start of each line really kind of adding to the the tension of the track I mean the song is literally about what it's kind of titled after and the there's a sense of real panic in the song as a result of that it feels like being forced in the midst of a fight-or-flight decision the song transitions out of these intense and syncopated guitar passages into something a little bit more laid-back but then you're catching lyrics about being in a brutal invention or a chaos dimension I also love the transition into the second leg of the track in and out of patience which is an intense driving rock tune with very fun very catchy guitar leads and ascending vocals it really kind of calls back to bands like the modern lovers we get another great transition into the song free bird too which is another more introspective moment in the midst of all of this political unrest on the album with I believe Andrew savage singing over some kind of quirky and a little tongue-in-cheek classic rock ish organ chords about growing older and kind of waxing poetic about his past and slowly kind of growing into his own point of view identity the song normalization is as aggressive as it is chilling I think it's in a similar conceptual vein to the song violence earlier in the tracklist but much more bombastic and in-your-face there's a weird psychedelic funk breakdown in the midst of the song - the song feels a bit more abstract and big picture from a lyrical standpoint as well then we have the title track which is supremely funky in a way reminds me of what I loved so much about LCD soundsystem in the mid-2000s it's just really eccentric thoughtful punky dance music whose lyrics kind of state the album's mo of I guess being wide awake being aware kind of keeping up this pace of awareness it's kind of like the post-punk equivalent of being woke the song death will bring change helps bring the album closer to its finish and is an incredibly haunting moment on the album kind of takes a bit of an old-school psyche Rock tone it's it's a little doors ish features some very dramatic dreary guitar chord strummed in a in a very loose way enhanced by these eerie children choruses singing death will bring essentially predicting things will alter as this new generation comes into adulthood and replaces the old guard the band ends things on a somewhat lighter note on the track tenderness with these carefree rhythm guitars a kind of jaunty saloon piano the lyrics again kind of pushing toward these themes for change in the future which I mean if you read into the first verse of this track it's it's actually really poetic beautifully so and I think it's a moment on the album where the band and and even me myself for a long time now have kind of come to terms with the fact that unfortunately political change and societal change rarely comes as a result of just kind of flipping people's minds and ideas right then and there usually it comes with generations of people over time kind of learning from their mistakes and kind of replacing the older people and then enacting the societal norms and standards they now want to enact as according to how they perceive the world so that is certainly part of it but again the song is also making a deep reference to tenderness which it is titled after with the band kind of crossing their fingers artistically for maybe more tenderness around the corner in the world's future with the songs closing lines referring to tenderness itself almost as a drug something that the band's lead singer needs a fix of there were a few spots on the record that lulled for me just a little bit I thought the vocal performance on the track back to earth was a little too awkward I loved the chord progression I loved the slow pacing I loved how dramatic and melodic the track was I don't know if it was a vocal range thing or a tempo thing but just the singing on it just felt a little fumbling and Mardi Gras beads even though I do like the tune of that track quite a bit the reverb on there really washes it out just a bit too much which is one of the things that I like generally about the other songs on here that they're so dry that they're so tangible that you really feel a lot of the instrumentation but outside of that I mean this record is so great and on point the songs the recording the performances the playing is noticeably better than that of any Park a course record so far this record is certainly more lyrically intriguing than a lot of the Bands previous records as well and I feel like they did a great job of making some interesting artistic statements on some very very very difficult topics I'm feeling a light to decent 9:00 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a

GkeHYp7MASY,hi everyone choppin each opt-in oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Courtney Barnett album tell me how you really feel this is the latest album from Australian indie and garage rocker from singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett whose breakout album in 2015 was turning heads across the music underground sometimes I sit and think and sometimes I just sit which is probably about as fun to watch as it was to listen to at least for me anyway with this record Courtney went over a lot of listeners with her Frank lyricism her diary like narratives her mildly rough rock instrumentation but to my ears most of the record just came off really plain and on the ambitious and mundane it just seemed like a cult of personality record that you wouldn't really be able to appreciate unless you really loved the personality losing out of the album now it's been a few years since the release of that record and believe it or not I'm still curious as to where Courtney is going artistically because she's still a relatively new face she still has a lot of room to progress and grow there's no telling what direction she's going to head in I enjoyed quite a few tracks from her collaborative record with Kurt Vile last year and I dug some of the lead up tracks to this new album over here as well like the track city looks pretty which is a driving groovy garage rock tune with sweet harmonized guitar leads some noisy effects and heavy themes of isolation coming out of the lyrics this track in comparison with a lot of Courtney's earlier work is much brighter and more dense from an instrumental standpoint and Courtney is coming off just a bit more compelling as a vocalist like the singing has just a tad bit more conviction just slightly more emotionally captivating as well as the song nameless faceless which to me read as like an ode to not only the gender divide but also this feeling of paranoia one might get when walking in the park at night alone obviously with Barnett taking a strong female perspective on this one and delivering gritty details like holding her keys between her fingers so she can kind of use them as a weapon I also love the kind of carefree jangly guitar chords on the verse that really kind of contrasts with the narrative of the song itself and the wild descending guitar chords and leads that kind of enos added the hook that really kind of bring that strong feeling of paranoia and anxiety generally across this record that they're just improvements improvements improvements Courtney's songwriting this time around seems more defined more structured the lyrics on this thing are much less rambley which you can kind of tell just given the fact that the songs generally on this record are much shorter than their predecessor not a single track here spans past five minutes it seems like Kourtney is focusing more on kind of organizing your thoughts and getting to the point nothing on the record really overstays its welcome even if that prevents Courtney from expounding on a theme that maybe needed some more attention like on the feminist rager on this record I'm not your mother which kind of clocks in at a very brief one minute 50 seconds but still the instrumentals on this record easily are more detailed it seems like there's more of an emphasis on just kind of making the hooks on this thing pop and flourish and blossom easily this record is more tuneful than its predecessor the song need a little time is a prime example of that the song about love on the rocks and separation and it's kind of a jangly sad pop rock tune reminiscent of like 90's radio rock for whatever reason I'm like getting a real strong Counting Crows vibe off this track but with a grungy or edge in a more depressing mood the production and performance is on this thing are pretty good they hit a nice momentum and sound relatively organic lyrically it seems like Kourtney is focusing more on specific topics within a given track than she was prior whether she's beating herself up and questioning her own intelligence on the track crippling self-doubt or trying to build her and her audience up on the track help yourself still despite all the praise that I can give this album I still feel like generally this is a very dime-a-dozen indie rock record with a lot of very soso vocal performances and despite trying to dive more deeply into her own melancholy there's just very little that shows up in the lyrics in terms of nuance and detail to me Courtney's music still comes off pretty humdrum and even though in some respects this is a more personal record than her previous one it still feels like she's keeping listeners at arm's length and there's a real lack of intimacy coming out of the songs and the lyrics it just seems like there's not a whole lot at stake on a lot of tracts and even though there are flashes in the pan and bright spots I do think there is a lot to be desired vocally on this record in terms of conviction because a lot of these tracks do still kind of fall flat emotionally narrative lis everything in Courtney's music seems to have gone a little bit brighter and a little bit more complex except for Kourtney herself in fact there are some moments on this record where I actually think she drowns in the slightly more aggressive drums and guitars a bit so again while there have been some very nice changes made to Kourtney sound since her last full-length album I feel like the alterations that have been brought to the table here have only brought her music so far I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

h9SlF00t-is,"[Music] hey everyone Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and this is another edition of the most inconsistent music podcast on the Internet the needle drop podcast but we are doing our due diligence here and sticking to our well-loved annual segment the worst rappers in the game usually we go over every year a list that you guys pretty much put together I crowdsource this list asking you what are the worst rappers in the game right now in the game currently you tell me your your opinions you you list them all out I pick the most suggested rappers and I go over them with my dude II respect here how you doing man I'm good I'm good do you respect is a fellow youtuber music critic culture commentator who makes very good comment on fuck who makes it very who makes very good content over on his YouTube channel which we will link you to down below in the description box thanks for coming on again man thanks for thanks for making the time for me I know you're super busy you're just you're just you're you're just fucking you know really hitting the slums over here hanging out with me it's always it's always a pleasure we do need to clarify that this is crowdsource because there's always two to three people that you and I would definitely never throw into the list so we're gonna we're gonna argue against that so okay you know even though there are rappers on here that it's it's not our it's not our decisions here you know we're gonna argue against that so obviously we're going over this list saying hey these rappers around here because you guys have decided that these rappers are awful but you know if we disagree with whether or not these rappers are awful enough to make this kind of a list the the worst rappers working right now currently we're gonna we're gonna argue against that we're gonna get confrontational okay we're gonna we're gonna rationalize and and let's let's kick it off with with a real heavy hitter in in the world of of hip-hop music right now miss mr. little pump mmm-hmm so little pomp generally opinions opinions of his music opinions of the whole South Florida SoundCloud set yeah little pomp to me he he catches a lot of flack obviously with his comments that he has for another particular rapper that we'll get to on the list but III think he catches a lot because I think little pomp hits all of the the caricature sort of like the points that you have to hit you've got to hit the hair you've got to hit the the gold chains you got to hit the the fake money in the video like in the Escada video he hits all of the you know it's kinda kind of reminds me of what people felt like Trinidad James was because people thought for a period of time when print a turn at that James came out with all gold everything they felt like he was doing some form of like satire I don't know if Trinidad James is actually doing that if he's that intelligent to do something like that but I doubt it but I feel that little pump is really that's really coming through in his music it's really coming through in his videos and I actually think that little pump has a lot of technical ability so I wouldn't even droop him up with the term that's becoming a little outmoded the you know the mumble rap term it's it's getting a little old and I don't think it applies for a little pub necessarily yeah I think the mumble rap thing is is really more of a I guess a mini genre or sub-genre rather than just a literal description of of what a rapper may be doing I mean certainly there are rappers out there who kind of don't rap that well they slur their speech a little bit and of course maybe there's like some extra effects or auto-tune on their voice which really kind of add to this very I guess mumble e sound or mumble e delivery but little pumps words that they're actually pretty clear a lot of the time so I mean he's not literally mumbling but I sort of see what you're saying like he does sort of check all of these boxes for the type of rapper who doesn't really elicit the kind of respect that like a most def does for example you know he doesn't seem [Music] very well-read I I guess like it doesn't seem like he he pays much attention to the harbor grant especially yes for a Harvard grad disappoint it's it's a little disappointing a full disheartening for a Harvard grad to sort of be as ignorant of the world around him as little pomp seems to be on the outset however I mean he seems to be making the kinds of business decisions that somebody in his position should I think there's probably even if he's not the smartest guy in the room I think he's paying someone near him to be the smartest guy in the room maybe he's paying maybe that person is uh getting something over on him monetarily at the end of the day we don't really know but um he does sort of seem to check a lot of boxes where yeah sure he doesn't have a whole lot to his lyrics in terms of substance or meaning but there's also just how ridiculous ridiculously he dresses how he handles himself and you know III think he's definitely an example of which there are at least a few on this list of rappers now who do you think people hate little pump for his music more than they hate him for how he looks or just how they think he acts because I think it's Howie I don't think the way he acts is really I mean he's sort of dismissive with everything on every topic every time you see little pump he just throws in a scat ad blanket over everything whether it's you know getting dissed by somebody or just being caught by TMZ out somewhere I don't think it's anything that he has to say he's not he's not violent he doesn't portray some image that I think is necessarily damaging to the youth um but it's it's the look and it's it's also the fact that little pump is just he's younger than all of the counterparts that I think an older hip-hop fan would group him up with like little Aziz in his early 20s even somebody like ugly God is 21 and I know there's not a big separation in age but in this day and age there's for whatever reason there's a big difference between a 17 year old and a 22 year old you know your old nigger if you're 22 but its he's so young and he just yeah I just feel like he represents something like the irreverence of just everything I don't think he does anything wrong other than the fact that you know it has little pomp ever made any statements about an old did he join that group did he join the likes a little Zen I don't remember you get you got all these guys confused after a while did he say anything crazy I mean I know he did a little shot at Jay Cole who you know we're going to be talking about later but I don't really think he's paid much attention to like old heads or old or hip-hop or anything like that but I feel like with a lot of these people who hate on an artist like little pomp it's almost like that reaction to two guys like him is almost built in to the dislike for him because they just sort of assume with the lack of reverence for that era of hip-hop that pours through in his music that he probably you know hates Biggie and Tupac anyway you know what I mean so now I feel like it's there's almost like that generational prejudice like across the board being labeled sort of being applied to a lot of these new up-and-coming rappers regardless of whether or not they have a legit quote or an interview out where they're just like yeah this this rapper sucks for that rapper sucks or whatever yeah yeah and I think they'd be wrong they'd be wrong to assume that he's not equipped with at least the basic tools of having clarity on a song because he's definitely equipped with he's sure he shows it I mean I I may not be a fan of the beat choices and whatever melodic shit he's trying to do but but they'd be wrong to assume that he's just the absolute bottom of that whole group no I mean me personally I like a lot of little pumps music I mean I constantly get shit on or at least I did for a bulk of last year it's kind of dwindled off a little bit this year and has got a it's it's kind of been replaced with some other records that I've given positive review twos positive reviews to that uh people are mad about but um yeah I got a lot of shit last year for just enjoying his self-titled mixtape and you know I just love his energy like you said he's not really that mumbly he's pretty clear on a track he could put together a super catchy hook and on top of it I just kind of like his turn up tune out vibe I mean obviously that's not the way somebody I think she couldn't themselves in the world 24/7 obviously if you do that you're just a fucking moron but the thing is like for entertainment value like it can make for a good song can make for a great track can make for a fun mixtape and and people are sort of like reacting to him so negatively as if there hasn't been any rappers out there recently you have this very same message or that there hasn't been like a ton of pop music or rock music that has come out in the past that pretty much has the same exact ethos it's it's like we're just constantly getting like I don't know it's it's like the older generation matures and they forget about all that like crappy turn up music from from their youth and then when the new generation does it in a totally different way it's like oh my god I can't believe it what is this non lyrical dumbing down music you know and it's like come on man like every generation has had like turn up music every generation has had it like it never sounds the same it always sounds different but the thing is I feel like that's part of the reason that the the previous generation reacts to us so negatively it's like oh well it sounds bad this time because now the sound is different but the thing is like to your parents your turn up music sounded like shit you know so I feel like it's just kind of the natural order of things and and I feel like little pomp is is is hated more for what people think he is or just sort of you know see that he is just by the way that he conducts himself as opposed to like the music that he actually makes I mean I could sort of understand if you're not the type of person who listens to super poppy super lowest-common-denominator super straightforward super blunt you know type of music you like something with a little more nuance a little more depth generally across the board I get that I understand that you know if you're the type of person who hates a little pomp but you also would never listen to a soldier boy or you also would never listen to I don't know like what's another example off the top of your head it listen to Soulja Boy if you would listen to young thug yeah like you would never listen to a young thug either like I get it I understand but uh you if you think little pumps singularly is like somehow like the worst of the worst of the worst when it comes to this trend the sound the style this ethos this idea I don't know I just think you're I just think you're sorely mistaken I I don't think he's like the one of the worst rappers out there right now because I think as far as like instrumental choice in terms of song structure in terms of just basically the the the baseline necessities for what would make a catchy and a listenable song yeah I think you could do much worse I think you do way worse than little pump I think the name also has a large thing to do with the - I mean the name is a brand it's a brand all together it's a franchise and that doesn't help that doesn't help with the overall just introduction to the artist the fuck is this another little like that's that that's all it takes not even the music at all or the look it's just the name itself can just it triggers people it definitely does trigger people no it does and he's the only little on the list by the way mm oh yeah that's that's true he is the only little on the list I think he's that I think he's the biggest little right now is there bigger little no there's not a bigger I mean this guy this guy got a parody on on SNL I mean you know they that is true him and me goes yeah yeah yeah so he's the biggest he's the biggest side of the single littles he was the biggest little he's at the top of the he's at the top of the little chain right now all right let's move on to the next suggestion that was here on that list unless you feel like you have anything else really to say about little pompidou's me about little pump no nothing else to share as she got a she's got a scanner next let's talk about playboy cardi somebody who I reviewed positively recently and I I did get kind of a mixed reaction from that like there were a lot of people who were sort of like uh what like it that building up to the release of my review were like oh man Anthony Fantana is going to give it a not good Anthony I could feel the red flannel coming oh my god oh my god and then like after the review actually dropped of course there were a lot of negative reactions to that but simultaneously a lot of people were just like completely erupting into a frenzy who just assumed I was gonna hate it because I wasn't that crazy about his Last Tape there was even this kid who like sent me a screenshot of his group chat with his friends and his friend had said like something like thank God the voice of black culture game play a gay playboy kardea 7 like what so I mean I'll come in with yeah apparently so I'll come in with my opinion which some people listening may already be aware of because of my review for a diol it came out pretty recently but trying out keep playboy cardi's music you know I'm sure you've heard Magnolia I'm sure you tried out some stuff from the new record like what are your impressions of him generally is he a rapper who you think deserves to be sort of like on the the current worst and hip hop type yes yes I do oh right I think because accompanied with the I've never been a fan of the the minimal the minimal sort of instrument instrumentations I've never been a big fan of that even though I do like I I do like Magnolia just like everyone else did but that along with someone that I would define as a mumble rapper and still doesn't really have much clarity in words and doesn't put a lot of emphasis in it with those things together I would put him in the category of somebody who's deserving to be on the list now I didn't now I didn't listen to dye lid I didn't listen to dial it I've just listened to singles a playboy cardi that's all I've been able to get ahold of I didn't listen to dial it but I saw that you did give it a 7 which which was a surprise and I'm glad that you spoke you spoke for everyone but I would say that he's a part of the he should be a part of the list because of that reason because it's just not a lot of effort ya know I would I would agree as far as like the technical aspects with which we would judge a good rapper versus a bad rapper I would say technically I do think he probably would would deserve to be on you know like a list like this because you know let's let's just look at it from the standpoint of you know just his double excel freshman cipher and sort of freestyle performances you know what I mean like which were just absolutely awkward and stretchy and annoying and just like totally useless you know the thing is I played wake Artie I I think he only really kind of works in a particular kind of context you know what I mean like to me ing a lot of some of his singles and I enjoyed a lot of die lit but is he somebody who like if I see him featured on the song am I like dying to hear it like oh man this has got a play Blake Hardy feature I got to hear this shit like not really like him I really like sitting there with my mouth watering thinking that playboy card he's about to like come on and fucking kill it like fucking kill this beat oh man he's totally gonna fucking steal the show on this song no I mean that's like not really his thing that's not really a shtick that's not really his style put him in a put him in a room with a battle rapper he'd be fucking eaten alive you know what I mean so there are so few contexts in which I think playboy kardi as an artist actually works and really that's that's on his own music and I wasn't really all that router impressed with a lot of his older material outside of Magnolia either but I feel like on this new record he kind of honed and and distilled I guess a lot of those elements are sort of isolated rather those elements that made Magnolia so good and that is just more minimal instrumentation where psychedelic effects more hypnotic repetitions so that the the tape kind of has an overall very druggie kind of very intoxicating feel to it in a lot of ways it's entirely different technically and stylistically but in a way it kind of took me back to ASAP Rocky's big breakout debut tape which if you also remember like people were tearing apart because it's not that lyrical he's not that lyrical dude can't freestyle for shit unless he's from New York and that might have even worse absolutely makes it even worse in the case of playboy cardi I feel like a lot of those same I guess shortcomings also come into play but in a way they're even worse but simultaneously I feel like dial it is even more psychedelic than the ASAP Rocky's newest record I just feel like a lot of the album is is all about just like pure bliss and euphoria and I like that about it but the the thing is like only part of the appeal of that comes down to playboy cardi's rapping I feel like a lot of it has to do with just the sound of his voice some of the weird vocalizations he makes again the effects the production so again would I ever want to listen to playboy car do you like completely outside of the context of an instrumental no probably not but but I I do feel like it doesn't need to be mentioned I do feel like he does make good songs I do feel like he does appear on on interesting minimal somewhat experimental and kind of trippy rap tunes and and and I like that about it I like that clearly clearly even though he's not much of a rapper he's making a conscious decision to make this type of sound in this type of music because there aren't a whole lot of rappers out there who I think sound exactly like him you could argue that he's run off of a lot of trendier sounds out there and certainly he is but I think that he is doing a very specific thing within this sort of very kind of low-key hypnotic auto crew knee type trap stuff okay let me ask you questions so okay so within so we're putting him in his proper context if obviously his music is it's it's very it's very druggie it's very the word that always gets thrown around with this kind of sounds like the vibe oh yeah I like this yeah um how well let me ask you a personal question are you do you do any sort of recreation you know any any sort of drugs at all do you drink anything no I can't say I can't say I do and I've given you know vaguely I guess positive reviews to some artists and and also negative reviews as well who also it seems like the the the whole point of their music is jazz strike up some kind of vibe I think Rae sremmurd does that though obviously they're a little bit more lyrical if you could use that word than playboy cardi I think futures music also exists pretty much solely for that purpose although I've never been really as crazy about futures voice in his delivery as I have sort of a playboy cardi is doing here okay well I mean I I would I would think that being that the music has that sound you see because I - even when I was say 25 for example and whatever music I if I guess when I was 25 I'm not sure if I can pinpoint what this music is derived from if I could if I could vaguely point in a certain direction I mean I would probably have to point at something a little Wayne would be something that this would really have been generated from and when it came to music that was psychedelic I just never liked the I just never liked the trance that it's supposed to put you in and it supposed to sort of hold you into some like like some dumb down sort of malleable version of yourself and it just to me it just never spoke to me and what so when I hear music like this it just gives me sort of like this feeling of there's an attempt to there's an attempt to put kids in a certain mood there's an attempt to there's an attempt to make kids more I'm not sure if I'm if I'm getting to anything help me out here just make them just all the senses or just sort of just dull the senses so much to the point that like how much of a vibe are we really discussing how much of a rivalry really discussing that the music puts you in a better play boy cardi record puts you and I and and and this can be said about several of the artists that we're gonna discuss it could be said about several bottom-end and for example um you know after the passing of a little peep you know I went in and I listened to little peas little peeps tape and I just couldn't help it but I don't know who would it be enjoying this music other than somebody who is constantly in an induced coma of just of just just lean or whatever the fuck it is that they do and I I would just I belongs on this list because and it doesn't have to be thought to all the music that you listen to I understand that that doesn't have to be thought to it it doesn't have to be thought-provoking or everything but there's just a certain level there's just a certain level of of being awake for something that I think that's required that that I think he belongs to be on this list yeah again I mean for what we traditionally know to be a rapper and sort of the requirements that one would need to the the the boxes one would need to check to sort of be like an impressive talented rapper you know I think I think playboy kardi Falls monstrously short so you know I if somebody put playboy kardi on their worst rappers list I wouldn't necessarily just outright disagree but as I guess sort of an aesthetic curator you know if we call bleep playboy cardi that I I enjoy his music and and I can think of you know rock songs or psychedelic rock songs or psychedelic metal songs that are really in a lot of ways even more repetitious than what playboy Carr Diaz has presented here you know let's say let's say sleeps dope smoker which is this like long hour-long sort of stoner metal track with very little in the way of like sort of alterations to the sound or the riffs across the entirety of the song also you know Earth's Earth - which is like a legit drone metal album where they just literally crank the the amplifiers up and there's kind of like meditatively Jam on these single like heavy very slow riffs to sort of create this psychedelic effect and and and I've loved those records I've loved those bands and you know I don't want to say play Bacardi is like you know some kind of amazingly deep innovator who's sort of like making music that that is so beyond of course that you know but because like let's say for example you could also argue that like um there there are quite a few psychedelic tracks on a quim and I you know or Shabazz Palaces black up is really psychedelic that's an incredibly psychedelic album but also it's much more interestingly produced it's much more lyrical so making music that's psychedelic doesn't necessarily mean it has to be dumbed down it doesn't mean you know there are obviously shades to this you could make really highbrow interesting experimental cutting-edge psychedelic music I think playboy kardea is merely taking a lot of these more trap and more simplistic pop rap sounds that are just current right now and kind of bring them a bit of a psychedelic tinge which which I think just really works works for him and just works in general you know will it work five or six years from now when this trend is gone and it's totally obliterated and basically whatever we're listening to now has been replaced by a new wave of something else it'll probably make less sense yeah it's I mean it's always an adjustment there's always an adjustment period for this for this kind of music because because all of them the music that I loved so much was just all about that affirmation it was just it was just all about the it was all about the the the your you're sort of like head nodding to the song and you kept that a certain pace that that this that this music just doesn't do for me that it doesn't do and of course you had music back then that was you know the production was more psychedelic and I don't think the intent was was totally there because these people weren't because they weren't promoting that but if the sound sort of lent itself to that then I think that makes it more and it was non forced whereas if if your intent is to is to talk about it and make it sound like it then it's like you're specifically trying to I'm trying to put you in a vibe I'm trying to put you in this you know sort of this drug induced coma but I mean of course but the PlayBook Rd he's not gonna you know he's not winning appeal it sir of anytime soon all right let's let's talk about the king of New York next one one mr. Takashi six nine who I mean you you have to love the day 69 mixtape right I mean mixtape of the year best thing you've ever heard in your entire life I enjoyed it more than I thought I would really okay yeah definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would it's you know it's um it's it's a shame that uh you know the antics that he that he pulls off which is you know it's gotten him a lot of attention but there's there's quality here there's definitely quality here um I think I think six nine a lot of his songs do sound the same but at least what you could say is it's his own particular sound you know maybe with exception of Gotti which which you know doesn't sound anything like his other singles but all other three or four the Gummo the Billy they all sound alike but it's his particular sound and it's it's it's what we love here in the city it's just nonsensical gun music that that's all it I mean there are certainly a few other rappers out there who I could name who have a singular sound kind of like he does but it's also very exciting it's a very aggressive it's screamed it's you know a hyper violent and certainly he's he's not alone in this trend but he definitely has kind of a certain aesthetic in in this style in this wave and another thing I'll say is I think that a lot of his earlier singles were a lot more kind of weird and out there and a little edgier and a little bit more almost like new metal style um in a way whereas like these days I feel like he's kind of toned that down a little bit and has gone into a bit more of a predictable you know kind of turning the rock influences down a little bit on his latest stuff now me personally I probably would put him on this list I just find him obnoxious and just from a musical standpoint I mean there are a few tracks here and there like I could probably take six nine pretty easily in small doses but um but just like in general what I want to would I want to listen to him like when I hear 6-9 feature do I get excited know what I want to hear 6-9 off of a beat no absolutely not most of the time I barely want to hear him on a beat and it's gotten to the point where you know maybe some of his earlier singles were kind of thrilling and exciting for me but even when I hear a new single today it just sort of sounds like the same shit man it just sort of sounds like he's kind of just stuck himself in absolutely absolutely and I don't know it's it's just really like a huge turnoff for me just the same delivery same instrumental style and I just feel like he doesn't really have a whole lot in the tool belt to sort of push himself going forward I mean youyou obviously dig his music a little bit more than me do you think he has a future in the next two or three years no he doesn't have a future in music and I think he's very aware of that I think he's aware that he's not gonna last in which is why he has to why he has to pull all these stunts to get more attention to himself I think he I think he figures if it's not broke I'm not gonna fix it I'm I'm just gonna keep on because otherwise I can't keep bragging about how many number one you know singles I have and streaming and all this shit I I can keep creating the same music and and the only thing that I'll say to his credit is is like I said it's every sound sounds the same but there's so many artists right now that sound exactly alike but they sound like ten other people but there's nobody who sounds exactly like six nine and just like just screaming over a track like that not that I never expected myself to be a fan of that and and as a matter of fact I think I'm harder on most artists because I'm from New York and I'm just a fucking I'm a snob so I'm harder on New York artists more than anything so I'm I'm very surprised that with the antics that he pulls he still makes music that I actually enjoy you know his songs are relatively sure it's just it's in and out I mean Billy sounds just like one big chorus that that's what it sounds like so you know that may be a tactic with streaming and all that shit but but I think he knows he doesn't have a future I don't see and I don't see that Avenue I think with artists these days newer up-and-coming artists who sort of get by doing what a guy like Takashi does when your fans are mostly just super hype on your singles I feel like that almost thanks to streaming has become just a new business model you know what I mean like there isn't as much pressure when you're a single centric artist to put out that many songs that sound all that different it sort of just seems to make sense to make sure that every song kind of sounds the same because Takashi had I mean how many years did he have where he was kind of popping and he had lots of viral singles but he didn't have had an album or a tape out yet you know what I mean so it's almost like just dropping singles can almost just again be a business model now let me ask you one more thing about Takashi before we move on I mean certainly when we were growing up there were instances of you know rappers getting into all kinds of antics or shenanigans or saying some wild shit or dressing eccentrically or you know you have backstories like oh you know how many times in fifty Cent gets shot so on and so forth to kind of build interest in the artists outside of their music you know what I mean but these days it sort of seems like doing ridiculous shit to get attention has almost reached a saturation point do you feel like it's worse than it used to be better than it used to be do you feel like the internet and social media has something to do with it or is it just pretty much the same as it's always been and it just seems like maybe it's worse because we're getting exposed to it more because there are so many rappers out there there's so many social media accounts are so many Instagram videos yeah yeah I think it's I think it's the same as it as it always was but obviously now it's a bit different because I think it just it makes the artist lazier if an artist can reach 500,000 people with a short 14 second clip of them just doing some random I mean so many Instagram so many Instagram comedians are using that as a way to get into music because I think in their eyes the content is the same making a song I'll be able to reach these many people if I put out an Instagram video I can do this in 14 seconds I can each so much of you and I could just do something stupid that'll be shared but what happens is the music suffers because of it the the music suffers because why should I have to put any effort into my music when I can get your attention through this and then I can just use the music as a platform and I'm out in three to four years because I got a reality show or you know I have some other business ventures that I got into and I don't really need rap so it's I lose the the creativity I think back then you you know you had people like 50 that were obviously doing things just to get attention and just you know just to get negative press but 50 still had to put his boots on the ground he still had to put in the work and that's not the case anymore yeah well also on top of it and not that she's on this list she's not but um you know I think cardi B is also proof that surprising by the way very surprising surprising by the way well she's somebody who clearly started out in the whole social media thing got into music but then stuck in music or at least you know for now I mean maybe five years down the road she'll who know she'll go into acting or something daytime TV show oh my god oh yes yeah I would DVR every fucking episode I'm gonna say get the fuck out of here you would actually watch maybe the first episode well I you know I would watch if it kicked Ellen off the air okay I would watch regardless but I would watch every episode of a kicked Ellen off the yeah not you know I don't have any personal hatred toward Ellen I'm just joking but as soon as I saw the yodeling kid I just said how many days until until he's on Ellen I think it's like well you know I would be more thoroughly entertained by cardi B interacting with the yodeling yet that I would by Ellen interacting with the yodeling kids so even if cardi B replaced Ellen just did basically the same shit still I would I would I would stand cardi B so much harder but uh but you know at the end of the day I mean I I agree with a lot of what your you're saying and I feel like with the Internet until you get to a point where you're as famous as cardi B it sort of makes sense to if you're a content creator to any sort to have as many irons in the fire as possible so if you have two million Instagram followers and all you do is just make dumb stupid viral videos it totally makes sense especially since it's easy than ever to just fucking grab some dude who will produce for you for little to no money of which there are actually lots of great and decent producers on the internet right now and just be like hey you know produce a song for me and I'll just like rap over and that'll just be my single I mean you have legit major label artists who are paying some of these fucking guys like nothing to produce beats so it's like you know what kind of expectations are sort of glass ceilings are we talking about people who have Instagram comedy accounts facing when it comes to releasing music and getting a viral hit none nothing I mean I think Jake Paul pretty much proved that with you know with having a number-one song you know and yeah and I want to say that that that doesn't always translate I think if if if you're gonna be the I'm not sure if you're familiar with bunk or Fat Boy asse yeah I'm yeah it doesn't it doesn't really translate because I mean he went viral for all the stuff that he was doing and then he put out music and it just hasn't resonated at all so that's where I think there should be some credit given to the quality of the music I don't think it's I don't think it's fair to just say you just get loads of attention and then you funnel out a song and you put it for streaming that it automatically blows up it has to there has to be something unique about it and that's the credit that I can at least give Takashi in this case that it just simply breaks down to there's a different inflict inflection in his voice there's an anger to it it's not it's not really emo it's not depressing he's found a niche within this generation where you know like like we've been saying they'll be grouped up together because of the aesthetic the way they look but there's something that he's doing I think musically that's working with people it's just not all it's not all bullshit a hundred percent I mean I I agree the music does have to sound good to the audience at the end of the day but I will say do but as we assume that yeah no no I I just think that um it's it's not necessarily a stupid thing I think it just comes down mostly to a marketability thing like like Jake paul and cardi B are obviously going to be much marketable than a Takashi 6:9 who is obviously going to be much more marketable than like a book like he's obviously you know even though Takashi has lots of skeletons in his closet we're talking about a guy who by comparison seems much more volatile and out of control and probably has like you know Takashi has been at the music thing for a while you know what I mean like he's not somebody who sure there were pictures of him that went viral because he like looks ridiculous but he's always been somebody who has kind of been focusing on his music thing you know not somebody who just kind of like merely happened into it you know what I mean mm-hmm so let's move on to the next one over here which I'm gonna get into a bad baby right now because we weren't just kind of talking about social media stars and people kind of going viral and then getting into music which I mean I think that baby aka that catch me outside girl is exactly that Danielle burr goalie she's a prime example of that and she's somebody who seems to be seeing just a whole lot of success right now just for the fact that she has become this ridiculously popular and and gawked at and hated but simultaneously admired social media star off that whole dr. Phil thing and and now has entered the music game and even without dropping too much in the way of a track or a single has received an incredible amount of legitimacy just right off the board just because I guess people are magnetized by her personality and her reputation I mean it all kind of in a way starts with the endorsement in the Kodak black music video that she appeared in and then we're talking about her getting signed to Atlantic Records I mean how many rappers out there kind of toiling on Soundcloud and have incredibly viral tracks here and there but are not sort of getting you know assured in by the Atlantic Records set with a large record contract so right out of the gate she has an incredible amount of legitimacy before even really having lifted a finger and the first few tracks literally because she's probably not really absolutely and the first few track she's come out with like actually sound kind of good now is that because I think they're a mark of like great hip-hop or anything like that no not necessarily it's it's the other yeah yeah the the thing is is that the bar has been so lowered that she's living up to the expectations of what a rapper in 2018 needs to live up to you know she's pretty much checking all the box she's doing everything that she needs to do so I don't know as it may seem like she's completely illegitimate and shouldn't you know even be a discussion in the hip-hop conversation to me it sort of seems odd to sort of throw her into the bad rapper Bank because well I mean as far as standards today go she's she's she's doing what she needs to do mm-hmm yeah Gucci flip is is a record that I've heard the record three you know for three or four years I've listened to the same exact record you know with yadi on it and it's it's exactly like you said there's there's there's no there's nothing really to discuss here it's the only thing that I think worth mentioning is is that she's had the benefit of at least having some attention taken away from her from the likes of a little Tay and I think little Tay helps her because there's this image that we have of these like young up-and-coming I don't even know if a little tape wraps for Christ's sake I've no I well she's about she's about to she's about to get into this yeah yeah I understand I hope she talks about what happened recently with with her being exposed her mother losing her job and all that stupid shit um yeah that's that's actually like really sad for her but it's really funny but it's but it's really funny and I wonder what I need I need to look back at her Instagram and sort of see when the last time she posted on Instagram was and you know honestly like what's gonna happen after this is just she's she's just gonna start renting the cars yeah you know she's just gonna start renting them because chances are at this point like it's probably to a point where she is making some money you know now she she doesn't need to borrow the car from her mom's employer like now she can probably just actually you know rent the cars herself she wants to but still man what a weird thing to ask your boss for from again what I understand when I was reading the article it's like how could my kids take some pictures with your you know really expensive cars which like if that's the case why do you need the keys you know why did you have the keys or whatever you know it's like she's there revving the cars and like where did she get that same stack of money that she's just like you know like flipping out onto the ground every single time maybe maybe that's fake as well I I really don't know I mean her mom might have that much green on her if she's sort of doing real estate in like a high and they're in a super high-end area you know what I mean but uh but yeah you know I'm actually kind of excited for little tayto to put out a mixtape or something because I feel like that's gonna that that's just gonna make everybody go absolutely fuckin insane which everybody's gonna go insane which will sure in a lot of aspiring under ten rappers like little taken seriously open up a floodgate of just just the flood gates of Hell I mean she's already absolutely well I mean that's what I feel like that baby did with her because I think you know she comes from you know her mwah Vicki come from her ribs you know I think it's the same I think they're the same animal and she's she's benefiting I find her more likable when I see her in my stories I'm not as I'm not as annoyed I don't know if that works for her more or it works less I'm not her demographic so I don't think it matters anyway but I see her I see her she like she's moving away from the whole dr. Phil and all that because there's a maturation thing that's going on here I know they had the little confrontation too but there's something there that little taste filling in a void of hate like she's filling in this gap of hate that's supposed to go for Danielle bruh goli but it's it's just not there anymore because we have this nine-year-old train wreck that that we just can't stop watching but it's gonna open up something really dangerous especially because she keeps emphasizing the fact that she's nine because that's gonna make something come out and say I'm seven years old and then we're really headed towards somewhere where we we don't really want to go why I think where we're headed toward it's probably the death of all this stuff you think it's just gonna get so ran into the ground you think it's it's gonna get so ran into the fucking ground it's gonna become so saturated because here's the thing when anybody can do it it's not special anymore you know what I mean but I think that look in the case Wow though why I feel like I feel like right now we're almost hitting a point where it kind of reminds me of you remember in the 80s used to have all that like awful like bad novelty rap all the time everywhere and then I feel like that I feel like that partially contributed to the need the necessity to kind of progress it into something just a little bit more hardcore that was more difficult to copy because then it wasn't gonna be something that people could just you know you could just literally have a nine year old on Instagram just being like yeah I'm a rapper now yeah I'm a rapper now because at the end of the day because that stuff is so controversial and because that stuff is so ridiculous like the the people who want to make actual music you know the the type of people who back in the day like waka flocka or Lex Luger who just literally created this sound and not to say that they were the total originators of it but created the sound just because they were passionate about and they thought it was great it's those people are gonna end up suffering at the end of the day the actual artists and the actual creators because they're gonna find it more difficult to actually compete in this sound and in this nation in this in the genre with the femmine how are you gonna compete with a fucking nine year old who the entire internet fucking hates you can you can't you know it's that's especially in an age where you're talking about it doesn't matter if you're good what matters is if you're getting attention you know if if little take it's five billion hey streams on her new single you know it doesn't it doesn't matter that they're hate streams all that matters is that it's five billion streams you know and ageism is working a lot it's a big component here hmm they want absolutely the ageism it's if I'm if I'm younger and I do it it's just it just validates everything about what I'm doing I'm doing it earlier than you so this is somehow an indication that I'll come that I'll just keep doing it which is something that I've always argued against I always argue against that and I use I use an example that people probably hate me for but I always use it illmatic as an example Naz doing it when he was so young and people think that that's like a mark of something but how many ill Maddux has not created he's one of my favorite rappers of all time but how many classic classic albums has nas created since then you know because we always want to extrapolate it and say well we did it at this age then imagine what he's gonna do in about 10 years is something it's not it's not always a case but I think that's a narrative that they're running on there I'm nine years old can you just imagine what I'm going to do what I'm 30 you're gonna be working at Red Lobster on your food no I mean that's that is true that is the case and and also I mean how many kids NAS is age when he was making that record have come out with records that are just as classic or just essential to the genre so you're also talking about something that is probably only happened like a few times in a generation you know what I mean but yeah I mean it not even just little Tay I still think a bad baby still has an effect to be had here because you know her record whatever it is has not dropped yet and I feel like even the little take could usher in like oh you know I'm a six year old rapper I'm a nine year old rapper I'm an eight year old Flexer I'm the youngest Flexer two years old um even though she could definitely bring that in I feel like Danielle is still like very much a Trojan horse because as soon as her shit drops like they're gonna be all types of like teenagers who are just like alright that's it I'm just I'm just gonna be a rapper now I'm gonna be in the game I'm gonna be a rapper and and and the thing is like there are a lot of people there there are a lot of Danielle bar goalies out there which is exactly why she's so popular you know sure that there are a lot of people out there who just love to hate her but they're also a lot of people out there who really identify with her and who better to make music for that audience than people exactly like her you know and and as soon as she sort of like uh sure's that in and sort of inspires people to sort of copy her like I feel like it's going to again kind of create a point where it's it's it's it's going to create some some anguish in the community in the same way that you saw like Macklemore gets so popular so quick we you know talking about important issues from you know from a supposed white perspective and so on and so forth you know you're gonna see a lot of the same like unhappiness you know over over at Danielle bergoglio getting famous and and and I and I think that could potentially contribute to you know this attitude of okay it's not it's not cool anymore you know the the moment everybody can do it or the moment when people who we don't like can do it and they're sort of dominating in it like then it becomes instantly uninteresting or instantly uncool to yet to adults but not yeah yeah you're right not to the children who want to be no not to the children who want to be here Rob well here's the thing I think also simultaneously what's going to lead to things changing is that each generation of kids want to define themselves by something differently you know a different sound a different direction a different aesthetic a different something and eventually this is going to become the old thing and this is going to become you know basically the the stale thing to do and you know we'll sort of see whatever the next generation brings I guess but again I wouldn't necessarily say outright she's a bad rapper and author I think she's an average rapper you know I mean yeah even though other people are probably which says a lot of other people are probably writing her shit she sounds like she put in the practice on the track not that I think it probably takes a whole lot of practice to rap like Danielle Berkeley but you know there were moments on like cardi B's you know earlier mixtapes where she sounded like really off fucking tempo and and clearly with whatever they're doing with Danielle whether it's a performance thing word that she kind of honed or if they're just like editing the shit out of her vocals she sounds like it sounds together you know it sounds together so let's move on to a a rapper who I don't think either of us would would put on this list of a j.cole who repeatedly with every episode of this that we do it's funny because depending on who we talk about it well I guess what I want to try to say here's who we end up talking about in these lists depends entirely on like who just came out with an album you know what rappers are new what rappers are irrelevant now you know who's basically who are basically the new players in in the current landscape and in every episode so far album release are no album release Jake Hall seems to come up like just Jake hall just has such passionate haters that just seems to follow him everywhere he goes and um I don't know I mean III think he's over hated which which is a term I saw somebody say the other day like Jay Cole doesn't blow me away some sounds like a good album name yeah probably Jay Cole over over hey she could probably come out with a song called over hate it and and if he did a song about that concept I would totally respect that but um you know to me he just sort of seems over hated you know I don't quite get the Jay Cole hate I get that you know he he maybe falls a little short of the mark when it comes to making supremely deep music according to some people occasionally according to me but you know I don't think he's making the worst music in the world ya know it's it's um I think it's a it's it's a generational thing I think just like little pomp obviously you know obviously you know we're throwing the 1985 track in here you think Jake holes audience is old Jake holes audience I think is mostly made up if anyone taps into the 45 the 50 year old head Jake old taps into that audience he definitely does because he makes you know because he creates characters I kill that word you know that audience is smart enough to get what he's doing this smart enough to get the satire what he's doing but it's it's he represents something just like little pomp represents something so the opposition automatically hates him for it I mean I think up until when he came out with this album I think he mentioned this that they were they were fuck Jay Cole chants for like a whole year ever since him and little pomp had that little friction on line or whatever it was so he simply has taken on the face of old heads even though I mean J cold sweat he's like he's like all right she's like early thirties right he's like the same age as a Kendrick Lamar in Kendrick Lamar has a very young audience and I think that a lot of J Cole fans are a lot of his fans are younger too there's more definitely a y-yeah I think it's murdered probably a more of a mental thing than a generational thing I mean you're you're right if there is a younger rapper who's appealing to older heads J Cole probably is not the only young rapper to be doing so but you know I think it's more just like a mental thing and I think it's really just more of his attitude that people must hate you know maybe people find it's condescending yeah a little condescending or just like pretentious or you know hateful toward what these people are doing or appers are doing but after listening attract like 1985 yeah maybe it's you know it's looking down his nose a little bit but I don't even see that track as being like a hateful track in fact I think it's one of the better tracks on his new record well I definitely saw it as a diss I definitely saw the messiness that that's one thing I mean it's it's it's a respond to are you able to hear I think this dropped about maybe two days ago ybn Corday I think it's how you pronounce his name he did a response it was yeah his like response track which I respond I was expecting because of the name of it I was triggered already I was triggered old niggas but when you listen to it it was great I love the barbershop setting everything I I love the track I listen to it like maybe three or four times but but you know but but I really feel like that's what it is it's it's him being condescending is it there's so many intelligent fans out there that they are quote unquote woke and they're very intelligent they're University you know they go to university and they're they're very smart they're young and they don't want to be told that the music that they listen to is making them dumber they they they have self-awareness and I think J Cole gets hate from I think his strongest base which is that the smart the sort of mid-20s that crowd it's like Jay we're smart we want you to ascend somewhere else we want you to go somewhere else other than you know shooting at you know shooting at these artists where you know you're totally safe here because if anybody comes at you you can just you know you that's why you make a record like 1985 you you're not sweating anybody challenging you you're not going at somebody like a you know just throwing out Joyner Lucas's name just for whatever reason to somebody who can actually come at you and will actually come at you you're playing the safe route even though everything that you're stating is true we can all agree it's true but I think yeah cuz you know little pumps response it's gotta that's all that's all it's gonna be so it works it works why not right he stamps himself as being the person in this generation sort of like jay-z was the person with no more auto-tune who stamped it and said this is bullshit let's stop doing this and he's stamping himself into history by doing it and I think that's really all that was important that's all that was important to him I saw he performed what was that festival just from a couple days ago where he performed it on stage while little pump was backstage I'm not I'm not sure what I was I wasn't paying attention to that but what was the what was the real imeem I think that's pretty interesting I mean they showed a shot of little pump just in the back just sort of nodding his head to it I mean I guess maybe mocking him a bit but he was playing nineteen eighty five and then he cut it and then he played the acapella tour 1985 because he really wanted the crowd to listen I think afterwards it just it didn't have that I don't know you listen to it and you let me know but it just didn't have that punch maybe the record is just not gonna live for very long but well I think the record is probably not gonna live her very long because I think what he's responding to isn't gonna live for very long you know it's it's not like a universal theme he's kind of responding to a very short trend I mean I think him responding to somebody like little pump whose initial disc toward him was pretty weak to the point where I think most fans didn't even really remember it or pay attention to it by the time the little Col little Col J Cole responded to it but um I think I think the the other issue is not only that yeah of course little pump is gonna have a stupid response to whatever J Cole says but simultaneously what little pump is and what little pump is doing is not going to last for very long like J Cole himself is going to outlast this trend um a little pump is doing so it's gonna sort of sound weird looking back to sort of you know kind of here you going at this kind of miniature now irrelevant kind of a blip on the historical map you know that really kind of you were you portrayed yourself was kind of being above hey I I want to ask you something because I think that song when it came out it made me think of do you think there's something to be said about the fact that all all commentators you included it we've wanted we've been saying this for years the Internet's been saying this for years but the automatic the automatic comment that you get if you say something like that is shut the fuck up you're just a hater you're hating on these young people but there's something to be said about it's just it's just what we give it's something that we put in the hand of the artist that we consider to be like you're the it guy you're like one of three that you can say whatever you want and because you've had so much success you can speak from the podium but so it's like to me it's like truth isn't really truth it's just the messenger is is is where really that's what it matters because J Cole didn't say that through the kill out Edward through you know everything outside of you know the personal stories in kod the commentary is nothing refreshing it's it's it's like yeah I know this already but it's that's interesting to me that that's the online conversation it's been the online conversation since the abscessed inception of the very first little it's always been that but now it's like finally somebody said it someone finally said it yeah I mean me personally when I'm sort of negative toward you know one of these newer rappers I guess I I have a bit there's probably some of that getting thrown at me but it's not that bad because I think there are a lot of people are familiar with just my track record because while yeah like I could fall on the side of J Cole like on that 1985 track like as as unnecessary as I thought it was I do think he brings up some decent in the track but simultaneously people know that I like that little pump tape and that's the thing like I can like little pumps music while understanding that like he clearly doesn't conduct himself in a very intelligent way j.cole conducts himself in a very intelligent way much of the time you know from what I've been able to observe you know but I don't find his music as interesting sort of like for those very same reasons that you were saying you know like oh the the commentary wasn't that refreshing and so on and so forth and when you went and when that's kind of what you partially market yourself on like hey my commentary is great I made great commentary like I'm going to go into your record expecting that and and sort of having a high bar of expectation for that because I mean number one you've built it up and number two there you have contemporaries who are doing really great contemporary really great commentary and really at the end of the day I feel like those are the twofold issues that people have with with Jay Cole it's either his attitude or it's the fact that he's falling short of some kind of expectations that people have going into the record given what not only him but also his fans you know sort of seemed to the narrative they push about him another question um okay with kod obviously you hear a song like ATM and ATM is you you know what he's saying and you hear song like brackets is that confusing in your eyes I mean is it confusing to make a track where you're obviously saying or motive or motivate which I think kind of like ATM and that you could sort of group it up together and it's just like yeah get your money get your money that's that's all the messages and you're driving yourself crazy but then I'm gonna make a song like brackets where I'm actually stressed out about my money and I think there should be an app about what I want to pay where I want my taxes to go to UM is that confusing because we have two different messages about it wouldn't be the first time that Jay Cole has been a little contradictory on an album I mean he himself has you know made tracks resource seems to fall on both sides of the fence with oh well you know I'm being like mack daddy and i'm like sleeping with a lot of women but also you know I love my significant other and I'm trying to like fold clothes for ya exactly you know full clothes and you know eat cereal with almond milk and that sort of thing you know more a more domestic Jake hole so you know clearly he falls on both sides of the fence on on other issues as well I I didn't necessarily see motivate and brackets being polar opposites though like conceptually I mean maybe in in in the most surface level sense but I think when you get down to a lot of what he's saying on brackets especially when you're talking about him as a black man paying taxes into a system that negatively effects the types of communities that he came from you know then then I think you're really kind of getting to the core of a track like brackets and and and I understand what he's saying I see what he's saying it's just two messages about it's it's it's two messages about money that you know both are both are very real but at the same time it's like does it have any room does it have any room on the same on the same album is just what I wonder well you know that that's another kind of issue that I have with a lot of Jake holes music which I don't know if it's it's that big of a problem with a lot of other people but um you know another issue that I have with some of his albums consistently is that I feel like he's hinting towards doing something conceptual but when you actually look at the grander scheme of how all the tracks work together like they don't really reinforce each other or they don't really build off of each other narrative Lee again it sort of seems like that just on the surface like oh man this looks like it's going to be a concept it's going to be a concept J Cole's coming through the concept but then you actually like look at the way all the tracks work together where rather don't that expectation kind of falls flat you know and and not that you need a concept you can just have a bunch of fucking tracks that all sound good together and have a good record but to me continually I think that that is something that Jay Cole implies again and again and again that this is going to be a concept this is going to be idea this is gonna be a theme and it just sort of ends up falling flat because that that just doesn't get delivered haha speak for yourself buddy I can't wait to talk about Russ so I mean you know it's still considering all that I probably would not put him on this list because I mean he's he's somebody who more than most people on this list right now you know he's somebody who I would probably love to hear just no beat at all you know what I mean somebody somebody who I know as a rapper could totally go acapella and he would sound good you know he'd sound good on the mic he would have a good performance he'd have a great flow he'd be consistent he'd probably have a theme or topic or idea for that particular freestyle or something I mean with every Barbie Gold not necessarily but you know he's somebody who from the traditional standpoint of a rapper I could I definitely see worthy of more respect than a lot of other people placed you know onto this list right now but I just think J Cole just continually falls short of expectations on the conceptual side of things and and in the grander scheme of things when it comes to you know actually making songs and making records and that's the thing you know there are a lot of rappers out there who you know who were in the battle rap community for example but you know being a really great battle rapper is not the same thing as being able to make a record it's not the same thing as being able to write a song you know which you you've seen there's a lot of there have been a lot of people who have tried to kind of transition sort of out of that circle and into a more sort of record industry type circle and have you know kind of failed miserably because those talents don't necessarily translate to a commercial record all the time yeah and Joe button can even show you that from a reverse standpoint making records and coming into the battle rapper II it doesn't make C so it's like it's one way absolutely alright let's talk about who you just brought up Russ who I also think somebody but I want to try to say here is that I think he's also someone who gets hate for the same reasons that J Cole does and and let's go to the the I think what I believe is the quote Metro boomin had about him after that comment that he had about producers ruining hip hop and so on and so forth it's not even that his music is awful but people just find him to be to be whack in spirit yeah so just based on that alone I feel like people find Jay Cole to be that way as well but Russ is obviously a much worse case yeah I feel like Russ's is a sole example of really just kind of his is what people see is his public attitude as as being a huge turnoff douche just who does that just a hateable personality just so hateable and you know let's dispel a bit of a myth here because I've been questioned on this numerous times and and people say to me you know well what's wrong with Russ isn't he just egotistical like a rapper should be mm-hmm isn't he just ego isn't that all this is isn't he just being egotistical aren't rappers supposed to be egotistical why why are people hating Russ for being egotistical isn't it isn't that what he's supposed yeah I don't think it's being egotistical I think you heat ITA's between just being bitter yes I think and I think it's adds more to being bitter when he made the comment about I think it was about mumble rappers where he was like well everything isn't like what you see like you see all these people and you think they sell out all these venues but they need they need three or four artists to sell out the venue's that I sell out by myself so in actuality I'm really the guy that's winning and it's like well why do you feel like you have to point that out that I mean if that's working for you there's you know you could point out somebody like tec-9 I'm sure tec-9 could have said that eight years ago mmm you know tec-9 could have so I think what russ doesn't understand is that he he appeals to a super nice group of listeners like who are very passionate love his stuff yeah but I think he's somehow mistaken that for like mainstream success or like somehow being better or more popular or more more relevant than the mumble rappers who he who he critiques and he goes at you know what I mean no I mean you know you have some pretty big songs but like it's it's it's not it's not gucci gang you know what i mean like there aren't 11 year-olds quoting your songs it's like you sound like a label exact rest you got a lot of songs but uh where where's your gucci king it's true though it's true though you know 12 12 year olds and 11 year olds or not are not quoting your songs and like group chats is like a joke yeah you know what I mean I have a friend of mine who who sent me a screenshot of a phone and said this is this is my 11 year old texting her friends right now and it's just back and forth just Gucci Gang Gucci gang Gucci and it's nobody's doing that with a rough song nobody's doing that with a rough song like people love your music but I don't know just be happy with the fact that be happy with the fact that you're not in the industry because at the end of the day like you know little pomp I mean as much as I like the guys music like he's he's probably just like getting chewed up and spit out as soon as like this sound that he's on becomes less relevant you you think the record label is gonna stick by him and be like you know let's let's just develop him a bit more you know as soon as there's another 17 year old who looks and dresses more ridiculously and has a bigger hit song and little pump the pump gets put on the back burner yeah you know right now you're totally on this independent at least from what I understand wave and you're doing your own thing and from what you say you know you do everything yourself I do my own beats even though your beats are just a snare and a fucking kick and a hi-hat in a keyboard you do your own beats to do your own mixing like you know I I get it it sounds like one person did all of it but I mean it's working for you so I mean I I guess just enjoy that just do that but yeah you know it's really that bitterness and and for what like you're incredibly successful what do you have to be so fucking bitter about yeah yeah if the music even the music even shows it to which is fine but I think when there's a combination of your bitter comments and your music is braggadocious that's where the ego comes and it's totally fine for you to say it in the music but since you're not a large artist it sounds like you're talking to the people in the front row at your shows you're not as successful as I have worried what do you do with your life I just it sounds so person it's just like I'm in a small room with you since you're you're big but you're not as big as a Drake even though your music is sort of under his umbrella I believe it it's like it sounds I don't know it sounds like you're talking on a few people it's I don't know it's it's off-putting it's very off-putting even though I think he's I think he's skilled that I like a few you know he's gone viral with it with a lot of songs yes yeah so they you're absolutely right it's like dude just appreciate listen to dj khaled be grateful for the fact that you have the niche audience that you have and there's no need look at the same time it makes it warms my heart as as somebody who's up who's a part-time just old head that you know occasionally just hates and spews his bullshit about the fact that I'm just bitter about the music that's out there right now I love the fact that Russ is in his mid-20s and he shows his discontent for the current wave of music I appreciate it so much but it's just when he goes into the end plus when he gets into the finances of everything it's just it's it's something that 50 bought about in the game and it's stuck with so many artists and it just doesn't work for them when they start talking about finances and what they do it just doesn't work for you it doesn't work for everybody don't break the fourth wall I don't I don't want to know about that I don't want to know about what you do yeah and I think his attitude just causes people to probably hyper analyze his music a little bit harder than they would normally if he was just like chill or laid-back because while his songs are not terrible and his rap ability is not bad it's it's not like what he's doing is entirely original you know what I mean and it feels like there's just like a lot of bitterness about just like oh I'm not accepted in the industry and for what reason he thinks that that's the case I really don't know from him generally I just kind of get this very just general general vibe of just anger that he's not sort of respected in the hip-hop community and in the same way that other rappers are who might be doing similar numbers than he is but I think at the end of the day it's it's really just kind of an attitude thing I think it's you know you attracting more flies with honey than then fucking vinegar because I think at the end of the day like when you get records and songs that are going platinum again and again and again and again like if you just chill and you just like allow that to happen like other people are going to see your success and gravitate for that look at post Malone who still to this day like a lot of people in the hip-hop community don't like him but he's still incredibly successful and you don't see anybody turned down a fucking chance to feature on his records you know what I mean because even if he's not the most likable guy even if he's not sort of what people want to let into the hip-hop community and he's had some off-color remarks about what he thinks about hip-hop and so on and so forth like they're still with a magnetic need yeah even with that there's still a magnetic need for rappers to work with him because he has so much attention on what he's doing and to Russ's credit he had a track recently a feature recently with that J idk kid who you know was a pretty good up-and-coming rapper but the thing is like you know he's maybe a little bit more on the lyrical side of things and and might sort of see a point to a lot of the attacks that rust levees you know at a lot of these younger sort of maybe more mumble rap type artists but the thing is like I think there are some instances in which he can even find him working in those contexts but now I feel like that door has just been entirely shut to him because he's just like I do everything myself I'm the best I'm the best of the best all you guys do drugs and you suck I hate that I hate this about you I hate that value and I feel like it's come to a point where he's just kind of attacking things about the culture not because he thinks they're legitimately bad things but just because he's trying to attack any soft spot because he just sees himself as like being outside of the castle and he's just like hurling rocks at ya he's blaming he's blaming others I feel like if he got to a certain point he he'd be similar to Kanye I think he would have big rough speeches at award shows I I definitely feel like that he's that he's made he's up that ilk god you're fucking right that's such a that's such an astute observation that it would be crazy we cringe well let's move on to the next rapper now that you said cringe because I think there are a lot of people who hate this rapper for for reasons of cringe and that's logic you know I I don't mind logic I think he's a talented rapper I think he raps pretty well as far as flow goes he's got impressive flows he's got a bit of a weird thing going on with joiner Lukas where joiners like claiming that he like ripped off a bunch of shit from him and people really give him shit on that biracial thing like I feel like they I feel like they they act like he says it more than he actually said then he actually does like he does not bring it up as much as people say he'd bring me that I mean he's been mean yeah that's you know it's it's it's the memes are kind of dogging him but I think there are a lot of people out there who are just kind of like really tired of him and just really don't like him I mean I got so many responses saying yeah logics the worst I hate logic which again you know considering the inclusion of Russ and logic here you know it sort of seems like even though we could agree like hey you know little pomp and Playboy cardi they're not that technically sound not that technically sound for from a certain standpoint of technicality we could argue well you know these rappers are bad or they're not that good but I think with the fact that you have so many people here mentioning Russ mentioning logic to rappers who can clearly rap a Jay Cole as well I think it just goes to show that like in so many respects like this genre can be like very much like a popularity contest you know what I mean do what do I like your personality do I like who what I perceive you to be as a person because if I think you're annoying or if I think you're bitter or if I think you're obnoxious in any kind of way like I can't fuck with your music because I feel like in a way that that's part of a logic is suffering from here I don't know if you feel uh yeah it's it's some for me it's the most recently it's coming off of the joiner Lukas conflict it's coming off of it with his response to it I forgot the name of the of the record but his response was just like dude I am literally positivity like you speaking to the concept of positivity so I don't even understand it's so it's I can't even I don't have the vocabulary to just to just articulate how terrible and how condescending and how just like disgusting that all is it's like dude if you're gonna address the guy address him maybe it's legitimate that you stole the suicide idea from him you know maybe you did maybe you stole like an artist I have no idea but the fact remains our artist still shit each other happens all the time so it's it's one of those things where if you present yourself like like logic presents himself as sorta just like this lyrical rapid-fire guy who many times just rips off other people's styles but there's a certain logic that I love I love I love under pressure logic you know I love I love when he sounds like that I mean particularly that record not just that album but it you know I like gang-related logic I I don't I'm not a big fan of the everybody logic even though he can he can make the biracial songs he can do it right you know he did he did that would take it back on that album like I can tolerate the biracial logic but there's something about somebody who presents themselves in a certain way and then they sort of cower away when they're confronted with something like I always feel like if you're this lyrical guy then if somebody goes at you and you decide to respond then go at them don't just say hey dude this there's a lot of negativity to what you're saying compete compete like make a decision logic like who do you want to be I'm white I'm black I am positivity I am like I just logics identity to me is just I don't know what he is you know so I think he belongs on this list because like you said personality yes he he belongs on this list for that reason so so you feel like even even though again he has sort of those technical aspects down personality does play a big role for you and it is a huge it is a huge turnoff and yes because because he's attempting to he's attempting to do what so many people who we consider to be legit rappers is he attempt he has a cause that he's fighting you know apparently he's chosen suicide he's chosen that and it's a very noble cause but at the same time you can take yourself very seriously enroute to that and I think that's what's happened here I'm saving lives with my music out of the way out of the way I am peace love and positivity it's like it's kind of having a bit of a savior complex in your music can be kind of a turn-off I think Kendrick is bordering a little bit on that lately but not pushing it so hard that it's ruined his music or anything like that but but a savior complex can definitely be a turn-off so okay so I have another question so I saw your Bobby Tarantino to review and I think you pointed out something that I believe to be true as well you know with regard to him just just sort of blatantly just taking away all the artists of styles where it's basically a statement of is that what they're doing I can do that I can do that I can do that oh yeah where does that where's that where's that going where is the the constant theme of him obviously doing this where is that going I really don't know honestly I I think in a way he almost sees that as like what a successful rapper is I really don't know I may be in some kind of twisted way he sees that as creativity or proving yourself I really have no idea where he would have even gotten that idea because I can't even name another artist who is or was as mainstream as him and it seems like one of their telltale telltale characteristics is that they're like a chameleon you know yeah again I I just I just don't know where he would get that idea I mean you know I guess you could say a little Wayne with a lot of his earlier mixed tapes you know bodying other people's beats and that sort of thing you know maybe that's a point of reference but just sort of just copying some other rappers entire style yeah I just don't really know where that where that comes from and and to me that that's kind of another mark against logic that's another thing that persistently has been a kind of obnoxious thing about his music and I'm just not really sure he thinks the appeal of that is I mean maybe it works for you know more surface-level Musil music listeners who you know don't really have that much allegiance to any particular artist but they just like the way some certain songs sound you know so he's just kind of throwing tracks out there to be like well you know this will work for the Kendrick fans and this will work for the Travis Scott fans and so on marketing market to every to everybody and that didn't ensure my success because I'm pretty sure Bobby Tarantino too did did well I'm not sure what the numbers are yeah I'm pretty sure it did well well too you know maybe not so well that he got a 30 million dollar record contract which there were some people calling out is not being true but I'm sure I'm sure it did well but uh yeah I mean logic is another record technically I wouldn't necessarily say is an awful rapper I wouldn't say is a terrible rapper I wouldn't eagerly throw on this list but he is another rapper who maybe not quite as much as Russ definitely not as much as Russ but he is a rapper who I think some people just sort of see as being wack in spirit and I do think it does have to do with the copying I do think it does have to do with like a little bit of pretension despite the fact that like he's not wholly original he's not that interesting and you know also he does have a bit of a savior complex in his music too especially on his previous record where you know you had the space themes and you know they're listening to the album that that changed everything we have to listen to the album the artists that changed it all it's like what was this space-themed was that the one with with the Thalia which was on the front cover the incredible true story where he's sort of like holding the the sort of steering right yeah he's flying some spaceship yeah that that's the one where the people who were on the ship we're talking about oh look what are we gonna listen to oh let's listen to the music the artists have changed y'all the artist has saved the world which if you do it if you did it well it could work I mean it could it it's creative it's like yeah it's very self-congratulatory it's it's like yeah whatever but if you do it well then we're in you know we're always in when you do it well if your music is so good that you literally are that artists like I can't I can't really I can't really argue against it you know and and that's the thing I think it could get away with it when Drake sessom shit like that or when Kendrick says some shit sort of on that super egotistical I'm influencing everything I'm changing everything kind of level I can't totally disagree because like well yeah you kind of are you can but like in the case of logic that's just so not the case who out there is copying fucking logic you know who out there wants to sound like logic logic wants to sound like everybody fucking else you know so it's like what is a logic song I know his voice sounds like which is probably the one telltale sign of his music that when I hear a logic song I know oh well that's logic but who out there is really copying logic what does a logic song sound like that no other song sounds like there's no answer to that question yeah so yeah I think you know there's a bit of a too much self congratulation self congratulatory to duty self congratulatory themes as well just be a negative bro I mean whatever if just being negative he's saving the world and that's that's all there is you're taking the taking the tools out of the heart surgeons hands so what's that we have a few more left let's get into the next one probably one of the more controversial rappers in the list over here xxx 10th Ozzy own xxx 10th Accio nah I don't we've never even had a conversation or even a minor back-and-forth online about him so I really have no idea what what your take on him or his music is at all well X is again has all the looks but sounds nothing like his quote/unquote contemporaries he doesn't sound like anybody last year I think he really tried to corner the market on this you know on the suicide thing which at some points you know you know you don't know if he's if it's a cause that he as if it's something that he's trying to really just just profit off of you know it saved me and what's sad but my opinion about xx is he he's capable of a lot of different styles I mean you saw in the double XL freestyle where he also took a shot at Jay Cole you you see that he's got the potential to do different things and I think he's one of the better examples of what it's hard for me to understand sometimes of what it's hard for my ear to adjust to is just how these newer artists are using melody I think he with sad itself with a song like sad itself it's something that I wouldn't have found myself to be a fan of but I enjoyed so I think he has a great ear for music the hated part for me comes in to the to the fact that he has to he has to preface his album it's just a part of him but preface his album by saying that you have to open up your mind to this he he can very much be a cult leader you know the that's what that's how cult leaders are made up you know it's like adjust your mind this is gonna put you on a new frame of consciousness and enjoy yeah if you're not getting it your mind hasn't been adjusted yeah and we're gonna be in the circle at four you know you don't want to join and you know SYP SYP punk yeah it's so it's I think that's where it comes in and obviously the sexual not the sexual stuff the domestic battery all that all that stuff which I wanna you know which I saw you commented about the all the Spotify stuff but do you do you feel like he belongs on this from a technical and an artistic standpoint no not necessarily the the only record of his I truly gave an awful review and that I thought was terrible was the one album where he's like rapping the least you know what I mean was I seventeen seventeen record where it's just kind of like a yeah like a weird emo folk record where the songs just barely sounded even finished and awfully recorded and just sounded like generally terrible to me yeah there were a few rap rappy songs on there but it's barely even a rap album you know really when I first got turned on to him and I was mostly enjoying his stuff was when he just kind of had those early hyper-aggressive you know screaming like you know just like 6-9 those early SoundCloud singles that went super viral and I was like okay you know this is like fucking turn up and fucking then go down to hell you know that's like you know there was something really extreme and animalistic and crazy about it I saw a lot of the Death Grips fans fucking with some of it at first because a lot of his like earlier songs like you know sipping tea in your hood and that sort of you know that should that shit went super like viral but also like there was like a meme component to it as well he also had he had that what in tarnation's song or whatever they had like a meme album cover so clearly he's like a rapper who's very conscious of memes in the meme community and and memes in music and is not afraid to sort of incorporate that into his stuff if he wants to or if he needs to you know from like a marketing perspective or just sort of like add a bit of lyrical flair to whatever he's doing but like looking at a lot of his earlier tracks like pre revenge pre 17 like all those Lucy type tracks that he was just like dropping because he has a lot of singles just like a lot of random drops like for a long time before he actually started releasing stuff on a much more commercial level he has quite a bit of versatility in his back catalogue you know you have those hyper aggressive look at me type tracks which it seems like nowadays he's trying his hardest not to do another song like that which is interesting because that's almost like the antithesis of what you would expect from an artist cut from that cloth you know what I mean probably for the rest of is very short-lived career we're going to see Takashi 6:9 making the same song over and over and over yeah it seemed like very early on like once X got big off of those tracks he did not want to make another song like that again I think that's in a way as awful seventeen was that was partially an attempt by him not to make the same song over again not to make the same kind of music over again you know it's like I'm big now people are expecting me to make a certain type of track the the type of music that I got viral off of but I'm going to hit them with the left hook and do something completely different do something completely outside of their expectations and you know do like these sad guitar songs but again looking into his back catalogue there's quite a bit of versatility you do have those more aggressive tracks you do have boom-bap type tracks and jazz rap type tracks and tracks that are more ignorant tracks that are more conscious so artistically I do think there's a lot to him and I think that's also the case with his newest project that you know the question mark project even though there are clearly some songs on there where he's just like jerking off and bullshitting you know like that I don't even speak Spanish song lol which is like one of the worst tracks I've heard all year there are some tracks on there like rap tunes and like almost like punk and rock type tracks that that go over pretty well and I don't know if I have a hard time struggling to put him on this list it's really only for the reason that he just refuses to be a rapper and simply a rapper you know what I mean like when I hear him on a tracker when I hear a feature it sounds fine it sounds decent he's okay you know I'm not like necessarily blown away or anything but it sort of seems like he's trying to define himself by much much more than that artistically does he always do it well I mean I think he misses more than he hits a lot of the time because I think in a way he's kind of like he's dabbling in everything but he's not necessarily a master of anything you know what I mean he's not doing any one thing so incredibly well that it's like whoa holy shit because it's like he insists on not being pigeon-holed for whatever reason and I sort of wonder how long he can get along doing that because I feel like building an audience you could sustain yourself off commercially kind of I don't know at least by prior you know because things are probably changing in the age of streaming by prior knowledge you know from what you and me know being younger and sort of listening to records and following artists in the music industry there needs to be some kind of stylistic cohesion or consistency there you know what I mean to keep the audience coming back but he just sort of seems to be all over the fucking place and and and he continues to be successful despite that lack of consistency but who knows for how long yeah being being an artist's artist to say I don't want you to pigeonhole me if I get popular for this certain thing but I'm gonna completely change it that's great in theory but it can be very harmful towards people identify people need to identify you for something they have to they have to figure out it I mean you'll always have your core but there's a certain style that you have to have where people recognize it that has to be a thing and I think to be an artist so much to that full of I'm going to recreate myself because when he was making those hype records I mean what was the what was the time between that and 17 maybe like a year and a half maybe that's a very short period of time like I think you have to pace yourself and take something out of the the the 6:9 playbook and just keep at it maybe six nine will change he probably won't but that's probably something that he could have benefited off of I also don't think he's very prolific i I don't think he's going to be I think everything is gonna be pretty spread out and you're not gonna get a lot of music from him which is probably what's gonna carry him out I think a few more years longer than all the other people in his age bracket I believe I think he'll stay in music a whole lot longer because of that reason and because he wants to recreate himself every now and then I certainly don't want to hear any more records like 17 I don't want to hear that anymore and that's but I think that's the audience that he speaks to he speaks to the audience of you know sort of in the way that Cuddy Cuddy speaks to that audience he speaks to the audience of the people in the back of the class and and of course our friend Hopson it's--that's they're all in that in that same group I think they have the same audience pretty much um people that see themselves as underdogs and they feel like they need some sort of support but I don't think it's as extreme as logic and his hero complex I think it's I'm just like these people so I'm making music for these people whereas logic looks at it like I'm gonna save these motherfuckers because they need they need me yeah I think III think X is probably appealing to that same crowd but with with a much darker edge logic is kind of like the The Weeknd can't youth group you know administrator of the rap game you know it's like hey things are hard but we're all in this together xxx tent Ozzie Owen is just like the dark alleyway sort of like goth kid drug dealer who just like smoking like chain smoking just like what the fuck is the point of life you know no when I cut myself and and and you say earlier that you you didn't sort of see the appeal in or you didn't quite get the the whole little peep phenomenon he he very much appeals of the same group of people you know people who in my negative coverage of his stuff you know responded to me and said hey well you know I personally have had like a lot of emotional and addiction issues and yeah and his music sort of speaks to me on that level so you know he very much has like a bit of a sad outcast kind of vibe his music as well which I think X probably most likely appeals to that same group to I think with X a lot of the hatred toward his stuff comes from just merely again his reputation his personality the fact that he needs to throw a caveat before each record just to be like hey man if you're not open to this it's just such a not it's just such a bad look the thing is like if the music is good the music's good it's gonna speak for itself you know what I mean not only that but I mean maybe there is reason to kind of argue for what he's saying because a lot of what he was delivering on that album wouldn't necessarily appeal to strictly like a hip-hop audience but I feel like you've already kind of broken the floodgates on that on 17 you know what I mean if people are still fucking with you after 17 then they're clearly willing to hear almost anything from you you know what I mean like if the transition into this like sad bedroom recorded folk music didn't sort of ruin your career like if you make a rock song or something with like a little bit more of a pulse like it's I don't think it's gonna like you know hurt your numbers or anything like that because it seemed like that interlude a lot of it was emphasized on okay well this is a more alternative sound okay mm-hmm so just be ready for that and you know it's it's kind of interesting the consistently and there in the rock community there's always this discussion of like oh you know rock is dead guitar music is dead it's dying nobody likes guitar music anymore you know it's old hat just old people like it but simultaneously you have these dudes like Kid Cudi and axe and and there are some other rappers out there too who it sort of seems like they're doing everything they can to find ways to work guitar into into their music I mean even Brock Hampton is an example of that is they have like a few guitar songs on on their records so it's like there's kind of like this new wave of rappers out there who are like not afraid of the guitar and use it quite often and it's almost like the this discussion of guitar music and rock music being dead is sort of being had completely outside of that with like absolutely no understanding that there's kind of this mini trend within rap right now where they're like yeah we're gonna actually just end up making rock music so when the future with a last question on him so in the future with him do you think he'll be making anything that sounds like rap at all by the end of his career you know I I think for for him going forward he's probably just gonna continue to balance what he does with a million other genres at the end of the day what I would what I would really like to hear from him is just songs that sound a little bit more finished you know or just something that sounds like he's just put a little bit more effort into it that there was a lot on that record on his new record even though I think it was an improvement over seventeen that sounded like it was just super effortless and off-the-cuff and you know if you're gonna have some kind of preface at the start of your record about how fucking serious it is and how I need to open my mind to what's gonna be going on on it and then there are multiple parts on it where it sounds like you didn't even take the track that seriously yeah it's kind of it's kind of a turn-off and it's a bit of an inconsistency like there's no reason to have tracks like that in your record if you're gonna kick the whole thing off be like okay man it's going to be a really deep deep it's okay and if you're just not open to it if your minds not open its if you don't like it just get your minds out open okay um but it's gonna be minimal but it's I think you should have thrown that word in there maybe maybe it's minimal okay it may be in Finnish but it's deep all right let's let's get to the last person on the list here who I actually don't have a whole lot to the same to say that personally and that's rich the kid rich the kid you know I mean I I could potentially see myself throwing him on this list and only for the reason that honestly I could not pick him out of a lineup I I really could not after hearing multiple rich the kid features and multiple rich the kids songs like what it what is your style what is your sound what is your voice what did what is your anything I really have no idea I feel like in a lot of ways he's kind of for me replaced Big Sean is like hip-hop's most non-essential character you know because for a moment I just thought like Big Sean gets so much hate yeah you know I mean for it well I think he's gotten a little better I think yeah I think he has gotten better you know I think I think Big Sean I think that control verse ruined his career but yeah a little bit you know I think he has grown into himself a little bit more since the control verse and and has made music that I think has proven that he's a bit more essential than he was you know earlier in the decade but I'm just like not really seeing the necessity for a rich the kid right now like what are you bringing to the table that nobody else is bringing I I really have no idea yeah the same there isn't there's there's not much for me to say about rich the kid first time I heard a plug walk was on snapchat first time I heard it which hey he's getting some sort of a push him somewhere and getting a Kendrick feature is um I mean that's pretty big too but I don't think he belongs on the list because I just think he sounds like I just think he sounds like the flock of everyone I don't think there's anything really that stands out about him was he on the lower end of votes um he was on the lower end of votes you know but but I think I think there's um I think there's a point at which where you become so generic or you become so average that you literally don't stand out in the crowd and that in and of itself yeah becomes like a huge mark against you because then it's just like well what's the point yeah you know like well why are we here mm-hmm all right I'm going to I'm gonna leave it at that this has been our worst rappers in the game currently podcast I want to thank D respect for coming on and commenting with me and taking part in this in this gauntlet the most consistent podcast in the world I'm I am I'm so happy to be a part of it all right um again we're gonna link to his stuff is social media his YouTube channel down in the description and thanks for listening everybody and have a good one forever [Music] [Music] "
zGaNfx3aTME,okay hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it may not sound like it to you but my allergies are absolutely killing me right now so please bear with me while I try to survive through this episode of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week before we get into that a few things to mention I am going on tour going on tour going on tour going on - we're going on tour in June pretty much East Coast dates sorry - everybody else we will hit you want another tour we just added two more dates to the tour shout out to cool skull who did this lovely poster art so we have our usual dates the New Jersey date the New York the other New Jersey date the Virginia dates North Carolina Tennessee Georgia and then we're also hitting South Carolina and Pennsylvania to link to our page the needle drop comm slash tour where you can find all of the relevant information and ticketing links to the tour we have general admission tickets as well as VIP tickets the VIP tickets come with like an extra meet-and-greet type thing you know we'll hang out take pictures because a lot of these venues a lot of these dates have hard outs so as soon as the show is over I can hang around for a little bit afterwards but not long enough to sort of meet everybody and everything so there's heart outside a lot of these venues the VIP lets people sort of get the more intimate experience and also if you pick up those VIP tickets day of show I have an extra piece of content exclusive secret content that will be remaining sort of exclusive that you guys should find find very interesting and as far as like what happens at these things it's a mix of music and memes and lecture and Cal it's it's a it's a good fun time also of course down there we have our amazon associate link and our turntable lab associate link pick up day a nice colorful piece of vinyl or a new turntable or some speakers if you're trying to get into the whole record collecting thing we get kicked back from that turntable lab link and let's get into a little shout out over here for the band All India Radio they are a long-standing kind of downtempo and post rock band that has a pretty immaculate instrumental over here titled Vega which is now on the needle drop comm Austin did a little write-up for it and we premiered it on the website so we did a nice little song premiere for their new record coming out very soon so keep that because it's a pretty immaculate very pristine instrumental and apparently this cover art was originally commissioned for Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon I actually like it a bit more than the Dark Side of the Moon cover I mean I guess you can't beat the prism it's so it's so iconic but I find this to be so much more stimulating it's really really beautiful album cover art alright let's get into what I felt were the worst tracks of the week worst tracks of the week we've we've had quite a few this is a really busy week a lot of songs came out a lot of music came out I actually had to like not even talk about every single piece of music that I think in other weeks I would have otherwise like said something about or else like this video is gonna be like 40 minutes long because there's so many freaking tracks that dropped let's start with this new song from little Tracy and little Aussie verts this like of farmer remix it's kind of like a funny piece of novelty trap about being a redneck just kind of seems like a ridiculous joke song the the in which the I think the comedy kind of wears thin after like a single listen and and I feel like a little Uzi vert didn't even play into the obvious theme of the track all that well some of the auto-tune melodies on the cut are kind of catchy and and some of the jokes do land but overall it just felt like kind of really trashy and tasteless and I don't know just desperate for attention honestly just just sort of seemed like maybe a little too eager to piss off the exact demographic of people who they're trying to make fun of in the song obviously you know southerners or rednecks or whatever yeah not caring for it too much just sounded kind of trashy IMO moving on from their big shack mando dense the the very unfunny follow-up to his skip it up viral hit last year yeah you know I mean listen that that that meme that was magic that was magic man and and unfortunately uh you just can't really recreate it I mean maybe if there's a music video attached to this thing it'll make more sense in the jokes in the humor of it will land a bit harder but just as a song just on its own even though he does you know do those funny little on an amount of PS ends here and there and you know tries to kind of spice the track up a little bit yeah I just feel like the humor on this track is a super weak Oh God this new sangria wine track from Pharrell and Camila Cabello you know honestly Cabello her her recent music I just found to be kind of bland just like your usual top 40 pop stuff with like a slight like super vague kind of Latin twist to it but I wouldn't even say she's the worst thing about this track I mean again her vocals are kind of generic but I actually find a Pharrell's hook on here to be the most obnoxious thing about the whole thing like his inflections in his whole I don't know I guess this is what he feels like like an impression of I guess Latin music fused with pop fused with hip-hop is it just sounds really goofy and I don't know it just just sounds really uh I guess like a bastardization of a lot of the musical influences that went into this thing so yeah it's it's it's it's another pretty trashy cut it's it's not a novelty song but sort of sounds like one as does this new j-rock track god this was awful what the hell happened here like I saw the cover I'm seeing the trophies I was like it's called win what the hell this has got to be great this has got to be a banger this has got to be amazing and certainly j-roc came hard with the inflection with the delivery and with the instrumental but God the lyrics are trash like what I just don't know what to say about this it's just a win-win-win-win like it's so tedious and it's so ridiculous and and he sounds so cartoony on the track it sounds like a joke song like and I get that you know sort of bringing things in a more minimal in a more repetitive direction as is is the trend right now you know and and on top of it it's not like you have to sort of sacrifice quality at the altar of simplicity because you know Donald Glover proved that you don't necessarily have to do that with with this is America and I've enjoyed quite a few artists who kind of you know stripped their tracks down to their most simplest and most repetitive elements before but this just sound kooky this just sounded goofy I you know it's I think it's partially the repetition repetition which was really annoying about the song but I I think it's mostly just kind of the tone and the delivery of it it just sounded like an SNL skit it's like a jokes and I don't know what I will say about outside of that it just sounded like a bit of unintended comedy I guess and and I'll leave it at that oh and Cal Church esta has a new free style out which is absolute trash he made a bunch of like playing card references throughout the song beat sounds like it was made on a like 1980s Macintosh computer it's super like lo-fi and kind of like a little distorted on the voice and I don't know it it just sort of sounds like trash just sounds like garbage so screw Cal Church esta he is he's a terrible human being an absolute trash and not talented and stupid and an ugly and ugly - if you ever looked at his face you know what it looks like to stare into the face of someone who's really been beaten down with the ugly stick all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were met you know wasn't crazy about him wasn't crazy about him but they're not terrible certainly worth your attention worth worth your awareness a first fe has her first new track her first new single in a while a title drug was kind of a plinky glamorous somewhat dreamy little ballad that doesn't really go all that hard there's not really an aggressive point on it there's something about the production that sounds like really shimmery and futuristic kind of like a like freakin PC music production or something like that I like her vocals on the track again I thought there would be a point where it just kind of picks up and just goes more aggressive though I mean typically that's like her older stuff you sound like it used to be a little bit more bombastic but she's really kind of eased up on this track and it's a it's not a bad kind of low-key ballad you know even if the song topic itself is nothing new moving on from there ty Segall and white fence have a new collaborative project coming out titled joy which I'm pretty excited about because his last collaborative record with white fence is easily one of my favorite ty projects although to me this new single over here titled good boy just kind of felt like some generic heavily edited psych pop didn't to me read as essential or as low fires out there some of their older collaborative material you know again if you're like heavy into revolver era beetles and and stuff you'll probably dig pretty heavily on what on what the duo is doing here moving on from their own eco case Necco case came out with a new track over here titled curse of the i-5 corridor and it's a pretty heavy overwrought very lengthy ballad not as direct or as instantaneously catchy or as emotionally captivating I think as some of the other cuts she's released so far from this forthcoming album she's really really releasing a lot of tracks from this record this to me just sounds like a song that would have worked better as a deep cut that kind of grows on you as you listen to it more and more so I'm just sort of wondering how much of this forthcoming record is going to be spoiled before we actually hear it but you know it should be out soon it's just around the corner so there's this track again it's it's it's alright it's a very heavy dark ballad and just hoping uh the the rest of the record just kind of pulls through and kind of works together as a whole moving on from here the new Mitsuki track geyser is actually pretty good her music previously has never really stopped me in my tracks just felt like a very vague blend of indie and shoegaze and pop music and and just felt very nondescript to me and while this song over here wasn't really blowing me away because it did feel a little brief although I could see it working really well in the context of an entire record this song over here is easily from an instrumental standpoint one of her most triumphant tracks so does it work entirely as a single I wouldn't necessarily say so but again the build the progression of the track the instrumentation on the track is really really immense and actually pretty spectacular in a lot of ways and her vocals to me felt a little bit more tangible as well so even though this might not have blown me away as a single song it does actually have my mouth watering a little bit it does have me excited for where she's gonna be going next with her music because it does seem like she's maturing and kind of growing into her own a little bit and you know finding what is possibly her sound and kind of defining herself you know defining what a Mitsuki song sounds like moving on from there a new a new Adult Swim single from the one and the only Tim Hecker the song is titled rose light and it kind of reminds me of the somewhat textured and dissonant and noisy and kind of shirred ambient and drone compositions that he was doing on his virgins record way back so who knows maybe it's a bit of inspiration from that time or leftover from that time I'm not really sure either way it's a decent track sounds fine so you know if you really kind of enjoy that era of Tim Hecker's discography do give this track listen because you know it's it's certainly in that fame moving on from there which which track was this this was the I think the goth King track womb this band is kind of a nasty punky indie post-punk outfit with a really like sharp reverb II kind of effect on a lot of the instrumentation really brash bratty vocal delivery some wild freewheeling guitars it's maybe not as animalistic or as original as I would like but there's certainly a band to watch again goth the king the song is titled womb goth king dig it on this track quite a bit moving on from there Kristine and the Queen's has a new track out new project on the way the song is actually a collaboration with Dame funk and there's actually a French version of this song as well I believe it's a nice little track it's not quite as dramatic as some of the previous material I've heard from from this project of course with Dame funk being involved there is a bit of a very light synth funk vibe to it though I would say it's uh it's it's not a nostalgic throwback or anything like that which we typically associate with with Dame's music the since they're in they're heavy but it sounds very contemporary it sounds very sensual and it's a pretty sweet track overall and next Brooke candy with this song over here titled war Brooke candies music I've never really been super crazy about but I will say that this is like the first track of hers that really started to pull me in and kind of win me over I kind of like the rough and sort of heavy metal elements that are worked into the song the beat is absolutely bombastic I think her vocals are pretty great as well the one thing that kind of holds me back on the track is that the super edgy sloganeering type politics throughout the song they're just super reductive and kind of annoying but there is something about the track that kind of reminds me of mi a a little bit but again like a bit more of a edgy dark almost like metal kind of version of that I'm not exactly sure if this is a sound or a style that she's going to carry through on the rest of this forthcoming project but I don't know I certainly like the direction she's going in I certainly like the direction she's going in you know could the lyrics be a little bit more interesting yes absolutely but sonically vocally I feel like there are a lot of good elements here so and let's move on to the tracks that I felt were the best tracks this week the songs that really kind of grabbed my attention in a positive way really kind of blew me away or stuck with me first freaking this posthumous little peep track slash music video for chains with clams casino this is great this is  good I mean I know I've never really been crazy about little piece of music before I've been heavily critical and you know he dropped another posthumous track not too long ago I think with like marshmallow that I thought was okay but this is like the first song of his that I've really kind of like stopped me in my tracks and really kind of floored me and not just because of his super melodic but slurred and an ultra catchy hook on this one you know have the four chains I give to his brother so on and so forth but also clams casinos production on sting is incredible not only does it kind of feed into is typically very washy and cloudy and psychedelic aesthetic but some of the layering on this track is really weird and really experimental not only plays to the slightly edgy demeanor of little peep but also just sounds completely cutting edge for clams just in general so I mean if there's like more leftover stuff from these two getting together I would love love love love love to hear it because this was just an incredible little single super dark incredibly produced very trippy very strange so really digging on that track moving on from there Anderson pack bubble and God that's an incredible track man this is an incredible track like Anderson PAC I think a lot of people have always seen him as like part this part that part everything a bit of an all around or a guy who does it all but in a lot of ways this is just kind of strictly a rap song and a trap banger in that with a lot of eccentric samples and just kind of wild instrumentation Anderson pack on top of it is super  charismatic and just the music video this thing is insane but the thing is that that wild attitude also comes across in his lyrics in his delivery as well there's so much personality on this track so much of a strong fun incredible vibe but because Anderson pack you know he's not dumbing it down you know you know there's kind of a funny tongue-in-cheek smart somewhat satirical edge to a lot of what he's saying and doing on here just true entertainer Anderson pack total package and we'll leave it at that loving this track I think well we went backwards got to go forwards moving on from there oops moving on from there this is the new Nine Inch Nails song over here God break down the door a really interesting direction for Trent on this one certainly more experimental than a lot of the stuff that was on his last EP - underwhelmed me to me the song sort of sounds like a fusion of suicide and David Bowie like it's super still it's super repetitive it's very minimal Trent's vocals are very tense and it's an incredibly dark song with like some weird saxophone in there - I would love to sort of hear like an EP or a project of like him going down like this in this very dark kind of musical abyss you know this is stylistically is right up my alley this is like the kind of thing that I'm that I'm very into and it's really great to kind of hear him embarking on it because the production is pretty good but I do like the fact that he knowingly and and very caring Lee kept the sounds like very rudimentary in raw that we could have easily like with all of the yeah I guess everything is disposable he could have easily gone just overboard with everything that was on this track and I just uh I just can't really say enough nice things about this song I just really love the direction trends going and with this track moving on from there melodies echo chamber now melodies echo chamber previously is not really a musical project that that ever really grabbed my attention like just felt to me super bland generally but this new song desert horse and the other track that has been released in in promotion of this new forthcoming album are super weirdly produced and very colorful and odd pieces of psychedelic pop very creative and I just loved the tune on this one I love all of the weird extra bits of instrumentation and transitions like it's it's very very I don't know I just love the finer details of this track just very very very lovingly detailed and I don't know if I could say much more about it other than that try it it's a very fun creative bit of psych pop the vocals are great too so do not do not miss it this is not your usual psych pop pastiche it is some very interesting instrumental bits sort of work throughout this track very nicely moving on from there the new kerokero bonito track which I missed last week but now I'm sort of catching up with it this new song over here titled what is it time time today came with a new music video as well with sort of all these uh funny scenes and then what looks like a mental institution or something but um karekare bonito kind of going back to their synth pop again maybe not quite as bouncy or as contemporary as the stuff off of their kind of breakout album but still definitely more in a direction that I enjoy you know lesson that sort of lo-fi indie rock direction of their last EP although I would say this song is kind of sticking to that whole loaf eye thing and I think the balladry is is almost the same though I will say this track feels a little bit more memorable and cohesive and I feel that same sense of like sadness and longing in KK B's songwriting on this one yet again which I really loved on their last record their last album I mean which I really loved on that album but I guess it just sort of sounds a little bit different around this time around doing a bit of a low five bedroom synth pop thing yeah I'll leave it at that really digging the track moving on from their new disclosure single which I'm actually really excited excited about Alton ultimatum is the title of the track featuring malli singer phat oh I'm gonna  this up and I'm gonna try my best not to if I to Mata do whare I hope I hope I nailed the landing on that one again I apologize for not knowing that in advance but her vocals on this track are incredible the production is great the groove that bouncy sort of futuristic and in very bubbly house production that disclosure brings to the table all around just like a really great track and and I love that they're kind of taking it back to basics on this a little bit because I feel like they really tried to break the bank and go absolutely overboard with so many songs on their last full-length album which honestly like when this signal came out I was like yeah I mean their DB is really good did they come out with another I totally forgot about their last album I totally forgot about that sophomore record because it's such a mess and hopefully this next time around they're they're just a little bit more consistent I will say this track does have me really excited I hope they pull on some more interesting features just like this one and just take it back more in a direction that feels more like them I feel like on their last record it a lot of tracks just kind of felt like they were trying to keep up with trends and play into whatever the vibe or the style is of their you know sort of a list guest I would rather the duo sort of stick to their guns and and pick more interesting obscure creative features that people are hearing other places and and this song does exactly that great tune great feature great vocals great products really digging it moving on from there Death Grips oh my god this is so much better than frickin streaky black paint is the new song that they have over there in a very strange song for Death Grips because it sort of seems like the band is taking their very abrasive very industrial internet aged sort of neo hip-hop sound and taking it into like a psychedelic jammy direction and it wouldn't be the first time that we like heard Death Grips kind of performing in a way where they felt almost like a Little Rock influence to sort of like a rock band I mean that's kind of what Jenny death is to a tee but this to me just felt so much like looser like again that was like an improvisational element to it like a little more than usual especially kind of when you get like this jammy keyboard piece that just just feels really really strange like just very very uh I guess unique for a death grip song but they kind of pull it off you know they they definitely pull it off I don't really know what to to say outside of that I mean it's definitely not as thrilling or as blood pumping as you know like an inanimate sensation or something like that but it is really cool and it is really intriguing to hear Death Grips doing something different and doing it well too you know it was a little a bit of a letdown to hear streaky sound as predictable as it it did and it's nice to hear that the band still has more tricks up their sleeve up my sleeve I sleeve up my sleeve and and hopefully they have more of more tricks to come and finally a ybn Corte I believe this is the last track oh no we have a few more YB and Kourtney dropped this new song over here which is essentially a thematic response to Jay Cole's 1985 track you know two little pump and all the mumble rappers and so on and so forth and I really like it I think it's a really good smart reasoned response from a young rapper who has a lot to say about you know this whole old head you know versus new rapper and new generation kind of dichotomy and struggle that that we currently find ourselves in the midst of I think he says a lot of smart things about the the state of music currently I think it makes a lot of great points the flow is good sure maybe maybe the the song isn't so catchy because it gets bogged down in the message a little bit but I think his response is is a necessary one and and yeah you know I'm just gonna leave it that obviously the instrumental is is the instrumental you've already heard and everything but uh you know I think this is a really good performance I think this is a really good write that he's come together with here and you know to me a song like this is what hip-hop is all about you know when a rapper has something that you have a problem with  you take it on wax and you uh put it out there for everybody to hear and that's how you make your point that's what the music that's the art form is all about and he did it really well so you know it's not only great to hear that new up-and-coming rappers can can still pull that off still do it and it's it's nice to sort of see that a resurgence of that a little bit and and you know as happy as I was with J Cole's track originally I'm happy with this song as a response because I feel like he didn't necessarily put coal in his place but I feel like he sort of Illustrated that Jay Cole as well reasoned as he was because I don't feel like 1985 is purely a diss track I do feel like it's also an advice track I feel like ybn was able to illustrate that Cole was kind of speaking from a place of ignorance at least a little bit on that track with just you know not trying to understand where exactly sort of this new generation is coming from and and how they're expressing themselves and finally shout-out to Aesop Rock with Clutts this new song of his new music video as well you know it's it's a great track but doesn't feel too much like Aesop is is doing anything other than just kind of like dropping another kind of self affirming song kind of updating us as to where his kind of head is artistically at this point in his career you know a lot of tracks on here just kind of like self description of his eccentricities and his mindset in his worldview and that sort of thing so um you know you write about what you know about that's what Aesop Rock does you know maybe not quite as like weirdly topical as some of the songs off his last record but hey you know let's see what he has to bring on this new album and you know obviously flows still their production is totally out there as to be expected with Aesop and you know the the references the lyricism the entendre is just everything is deep as it is subterranean and it's glad that Aesop Rock is still able to keep it up keep it captivating and just keep on killing it so all right that's gonna be it for the weekly track roundup thank all of you for watching remember again we have our tour coming up the needle drop calm slash tour that link is down there in the description

J6CCJNs-Iso,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our lead us u of the Frank Ocean album endless I am here covering the CD quality version of Frank ocean's 2016 album endless Frank Ocean is a singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist someone who quickly went from odd future Wolfgang killed them all appendix to pop and R&B superstardom that transition was quick and miraculous especially considering just how little material he put out to get there and how long he kept fans waiting to finally hear his follow-up to his huge explosive breakout album channel orange with there being four years of release time in between that record in 2016 s blonde originally like the project was titled boys don't cry there were numerous like released a push backs Frank continually disappearing from the limelight again and again that again I mean this would basically be career suicide for any other up-and-coming artist but once he did actually hit fans up with new music in 2016 with the album blonde he also hit listeners with a visual musical art piece titled endless I guess to sort of add to the depth of this long waited release or get fans mouths watering for the blonde album I guess in retrospect I don't fully understand what Frank's motivations were in releasing both of these projects pretty much at the same time my first impressions of endless is that it was a sweet sad semi ambient experience but admittedly at the time my sights were more set on blonde because it seemed like the bigger release the more necessary listen the more pressing issue my original review for both records commended endless but mostly glossed over its finer details as I kind of wrote it off as a weird b-side oriented visual art experience of maybe just a lot of extra bits that didn't make the final cut of the album but upon closer inspection with this new release my feelings on endless have changed because this record is undoubtedly its own musical experience aesthetically in contrast with blond endless is far more Spacey dreamy even prettier there is a persistently moody vibe throughout this with an incredibly glossy reverb eachine on nearly every piece of instrumentation here it's not nearly as direct or self-affirming as blonde but I would actually argue that's part of endless appeal it's not really a deep longing stare into someone's soul it's more like a lack of eye contact actually while curling up in a ball under a sheet in bed in the throes of depression tumbling further into an emotionally dark psychedelic abyss where it's just hard to really get a firm grasp on anything as musical ideas and sounds kind of fade away or slip out of the auditory view of the listener repeatedly across the record transitioning into different sound palettes or musical passages we have a ghostly but idyllic Isley Brothers cover dejected rapt versus lo-fi Bandcamp beats dramatic acoustic ballad Rianne abstract neo-soul all kind of flipping by like a sketchbook in fragmented segments still single songs individual moments on this album but they're all kind of melted together pretty lovingly blurred into each other super aggressively even when there's a song on here that ends a little early or feel somewhat unfinished Frank is quick to throw in a musical passage or another song or a vocal snippet or something to kind of support the ending of that moment to bring it into something else it's like this beautiful gorgeous non ending endless compositional collage and while I know this record was not recorded in a bedroom a lot of it does sound a lot like very lonesome intimate Reaver be better and pop which gives the album a very distinct aesthetic and leaves the entire thing feeling like a distant memory even when you're listening to it right there now the entire thing works really holistically as a melancholy bliss some of the musical ideas are a little derivative and sometimes the lyrics might feel a little too frank and that some of the things he's saying don't feel that poetic they feel like just very blunt descriptions of feelings that he's having or situations he might find himself in or minor little details that he might just be making reference to for whatever reason I think the song Higgs is a prime example of that if we were to look at the lyrics clearly the lyrics on this track don't have much in the way of rhythm or meter Frank is just kind of going off at the mouth a little bit it's like a sad acoustic diatribe but the raw emotional performance that Frank brings to the track is actually pretty nice swap out for a much more structured and catchy and maybe more even-tempered song which blonde has in spades and don't get me wrong I love blonde I think it's a great record however I do find it kind of refreshing on endless over here to here Frank kind of performing on a tightrope without a net artistically speaking he's just throwing a lot of very raw ungroomed ideas out there and with some artists that can go very wrong kind of looking at you kid cudi kind of looking at you Miley Cyrus but in the case of Frank Ocean it works incredibly well especially since even though a lot of these songs don't seem to be all that fleshed out on the micro level he does a great job to make sure that they all work together as endless they all work together on a macro level so while blonde might have the better single highlights like solo and pink and white and self control I'm actually finding endless to be equally addictive for its emotional and sonic cohesion not necessarily for how tracks like Xenon's and comme des Garcons x' and unity might work individually I would say the one downside to this record is that there are some songs and there are some moments that I do wish were longer or developed a bit more because it would have brought a higher emotional peak on the album of which there very few I mean it's all a very interesting beautiful engaging stimulating experience with how much Frank kind of throws at the listener across the runtime of this record but a lot of it does kind of breathe by without much in the way of an overall progression because if you put this album on an infinite loop you could probably drop in at a number of points and the experience would be vaguely the same though the Isley Brothers cover is a really great start but so could a number of other tracks on here be but overall with endless I am incredibly happy that I picked up a CD quality version of this thing and gave myself the opportunity to go back and really soak it in because it was it was kind of difficult to do that with it being released the same time as blonde because in doing so I definitely respect and admire what Frank did on this album so much more and also just really loved the fact that he was able to come at this record with a totally different creative mindset than he did on blond and pretty much have it be an equally fulfilling experience in some ways creatively conceptually stylistically this has even more diverse than blonde as it seems like Frank is experimenting with more instrumentation more genres more samples weirder sounds and effects and transitions which is definitely up my alley personally though I could definitely see why most people would enjoy the blonde experience over the endless experience I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

X0ACL1CRIKs,[Music] [Music] hey everyone its Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ski mask the slump god mixtape thing beware the Book of Eli the South Florida madman ski mask the slump Todd he's back if you've been following this channel you know that I've had high hopes for mr. mr. slump God for a while ever since he blew me away with some of the tracks on last year's you will regret mixtape now what made some of the tracks on that mixtape so special slump gods super speedy lightning fast flows hilarious gross similes his really animated one-of-a-kind delivery his spazzy ad-libs and the deranged jittery and abrasive trap production that he typically hops on top of one issue though is the tape was kind of on the short side the slump God ended up reloading the thing with singles and other tracks he released afterwards which overall improved the quality and the flow of the tape quite a bit however I do wish some of that material actually ended up landing on here instead songs like catch me outside and baby wipe there were also a few tracks on this thing where I felt like ski mask was kind of swapping out his unique one-of-a-kind delivery and flow to make something a bit more auto crew knee a bit more trendy overall this tape just read to me like a decent project from an artist with a ton of potential so now comes in beware the Book of Eli which has its own set of pros and cons absolutely this tape is more consistent than you will regret originally was ski mask seems to have a firmer grip on what exactly it is that makes him unique as an artist and he hones in on that with hilarious one-liners really odd reference points dropping lines were you saying that he wants to spoon this girl like add animals or slurp her like a go-gurt or on the opening track to this thing where he's rapping about a girl looking him up and down like an elder scroll or him saying that his diamonds are cleaner than a baby dog's tongue I'm at yo head like a hair so in Hyden seek where's your hairline going your bitch icky Vicky that hoe got the cooties only time I would touch her when I give her noogies either that or what I'm trying to rub off one of my boogies honestly that's just the tip of the iceberg on this tape when it comes to how ludicrous ski masks lyrics can get overall I wouldn't say the substance and content to what ski mask is saying is all that different than a lot of his contemporaries from the SoundCloud set from the trap banger set but he definitely sets himself apart from all of them with the supremely weird way that he delivers it all coming out rapid-fire on these insanely tight triplet flows enhanced by equally speedy and in twiki ad-libs and incredibly explosive production on the opening track to this thing lost souls I don't know whether to laugh my ass off or just go wild just the idea of drowning someone in the river of lost souls in the chorus of this track I don't know just just kind of feels like a different experience also loved the ultra distorted trunk knocking beat on this thing eerie warped sense I mean I'm not crazy about rich the kid I find him to be one of the more generic rappers out there currently but he does keep the energy level high when he does feature the song run features production from Timbaland surprisingly I love the eerie little woodwinds since he throws into the track it's yet another moment on the record including the opening track that seems to play into this idea of magic mysticism almost like fairy tales I mean just look at the cover of this thing it looks like a child's fantastical storybook now even though this track lasts like one minute and 47 seconds which is not the only track on this thing that lasts about that length of time but still even with things being as short as they are on this project slump God makes a genius use of his time by just being hyper focused on the structure of these songs because in under two minutes he still gets in an intro two verses and two choruses which I guess goes to show that with him rapping faster he can finish songs faster the diaper intro gag at the start of the song throwaway is quite literally throw away but still this song is another highlight for me in the track listing here especially with ski masks like weird warped contorted fro a repetition chant on the hook throw away throw away throw away throw right why I cannot even make my voice do whatever the hell he does on the track while this is one of the more low-key tracks in the track listing it's really just oozing with ski masks eccentricity even when he pumps the brakes on a song just a little bit he's riding the fringes so hard then we have the unapologetic banger coolest monkey in the jungle obviously in reference to that whole H&M hoodie ordeal there are a few bars on here as well as on other tracks to where he's kind of poking fun at racists or making fun of her threatening the KKK and on this song yet again we have references to witches and him being a wizard more allusions to magic and fantasy it doesn't come up on this tape so often I would say it's a concept but it definitely brings a vibe now this track like many others delivers more gut-busting verses both ski mask and his feature on here make reference to you family guys Quagmire's key catchphrase giggity and while the feature verse on this thing may not be as amped as ski masks it certainly has a similar twisted sense of humor the song suicide season features this slow dreary eerie be definitely another cool down moment on the album the sample of which I can't play sounds like something out of a an old children's storybook cartoon but now flipped into a dark suicidal trap banger with ski masks making reference to sex making his his desire for death kind of melt away I wish the song we're a bit longer given that it is one of the darker moments on here and that the lyrical tone kind of matched the instrumental vibe of the song a bit more but still the track is pretty much a highlight for me another song child's play I mean when it comes to aggressive tracks on here this track is just it's easily the most insane of the bunch 5k 10k what I make today God that refrain is an earworm and just the rumbling bass the distorted over driven bass on this thing damn it the song is murderous weird hyper aggressive the Chuckie references on the hook are funny now I will say that there is a bit of a lull in the middle of this project which I mean for a project of this size you really don't want it's just 20 minutes it's just 10 tracks you can't really afford to have a lull the song do I have the sauce has a very cool vibe very cool flow some of the lines on here are highlights like him saying that he wants to bend that the letter C or him saying Sesame Street I'm a monster for that cookie however there are also some erykah badu and cow jumping over the moon lines and references that really could have been much funnier don't hit quite as hard and overall across the entire tape I'll say that the two verses on this song or maybe two of the least eccentric here and then there's also the matter of the hook the a halt halt halt yeah the chorus is mostly ski-mask kind of saying aha rhythmically and it wouldn't be the only repetitive chorus on the record but it just seems so off-the-cuff and just I don't know just thrown out there it's weird but I don't know to me this track just kind of falls flat flatter than every other song here anyway a lot of these same issues kind of transfer over onto the song geeking but with a different vibe a different style as this is yet another slow moody autocrine ballad and while I wasn't head over heels for it and yet again it feels like a moment where ski masks personality takes a backseat to the style the trend the sound that he's chasing after he does do a better job with this sound and going in this direction though then he did previously so that's good I actually still kind of hear him on the track doesn't sound like a Travis Scott ripoff just a bit more personality length and maybe even a feature or what could have made the song so much better as far as the finish of this thing goes ski mask mostly sticks the landing bukake and dapper dan don't bring much to the table that previous tracks didn't already though I will say dapper Dan's quotables are much greater than that of bukkake not to mention on that closing track we're having another unnecessary rich the kid feature here this one seemingly less interesting than the first overall though I really enjoyed this tape I really loved a vast majority of what was here and I don't know it's just like a really killer short deadly funny creative out-there dense entertaining and totally cracked project that I certainly recommend ski mask has definitely improved since his last project he's clearly gotten a better sense of the direction he wants to go into and as good as this project is I'm seeing still more potential in what he's doing I just hope he continues to take what he's doing here hones it finds ways to improve tracks like geek and if he is going to go in that direction and finally on his next drop just puts out something a bit more substantial because while I really enjoyed listening to this tape simultaneously I just feel starved with ten tracks with 20 minutes I'm starving I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

uNAm2pFDgBA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Arctic Monkeys album tranquility base Hotel and Casino this is the sixth full-length album from Sheffield rockers the Arctic Monkeys who originally broke out in the mid-2000s off of the incredibly smart and spunky album whatever people say I am that's what I am NOT the band's next album was noticeably more mature but still a decent record but as the Arctic Monkeys have continued along their creative trajectory the band's music has only become more and more drab transitioning away from the dance-punk roots that they rode in on and more into like this warmed-over Britpop alt rock sound that just doesn't really have much oomph to it a change I could totally see myself being fine with if this energy was being swapped out for better songwriting or something but in the case of sukkot and sea and the band's last album that most certainly is not the case the band's previous album a.m. is easily one of the most boring lifeless and uninteresting rock records of this decade it's pretty much been a five-year studio album break since the release of that record and God did I need it because I still talked to my therapist to this day about the fear the lingering fear of around the corner' at any moment an Arctic Monkeys album could pop out and bore me to death it's gonna be okay and me don't get upset it's gonna be okay little baby boy so now the band is back with a brand new record and a brand new sound to it a sound that a lot of fans were hitting me up saying hey hey you might like this one sounds nothing like their previous stuff or hey this is the worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life get ready I wouldn't say either of those points are really valid or invalid personally I fall somewhere in the middle I mean certainly the band's sound on this record is different it's much more showy and glamorous and piano-based with lots of themes of ego and fame and XS explored in the lyrics and the Monkees play out this style pretty thoroughly across the entirety of this record I mean really beat these themes and sounds into the audience right from the get-go with the song star treatment which is a really ritzy dreamy piece of piano pop with Alex Turner singing about doing two shows a day four days a week just wanting to be one of the strokes the track kind of sounds like a lounge nightmare or like a bad Adam Green song without much in the way of a tune or a sense of humor or irony even though the music on this record is clearly coming from an ironic place right from the start with this record my impression is that I don't hate the angle I don't hate the sound I don't hate the style I don't dislike what the band is going for I just feel like I've heard it done before much better whether that be an ironically by the artists who pioneered a lot of these lounge sounds or by other songwriters later who would use this same kind of instrumentation to deliver a bit of satire or commentary you could even say father John misty is pure comedy does a better job of saying something interesting over really luxurious instrumentation things do seem to smooth out a bit more on the next track one-point perspective the instrumentation does a much better job of hitting that nostalgic g-spot and from a satirical standpoint Alex Turner's vocals have a much better balance of legitimate passion and enjoyable camp the tune on this track shines much brighter too it doesn't just get bogged down in Alex's I don't know dramatic performances the song American sports instrumentally conceptually is a fantastic transition sounds like a really dramatic piece of piano backed William Shatner esque spoken word with like a dash of timbre tambour influence yes the Canadian band timber Tambor I actually do think that's a legitimate comparison at this point on this record because I feel like this record and much of that band's discography has a similarly surreal and Anwar take on a lot of these vintage lounge and vocal pop styles which is especially the case here as Alex's lyrics get a bit more narrative and there are some more psychedelic effects and delays popping up in the mix I would say the one major hitch on the song is just the sudden ending the title track is a really odd bird in the track listing here it has these oddly intimate vocals super close almost claustrophobic there some intricate bass and guitar works some really crisp drums a nice harpsichord ish type of arpeggio kind of playing in the background the track instrumentally feels almost progressive especially as this kind of jammy growling synth lead pops up in the last leg however the pacing and the structure of the track is just really odd unnecessarily complicated and the hook is just unforgivably clunky tranquility base hotel and casino the track has a vibe but even at 3 minutes it doesn't feel like much of a song which might have something to do with every passage of it feeling like it's in a constant state of introduction like it never really truly resolves into anything it feels less like a track on an album of really any sort and and more like the theme song to a historical period drama with a mystery angle on the BBC and if that were the case I mean it would be a hell of a theme song but not much of an album cut the song golden trunks features some fantastic vocal harmonies which really steal the show some of the best on the entire album they're tight they're angelic they're trippy they're little beetles esque but it's yet another moment on the album where the songwriting and the execution just leaves a lot to be desired the structure of the track is not really that muscular when certain parts begin and end feels a little blurry the loud and buzzing guitar leads mesh with the vocals in a really messy way kind of drowning out a lot of the backing instrumentation and just overall the song feels blobby the song 4 out of 5 is not only a sturdier song but again a funnier moment on the album I'll remind you that continually throughout the tracklist Alex Turner's lyrics are always referencing Fame and popularity and basically the the downs of the limelight with the title four out of five I think you could probably guess that this song is very much about reception and perception there's definitely a really glam luxurious Elton John vibe to it especially is the band's vocal harmonies pile higher and higher and higher I especially love the funky dark guitar passages that kind of transition the track from one section to the next now at the midpoint of this record I'm kind of hoping for Arctic Monkeys to just find more ways to fill this sty allow and just completely explore it so this album is a bit more enjoyable a bit more consistent and feels less one-dimensional but as much as I may enjoy a lot of the tracks on the back end of this thing instrumentally the song the world's first ever monster truck front flip has this total psychedelic Beach Boys esque Sunshine pop sound to it the song science fiction is a painfully dramatic spot on this album that sounds like a moment of sad clarity in the middle of an exploitation film with like a horror angle maybe something where somebody is hunting down sexy ghosts in the 1970s and she looks fun might be one of the weirder and most quirky spots I love the weird in unison chanting sure sounds like fun vocals that are repeated throughout the song the track also features these heavy thunderous massive piano and guitar leads that just crush down on the mix every time they hit it's oddly groove - and features some really weird sudden instrumental transitions that kind of lighten up the vibe a little bit with all of these weird changes in just the brazen oddity of the track it reminds me of something that even could have been on the new Jack White Album boardinghouse reach seems like there are a lot of to thousands rock artists out there who are just completely going off the fucking creative deep end and I mean even if every result from it isn't amazing I'm glad it's happening but as I was saying before even though I enjoy a lot of these tracks instrumentally I feel like Alex Turner often takes away from these songs more than he actually adds his singing isn't always great I mean clearly he is aware of his vocal limitations and is mostly kind of playing into this style as an act he's clearly trying to overcompensate with just absurd theatrics on every single one of the songs here and either they just aren't enough to make his vocal performance passable or he's just leaning on it so hard it just gets old not to mention that these same theatrics kind of take away from Alex's focus on a sensible melody on a lot of these tracks - the lyrics also add to this because it feels like Alex doesn't have much in the term of rhythm or meter to his singing a lot of the time he's just trying to pack ten pounds of words into a five-pound word sometimes it just feels like the music on this record the only purpose it truly serves is to just be a platform for Alex Turner to be striking Elvis poses on top of it while doing air guitar windmills with hands full of like Liberace sized glitzy rings hotel-casino overall I wouldn't say this record is a rough ride I wouldn't say I hated it it was certainly more entertaining and more interesting than the band's past few records I love that they're trying to something different and I guess I love the target they were aiming at but is it a flawed album yes is every track great absolutely no I'm pretty indifferent on the whole thing at the end of the day honestly now after this record I'm really not sure what to expect I mean I don't think that this record is going to be the Arctic monkey sound and style from here on out this was clearly a deviation and a big one at that I guess I just hope the band continues to experiment and wherever they lay an ex tit it sounds less thrown together I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe hit the bell as well and over here next to my head is another video that you can check out Anthony

nWcEHLFmKdE,"hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new beach house album 7-7 is the seventh full-length album from the Baltimore dream pop duo beach house over here consisting of Victoria Legrand and Alex Cali a band who I was a pretty big fan of in the late 2000s because I mean hey they were dropping some of the best in the genre but as significant a moment beach house was for Dream pop and for indie according to me around that time frame I was almost on the cusp of completely tuning out of the duo's music after their last couple of releases it just started to sound like the duo was running out of ideas not only on their album bloom which sure it's one of the more solid and consistent records but it just kind of sounded like a hi-5 version of the trademark sound the duo forged on their first two records with the distant drum machines and romantic guitars and Victoria Legrand's just really slow beckoning vocals all the dreamy organs all the reverb I mean again it was good it was a decent record but kind of a letdown after the incredibly versatile experimental and exciting teen dream just a few years earlier now the following depression cherry felt like even more of a dip in quality it was not only devoid of any new sounds or ideas but somehow Victoria and Alex came out of the tail end of this record with not much in the way of compelling songs either and thank your lucky stars which came out the same year felt even more unnecessary the recordings on this project were even more off it just kind of felt like the duo was just making a record out of the cutting room floor I mean maybe calling this record the cutting room floor is sort of unfair but I'm just not sure how else to explain the severe an obvious drop in recording quality and songwriting quality I mean even the b-sides and rarities collection the beach house dropped last year which are actual legitimate leftovers sounded much better than this album so while in one breath it felt like it was going to be difficult to maintain any kind of excitement for any Beach House album going forward 7 was legit looking like it was going to be something kind of different because every single tee's toward the release of this album actually sounded kind of experimental for the duo and it's no wonder after finding out that beach house actually brought on spaceman three's peak camber to do production on this thing Pete who is also a multi-instrumentalist and has released whole catalog of music under names such as experimental audio research and sonic boom and has dabbled in the likes of drone and alternative rock and space rock even electronic music so as a sound sculptor Pete's reputation is fringe and his resume is long which in my opinion is exactly the thing that beach house needs at this point in their career a new sound of fresh sound a new direction please for the love of God and thankfully a new sound is what they have on this project not only is the production and instrumentation on this new beach house album refreshing but it's also dreamy haunting thick textured colorful and luscious it feels like beach house has matured from making simple dream pop into kind of fusing pop together with shoegaze this album is nearly as versatile as Teen Dream it's easily their most adventurous set of tracks since that album and maybe their most stimulating album since that album and not just because of the sound of this record but the songs are sounding kind of revitalized to the song dark spring is a killer intro to this album with lots of patient percussion droning keyboards a wall of guitars that has a really light but rough distortion on it these eerie breathy vocals as well sounds like Alex and Victoria singing together it kind of reminds me of like a black moth super rainbow song but without the faux psychedelia and kind of gimmicky bells and whistles there's also a subtle schmaltz on the instrumentation and the melody on this track too it sort of reminds me of elevator music but maybe if the elevator were going up to heaven the song pay no mind flows really well out of the intro track it's a nice cool down after the noisy storm of serenity on the intro with lots of slow-motion rhythm guitars it kind of sounds like an unwound piece of alt rock it's got a lot of space it's got a lot of ambience but still the guitars and the instrumentation are very very heavy they're still super tangible not too much reverb not too washed out the incredibly resonant guitar chords match incredibly well with the super breathy lead vocals kind of whisper quiet the track is as euphoric as it is orgasmic I also love the slinky synth leads that kind of bounce back and forth paired with the persistent high hats on song lemon glow as the song plods along it also features these apocalyptically distorted and sunburnt and buzzed out wailing lead guitars kind of playing back and forth in both channels it's pretty trippy and it's one of the tracks on the record that features a somewhat intense finish with these guitars some marching snares kind of reaching a fever pitch the song Lincoln U is one of the more vast and open tracks on the album the vocals maybe a little buried on the track which does take away from it a bit I do think the sound for Beach House is just a little typical or predictable but still with some extra effects and instrumental layers it sounds like beach houses usual stick but sounding Cathedral sized it's a bigger more massive beach house like not not like a two-floor beach house but maybe a six floor 6,000 square foot beach house this is one of a few moments on this album where I feel like beach house is kind of resting on their laurels a little bit but they get away with it by adding a few extras or progressing things just a little bit however that's not the only point on the record where the duo seems to be playing it safe for example the song girl of the year features much less in the way of surprises or really anything interesting however on the song drunk in LA the dramatic songwriting of Beach House classics like heart of chambers returns especially with the super rocket of imagery coming out of Legrand's lyrics on here talking about horses running through her mind wanting strangers to be hers climbing the Eiffel Tower also some really nice instrumental layers on this track - as it progresses with Alex Cali pulling off these nice sweet harmonized guitar solos now the song dive is kind of like the ten-mile stereo of the album both songs have a fantastic momentum but this one doesn't kind of show it's it's full hand until later in the track after the midpoint dive sounds like a mirror interlude at first with super washed out keys and vocals Victoria seems to overdub her voice so she has kind of this call-and-response effect with their two voices the track seems to get more and more blissful heavier and heavier more and more intense until the instrumentation starts to melt away revealing this super heavy incredibly aggressive sequence drum pattern then these grinding guitar with a nice kind of rough distortion on him with this kind of driving route no riff it really holds down a steady groove on the track and I don't know it it seems like a really interesting mix of My Bloody Valentine like a little new order being thrown in there slow dramatic synth pop seems to be a prime influence on the song whoo as well even if maybe songwriting wise it's not one of the best tunes on the record black car to me felt much more compelling even if it's not as peppy a tune the song's intro features these plucky chilly synth leads that sound like they could kick off like a track on Bjork's Vespertine after this the song slowly blossoms into one of the coldest and most dreary on the entire tracklist although I think it could have used a stronger outro and maybe more direction after the initial instrumental build because eventually the song just sort of begins to coast out without Victoria or Alex adding much more to it the song lose your smile tries to translate beach houses typical sound to like some slow warm sunshine psyche rock guitars and stylistically it mostly works the problem is is that this song is really one of the most lifeless on the entire record really the pacing and the way that the verse kind of flaccid ly transitions into the chorus it's really one of this album's true moments of stagnation the song last ride though which is the album's outro is one of the most epic of the bunch it stands at six minutes and creatively brings us together these 60s girl group dramatic snare tambourine drum patterns together with the large sprawling soundscapes of like a great experimental ambient drone it takes a while to kind of build momentum up but it's a great meld of styles that really only a duo like Beach House could pull off overall I think 7 is a pretty good dream pop album and definitely a bounce-back for Beach House in terms of quality and adventure I do kind of wish they went a little more all-out though because it does feel like they came up just short of pulling out all the stops there are a few tracks where the songwriting sounds a little half-baked or Alex and Victoria are painting themselves into a corner once again with their usual sound still though I'm happy to hear the duo come back with one of their better records in a while and I just hope they keep up this sense of adventure on future albums I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this project transition have you given this album a listen did you love it it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another beach house review you can check out hit that up and yeah that's it beach house Anthony Fantana forever "
eXm3ODioS80,hi everyone scream finish reet Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new playboy cardi album die lit this is the debut full-length album from rapper double XL freshman and ASAP mob affiliate playboy cardi who is coming off of a somewhat hot 2017 with a kind of successful self-titled mixtape and his breakout two times platinum hit song Magnolia even on this single track alone cardi proved himself to be a new face to be reckoned with in the rap world even if I wasn't crazy about his debut tape or I thought that his double XL freshman cypher performance was really underwhelming I still named magnolias one of my favorite singles of the year my 50 favorite singles of 2017 video and why why is that why did I do that not only is Magnolia an insanely infectious song but also to me at the time it felt like the logical conclusion to everything trap had been trending toward for like the past 7 years the hypnotic production the ad-libs the repetition all culminating into this raw euphoric psychedelic energy it just felt like the next step in this new wave of rap minimalism and dial it is essentially an extension of that but this time er find a little bit more because on this record it feels like cardi has a better appreciation of what exactly makes his music tick or has at least found better ways to create kind of an entrancing vibe and in a way it's kind of inspiring to see how much feeling he conjures on these tracks with so little in a way die lit while not a perfect record it is a reminder of the power of simplicity the song fell in love with Bryson tiller I think is a pretty prime example of that again maybe if we stay on the surface of this song and just pay attention simply to the lyrics the track doesn't seem like much but it would only be a trick to convince ourselves that there's nothing else going on here I mean with the light splashy cymbals and the ghostly skipping synth chords the reversely melody is the gentle trap drums and cardies kind of entrancing distant flows the song is actually incredibly relaxing its blissful it feels like it's kind of creating the feeling of love itself and Bryson tiller slightly loaf I feature actually adds quite a bit to the track I think it's one of his best features in a while and it actually adds to the weirdly surreal vibe of the song now in my opinion this is one of many track on this thing that is worthy of compliments in a closed ear really the only points on this album that kind of leave me feeling underwhelmed are when a song is so short it's kind of hard to get into the vibe or when lyrically and instrumentally so little is going on that I kind of feel this sense of stagnation in the track songs like old money in foreign and middle of the summer just a little too on the short side also with the middle of the summer the lyrics I think are just a little too vapid to ignore the song pull up I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with while it is too simple to really celebrate I do kind of like how brazen cardi is in just packing the track out mostly with these weird little high-pitched mouth gun sounds pew pew oops no time I think could have had a lot more going on that actually did and the song Love Hurts as well as a song that was tough to get into at first featuring Travis Scott again because they're just instrumentally is so little going on but I actually think this moment kind of switched for me a little bit because it's another moment that is so brazenly minimal that it's like why it's like really challenging themselves to just be rapping over almost nothing after a track like this I think it's kind of hard to argue that cardi is a rapper who is dependent on a beat to make him sound good because I mean his lead vocals and Travis's lead vocals and their ad-libs make more sound in the mix and the beat itself so with the exception of those tracks that I'm either a little weirded out by or slightly underwhelmed by a majority of the songs on this thing I think are quite good I'm pretty enamored with just how uncomplicated and catchy a lot of them are and not to mention cardies supremely effortless vibe his very strange nasally cadence and tweaked-out flows the song long time features these really nice gentle cycling warbly synth chords cardies hypnotic flows are kind of enhanced by his ad-libs which bounce off his lead vocals kind of like a nice sharp delay it's a nice silky serene intro to the album kind of sets the tone for the whole thing really well the song leaned for real features these epic and subtly ghosty synth chords this repetitious mantra of being on beans for Rio being on lean for real being on beans for real being on lean for real it's one of many extremely psychedelic moments on the that are actually overwhelming skeptics on the track is pretty decent he breaks up what could have been a lot of monotony on the song his performance is pretty cutthroat so that's nice and then we have the song shoot of featuring little Aussie vert which is not only significant because it's one of the better tracks here but also because featuring with cardi was a pretty important moment for cardi back in 2017 in a way cardi and Uzi are kind of artistic kindred spirits also with all the glamourous Chinese synthesizers and strings all over this track once the beat eventually kicks in it sounds like a trap Christmas I'm a song poke it out we have Nicki Minaj featuring who for a second tries to get into cardis style by throwing out you know some weird vocalizations and ad-libs eventually she gets a bit more lyrical with some creative references to Apple phone FaceTime cardies music Magnolia but really what kind of sells the song or the quirky synth leads they have a bit of a woodwind tone to them and of course the ear worm refrain poke it out poke it out poke it out poke it out the song home kod is a track just filled with all these bitter relationship bars the cycling instrumental is so tight and so I guess anxiety inducing it makes me feel like I'm trapped in the same bad relationship that Carly is rapping about the song mileage features another synthetically gorgeous and in luscious instrumental and I guess I also want to mention this track because cardi rapping about not being interested or not caring about how many partners significant others had before him by way of saying he doesn't care if your pussy has some mileage I mean I don't know seems like a watershed moment for feminism and the trap genre to me yeah it's a point on the flatbed freestyle cardi kind of Wow's me with these weird nasally vocalizations I think he kind of squeezes his voice into his upper register in some pretty weird ways that makes the song kind of entertaining definitely in odds stand out it's moments like this that make me feel like this album is legitimately dipping its toes into experimental hip hop and the song chopper won't miss not only has a decent young thug feature on it but it also kind of feels like a bit of a musical sequel to Magnolia the beats are eerily similar cardi references that track and borrows the same flow from it but this time it just feels a little nastier I guess and speaking of nasty the song our IP features some of the most aggressive bars on the entire record snatching people's chains and and all that there's some weird sour descending synth lines on the cut and some really grimy deep distorted bass and pretty much that's it for highlights for me I mean a lot of good tracks on here overall while the record may feel a little bloated at nineteen tracks and carty sound his style does stretch a little thin because he doesn't do that much with it also with things being is oversimplified as they are cardi doesn't do a whole lot with structure on some of these tracks but that pretty much does it for my complaints on this record overall I think there's a lot of creativity here it's pretty one of a kind project at least right now until maybe dozens of other artists copy exactly what David is doing and I can certainly see the temptation to do that going forward because while what kardi is doing here is incredibly simple from a technical standpoint it's probably incredibly easy to just write off entirely but there is an especially intoxicating catchy and almost mind-altering quality to the simplicity of some of these tracks that I just can't get enough of I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well when you sub over here next to my

EsAxL7d-aCE,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I go over a bunch of Records that I didn't have time to do a formal review of gauntlet style and yeah you probably have seen an episode of this before you know what you're getting into so let's not even tease it any further let's just get into it let's go I saw a lot of buzz floating around this album and of course with it being labeled as like this Ethiopian jazz revivalist type record my interest was piqued but actually listening to it I don't know I like the aesthetic and I like the vibe of the record the instrumentation sounds like really raw and organic the recording may be inadvertently so sounds kind of psychedelic but the performance is my opinion are just like a little rough not quite as tight or together as I would like them to be often it kind of takes away from the performance and the groove aspect of the songs but still if that's not something that disappoints you all that much if that's not a huge factor for you I highly recommend this because I mean in Tambor and in style alone there are a lot of Records like this that I've heard this year so I would say give it a shot out of pure morbid curiosity [Music] unfortunately this new Denmark Vesey project just kind of left me scratching my head I mean his previous efforts have felt a little bit more fleshed out and together and sensible in my opinion even that by Muay drugs attempt at doing like an industrial hip hop thing which while it didn't connect with me it still was pretty listenable and I saw the hype I got why people liked it so much this however just kind of feels like a handful of tracks which have been mixed by Earl Sweatshirt mixed by knowledge and then after these tracks kind of blow through many of which are sort of super lo-fi kind of jazzy kind of difficult to describe because they feel so nondescript he's come out with such bold or music in the past before and then he follows this up with like a really weird short heavily sample-based beat tape that just kind of goes a few minutes and I don't know as a listening experience it's not very fulfilling it's just kind of okay maybe just kind of a thing to hold the fans over before he has something bigger coming down the pipe I hope but how many projects deep are we with tennis Shea and she's still yet to deliver a sound and a style that feels like it's uniquely her like for the most part with the exception of a few tracks here and there that sounds super super poppy and trendy a lot of the cuts on here are just super slow moody artsy R&B just kind of generic there's so many other artists making this sound right now doing it better doing it with more Flair more style better lyricism more interesting production it just sort of feels like she's still at this point behind the curve in terms of songwriting in terms of vocals in terms of production it's just kind of disappointing yet again because she successfully presents herself as being bolder than she actually is this new prof album I was pretty curious about given some of the teaser tracks to it and I've enjoyed some of his music videos in the past I mean he's really zany out there character I mean if you love a lot of Eminem's earlier stuff where he's just totally off the fucking rails and he's off the wall and it's really cartoonish like you'll most likely get into profs music and this newest record over here is no exception although there is a bit of a change in sound this time around I feel like he works with his singing voice a bit more on this record which is kind of a double-edged sword because it adds a lot of personality to this record it adds a lot of silliness a lot of tongue-in-cheek attitude to this album but yeah I can only take so much of his singing because it's not like it's that great so beyond that we have a lot of heavier banger trap style production which he's clearly just trying to keep up with the Joneses and much of it isn't really all that bad you know it's it kind of keeps the viscera of the album high one of the few things about it that's consistently great that and his energy on the mic but I feel like there's a bit of a drop in lyricism on this record he also puts out some bars that you can tell he's trying to be funny but they're just kind of warranting eye rolls for me personally like this one line when he's talking about being the shit and needing a diaper and so on and so forth the album is a little lengthy and bloated too you know somebody who's like this I like you on the fucking edge all the time I can only tell you so much but still there's some good performances on here some decent song topics some decent production as well it's not a bad record if you like your rap music a little animated and eccentric then it's probably worth trying out and shout out to rhyme sayers for putting it out yeah I didn't really expect too much out of this project because I thought that teaser tracks were just okay they just kind of sounded like structureless generic bangers that you could find on a number of Santa profiles and lo and behold that's in fact what it was some of the features come in and kind of bring the energy of these tracks up but for the most part the songs on here just like really aggressive really short not a whole lot to them they catch kind of a vibe they have a hype they have an energy to them but there's not a lot to it beyond that I feel like with this project you could kind of get what it's delivering on a lot of different records on a lot of different mixtapes on a lot of different internet profiles you know it's not really bringing anything as significant as like smoke perps dead star project not too long ago so yeah I mean it's okay but just kind of feel like we're painting ourselves in a corner a little bit no I'm not listening to the news sting and Shaggy I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna do that no shoutout to this all-girl Spanish garage poppin punk band their new record is out and it is full of fun vibes full of attitude if you're kind of looking for a summery carefree rock record I highly recommend it however for me what kind of takes away from the album is that the loaf I proceeded to really be as low Phi as it is primarily the distortion and the recording comes from just like the really fuzz doubt super volume boosted vocals which I feel like with better mixing could have just sounded good could have been more fun could have been less abrasive while I don't mind abrasive music it just sort of seems like something that just didn't really need to be as harsh on the ears as it actually is it's fun or it's interesting for a song or two but for the length of an entire record even with this being as short as it is it is a bit of a nuisance that and I guess their songwriting isn't really that diverse but still again if you're looking for a record that you can just kind of zone out to have some fun to put on at a party you're out cookout sun's out guns out that sort of shit out with your friends then pop it on give it a listen it's worth shot as conceptual as elevators one and two might be and as topical and narrative base to some of the tracks on here may be yet again I feel underwhelmed by a bishop album and that mostly has to do with just again his delivery and his vocal style there's just not a whole lot of flavor there's not a whole lot of spice to it I mean sure he has a baseline of talent he has flow he can spin a yarn but beyond that I just feel like the beats on here super bland his performances are just very so so very run-of-the-mill very jazz rap run off it feels like he's just kind of borrowing from a lot of the more underground hip-hop artists of the 2000s the whole Stones Throw thing and and beyond and just kind of I don't know breakdancing on its grave I'm not trying to be mean with the guy but it just feels like he could be doing more with it than he actually is next this new jack latter album Jack is a songwriter he's a guitarist I've seen him play live with the one and the only Alex Cameron whose album forced witness last year was one of my favorites so of course given that connection I really wanted to try out his newest record over here and I liked some of the teaser tracks to it and it's not a bad singer songwriter record it's very slow it's kind of despondent it's moody or at least that's the vibe it gives off especially in Jack's very deep husky pronounced vocal style seems like very very very Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds influence but it's not quite as aggressive or off-the-wall or anything like that think of the more mellow side of the Bands spectrum aside from that influence kind of being worn on Jack's sleeve the only thing that really kind of holds this record back for me is just that I feel like some of the performances in the instrumentation occasionally and his voice just feel a little stiff a little awkward kind of like he could be adding a bit of drama or something to what he's doing despite a lot of these songs seeming kind of dark there just isn't a whole lot of emotion translating for me because again it just seems like the performances are a little sterile even though I wasn't super crazy about the last black moth super rainbow album which came out a long time ago at this point I still kind of went into this thing with high hopes because typically tobaccos solo stuff is pretty decent but still I kind of feel like he's continuing to use this project to just dive into the same low five super psychedelic beats with the whispery lead vocals there's just not a whole lot to the band's sound at this point that isn't just a played-out gimmick I know that sounds harsh but I really do truly feel like BM SR is in dire need of some kind of revamp or revitalization I mean at this point I feel like I look forward more to tobacco albums because at least there I know that he's gonna change things up a little bit try something different get a little bit more experimental but outside of this album sounding maybe a bit more mellow and ambient in comparison with other black moths super rainbow records there's not a whole lot to report I mean I would say even with this change it's a bit of a downturn in a way because with things on here sounding so dreamy and formless the songs really do kind of lose any sense of structure or like even a pulse so I mean if you're kind of looking for something that sounds sort of like psychedelic very dreamy kind of bubblegum sort of sweet but isn't demanding that you paid too much focused attention to it then I guess give it a shot in one breath I can definitely give it to the body on this one because this is easily one of their most experimental records yet with all this extra range instrumentation some very cool epic female vocals some cleans on here that are kind of hellish and interesting and dramatic but at the core of a lot of these tracks you still kind of hear the same blown out beats apocalyptically distorted guitars and bass and and whatnot and those blood-curdling scream vocals though they just like give me this intense sense of anxiety that it just sort of sounded like somebody who's trapped in a fucking dungeon and I want to save them and I mean these elements have have been the bread and butter of many a body album prior and on some of the early stuff it was really thrilling it was really exciting but at this point I feel like it's it's gotten stale it's been stale for a few records now and I feel like that's no less the case on this new one over here I mean again sure with these vocal and instrumental additions things are a bit more interesting than they've been in the past and I also do give them credit for being as out there as they are on the new collaboration that they did with full of hell typically I do hear some pretty interesting and experimental ideas on a body album but again these core elements that I've just talked about there's not a whole lot to them they're not very dynamic and I feel like they add a lot of lulls to the band's newer records because these sounds I feel like have been completely explored by them there's not much they can add to a record with this handful of very limited very distorted very abrasive sounds that they haven't added to their previous projects it just feels like deja vu it just feels like a lack of imagination I've never been a huge Y Oak fan but I do give the duo credit because I think this transition that they made from this really slow dejected indie rock into more of a bass guitar and synthesizer bass sound has led to a lot of good qualities I think their songs are a bit more lively a bit catchy or a bit more vibrant still their sound and their delivery in my opinion leaves a lot to be desired but I feel like this new direction gives me and maybe other people a reason to give them another Shai if you've never been crazy about their music before it because in a way they sound like an all new band still not a new band that's blowing me away or anything but still a new band with a new great direction as much as I enjoy a lot of early Kool Keith as much as I enjoy the first doctor octagon record and as much as I appreciate that album for being the mark on hip hop that it is especially inspiring artists like MF DOOM I don't think it's controversial to say that with the project's come back on this new album over here it's just kind of a if you don't use it you lose a type situation and not the cool keith has been on a hiatus since dr. octagons first record certainly not the case but clearly with the years and between that first record and and now something has gone missing because this is not nearly as exciting or eccentric or as off-the-wall or as ballsy I think as that first record and maybe has something to do with context - like does dr. Octagon sound because I do think they try their best to stick to it as as hard and as I guess closely as possible does their sound make as much sense in 2018 as it did back in 1996 probably not the hardcore fans are most likely going to go nuts for it but with as much time as it's been since the last record I would have hoped for something that sounded a bit more revitalized in terms of like quality of material this almost feels like a step down not only is it just lacking in anything new and exciting but also just you know side-by-side comparison Pepsi challenge one tastes much better so this band landed in my lap by way of a recommendation that somebody threw me on a live stream and I was pretty impressed on my first listen I mean there are elements of The Strokes in this band's record there are elements of that kind of obscure lo-fi indie rock band women in the spans record it's kind of noisy it's kind of catchy there's a gutsy quality to the performances on this record the vocals come off a bit generic and overall their sound is a little dime-a-dozen when it comes to the Lofa indie set but still I think there's some good tunes on here and if the band continues and sort of works toward doing something a bit more unique aesthetically I think this could be a group worth watching into the future so again if you're looking for a solid loaf is indie rock record with some good tunes give this thing a shot skaar Lord is an artist who I've been watching for a little bit now he's one of the biggest things coming out of the UK in terms of hip hop right now and he has a style that is all his own that is like this fusion of new metal and scream oh and trap sure you could say artists like xxx fantasy own and a lot of other artists and the SoundCloud set are also doing something similar they are but I feel like scar Lord brings up those metal and metalcore influences those screamo influences so much better than a lot of his other contemporaries do I also think there's an animalistic a primal intensity to his performances on these songs the screaming the the problem is as a record though when you hear all these songs back-to-back-to-back-to-back there's clearly a very plain formula and gimmick to what he's doing and it's very very edgy and it's not as deep as it could be I mean certainly there are some tracks on here that feel like a commentary on how dark and shitty and despond in the world is but outside of that it's almost like you're kind of hearing the same beats the same flows the same delivery on every single track scar Lord as unique as he sounds when you first happen upon him he is a bit of a one-trick pony that's not to say that he doesn't have great ideas though and that he's also not just kind of a product of the music landscape that he's coming out of but I feel like going forward if he's going to maintain his audience and also gain new listeners he's gonna to change his sound he's gonna have to diversify somehow or else he's just gonna be known as the guy who sounds like this only sounds like this and there's only going to be a certain amount of shelf life where this kind of thing is marketable where this kind of thing makes sense shout out to carnage over here he's a producer new record out a lot of good solid features on it excellent one for Mac Miller excellent one from little beyond here excellent one from little pump that I shine track that I love so much is on here there's some great features on this thing a lot like that latest record from Ronnie J it just sort of seems like carnage is trying to keep up with the Joneses in the trap in the auto Cruden scene at the moment his production is super freakin heavy super bass centric while there are some features on here that shine out more than others I won't say there's anything on here that really ruined the record and it feels like most of the time with this type of music the production really does steal the show and he does have some very good beats on here I will say the way he eq's and mixes sounds everything is so loud everything is so vibrant everything is so in-your-face some of the more mellow and melodic cuts on here though don't quite make as much sense with this hyper aggressive production style they also kind of lead to some underwhelming spots on the record still though I do think it's one of the more solid producer curated records that I've heard in a while and if you were in the mood for some bangers certainly give it a shot ashen and that's it for this edition of the why you know review have you listened to any of these albums did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out check that out or the the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana forever 
OgJkBKiIVsM,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for another weekly Trek roundup where I go over what I felt really best in the worst tracks of the week are you excited you better be because I'm excited first let me say that I had a new speaking engagement tour coming up in June a bunch of East Coast dates we're hitting up New Jersey New York Virginia North Carolina Tennessee Georgia and we're gonna be adding another date to this soon there are general admission and VIP tickets available down below this is my first US tour a series of US tour dates you know all stacked together it's kind of one date after the next and a lot of these venues do have a hard out which is why these VIP tickets exist because it's gonna be before the show we're gonna hang out pics meet and greet autographs and that sort of thing if people ask for that which they often do and also the people who sign up for those tickets will also be getting a special piece of secret bonus content day of show that I cannot sort of spoil the the nature of which right now so bonus content I promise it's gonna be a very special piece of content that that you will be very excited about once you know what it is the day of show and yeah that's it general mission meet and greet link for information down there and in tickets below or just the needle drop comm slash tour the link is the needle drop drop comm slash tour the needle drop calm slash tour also a lot of these venues they are on the smaller side so if you do want tickets if you do want to be there do try to get them sooner rather than later and that should be it let's get into uh of course the Amazon and turntable lab associate links they're down there too if you feel like treating yourself especially with that turntable lab link at yourself oppressing of a record I reviewed or a turntable or some speakers the channel gets kicked back from that supports the segment supports the show supports turntable lab makes you happy because you're spoiling yourself and let's do it worse tracks him let me let me clear my throat because we have quite a few worst tracks to get into alright okay let's do it alright first ooh this new ty dolla sign track one of his trashiest singles in a wild generic beat really nondescript vocals for him from him usually his singing is a bit more impressive and some some pretty corny bars from 21 savage I mean typically his stuff is pretty cold but I don't know he just feels really off the mark on this song really all in all there's nothing all that's special about this track which is really kind of its its greatest flaw moving out from there girls new track from Rita Ora featuring cardi B baby raha Charli XCX unless I'm pronouncing a baby's name incorrectly and if I am I apologize but there's actually been a quite a few people commenting negatively on this track over the past few days when it dropped Friday and I could certainly see why I mean it's not just because it's a generic piece of radio pop with super glitzy production and the vocals are like cleaned up to the point where they feel almost alien but also just the theme in the nature of the track it's all about women's sort of feeling this physical attraction to other women and wanting to kiss them but the thing is it's kind of more along the lines of Katy Perry's I kissed a girl it's not really about same-sex love or anything like that it's just kind of this I guess attraction in a way where it's it's kind of like it's kind of like watching a lesbian porn but clearly it was shot and made for like a straight man to watch it it's it's it's not very uh I I guess queer for a song about girls kissing other girls it just sort of seems like a bit of a stereotype and more something for straight people to kind of you know dabble in or for straight people to gawk at because it's a it's like titillation it's it's it's a pretty cheap track honestly um not not very impressed with the content of the song and I don't know just feel it just feels a little tone-deaf honestly just feels a little tone deaf moving on from there a DJ mustard who is now known as just mustard or at least on this track anyway teams up with Nick Jonas on this really awful generic piece of just radio pop tasteless production did not think DJ mustard would ever put together an instrumental like this though I guess it's nice to see that he has you know more than one ace up his sleeve and Nick Jonas sounds as as boring and run-of-the-mill as ever there's really nothing special about this track just awfully bland awfully uninteresting this new track from little baby and Drake features Drake just barely and little baby's vocals are borderline intolerable the track is titled Pikachu and hey you know it's they can't all be winners can they and then we had this new John Mayer song a new project on the way this track is produced by no ID of all people and the track is titled New Light and again just a really kind of lifeless piece of pop John Mayer matriculating away from the whole guitar rock and the singer/songwriter thing and trying to go more synthetic more pop friendly and I don't know just the the the usual suspects that typically make a John Mayer song uninteresting to me also show up on this track over here despite I guess his best efforts at taking on a new sound because vocals are boring performances just lifeless super moody for almost no reason and I don't know his voice and his delivery just don't really match the instrumental I think no I DS production is probably the best thing about the track but John himself is about as interesting as a glass of spoiled milk and I think that's going to do it for the worst tracks of the week we're going to get into the mess section over here tracks that I wasn't super crazy about but are certainly worth shouting out this track over here from this band called spiritual cramp this band I saw had this track premiered of the Stereogum so shout out to those guys and though this is kind of a nice piece of reverb II heavy post-punk II and just art rock shit with a just very passionate vocals though they're a little buried in the mix it's kind of low five but the performance is gutsy the band has teeth and that's definitely got me looking forward to a whatever they're gonna be doing after this also just love that logo also that police state title there it's kind of it's gnarly it's gnarly as fuck so I'm kind of like in the bands attitude moving on from their new track from LSD of course that is labyrinth SIA and Diplo with their new project over here this track is titled audio not quite the vibrant kaleidoscopic banger that their last single was but still a pretty but a bright and fun diverse pop song yeah I mean again I kind of feel like if they keep putting out tracks like this they're gonna paint themselves into a corner and we're already going to know exactly what this album sounds like before it even drops so hopefully they're able to show a little bit more diversity in the next single a little bit more versatility I guess is the word that I want to use because it sort of seems like between this track and the previous one they have a bit of a formula going and I don't know Diplo is nothing if not formulaic but I I guess I'm still willing to kind of wait and see what happens wait and see what happens moving on from there Joe G has a new track out titled yeah right new EP or new project coming in June and the song over here I think is a bit of an improvement on the material on his last record while I wouldn't say his vocals are you know make me go over the moon or anything like that there's still super low-key having said that there is much more structure to this track I think than a lot of the songs prior on the on the EP dropped like super early this year the vocal melody is actually pretty catchy as well so I will say in terms of song right there's definitely a lot more going on than previous and yeah that's it just kind of looking forward to what he's gonna be doing in the future and you know how he'll grow as an artist because from what I understood some of this EPS material may be older and he's had this second release planned for a while I actually thought I was gonna come out earlier this year so now it's it's finally hitting soon and you know I guess we'll just kind of hear what he has to bring to the table once it's out there moving on from there Dave Matthews Band new project on the way Dave Matthews Band whoo I used to like some Dave Matthews Band when I was a kid this new song is titled samurai cop it's not a terrible track it's not a terrible track I'll say if anything that holds this song back it's that the instrumentation the production it's a little super clean it's a little bland it's a little flavorless you know Dave's vocals are pretty passionate and pretty amped up on the song and the songwriting kind of has this slow swing almost gospel type quality to it I do like that influence quite a bit I think it plays out well in the song the chorus is nice and explosive there are a lot of good things about the songwriting of the track I just the thing I just don't think the sound is particularly great I feel like previous recordings had way better production had way more bells and whistles this seemed just a little plain and a little too sterile sonically in my opinion but I don't know hopefully we hear a bit more gussto from DMB in the future moving on from there the new Courtney Barnett song which he just dropped a music video a music video for Sunday roast is not a bad winner or I guess unless this tracks been out for a while now although I don't think it has could be wrong on that but it's kind of a nice low-key ballad it's it's not a terrible track it just sort of seems to me like a track that's a especially with its placement in the track listing is gonna mean so much more as like a finisher than it is just like as a single song you know it's not a bad listen it's not a bad listen it's kind of a slow sad but lazy and just kind of laid-back indie rock tune still looking forward to that record and finally Chromeo with bad decision um you know chromeo stuff it still kind of got that swagger it still got that suave demeanor but I just feel like they're their latest tracks they're just produced to death man they're produced to death like you're kind of losing some of the the nuance and the flavors and everything is so bumi and loud and aggressive that I can't really enjoy the sound of any of the instrumentation any of that old-school classic synth funk synth pop shit they do so well I don't know I mean maybe it's something that will sound better once I hear the entire record but so far even at their best I feel like there's just something that's kind of missing in in this new batch of tracks it's it's unfortunate because chromeo has always been a group while gimmicky I thought has made some really entertaining sweet sexy catchy music and I'm just not she's not getting that vibe this time around unfortunately all right well let's get into the tracks I felt the best best best best vain holy crap fan recommended this band in my inbox this week and I'm glad that he did this track over here is titled virus colon slash slash vibrance this band has kind of a super old-school like Dillinger Escape Plan type sound but there are some electric elements like worked in there very subtly it's super abrasive very heavy intense performance just a fucking great metalcore sound like it's very indebted to some of the genres classic bands you know you you think metalcore heavyweights from back in the day like Dillinger and botch and obviously converge and that sort of thing and and clearly they're pulling from that but man they do so well sort of uh reviving it in a way so much so it just kind of makes you want to sit back and see if they kind of grow into their own a little bit more but still as is with this one track it's it's a fucking roller coaster ride so thumbs up to this shit this was great I'm moving on from there a Rico nasty Rico freakin nasty with Kenny beats with this new song over here titled rage love this track rego nasty is like bringing this ultra aggressive just uh I just badass fuckin teeth clenched brand of trap that I'm liking a lot a lot of people have been sort of comparing it negatively in in in in my experience on social media to to scar Lord get out of my face with that shit you're wrong you're ridiculous scar Lord is a one-trick pony as much as I do enjoy some of his tracks that new mixtape that he has out it's so one-dimensional I can't even handle it Rico nasty has quite a few songs with sort of different deliveries and stuff this track over here is easily one of her most aggressive granted and even scar lord is not the only person who's doing super aggressive trap right now so again give Rika the the the attention and the respect and the Kudo she deserves on this track because it's a fucking heavy hitter and she just sounds gnarly as hell on the song it's it's a gruesome gruesomely produced track and I don't know it's just uh it's just kind of a new metal goth killer trap banger and I just cannot wait whatever for whatever tape she drops this year moving on from there lump so lump is a new musical project featuring a member of this experimental folk act from the UK that I enjoyed a while ago like years ago I used to enjoy their shit named Tong who brought together elements of like electronic music and full can just like kind of weird post-production and strange experimental edits and Laura Marling is doing vocals on this and it's actually a pretty out-there experimental an interesting track I mean I was a little underwhelmed by what Laura had done recently in terms of solo stuff because I feel like in a way we've almost reached a point where it's just kind of become predictable this is is just way more left-field and way more surprising I love how Express of an odd her delivery is on this track I think it's just kind of the the really kind of the kick in the pants the new spark that both these artists need needed to be trying something new trying something different so if you're looking for some beautiful folk music contemporary folk with a somewhat experimental edge but not so experimental it's a turn-off you know it still feels like a good song it is a bit on the long side though so do get ready of that do get ready for that it is it is a thoughtful patient and cerebral track it's a cerebral experience so getting to this song sort of understanding and expecting that moving on from their kin which is a synth pop band from the west coast who prior in 2014 when I last heard like this band come out with an album I was just super underwhelmed by it just didn't strike me as being special or interesting in any kind of way shape or form like some of the songs were kind of catchy but outside of that like it just seemed a little average and I'm not saying they've kind of become the most distinct project on the block with this new song over here which is a excuse me it's titled strange embrace I'm not saying they become incredibly unique and original on this track but the performance is incredible its electrifying the song is amazing it's a great sort of 80s throwback but even though it's a bit nostalgic just that performance the songwriting is so good it's just instantaneously catchy and I'm really liking it so even if kitten does not become much more original than they are now if like the performances and the songwriting remain as good as they are on this single whatever they have coming down the pipe is gonna be quite good moving on from there John Wayne has a new sort of Adult Swim single out which he is also released as its own little solo thing on Bandcamp the track is titled last last fall and it is a grimy piece of lo-fi hip hop with John Wayne's usual mix of witty sharp but also kind of moody and introspective bars are really kind of loving the production on this track loving his voice loving his delivery really kind of loving everything about it so again hardcore John Wayne fans or you know if you love that sort of underground mellow music group or Stones Throw type sound do not miss on this track do not miss it it is good as shit moving on from there angelique kidjo has a track out which is a cover of Talking Heads classic track once in a lifetime and believe it or not she has a record on the way which is just a cover of Talking Heads remainin life so pretty ambitious undertaking Angelique is actually originally from Benin she's been coming out with music for years now and again just a pretty ambitious undertaking for her to do this whole musical reimagine ation of Talking Heads music which is not only ambitious just from the standpoint of any artist because it's such a huge out in such a classic album but it's actually pretty fantastic that she's kind of taking it back because Talking Heads back in the 80s when they were recording albums like this were influenced by a variety of African music styles and now she's really kind of like bringing that music back to in a way its origins or at least its its inspired roots it's it's one of its major musical cultural influences and I actually loved this rendition of the song quite a bit like her vocal take on is really interesting one of the things that has always kind of bugged me a little bit about once in a lifetime as much as I love the track as much as a remain and light is amazing is that with the chorus the bass line and the bulk of the instrumentation because you know it was at a time when David Byrne and and you know we're like you know assembling these bits of loops of music on a computer so there probably wasn't a whole lot of opportunities to change up what you were making or doing so the fact that everything kind of remains the same as the track shifts from different parts of the song is a bit of a turn-off for me and it's actually amazing that with all this live instrumentation Angelique is able to kind of you know move the sound of the song around a bit and you know just kind of like change instrumental flavours as you have different sections of the track so in that respect you know I I love this version I love this take and you know I just love how vibrant and organic and lively the the performance and all the drums are it's just a really excellent excellent cover moving on from there Andre 3k is back he has dropped two new tracks on Mother's Day and his has also released an announcement that I guess in you know in some kind of capacity he's he's back at it I guess we may see some new material soon maybe album I don't know now Andre 3k obviously an excellent artist somebody who I think should probably come up in the top five conversation more often even if he is in a duo okay even if he is in a duo now for a long time people have sort of wondered well why why have we not heard more solo material from him he's so talented he's so amazing why is he not making more music why we're not hearing more music from him I feel like what we're hearing here on these tracks may in fact be why we haven't heard more material from Andre and that is that the music that he's making here is so not what people expect of him not at all I mean the first track is very heavy painful and interesting piano ballad though not sung and performed in a way where I think most people would instantly recognize it as andre performing and then the next track over here which i like even more no montana look ma no hands is really intriguing and strange jazz track so i mean is this the direction artistically he is going and if it is i personally would be really interested but you know maybe this sound this direction is going to turn off a lot of people who are younger and maybe are coming into it with certain expectations they want to hear rap music they want to hear something new they want to hear something current and even old heads and old hardcore fans to who you know why hear the old shit wanna want something familiar you know andre sounds like artistically he's going wherever he wants to go so far sounds good it sounds interesting it sounds gorgeous but will the fans take to it i don't know and i think i'm gonna leave it at that though those are the tracks of the week that is the weekly track roundup thank you very much again we have a link to our tour down there in the description box so if you want to grab tickets to that sorry to everybody who's in the Midwest or West Coast we are gonna do more tours in the future you know short bits of dates and we'll you know hit those areas at some point soon but for right now those East Coast states are looking fresh they're looking great they're looking fun and I'm gonna see you guys on those and I will see you guys also in the next video all right love you love you love you Anthony Fantana forever 
cX9qqFGrDX4,hi everyone singularity Palar oh here the Internet's the busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new John Hopkins album at singularity this is the fifth solo album from electronic music producer based in the UK mr. John Hopkins okay what are you some kind of dork some kind of geek what some kind of smart glasses guy okay all right okay err professor smartypants you're a nerd you're a geek yeren unless talked about John Hopkins music I think five years or so ago with his album immunity when his futuristic tech house fusions were kind of colliding with his classical music leanings a super solid electronic music record which most fans would probably categorize as one of the best of the decade and even though I'm not as head over heels about this record as many people are I will not deny the hype around this album there are a lot of fantastic tracks on it but ultimately I just failed to see how this album was greater than the sum of its separate linear IDM mini Suites but I think that's exactly the issue John tries to smooth over on singularity if you will allow me to go full tiny mixtapes here and throw a definition or a quotation into the review in the mathematical or physics sense singularity means a point at which a function takes an infinite value especially in space time when matter is infinitely dense as at the center of a black hole and I cite that definition because that is the vibe that is the feeling that it feels like John Hopkins is is certainly trying to achieve with this music at least in a musical or a conceptual sense in just how holistic of an experience this album is and just how infinite and linear a lot of these compositions feel now singularity might carry a lot of the same musical aspects that John's last album immunity did however I would say in comparison it's a tad more progressive and cohesive clearly he tried to make this album a more seamless and cinematic experience but while this album is deeper than your average Electric Daisy Carnival DJ set don't make a mistake in assuming that John isn't working with a clear formula on this album he most certainly is I mean how many moments on this album are depend entirely on these warped Cynthia skipping into infinity across an astral pond a propulsive techno rhythms with a heavy house bounce I mean a great deal a great deal of moments neon pattern drum the title track emerald rush everything connected really the whole first leg of the album and after this handful of tracks John suddenly transitions us into like this ambient triptych where all of a sudden his production and his musical pieces get so much softer and more formless the song COSM certainly calls back to the glimmering ornate very serene IDM that he was dropping on his 2009 album insides we also get some droney and ethereal tones on the track feel first life a song also features like these really ghostly beautiful angelic chorus vocals calling out another beautifully cinematic moment on the album it sort of sounds like new-age music I can get down with and given the title I mean I really do kind of get the sense that he's trying to make this piece be about the birth of something and it's a moment on the album that certainly feels great it's a good cool down after the incredibly intense everything connected the song echo dissolve is a really lonely and still piano piece it's a sweet simplistic moment on the record one of the few tracks that truly feels like an interlude a transitional moment but the piano is not entirely alone tour the back end of the track there are some very dark subterranean bassy rumbles that kind of remind you of just how gargantuan the sound and the frequency scope of this record is even in its subtlest moments John tries to hit you with like you know some kind of interesting sound play which if there's one thing that John really kind of leans on as far as creating the magic on this album it's it's really that the sound play the sound design the song luminous beings is the most gargantuan song on the entire record standing at 11 minutes which eventually coasts into another minimalist piano piece recovery that finishes the entire album out a track that I don't mind but still kind of feels a little redundant at this point for a few different reasons I mean compositionally it's not really that stunning I feel like it doesn't really bring anything to the table that previous piano centric parts brought and considering we just went through these several ambient pieces just before we hit luminous be it feels almost like we've kind of boomerang back into that spot rather than kind of finishing the album off at a high mark it just kind of feels like an extension of the compositional fizzell that kind of ends a luminous beings off which overall in the tracklisting while it's not one of my favorites it's still kind of one of the more standout tracks it has some very good pacing I do like the way that John melds some of the more synthetic and organic sounds in the mix on this track the fractured piano arpeggios and the hypnotic beats the droney distance synthesizers and after the halfway mark there's even kind of like a post-rock ish string breakdown I do wish it was a slightly bigger finale for the record though as after this string break the song kind of coasts out into this more serene set of beats and scents that are just kind of mild by comparison with the first leg of the track it does feel overall kind of like John front-loaded this record with his most gratifying hard hitting and fireworks like tracks and then at the halfway point while I don't mind going in a more mellow direction the more easygoing side of this album fails to conjure any moments that are as powerful as the first several tracks still though I do mostly want to compliment the flow of this album overall while it may seem like what John is doing on these songs even on the first leg is super simple on like a micro level with the subtle progressions and the rhythmic repetitions the epic layering of instrumentation the blatant use of reverb and various effects on a macro level and how all of these songs work together and kind of build off of one another in one large overarching musical experience I think that's really where this album sees success I mean quite a few songs on here on their own sound larger-than-life but hearing them add up together in this tracklist makes the statement seem even grander I love the slow epic build on the title track that kicks the album off incredibly well the fuzzed manipulated and constantly evolving sinfully that takes over the majority of emerald rush and the droning orgasmic rush of everything connected my issue though is that this flow I think kind of breaks up a little bit during this ambient trio of tracks where the momentum built by the previous cuts gets obliterated especially on the song cosm I mean after this spot on the album the record is a decent listen but it's no longer the continuously exciting ascension that it was up until this point all that being said though I still think singularity was a very good listen an album that reaches for the stars for a good part of its tracklisting but then maybe ultimately realizes it's stranded here on earth I'm feeling a decent 2stronk 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you

1K6l7wIuOHg,hi everyone nuclear deal here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the brand-new Wiley album Godfather - Wiley is a UK grime legend guy who's been in the game for a while now I covered his last full length album Godfather last year he has a very long and storied career and the grime scene over there this decade has been a pretty fruitful one for Wiley he's been dropping a lot of records many of which have been independently released he's finally been getting a lot of recognition in the hip-hop scene over here in America he's had one relatively solid album after the next and he kind of topped it all off and away with godfather last year a record that was not only lengthy and epic by grime standards but a record that also celebrated Grimes culture and history as a genre as well as Wiley's role within it as one of its bigger artists there were tons of bangers on this record lots of interesting features and verses great production so given everything I liked about this record of course I was looking forward to hearing Godfather - what I assumed was essentially going to be a second helping may be an extension of the narrative as it were but after a handful listens to this thing I'm just having like a bit of a head-scratcher because I'm not really seeing how Godfather 2 is really the lyrical The Musical or even the spiritual successor to the original Godfather I mean it certainly starts that way with a handful of pretty mild bangers many of which sound like they could have slipped into Godfather's tracklist and sounded pretty snug they're pretty at home like the song been a while which features an instrumental that has a lot of big drums rattling high hats huge grand orchestral hits eerie synthesizers as well as Wiley's trademark staccato flows with tons of rhymes about bars and vibes his vet status and his experience in the grime scene the song I call the shots is a little bit more strange instrumentally but still very fulfilling still very visceral it's some cold-blooded boss  also makes a very smart lyrical reference to these genres of music that that are inspiring this style with Wiley talking about jungle and grime being fuse like a mixture of boxing and may again a pretty solid and enjoyable track even with lyrics on this thing like BBK is the squad without us things would be odd the song bar features an instrumental with lots of aggressive bass and whooshing synthesizers kind of sounds like it's touching down on some of the musical roots of dubstep in the UK I'm sure I'll get a lot of angry comments in the comments section if I'm somehow off with that lineage and the song remember me even though it's not the most fantastic lyrically it still has a pretty sharp sung hook but again outside of these tracks it's kind of hard to see this album's connections to the original Godfather project because it's just 36 minutes long features a fraction of the songs the rest of the tracks on here are nowhere near as gritty as the bulk of the material on godfather as a lot of the tracks here just kind of seem like a fusion of pop and grime pop rap with a lot of simple love songs to this record I don't really see as being a celebration of Grimes roots that its predecessor was either not to mention some of the lyrics on this thing are far worse than that of a lot of what was on godfather some like vodka or lemonade some like tonic and gin and of course that's repeated twice for some reason even though the structure doesn't really call for it my ringers been off for years because I don't want to hear it Rea if I hear my jam in a dance I put my hands in the air and sing and on this very same track while he drops a bar about doing things not to be on trend and he's not trying to be trendy and so on and so forth even though Godfather two easily has some of his trendiest tracks ever especially when Wiley drops that auto tune sung hook on the next track all the time you can't tell me that with this awfully sung hook he's not trying to be trendy there's even a bar on the track still standing where he's talking about oh I was chasing a check at one point in my career but now I'm chasing art even though this and a lot of other tracks on here are like some of his least artful what is happening on the song over it on this album it just sort of sounds like you're on this moody introspective Drake thing on a sad dance hall beat if that's not trendy I don't know what is there's some kind of awkward features on here too like Maurice more on the same song still standing his performance is noticeably less smooth than that of pretty much everyone else on this thing just generally the guest singers on things seem as generic as possible to appeal to as wide and as pop centric and audience as possible I mean I do appreciate the flow of the tracklist kind of getting a little bit more romantic and personal and introspective and moody as the album goes along which might make it a more digestible listen for people who are so much into grime or like a little bit more pop rap in their life or who live for the prevailing trends that Wiley works into this record but it just seems like going into this project there wasn't much of a question as to whether or not these songs are memorable are they well-written do they actually play to Wiley strengths mostly the answer to that is no a big fat no and as a result this album is really just a mixed bag I'm feeling a strong four to a late five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your tire of you next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts hit the bell is well and over here next to my head is a another video you can check out at that upworthy link to subscribe to the channel I will see you guys the next one forever 
fxDjKGGCYRc,
GlToEXQO2yc,hi everyone my canoe off Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rae sremmurd album Shrem worse REM REM life 3 the third one the third commercial album they've dropped as I've said this is the third full-length commercial album from from from from sway Lee and slim Jimmy aka Rae sremmurd and not only is this thing their third full-length album but it's also separated into three discs the first part is a collaborative effort from the duo's respective members sway and Jimbo and then after that the whole album splits off into two separate discs with each member kind of taken over a disc sort of like in a Speakerbox love below kind of situation they're really the outcasts of the trapped generation now when going into this three disc Odyssey I was kind of torn because in one breath I liked the duo second album quite a bit it wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either had a lot of great single tracks on there like black beetles and start a party shake it fast with Juicy J and look alive there were a lot of great forward-thinking kind of cutting-edge weirdly produced rap bangers on that thing that played to the duo's boyish delivery and style their their youthful aura and honestly even though this was not a perfect project I could kind of see the duo going up from here creatively maybe not in a lyrical sense but maybe more with them kind of finding out ways to write weird or catchy or songs so I did have that in my mind going into this triple disc experience but then again it is three discs of music from race Rimmer who we already know going into this thing don't have the artistic versatility or the lyrical fortitude to handle an entire 100 minutes of music and keep it interesting from start to finish maybe their chances of pulling through are better than that of me goes on culture too but still the odds are kind of stacked against slim Jimmy and Anse way now still there are some great tracks on this project with sticky production and super catchy hooks charismatic vs. decent features as well however most of these songs land on the first disc of the prod we're sway and Jimmy are pretty much greater than the sum of their parts hey kind of like you and me best friends forever two peeps in a pack you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray there's no good especially when Jimmy and sway are on top of these Mike will made it beats that feature some co-production from the likes of tm88 rock 30 Zito vain' Metro boomin and many many many many many many more there are plenty of highlights on the first disc like the song up in my cocina which has a very eerie atmosphere on it banger track beat some very like suspended creepy like horror movie synthesizers jimmy and sway come through with those boyish vocals dropping these super laid-back chill flows braggadocious rhymes with very absurd and playful references another highlight for me on this thing is buckets featuring future another total banger back with these sour kind of disjointed piano keys fumbling their way underneath one of the most cutthroat verses that Jimmy drops on the entire project futures appearance on this thing is relatively solid I mean I don't know if you have to try rapping too hard to sound impressive or sound like a doing a good job on a race rumored album but he certainly sounds like he's doing the bare minimum I love the song 42 if not just for its instrumental its flow and it's strange European sizing references in the hook it sounds like experimental obscure lo-fi 8-bit soundcloud trap the song Powerglide featuring Juicy J is another highlight on here truly psychedelic enveloping song super dark super surreal and Twp is even a song that even though I wasn't crazy about it as a single it did grow on me a little bit the first disc on this thing has a great vibe to a lot of solid tracks I mean it's not perfect by any means there are a few low points the song closed featuring Travis Scott would be a total waste of time if not for the instrumental in the Travis Scott feature has one of the most obnoxious hooks on the entire record you see a no se you see a Louis E to me perplexing pegasus while I do love the flows and the instrumental on this they don't really do too much with it there's not a necessary hook on this song at all it just kind of feels like they strike a vibe and they just kind of leave it there until the track is over and bedtime stories featuring the weakened this has to be able zwarst feature ever he's literally mumble singing his way through the song I guess you know there is mumble rap he's he's pretty much invented mumbles singing here but still considering all the pros and cons of the first disc it's still a pretty decent listen I mean I would say it's a strong 6 to a 7 it's mostly on par with everything shred has done up until this point it's on the following two solo efforts that things start getting really rough especially on vacation which if you are familiar with sway Lee's contributions to Rae sremmurd in the past you can probably go into this disc assuming that this is gonna be the more melodic atmospheric and smooth of the trio and ding-ding-ding you would be right but it is the most excruciating listen of this three disc experience because for the most part it doesn't even sound written it just sounds like sways vocally riffing over these spacey trap beats and that's it there's very little in the way of anything that sounds like a finely crafted tuner that it was even preconceived it's so impromptu not only are the performances on this disc super weak especially on the song red wine which features one of the most awkward vocal performances on this entire thing it's like suede didn't even know what he wanted to do going into the track but I can't imagine how anything on this record was even drafted because at a certain point when you've drafted the song Guatamala for the fifth time you had to have realized that this is a really tasteless attempt and trying to fuse trap with Latin pop not only down to the melodies and the generic bead but the trash lyrics honestly the second disc of this thing in my opinion is absolutely horrendous and one of the worst listens I've had this year of anything and all things considered I pretty much feel like a strong one on it now the final disc of this thing handled by slim Jimmy the Jim trow is better measurably than sway keishon but not by much it has its shortcomings as well because while it does hit harder it has meteor instrumentals a lot of which again are brought by Mike will made it with some co-production and Jimmy's delivery on this thing is definitely more attention-grabbing and aggressive than what's way offers on sway casein he's not so versatile a rapper they can handle 30 minutes of a disc on his own even with a few features and keep it interesting I actually think separating him away from sway highlights just how little personality as an individual artist he has because there's a number of tracks on this thing where he sounds like Young Jeezy for some reason but like even Young Jeezy when he was younger had a very husky raspy voice it's like Jimmy kind of strikes that same tone but he's almost like a pre puberty Young Jeezy and that's not when he doesn't have tracks on this thing where he sounds exactly like good act black especially on the song changed up I feel like he's essentially written a good code act black song here which is just baffling to me like you already kind of had this established sound and style as a member of Rae sremmurd I feel like sway for the most part kind of stuck to what you would expect from him on a solo venture whereas like Jimmy on his own it's like he's got no rudder no direction especially on tracks like keep God first I mean without sway there to kind of swoop in and drop a great hook there's no chorus there it's just super tedious mush and the features on this final disc are kind of rough too I mean if you have a lot of respect for Pharrell and you want to keep it I would skip his appearance and then zoe kravitz of all people is on this thing who I just enjoyed hearing on the news you know Monet album but she has a rap feature on this disc and it sounds like a bad SNL skit it sounds like Natalie Portman rapping like posturing and trying to sound super aggressive it's super tough yeah I did not get it at all it just sounded like a satire which I mean maybe the last two discs of this album are in a way of something I don't know it's I I haven't quite figured out what it's a social commentary on but certainly certainly the the the the point was made I think yeah I think after this thing unequivocally I can say that Jimmy and sway work better together hearing each of them respectively on their own disc of this three disc album is kind of like looking into the mirror and not seeing your reflection even if I am feeling like maybe a strong four to a light five on Jimmy's disk again better than sways but not by that much and bringing together all of my scores for all of the disks I think I'm feeling just like a strong 4 on this record overall and those are my thoughts on this unnecessarily long super bloated 3 disc Rae sremmurd album I mean if you took the best songs on the entire thing and condense that down into one single disc and maybe forced a few more collaborations out of Jimi and sway I think it would have been a pretty good album maybe their best yet but instead I feel like they've given in to this temptation towards stream trolling and have just kind of thrown out these haphazard side projects just to kind of rack up more more plays and and that's a transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best which a tire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony

GZO90eZ8wEs,[Music] hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a great albums video where I go over over this past month all the records that kind of stood out to you great great records nice albums to listen to I will link down there in the description box to reviews for all these projects so you can see my in-depth opinions on all of them don't want anything really good to slip through the cracks on you guys that's all I'm just I'm just watching your back I'm just looking out for you okay let's go first the new sons of Kemet album your queen is a reptile really excellent jazz record from London quartet tuba sax double drummers on this thing occasionally some poetry or spoken word in the mix it's a series of really enthralling exciting jams just really great chemistry and interplay between all the musicians on this record fantastic energy I don't know what else to say about it other than that it's just really groovy it's a just very visceral album so if you do like your jams and you like / your performances to be really electrifying and exciting very uh physical you just got to move your body then this is the jazz album for you I swear there's some pretty passionate and lovely cool down moments on the record as well yeah it's just kind of a futuristic very rhythmic very ahead of the curve and I like it quite a bit next the new Jean Grey and Kweli Chris album everything's fine very humorous satirical witty album full of smart commentary creative song topics interesting left-field underground grimy weirdo production Kweli continues his streak a very interesting creative fringe rap albums while Jean Grey is an artist - I've just always felt we don't hear enough from and there's plenty of her on this record to account for there's some fun features on this thing too and again just all-around very good record next the new Cali youichi's record isolation very good art pop album with blends of R&B and dancehall and a lot of other things like she's really all over the place stylistically but the creative space EEP reduction and Callie's very amateurish and odd vocal delivery managed to tie it all up into this very dreamy strange universe the Latin pop detours on this record were very nice too I know that at first it may not sound like much but there is a very subtle odd beauty about this record and in character to it that I think makes Callie a special artist one who I'm hoping I hear more from in the very immediate future next the new sleep album the sciences the stoner metal trio is back like 15 years later with a new album out of the blue on Jack White's Third Man Records and while it doesn't sound exactly like what the band has come out with in the past though I mean how much material the sleep have in the past anyway and there's clearly influences coming from owls band ohm and Matt's band high on fire a little bit with their respective playing it still comes together really well it's a solid set of tracks that celebrates what made the band great to begin with but kind of updates it with some chunkier heavier more roaring more straightforward riffs some decent chanting kind of deadpan hypnotic vocals overall just a very quality stoner metal record with a pretty introspective finish hardcore intro and a lot of Sabbath worship and the tracklist to next the new hopalong album bark your head off dog the indie band is back with a record that isn't quite as intense or flashy instrumentally or vocally as their last album but with toning things down a little bit I think their songwriting shines so much more like the songs are so much catch here on this record than they were on their previous material just all-around good solid indie rock record with a lot of raw talent in the performances in the writing so even though it's not reinventing the wheel or anything the tracks are incredibly compelling the lyrics are super-smart the performances are tight they're just dead on the songs are very well crafted the talent level that hopalong brings to the table is apparent from the first track on this album they are certainly cut above what you're gonna hear most indie rock bands out the these days especially the ones that are just kind of shooting for a more lackadaisical dreamy mindless just kind of nonchalant sound and finally the new Janelle Monae album dirty computer she comes through with an album that is the first record of her first major record of hers that is totally outside of this whole metropolis suite series and it's essentially an art pop album that's a little dystopian essentially about being in America but also very deeply sexual album too she manages to balance these very physical and sexual feelings with the more political tones on the album also a lot of female empowerment themes coming through in the lyrics as well tons of prints influenced very snappy synthetic contemporary production which took me a while to get into given just how much I love the more organic and lavish instrumentation on records like the ark Android dirty computer isn't quite as grand a musical or an artistic statement but I think that's partially because Monet focused herself down into making a pop album strictly a record that would appeal to a pop fanbase and I think she's succeeded in that this is a very quality pop album the songs are incredibly catchy the vocals are super sweet the instrumentals are very colorful very vibrant and honestly I don't know if we're gonna get a better pop album this year I mean if we are who's gonna bring it Meghan Trainor No so that is my list those are the albums for the month of April that I hope you guys check out that you should definitely get your ears on records that stood out to me records that are great are definitely going to be on my year-end list again links to reviews and relevant information down there in the description box and thank you for watching transition have you given any of these albums a listen if you haven't you should over here next to my head is a playlist of our great albums videos that you can check out hit that up or the links subscribe to the channel hit the bell as well and I will see you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana great albums forever

your budding record collector friend or yourself treat yourself if you use that link and you buy stuff from there we get kickback from it and also want to shout out the band dead cross featuring Mike Patton who I reviewed on the channel before they have a new EP out which you can stream over at band camp which I believe is via ipecac records if I'm not mistaken you can give their stuff a shot their new stuff if you didn't know their last album was a really awesome blend of avant-garde rock and metal and hardcore punk music it was actually a pretty decent pretty decent record a little annoying at times but adds add some great tracks on it and let's get into the worst tracks this week was a pretty hefty week for worst tracks there were quite a few worst tracks first off the new Tanya to gawk track featuring Damian abrahan of the band fucked up they have come together on this new single and have dropped a cover of the Iron Maiden song run run to the hills let's just say their respective vocal styles coming together as much as I do enjoy some of Tanya's solo stuff hearing them come together on one single Iron Maiden cover it it doesn't do the original much much justice it's a little full obnoxious it's kind of interesting while it's on but it's it's nothing I'm ever going to be revisiting ever again moving on from their task of sweet from the super deluxe brand you may have seen him doing some cool DIY stuff he has a new music video out with Frank to the jab to the see who does production on his new track Vanessa I'm putting this in the worst section because I hope I can beef with tasks of sweet dude I hate you you're a bad person you're garbage and your song is doodoo poo-poo doo-doo and it's a total banger and the lyrics are hilarious and you seem like a really nice person but I hate you and I hope you I hope you get indigestion alright moving on from there the the there's gonna be a Superfly reboot and of course a new soundtrack attached to that there is a new track out with partynextdoor and future titled no shame now of course because partynextdoor i'm not crazy about the guys music but he can actually sing pretty decently and he's singing all over this track and because you have a person on here who actually has some decent singing chops it just feels like future has to try to play keep up with him and the fact that he can sing so he's kind of crooning all over the track and if you know anything about future you know that he can't sing so yeah it's it's just it's just partynextdoor and future just kind of like bad auto-tune bukkake all over a generic beat it's basically auditory torture for a few minutes again not not entirely at the at the feet of partynextdoor am i laying the problems with this track it's it's it's mostly it's mostly future and I guess the soundtrack is produced by future Jesus Christ is is that is this about to be a train wreck probably probably stop moving out from there this new Dirty Projectors track titled breakthrough is one of the most horrendous songs released under the Dirty Projectors name I feel like as I listen to the song that there's a there's a cool fun catchy creative tune at the core of this track and this is a total 180 from some of the smoother and more R&B influences of the last Dirty Projectors record so I guess it's welcome that there is a change of pace but god this this seems like everything that was ever awful and annoying originally about Dirty Projectors condensed into one of the most obnoxious songs that has ever been under the DP name and and why is that I should probably get to that it's it's really kind of mostly due to the production of the track like the weird fuzz doubt guitar lines it's it's just so off kilter and chaotic and unlikable I just don't really know what to say about it other than that it's just horrendously horrendously abrasive and just really unlikable sonically it just seems like it's trying too hard to sound weird and as a result just is quite annoying and I'm just gonna just gonna leave it at that I guess hopefully subsequent songs are better this new Christina Aguilera song though it is not anywhere near as experimental as that Dirty Projectors song it's it's it's about as much of a mess it's featuring 2 Chainz and ty dolla sign although they don't really have much to do with why the song is terrible it's really just kind of the horrendous production and beat and rhythm in this song like it just sounds like a total mess between Christina is kind of jutting pronounced vocals and just the really zany instrumental the the song never really reaches a point of true resolved it's just always really tense and kind of off-kilter and not really in a good way yeah I don't really know if there's much to say about it outside of that it just sounds like a total mess it just sounds like a total mess I don't know if christina was intending to go as experimental as she did on this track it just sort of sounds like an experimental mistake but I guess I admire her for trying something different in trying to sort of stay updated I suppose moving on from there ho Cal Church esta new song Slap Chop it's it's utter trash features of production from Evo ox ilium and it's it sucks it's garbage it sounds kind of like a blown-out weird take on some of that you know recent very distorted soundcloud rap stuff it just sucks it just sucks moving on from there here's a horrendous cover of Moon River I guess for the Tiffany company featuring Elle Fanning and ASAP Ferg like who in what marketing room concocted this idea I don't know but they should most likely be fired because this is this is terrible and it not only doesn't sound awful but it doesn't do the original song any sort of justice I'm telling you man there were a lot of worse tracks this week there were a lot of worse tracks alright let's move on to songs that I wasn't super insane about but they weren't bad parquet courts Mardi Gras beads not quite as funky or as hard-hitting as some of their other recent material but it's a decent kind of dejected slow indie rock burner sounds like a track that'll probably grow on me more in the tracklist itself it's it's not terrible it's not terrible it's okay I'm moving on from there Natalie pres has a new single a new album on the way the song is titled lost and it's decent I mean I guess I'm sort of that a bit of a loss as to what to say like I was with her last record I just feel like she is yet to reach a point where she really has a clear sound or delivery or personality the tune is fine the production is pretty sweet but again she's not really an artist who I feel like I could easily pick out of a lineup I just don't really know what exactly her sound or angle is again I just kind of feel a little lost when it comes to Natalie Pratt stuff it doesn't seem to have that strong of a sense of direction or or a definitive I don't know style but you know it's a nice little sweet kind of soulful sad piano ballad next Jimmy world has a couple of new tracks out that you know our nice catchy pop rocks slightly emo tinged slow burners that aren't too bad next future islands have a new song out it's it's an Adult Swim single so obviously you know don't expect it to be one of their best songs in a long time or anything like that it's a title to Calliope that's it's a little low Phi in comparison to a lot of their recent material but still you know those synths are there and the beats are there and the those gruff lead vocals are there and very dramatic as usual it's it's a nice little track and moving on from there Death Grips having to have a new track out titled streaky and it's the first single from their forthcoming record you're the snitch and to be honest I mean outside of the very polyrhythmic beat which is pretty funky I find the track to be kind of boring you know in a way it's it's kind of like one of the more low-key cuts kind of like a get got where you have a ride rapping in a much more somber and just a low-key tone not quite as you know aggressive or anything like that which you know it's actually cool when Death Grips does a track like that every once in a while because it does provide some good counterpoint to the more aggressive cuts and typically they they tend to throw in maybe some more thoughtful or introspective lyrics on these more low-key cuts but that didn't really seem to be the case on this new track over here it just felt like um kind of absurdist and underwhelming I mean it's okay maybe I'll like it a little bit more on the album itself but again outside of the beats outside of that rhythm on the track it just didn't really do for me you know the whole streaky hook just kind of fell really flat for me I don't know hopefully they really pull through on this record but I wasn't too crazy about this cut wasn't too crazy about it and finally in this section I think we're talking about Big Ups over here oh we have one more but the band Big Ups they have a new track out which is linked down there below in the description along with everything else I'm talking about here this song is titled imaginary dog walker kind of feel like the band is falling back on that slit worship a little bit more on this new cut over here it's it's alright you know it's alright it's alright and and finally I think we're talking about a bad baby or you know the cash me outside girl she has a new song out featuring little yachty with a music video attached to it which kind of talks or rather portrays her as a bad influence and that sort of thing um it's a banger you know it's a it's a decent track banger yeah I find her tracks really fun but sometimes I just find her music videos a little annoying but still a decent cut you know I feel like too many people just hate on her for doing what she's doing despite the fact that she is living up to the bar that most of her contemporaries are setting like most of these soundcloud dudes and most of these trap dudes they're not writing songs that are any deeper than this you know and the production on this thing is pretty hard I mean it's not as you know I guess memorable is hi bitch but uh the yadi features decent the instrumentals pretty good and she has a you know bar 2 on here that are that are kind of sticky and let's move on to the best tracks the tracks that really were sticking with me this week a handful of good handful of very good tracks this week a good crop of best tracks so let's start off ooh ooh this new Travis Scott track over here featuring Kanye West and little Ozzy vert is actually one of Travis's best songs in a while I feel which is actually great because pretty much every Lucey track he's been dropping since he put out rodeo whole birds and the trap thing everything he's been dropping just felt like it was just run off from that album just really generic not trying as much this new song over here while it it pretty good it's pretty firmly a Travis track I wouldn't say he's a reinvention the wheel are kind of evolving heavily on the song too much but it doesn't sound like something he's done before a couple of times a little Aussie vert and Kanye I think bring a lot to the song Travis's presence isn't as strong on the track as I think those two voices are but still it's got kind of a fruity interesting instrumental it's not quite as darker as cavernous as the typical Travis Scott is and you know all around I just think it's kind of a fun futuristic cutting-edge track banger with a you know kind of some artsy qualities qualities to it moving out from there this new proto martyr track band who I think is doing some very cutting-edge and forward-thinking things with the sounds of post-punk now they have a new EP on the way the song is titled the wheel of fortune and it's one of the most harrowing heavy and despondent songs I think the band has ever dropped yeah you know just some really rough guitars on here and typically from proto martyr you can expect some vocals that are very poetic very like low down and just spiraling into this cavern of depression and the song is no exception with that I would actually say it's it's one of the most emotionally traumatizing songs they've ever dropped so do not miss out on this track if you're kind of into their sound you've enjoyed their previous releases moving on from there there is a new supergroup which is they're not the first supergroup apparently named this but there is a new supergroup featuring SIA labyrinth and Diplo they're calling themselves LSD they have a new song entitled genius and is it's a fantastic little mainstream pop track with Sia's vocals killing at labyrinths laying down some really great vocals on to it love the fruity catchy instrumental hopefully they can kind of keep it up for a full-length album this will definitely be one of the most exciting Diplo related projects in a while because I feel like a lot of Major Lazer stuff has kind of just been growing stale as of late I feel like he needs to do something I don't know just kind of change things up just kind of evolved into a different direction because I feel like Major Lazer sound it had a time it had a place it had a moment where as what I think they're doing here seems much more cutting-edge in the realm of pop and dance music as well so I don't know I just hope to hear more from these guys in the near future because this is just this is this is pretty on point moving on from there the new Florence and the Machine track which for whatever reason kind of reminds me of that um that live song what is it the crashing lightning track or something noses harass is that it's actually not that bad of a track it's titled hunger and again what I'm liking about this song is it feels like the band is a little bit more dynamic this time around they're using more subtle moments to build up to these heavy passionate tracks and it's just all around a great tune a great performance really thrilling really exciting just those heartstrings getting pulled and yeah the performance is really good too production is classy you hear a lot of nice thrusts from the instrumentation a lot of epic ambient sound around the around the instrumentation just sounds really good moving on from there oh god oh my god is this the no there's a second to last one yeah we have a couple more left but oh my god oh my god oh my god childish gambino is back he did a little SNL performance of a few new tracks but he dropped a new music video for this song title this is America and holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit I could not I'm still processing this this is fucking awesome this is the best single he's ever dropped this is maybe his best song period like not only is a embracing that whole Bangert rap sound but he's doing something political with it he's doing something forward-thinking with it the way he kind of blends those primal rhythms with some of that trap bass and and some other hip-hop production elements on the verses mixes in a little bit of social commentary it just sounds really dark it's really visceral and then he'll sort of transition into these more hype moments these brighter moments where you have you know group singing and it's a maybe a little bit of gospel influence or soul influenced or something like that and juxtapose with the music video it's obviously some kind of commentary on ignorance being bliss and you know we have these moments where happy and things are fine the things are great then we kind of transition back into these darker spots you know I'm blown away by the song the song sounds great I love the structure of the track I love the way we kind of transition with these different sounds I love what Donald is saying on the track but the music video just really kind of makes it all come back home like the gunshot moments like it's just such incredibly sharp fucking commentary and part of the reason that I think it's such sharp commentary is that it's it's uncomfortable commentary like not a lot of people who see this even people who agree with the message of the song I don't think are gonna sit through this music video we're gonna sit through this track without squirming at least a little bit so uh you know when something is good commentary and it's and it's making you squirm when a piece of art is making you squirm and making you kind of uncomfortable in a way when it's kind of either satirizing or trying to point something out that's very urgent I think that's when it's doing its job and I think Donald does a fantastic job of that on this song it's just an all-around a great track and it has me super hype for what he's gonna be doing in the near future I'm glad he's sticking with the childish gambino name I'm glad he's changing things up past his last record as much as I did enjoy things going in that kind of funk and soul direction I wasn't as nuts about that Dan seer groovy or disco type track that he did on NSL that he performed on SNL but um you know maybe the studio version is gonna sound better so the studio version might sound better typically I think live performances on SNL sound kind of flat and not that interesting but you know I'm open to hearing what the studio version has to offer on that but this is America holy shit like I'm I there were a few points especially when I don't want to spoil the music video if you haven't seen it already but you know that second moment when he has the the fully automatic and my jaw fucking dropped at that part I was like what's what that was it's heavy it's a heavy it's a heavy ass musically it was a heavy ass song and I will leave it at that it'sit's a tough act to follow but still I do want to praise the new beach house tract over here it's Hetal black car and I'm liking the more experimental direction beach house has been taking these new tracks in this new song over here is maybe one of their most droney and psychedelic yet it's not quite the light-hearted dream pop the light-hearted a romantic dream pop that we know from the duo it's a little subversive it's a little surreal and I'm just kind of liking the enveloping sound that they've been crafting on this one the song isn't quite as catchy as as maybe some people might be expecting from from beach house typically but but still all around some cool production and some great washy trippy sounds and I'm gonna leave it at that again that was a weekly track roundup thank you guys very much for watching again the good people of our sea geek sponsored this melon shirts still available at the time of me posting this video and again all the tracks I talked about are linked down there in the description box I hope that you got some good recommendations out of this video and love you love you love you love you love you love you love you over here next to my head is

jG_1LDtuSJY,hi everyone slapped chop here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Daniel Avery album song for alpha Daniel Avery is a London electronic music producer who about five years or so ago dropped a fantastic little Tech House album titled drone logic it was his debut album for the fantasy label prior to this record I didn't even know I didn't even know who he was so this album kind of put this dude on the map for me because it was loaded with these amazing drum sequences and grooves and oh the bouncy rubbery bass lines if you haven't heard a single track off of this record I highly recommend the song water jump that will get you hooked and just pulled through the rest of the way through the album just a really excellent electronic music experience great sound play super clean crisp electronics fantastically Dancy grooves and I guess I enjoyed this record so much I've just been kind of sitting here patiently awaiting some sort of follow-up because somebody who would come out with a debut with this much great material on it and so much potential would surely have something great coming down the pipe very soon but then it was one year after another year after another year in another year and now it's finally here and this album dropped out even notice it dropped it actually came to my attention as a result of some fans of the show saying hey you reviewed that Daniel Avery all those years ago aren't you gonna try his new one I didn't even know what happened I don't even know what happened maybe I'm just suppose a maybe I don't know about but I finally got my ears on this thing and and I am seeing why it's not making quite the splash that his debut album did this record is a total musical change aesthetic change which on paper is not necessarily a bad thing I know I get it I like change okay but I guess I just don't see this album as a change in an interesting direction or I guess I don't see what Daniel Avery necessarily brings to this style while with his last album he wasn't really reinventing the tech house wheel I mean it was superbly good tech house music on alpha over here Avery is going in more of an ambient techno direction with a supremely industrial Tambor to it like the sounds coming out the mix on this thing are super metallic there's lots of reverb on them nearly every piece of production on this thing sounds like it was pulled together on a factory floor it sounds cold it sounds frigid it sounds robotic it sounds even a little dystopian now with it being ambient techno the drums are pretty driving but very subtle not quite as groovy or as hard-hitting as anything on drone logic they don't really get tweaked across the length of a lot of these long tracks to kind of keep me engaged keep me on the edge of my seat most of the time where I think Avery tried to put a lot of effort and attention and detail are into the washed out sounds that cover a lot of these beats some of which have a kind of shoegaze e tone to them but not so sure gaze ethat I think this album could go toe-to-toe with any number of classic shoegaze albums or any classic IDM or ambient techno records they have a similarly washy psychedelic sound like FX twins ambient works one in two or Boards of Canada Gio Gaddy it feels like Avery is pulling from that wing of electronic music pretty hard but coming up short when it comes to I guess any interesting sound palettes or original ideas because for the most part the sounds these beats are awash in is pretty digital it's pretty bland it's pretty flat it's kind of thin sound play is really just so-so there's very little on this album that inspires me to dive right into it and the progressions are so tedious that the beginnings middles and ends of nearly every one of these tracks just kind of blend together into a kind of industrial techno nondescript ambient mush there's also a macro problem with things blending together on this album as well as they're very little in the way of distinct standouts on the tracklist here I mean album is certainly pleasant to listen to and it definitely fits the ambient techno mold but only insofar as it can really only be enjoyed in an ambient fashion because there isn't much to this record that really kind of keeps in the forefront of my mind as I'm listening to it I just feel like there was a bit of a missed opportunity with this record given that the progressions aren't nearly as detailed or as physical as they were on Avery's last album I think that there was a real opportunity to play with sound and craft some very unique and interesting sounds that listeners could really kind of get lost in with a more ambient type of release but the sound play on this record is really just kind of average there's nothing about the sounds of these beats and since that to me reads as hypnotic or enveloping or relaxing or inviting it just kind of feels like wallpaper which in a way that is an element of ambient music but I mean the genre has become so much more since its inception as has ambient techno itself but I feel like Daniel Avery on this record has failed in two respects he hasn't really captured the original wonder and magic of the genre at its core nor has he advanced in any direction that would keep things interesting I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record definitely not the standout that Avery's previous release was nor does it really read to me as being that significant of a album in its particular genre yeah transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't

2dbrndTCzng,they would be afraid of what we would lose if we lost religion and I basically said demonstrate oh you'd lose art and poetry and drama and narrative why worry are there are there no godless artists and poets there are artists and poets who think their godless all right hey everyone the Internet's wettest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kimber album primal heart this is the third full-length commercial album from New Zealand native Kimbra whose career was hugely boosted in the earlier part of the decade with an appearance on the smash breakout art pop hit somebody that I used to know Kimber dropped a pretty decent debut album the very same year titled vows a record that showcased quite a bit of vocal talent and artistic versatility there were really kind of kooky jazzy sort of tongue-in-cheek numbers on here like the song good intent but there was also very summery lavish baroque pop on this album like on the track something in the way you are and instead of when moving on to her next album kind of cutting things down and finding a more defined a more focused sound Kimber sounded even more all over the map with her follow up the golden hour in fact there were some tracks on here like the song 90s music that I think had even weird or production some of the beats on here were pretty synthetic kind of Spacey as well a lot of sub-base a lot of booming beats but still a lot of room for Kimber's vocals the kind of ruminate I got the sense that some of the songs was in the production on this record almost felt like an attempt to keep up with fellow Kiwi Lord who blew up and had some viral hits just a year earlier on this album there were also some nods to contemporary hip hop production with the rattling high hats and the tight snappy snares and the huge sub bass but in the tracklist on this record Kimber still left a lot of room for stylistic detours like the disco rager miracle or the song madhouse which is essentially like this 80s throwback synth funk anthem that just seems to be Kimber's thing on each tracklist she has dropped so far there just seems to be a library of pop Styles embedded within not only that but she also tends to wear her influences on her sleeve to the point where I think her past couple of albums kind of lose a sense of continuity and identity her music can come off a little nondescript if she's drowning in a particular influence or if a vocal performances may be so-so or a song is kind of generic and that's still kind of the issue on this new album over here as well where I feel continuously caught by who it is it sounds like she's copying as opposed to what it is she's actually doing because throughout this record I hear hints of the knife and SIA and Lorde and maybe a little bit of Radiohead or James Blake Kate Bush she really seems to be loving some little dragon on this one there are a number of very pillowy dreamy glossy synth led art pop tracks on here that maybe aren't the feistiest and the tracklist just seemed kind of mild like the song like they do on the TV which features a very sensual sax part as well as the good war and everybody knows and black sky some of which are decent cool down moments in the midst of the tracklist but are clearly overshadowed by some of the more vibrant and feisty er songs here with more tangible and upfront vocals especially top of the world super exciting primal track even if the song just bleeds fever ray just sounds so much like Karen jury or Anderson but it's like she's taking that influence into a brighter more manic more egotistical direction with these hypnotic dirty drums and really distorted heavy synth bass it's a track that sounds simultaneously ancient and futuristic and not a bad tune either I'm having a hard time describing some of the vocals on this track though because it doesn't purely sound like singing it's also kind of a I don't know a shouty or a spoken word type thing either way it's intense and portrays a ton of character much more than some of the other tracks here do the song recovery is really sharp blend of trap and pop with this really heavy bouncy bass synced up with these just gigantic chords some really sassy lead vocals I love how the drums kind of pick up a little bit as the song progresses along and the song has some really cute vocal harmonies is well hanging in the background and it's essentially this really summery track about getting over a bad relationship recovering from that and I guess giving yourself a little time for self-love learn to love yourself learning more about yourself instead the song human is one of a few tracks on the album where Kimbra is like a dead ringer for little dragons Yuki Mian igano especially with some of her more subtle croons on this track and in the background vocals it's got kind of a different instrumental and songwriting style though because little dragon isn't really much for the type of tune that we're hearing there which is really dark winding and urgent slowly blossoming into this really explosive chorus the song light year sounds like a forever 21 shopping spree set in the year 3000 with all these throbbing pulsating driving since and sequence drums occasionally the scents get a little visa there's also some really glossy orgasmic chords on the chorus also some of the best singing on the entire record too I mean when Kimber squeezes out that one no inner upper register before the song blasts into the hook the song right direction is a nice tune it's one of the better ballads on the record certainly not as washed out as some of the other more low-key tracks here it feels like a very intimate little tune set in the mid 80s with a very heavy and powerful string back to ending good progression the song past love I like the vibe of this track a lot there's something about the instrumentation that feels kind of dreamy and nostalgic much in the same way that you might find like on a she and him or a Best Coast track but it actually feels not too nostalgic it doesn't feel dated it doesn't feel trashy it feels classy feels sharp it feels smart my real issue with the song though is how are you going to have two summery pop tunes on here about getting over an old relationship and then emphasizing that that you need to focus more on loving yourself instead which leads me to another criticism I have with this album that lyrically topically it can be kind of surface-level you know there's some limitations here the song version of me helps pull up the rear of this album and helps end things often stereotypically sad and dark fashion but it's actually not a bad track it's kind of a painfully intimate claustrophobic ly close piano ballad that sounds like it could have landed on Radiohead's a moon shaped pool which love that album I think the song is pretty good it's not really an influence I mind hearing pop up even if it does kind of add to this albums lack of consistency I will say though the real closure of this record that comes after this this two-minute little vocal interlude with some weird James Blake ish vocal meshing that does not go over quite as well and almost feels like a cop out of an ending still though even at its worst this album is very listenable there's not really anything on here I outright hated there wasn't anything so bland so plain so average that it just felt gross I mean even the more low-key cuts on here while they may not stand out while they may not be super vibrant they still have decent choruses decent vocal performances that I find myself coming away from humming I just wish the actual production and performances of these tracks were a bit more interesting and lively because it's not merely that these songs are low-key I mean the song human is a pretty low-key track but the way that the synths are produced on that track the way that the vocals are kind of twisted into these very dark alleyways it's incredibly creative it's a really interesting sound which is not something I can say for some of the more washed out songs in the tracklist still there were more highs than lows on this mixed bag of tracks which kind of runs like a compilation because still to this day with album after album there is still really no common musical or sonic thread that pulls all of Kimber's records together as an artist she's a bit of a chameleon kind of an all-around or a Swiss Army knife she does a little bit of everything and I will say with years of practices seems like everything she's gotten a little bit better but without a specialty or a trademark sound it still kind of feels like as good as this album is it's missing that extra spark that little extra something I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you

vELbNWkvVk0,okay do you feel that I am thinking free right now do you feel that my mind is outside of the box and I'm thinking so free that I'm free I'm feeling out of here do you feel how free my mind is right now cuz if you don't feel that I'm thinking free believe me there's gonna be heck to pay hi everyone think the Neve early tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new panoptic on the scars of man on the once nameless wilderness parts 1 & 2 this is the latest 2 disc album from one of black metals more unique projects of the decade austin el Lunz panopticon's London is a Kentucky singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist and for over a decade now he's been taking the brutal sounds of black metal the harsh vocals and the tremolo Pickett ARS the blast beats and blending that with sounds and instrumentation from the American folk tradition acoustic guitars and fiddles and banjos and while some of panopticon's more formative releases might sound a little too cacophonous at points like his 2012 record Kentucky the dense layering of all this black metal instrumentation and American folk instrumentation created a really interesting and unique sound palette one that would smooth out and become even grander in scope on panopticon's following couple of records 2014's rotes to the north and 2015's autumn eternal both of which I highly recommend and are pretty much the reason I went into this new record over here with such high hopes so much excitement because for anyone who's been a fan of panoptic on up until this point a double album worth of material can only be a good thing now so far on this record the fan reception has been huge but personally I am NOT enjoying this project nearly as much as I have pretty much everything panopticon's done up until this point for a handful of reasons that mostly apply across the entirety of this two-disc project 1 for whatever reason one draws a line a separator between much of the metal and folk influences on this record sure occasionally you might have a funkier track on here that has an elect guitar crescendo or a black metal cut that has a bit of an acoustic interlude but for the most part on both of these discs the black metal and the Fulco instrumentation don't coalesce in any significant way as they have on previous panopticon's efforts each of them are mostly relegated to their own separate discs and to what artistic benefit I don't know because previously bringing these elements together is what MAPE an optic on greater than the sum of its parts when you pull them apart what makes panoptic on unique kind of falls apart to the production on this record I just found to be so so a lot of the time especially on the black metal cuts the black metal recordings on this record just seem really flat to me just kind of feels like very Western very American overly atmospheric Godspeed you black metal with an occasional touch of strings to add just a little bit of body make it kind of dynamic but for the most part the sound of these songs just comes off really average the instrumentation is nowhere near as tangible or as upfront or as in your face or as I guess muscular and defined as it's been on previous on recent efforts I mean even the crescendos on this record are pretty flaccid like the first big one that comes after a string break on the second track it's almost like panopticon's just paints itself into a corner like this is the thrill this is the high that this song has been building up to all this time and it doesn't get much better on the subsequent tracks like the bad 80s style descending guitar leads on the track platinum it sounds like something out of an awful NES video game soundtrack not only is it not interesting but it's perplexing that this guitar lead that this melody commands so much attention over the course of the entire track the heavy metal guitar soloing that happens later on the song isn't much more impressive either now as far as the full gear cuts I'll say that here is where the production is slightly better more crystal clear more pristine and has a nice reverb eachine on it however I will say that some of the songs on here are just so slow and just such a slog the performances can feel kind of awkward and shaky maybe just a little too loose to feel engaging throughout and my third major problem with this record really kind of comes down to the vocals not only are they missing in action on some of the black metal passages here but when they do show up they're just so buried in the mix they're hardly the exciting commanding beast eale roar that I got from previous panopticon's it just feels like a step down but then the vocals get even worse on the full gear cuts of this record they're so mumbly and uncomfortable and I'm just not sure why is it for dramatic or emotional effect lund seems to mostly hang out in the lower register of his range but he can't seem to just grab on to a note and hold it when it comes to the cleaner singing on this record I'll use this word again shaky another thing that's kind of confusing about it is that this isn't even the first time lund has sung clean vocals on his records I mean I remember him doing it on Kentucky and it's sounding a lot more interesting and consistent there the song echoes in the snow on the second disc is really the only cut on this record that features clean singing where the vocal performance felt like it had a lick of confidence to it it's one of the gruffer tracks on the record has some very steady guitar strumming and fiddle layering has a bit of a backwoods country vibe to it I mean I guess my last major problem with it is that I'm just not all that blown away by the songwriting a lot of the chord progressions I find to be very tedious very unimaginative though I will say and maybe this is the best thing about the record I do like a lot of the lyrical themes a lot of the conceptual themes of the album these nods to the natural world the natural order this album definitely takes more of an environmentalist angle a preservationist angle it almost sees a kind of spirituality in the natural world this not only comes up in Lunz lyrics but also in some of the vocals snippets he works into the record too I mean even the title of this 2 disc series is a nod to that idea talking about the scars left on this wilderness that at one time before man had no name had no nothing it was just it was just this wilderness it was just this place but outside of that there's not a whole lot about this album that I find to be exciting or really all that great for sure a great deal of this album is listenable but given panopticon's previous material it just really falls short of expectations for me I feel like I've just listened to one of the more unique American black metal projects out there period get cut down into something that is just so completely generic not to mention on out to an almost unbearable length collectively on these two disks I'm feeling a strong four to like five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best butcher a higher view next it'll like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comments in the comments if you're angry hit the

4Way39aUJ4g,hey everyone Kissimmee hit is Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Janelle Monae album dirty computer this is the latest full-length album from songwriter singer rapper producer model actress Janelle Monae this is her third full-length commercial album it follows 2013's Electric Lady an album of somewhat conceptual pops soul revisiting a lot of the themes of futurism and cybernetics and love and femininity as well as afro centrosome expressed on her previous efforts but this time around with a somewhat poppier veneer that in my opinion kind of undercut the grand epic ambitious R&B experience presented on previous efforts like the arc android in a way it just kind of sounded like a less epic version of what i've heard already those still good still decent but afterwards it seemed like Chanel was doing even more to kind of undercut the artsy er side of her appeal and attempting to raise the visibility of her Wonderland Records label by dropping some of the cheapest pop rap singles I've heard this decade like Joo Deniz classic man as well as her own yoga track nigh that neither which I care for all that much but you know I get it for Monet for Wonderland records it seems like things are a bit of a tightrope walk they clearly want to make music and art that's forward-thinking cutting-edge stylish and artful but the mainstream audiences out there might not get it but there's also clearly a focus on making things coming out of Wonderland records have a pop appeal as well so that one tool and and and Janelle Monae are successful commercially I'm sure it's also important to them that they have a platform from which they can release tracks like hell you Tom about a protest song the Jenelle and company released in 2015 speaking out against police brutality and in comparison with everything Monet has put out up until this point dirty computer I think is an even more focused attempt and making something that is equal parts pop and progressive not only that but this record is also her first release since blowing up networks outside of this metropolis suite that she's been guiding fans through all these years now of course because of that the narrative on this record is different than that of what you would naturally find on previous janelle monae albums the themes are a bit more contemporary a bit more reflective of present times our current social climate there's a lot more personal storytelling I think on this record as well which is an interesting change of pace because it's rare that in Monet's music we get a glimpse of what she was like when she was younger or what her thoughts are as a struggling artist or I guess what her political opinions are at least directly from her as a person as an artist not through a character that she's envisioned or anything also throughout this record deeply intertwined themes of sex power and politics hence the name of this record dirty computer because computers technology nothing new for Monet and her music but dirty this is this is a very sexy album now the musical flavors on this record will be familiar to fans of Monet's previous works elements of contemporary R&B as well as funk and pop and soul but I think some of these elements are a bit cooler than they've been in the past maybe brought to the backburner just a tad because there's like this very crisp synthetic production style on this record which did turn me off a little bit at first because sometimes the percussion feels like it's a little bit too indebted to the pop trap trends of 2018 in the search to find a sound on this record that is both pop and progressive it does lead to a few low points on the album in my opinion the politics on this record because the songs have to be direct and they have to be catchy can kind of be reduced down to sloganeering sometimes if you grab my pussy my pussy grabbed you back that sort of thing occasionally the production does feel a little thin a little sterile I do wish it was a little bit more organic at points and occasionally because there are themes of bliss and partying and feeling good on this record as well sometimes the lyrics do come off a bit vapid as well as more hedonistic than they are thoughtful I think the song crazy classic life is a prime example of most of these things though I do love the subtle nods to eighties synth pop on the instrumental though the sense the drums some of the vocal work on this track and the closer as well are both clear nods to prints still even though there are elements of this track I don't care for all that much I do sense that there is a message behind how blissful and uplifting and positive this track is it's like it's trying to be hopeful in the face of very dark times especially since the song does seem to kick off with this theme of the suit of happiness the feel of this song has a very carefree vibe but it's communicated pretty clearly in the lyrics that that is not the reality that the song comes from it's merely an aspiration that genell would like for the world at large for things just be less tumultuous when the record really gets going for me personally is on the song take a bite the song is glossy it's groovy it's tempting it's sexual it's an irresistible blend of pop and funk the beat the bassline the shimmering rhythm guitars Monet's beckoning vocals on the chorus take by God this track is juicy it's nice and juicy and that random-access memory not on the lyrics here you know it's remember it's it's dirty it's computer it's dirty computer the album gets even sweeter musically on the next song screwed but at the same time darker lyrically because throughout the song screwed or rather sex is being used as a tool to control people or a metaphor for people and the world at large just being fucked or just something to do because you know it feels good at first I wasn't too crazy about the track because it didn't feel like it was saying all that much but that's because the pop the near of the song is just so convincing it feels almost like a more tasteful approach to some of the pop rock tracks that Gwen Stefani was dropping in the 2000s it's bubbly it's tantalizing and yet also foreboding and zoe kravitz vocals on the track actually bring the song really sweet kind of girlish flare and this track isn't the only spot on the record where I feel this influence popping up it's also on the song I got the juice which feels like a cross section between tropical music Gwen Stefani's hollaback girl and kelis 'as milkshake but like with a fine arts degree now of course the common thread running through all of these songs is Pharrell who is also on this track he's got a verse on here he had a hand in the production so he just keeps making the same song over and over but it's still actually pretty good another time and I find this track to be less gimmicky than the two previously mentioned songs also Pharrell's verse on this track is hilarious it's sharp it's clever but also a little gross like that one line but he's talking about the juice Allah it's it's yellow like there's pee in it but yellow is is Pharrell's trademark color and I pee he means him pee Pharrell I mean what else I could say about the track is I don't know I mean if I got into how this song makes me feel I had I'd literally start breaking a sweat I get all hot and bothered on it have to cut this review off it really is that sexy if you kind of let the animalistic raw just lustful feelings of the song just take hold but outside of that I love Monet's very shouty sassy Colin response vocals the meticulously placed percussion now to go back to the song screw transitioning out of that track very nicely is Django Jane which I already praised pretty heavily when it was released as an earlier single it's a declaratory moody rap track where Monet essentially builds up her image as a one-of-a-kind artist a lot of themes of female empowerment throughout the track - I love that one line that's just like damn that's a bar over she talks about having to start a Pussy Riot she's gonna have to put them on a pussy diet was that was a good one the song pink is another great single that T's toward the release of this album a fantastic team-up not the first one though between her and Canadian pop artist Grimes the song brings a really summery feel-good blissful blend of pop and rock kind of an unusual sound for Monet it's just a little too bubbly a little too bright not typically something you hear her on the song sounds a lot like a Grimes track which I think is exactly why she had invited Grimes on to it but despite the fact that this track is a little unusual for Monet she pulls it off the song is easily one of the smarter and catchy or female empowerment anthems of the decade and I think a lot of people listening to it aren't quite appreciating just how cheeky the song is especially when you get down to the descriptions of the colors of the insides down there the song is really dynamic and really feminine as well I mean it's very pretty it's very gentle it's very tender yet also loud and powerful and authoritative the song make me feel was really the first single from this record that I truly fell in love with it's another moment on the album that is deeply inspired by prints the percussion the sense on this track feel almost like they're like a revision like a reversal or some kind of reimagine take on Prince's kiss it's like a lot of elements from that track have been transferred over onto this one and updated for the Millennial audience also I love Monet's lyrics on this track just the themes of attraction on this song are wonderful gorgeous Oh God in that music video so hot it's such the song I like that was the first single from the record that I felt just kind of on the fence with and even now listening to it in the context of the record I'm not all that crazy about it while I do like Monet lyrically going back into her past and celebrating this idea of individuality and kind of what makes her her own person and even though that makes her a bit of an outsider kind of weird not accepted by everyone celebrating that I still think the instrumental on this song just kind of sounds like your generic run-of-the-mill trap be definitely not an instrumental that to me feels as vibrant or as interesting or as intricate or as flavorful as many of the other instrumentals here not an instrumental which if I had heard it on its own I thought you know who would sound great on this oh my god Monet would sound great on this between her leads and the harmonies on this track she does put quite a bit of vocal work into it so it's not that bare of a song but it's still vastly overshadowed by a number of other tracks here I mean even some of the quieter ones like don't judge me which is this very slow psychedelic pop ballad on the surface the song reads like a story of not being able to be yourself around your significant other or being afraid that if you are yourself around your significant other that they're going to judge you and the only reason they have feelings for you is that they're in love with a character something that's not the real you the instrumentation on the track is settled but very flavorful these dreamy synthesizers some very nice guitar work a steady bass line and drum be the song so afraid is another track on the album that is not one of the more harder hitting but it does bring an interesting message and a blend of sounds there's like a very crunchy dejected set of guitar chords at the start of the song Monet is singing in a kind of angsty tone it actually sounds like the intro of a Nirvana song after this point in the track I was kind of expecting her in the band to go into like full grunge mode but it eventually blossoms into this epic heavenly soulful panoramic blend of instrumentation and vocals with Monet singing out passionately about how she's so afraid and while it may seem like again on the surface hey this is another love song it's another relationship song it all kind of comes back around on the closing track Americans where it becomes painfully clear that the really ship that she's referencing on those two tracks as well as maybe other tracks on this record is a relationship with her own country the song Americans has an amazingly hype 80s synth-pop vibe on it I get a bit of prints on this track I even get like a touch of Wham and the song is an all-inclusive call to everyone getting ground through the gears of the system in America to come together and fight for a better country that's women and blacks and Latinos members of the LGBTQ community poor white people I do find the track really inspiring really catchy very sweet though again I do think it does become another example on this album of some of the politics being reduced down to mere sloganeering a little bit which as I've said before in previous videos is one of the inherent problems with trying to make a pop record political because politics are so complex pop music and pop art is so straightforward it's so simplistic still though I enjoy a great deal of the songs on this record I think the production is pretty good the performances are nice and I think Monet mostly gets to where she's trying to go when it comes to the lyrical themes - I'm not gonna say this album is dumb because it's not it's far from a dumb album but I feel like Monet is smarter than the way she puts things on this record and I'm sure she understands that I mean it's only to this album's benefit that she didn't try to awkwardly preach herself through every single song on here and focused on making sure that at the end of the day the songs sounded good not just that they conveyed a message that she felt passionate about because his pop friendly as this album sounds it was definitely a risk to try to make a pop album that in a way was was smart more thoughtful and smarter than your average pop record I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this album transition what did you think of this album did you give it a listen did

a1olq-lfc-I,hi everyone beer theny bong tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new post Malone album beer bongs and Bentley's this is the latest album from white Iverson himself post Malone mr. Austin Richard post who blew up back in 2015 off of a pretty hot song white Iverson after that he dropped a mixtape eventually we had his full-length commercial debut stony late 2016 in December it's an album that at the time didn't cause a gigantic splash but it slowly gained him more and more momentum over the course of 2017 now I did not care for the album for a lot of different reasons which I'm not gonna rehash in this video I originally slapped Stoney with with a not good my negativity toward this record most likely inspired a lyric on this new album over here we don't follow trends rest in peace - yamo your new shit sucks I feel like Anthony Fantana but when it comes to posts Malone's new stuff at least the teaser tracks from this album my reactions have been far from negative in 2017 post landed one of the biggest songs of the year rockstar a track that I ranked as being one of my favorite singles of the year I think his best single so far one of his best songs to date really the first song from him that I honestly loved and not just because the hook was sharp as hell and the 21 savage feature was really cold not just because the production was incredibly grand and eerie and atmospheric a lot of my attraction that the song has to do with the singing I mean post singing on this track has really smoothed out it features a good balance of his his actual voice the tambour of his voice and some auto-tune the mixing on the vocal sound better as well and at the time I remember thinking hey you know if he could make a song this good maybe he'll pull through on beer bongs and Bentley's maybe it'll happen now in a lot of ways this record is is merely an improvement on the Stoney formula it's about the same tracklist length and runtime the same blend of trap style production and auto-tune vocals and moody R&B but this time around the sound is measurably better so are the vocal performances two posts singing on this album is definitely more versatile it's not nearly as amateurish or annoying weak were washed out in effects the production across the board on this thing sounds a lot more grand as well very intoxicating very chilly I'm not gonna say it's reinventing the wheel or groundbreaking if you've kept up with rae sremmurd or travis scott or like the weekend you kind of know the vibe that post Malone is going for especially on tracks like taking shots which is this really generic drinking track really generic party track and for whatever reason the instrumental ski and has this vibe that reminds me of Kanye West's fucked my life from his tea lap record so there are definitely similarities that post has to his contemporaries his music is very much the product of the current state of music the trend the trap trend that we found ourselves trapped in but simultaneously post has effectively with this album carved out a little niche for himself in the oversaturated field of part rappers part singers I mean there are a couple of obvious shortcomings on this thing the fact that it did not really truly need to be an hour I mean there aren't that many highlights on here posts sound his style isn't that varied nor are his lyrics so substantive and thoughtful that he has enough stories or angles to pack throughout this record I mean the song 92 explorer for example it's not bad it's listenable it's just as listenable as nearly any other song on here but is it really adding anything to the tracklist that the previous tracks didn't already not really I kind of feel the same way about the song candy paint as much as the aesthetic of the track is is uniquely glamorous and dreamy the vocal melody is just super tedious and and structurally it's pretty weak so there are moments where it does feel like post is kind of padding the tracklist out most likely because putting out a project of this length with this many tracks on it is just kind of the name of the game in the age of streaming got to get those plays get those plays baby and as much as I realize that that is the business model it doesn't make this album any less of a slog especially when post is subjecting me to tracks like spoil my night which might have the trashiest vocal melody on the entire record one of the worst sway lis features I've heard him drop in the past year I've never been like a small fry and some of the most for Kilis lyrics on the entire project before the existence of this verse I was really a devout atheist but I'm pretty sure now that I've seen two rock references and a Jumanji reference within the same block of text that is proof that God exists obviously the same divine inspiration that went into writing the Bible went into writing this if you now open up to your Elevens condiment you'll see thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's beautiful boobies so as ridiculous as a few parts of this album are I have to admit that most of this album it sounds like pure hits hits on hits on hits and I guess I don't mind the lyrics being a little shallow if it means that the tracks are just impeccably produced impeccably catchy and I think post does make an effort on this album - pepper songs and verses throughout it where you do get a little bit more introspection it does seem like he pulls back the veil a little bit gets a bit more personal that's the vibe that I get on the opening track paranoid on the album as he's singing dramatically over this very sad moody instrumental about how he's watching his back and he can't trust anybody referencing Edward Snowden who honestly does not get referenced enough he really doesn't in post defense I mean he has gotten a lot of hate over the past few years some deserve it some not so I definitely get the angle he's taking with this track but really was stunned me about this song is that his voice sounds so much more dynamic on this track than it did on nearly any other song on stony he has such an emotional vibrato on this track and and many others here he hits all these passionate cracks on the hook as soon as he really starts to push that volume and I think he's generally doing a better job of kind of wearing his emotions on his sleeve as he's performing those emotions also translate on the track rich and sad a track where seems like he's wishing that this person who he had as a love interest stayed in his life either before or after the money all I really get a sense of on this track is that the money wasn't making this person stay he couldn't buy this person's love and that he would trade all the money and all the success to get this person back it's one of the most emotionally compelling portrayal of loneliness and fame that I've heard from a pop rapper at Malone's level in a while not to mention the vocal melody on the hook just has engrained itself in my brain I would throw it out of the way I just keep up wishing that my name is Dan the song Zach and codeine as in referencing The Suite Life of Zack and Cody that is one of several intoxicating and incredibly blissful party tracks on the album probably the best one here but still one that I have a hard time rationalizing considering that you do have a moment on this record where post is shouting out ASAP yams but then simultaneously talking about rinsing his mouth out with codeine and how his life is sweet like codeine still it's a pretty bubbly track super catchy and makes me feel like I'm swimming through the ocean the song over now is one of the most dramatic tracks on the entire album really second only to blame it on me oh god those thick layered vocal harmonies on that track it sounds so weird and robotic and epic and bouncing back and forth between taking the blame but that not wanting to take the blame it just seems like he's he's tearing himself emotionally apart from the inside but the song over now is one of the most aggressive relationship ending songs I've heard in a while like he's talking about putting that pussy in a body bag it's over it's done I don't even want you anymore ah it's like he's just kicking down the door on this relationship and just he's so unapologetic on this track yet also admitting what an idiot he was he's just in the throes of this angry relationship psychosis and it's it's pretty heavy the song psycho while it did under well me a little bit when I first heard it has grown on me it's kind of got this nice a nocturnal summery vibe to it and I have to admit that ty dolla sign and post Malone are a good complement for one another and even though maybe at its core it's just kind of like a cheap relationship song you know getting over that other person who you used to be with and so on and so forth I think better now might be this album sleeper hit I mean it's just too insanely catchy and cut and dry for it not to latch on to the hearts of of posts young audience whatever a guy or girl makes them feel bad you know I say that I am better now better not to mention that this is one of many tracks on here I feel like post separates himself a bit from a lot of his competition and that you do kind of hear those subtle notes of guitar and bass actual guitar and bass being worked into his tracks he does kind of feel like he's more of a guitar strumming singer-songwriter just kind of belting out these songs about heartbreak then he is a rapper or a trap rapper he's just merely kind of using this production and this aesthetic to sell these songs that he's writing which we also get a glimpse of on the song stay which is essentially the the album's lone acoustic track which actually has some good chord progressions it's another moment on the album or post seems to be struggling with keeping a relationship together at this point on the record it's it's really kind of nothing new he's kind of been spinning these heartbreak anthems on on numerous points of the album so far and lyrically even though there are some pretty dramatic moments like oh my god you put her cigarette out on your face what the fuck it's not like the lyrics are so great that just stripping away all the bouncy heavy trap style production that you know I'm just being wowed by posts pen game you know as far as some of the other features on here goes I mean Nicki Minaj's was pretty good certainly better than than young Gerald's gez however I think I think best feature is is easily taken by yg on this thing and overall I'm just really happy I'm really pleased and and kind of surprised too I mean after hearing Rockstar of course as I said earlier I thought that post might be able to pull through on this one if you focused and came through with the sound that was as quality in a series of songs that were as catchy as what he had delivered on that single and for the most part he did that I mean he still has a ways to go in terms of building his style so that he's not just tediously repeating himself again and again and again and again and who knows if he'll ever really get there considering the audience that he's trying to attract with his music but on beer bongs and Bentley's I'm hearing improvements on all fronts and in quite a few again better production better singing better vocals better grasp of melody better grasp of song structure some pretty good performances too I can't hate on this one I really can't it's not that bad I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I do next if you like if you like please subscribe and

EYKPQgwDyiI,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for the weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week oh yeah that's what we do every week of course before before we get into this I have to say that our melon shirt is still available on our support page on the website just a bunch of picture of melons they're you know no pictures of me or anything no pictures of my face feature down this on this shirt at all it's just a bunch of melons or if there is a picture of me on

turntable lab associate links the good people over at turntable lab you hit up their website they have colorful vinyl pressings of Records that I reviewed on my channel as well as record players and audio equipment you know speakers that sort of thing for your budding record collector friend or audio file or you you know treat yourself because when you use that link you pick up something from them we get kicked back from it and you know supports the channel supports the segment and yeah those are those are the links that we want to shout out and all of those links and everything I'm going to be talking about of course is down in the description box of course I want to shout out a few more tracks before we into the worst and best and everything Mac DeMarco and Shamir their beat happening covers that I talked about in my record story video those are out and streamable and that is linked down there in the description box along with this cool little ghoul and ill bill split single never thought I'd see these two worlds colliding that's linked down there below shout out to ill bill and ghoul doing some hardcore hip-hop and doing some thrash on the same on the same split single that's nice and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks of the week all right she and him he gives his love to me she gives all her love to me he gives all his love to me sorry about that I'm a little tired so I'm sorry if I mess up a few words here and there so yeah easily one of my least favorite she and him tracks that I've heard in a long time for the most part I've been kind of tolerant of she and hims nostalgia factor for a long time it's really been kind of one of them were quaint and endearing aspects of their music I mean I found kind of the chord progression the songwriting to be just a little too cutesy and generic and and Zooey Deschanel's vocals to sound kind of foghorn ish a bit of a turn-off for me but but I up until this point I I guess I could see the appeal and what they were doing to an extent but I feel like it's totally gone out the window on this track I mean this song to me feels like I'm visiting a really awful retro diner like one of those bad awful 1950s throwback diners it's not from the 50s they're just trying to make it feel like it's from the 50s and the jukebox is broken the floor is filthy the Busboys spills a glass of somebody else's ice water into your lap the waitresses are rude the food is awful the place smells yeah it just feels like really awful nostalgia just awkwardly perform nostalgia just like a really clumsy put on and I really don't know how to describe it other than that Mason Ramsey yodel boy has a new single I was hoping that there would actually be some yodeling on here this would be a bit of a celebration of country's rustic history but instead the song here while it does have some nice organic and acoustic elements to it just kind of sounds like your average Nashville pop country songwriting you know project again I think he's he's a bundle of joy you know he's he's totally loveable totally cute all-american people are probably going to dig this and people are probably gonna say that I'm bullying a little kid but this song was clearly like either worked for him or he was working with a co songwriter on this track because again this just sort of sounds like any other piece of pop country that you would hear coming from a number of different artists so I guess the industry has already kind of put him on that pop country track and you know hey you know the kids got a good voice you know he's got a good voice he doesn't sound bad and he's probably only going to get better as a singer as the years go on so you know maybe they'll actually put the investment in him and he'll have a long healthy career but it seems like he's not going to do much to kind of very outside of the norm with going on and kind of with what's going on in country currently so whatever being famous 4:11 you and these two new Kanye tracks of course yeh versus the people and lift yourself master or rather just lift yourself this is the the master of lift yourself I will say lift yourself is the better of the two tracks because at least that song knows it's full of shit beats good love the way that samples are chopped up groove is fun and I could not help but laugh once Kanye drops at the very end and goes scoop maybe well whoop did you scoop poop poop scoop did he poop it dude whooping doopa doopa doopa doopa poop I mean honestly one of his sickest verses but then we had this other track featuring ti yeh versus the people where Kanye is essentially trying to go into detail of his reasoning and the drama surrounding his endorsement of Trump and Magga and wearing the Maggie Hat on Twitter this past week which I've already spoken about online saying that to me it just sort of seems like a ploy to get more attention on himself to promote his music to get people talking about him because for Kanye several things are true he thinks all publicity is good publicity he thinks that anybody who's a genius is crazier that all geniuses are crazy so that if people are not understanding you or if people are going against you or if people are angry with you or just like not getting where you're coming from then you must be on to something which might not necessarily be the case I mean Kanye even acknowledges his his will to go against the grain his almost need to go against the grain in this which I very much see m'p art of his attraction to this to this whole thing to this whole Trump endorsement and and I don't think Kanye is that deep into Republican politics or anything I mean he said on numerous occasions on Twitter I haven't even done enough research to know if I'm Republican or blah blah blah and I also love Hillary - and hey you know this is just about love and I don't agree with Trump on everything but you can't stop me from loving him we have dragon energy but anyway I with the concept of this track and maybe at the end of the day maybe Kanye in his own twisted ways is is well-intentioned here maybe Kanye is trying to bring about some kind of wave of togetherness and cutting through all the partisan anger and frustration and so on and so forth maybe that's his attempt maybe that's what he's trying to do here and if that's his goal I guess I wish him all the best good luck I hope it happens but I can't really see this track as being anything else other than utterly delusional to the part where it's just cringe II I mean Kanye's saying that oh I took Magga and I brought it empathy and I brought it this and I brought it that no I mean you just were mag a hat that's all you did you didn't bring Magga anything like mega and Donald Trump still stand for and mean the same things that they've always meant the meaning has not changed just because you've jumped into the Magpul which again you're just kind of wearing the Hat for show and for attention I mean not really changing the movement or educating the the people who follow that movement or love Trump on anything in fact you feel like as you've stated in this song you're opening people up to other ideas which again is kind of another one of the more preposterous points in this track like what are you trying to say that people who don't like Trump or who are against Trump like don't know what Republican politics are they don't know about trickle-down economics they don't know about the Muslim band they don't know about Donald Trump's wall and every other policy that he's been pushing trying to pull people off of Obamacare trying to get rid of Obamacare like we're not fully aware of all these things going on he's talking about opening people up to new ideas as if people haven't been aware of what Republican policies have been for the past 20-30 years like saying that oh ham introducing people to new ideas is like saying that hey all you eat is McDonald's have you heard of Burger King yeah we know what the fuck Burger King is and in people just happened to like McDonald's or like Burger King or whatever not to be reductive about the situation but when I feel like he's even more ridiculous about this track is that is is Kanye pushing this Democratic plantation narrative onto black people on this track which is maybe one of the hardest punches down I've heard on a song ever because here's the thing when black people vote Democrat they know the Democrats don't do shit they know Democrats don't do anything however just like everybody else they put their pants on one leg at a time in the morning and they go into the voting booth and they vote for the lesser of two evils so to act like when black people vote for Democrats they're doing it just because they're dumb and brainwashed and they don't know any better and they're on the plantation is like one of the most ignorant stupid insulting things I've ever heard in my life like when people on the right and when Kanye repeat this democratic plantation walking point and and they they pointed at black people do they think they're convincing them of anything do they think that oh wow you know that these people must really have my interests in mind because they think my reasoning for voting democrat is that I'm too stupid to do otherwise I'm just brainwashed I'm just mindless I'm just on the Democratic plantation are you kidding me so listen I could write a whole book about why this song is stupid and and and at the end of the day black people don't have to be Democrats of course of course that's the case however kanye's embrace of Trump has little to do with Pollock has little to do with policy has little to do with right wing and left wing ideals he's just kind of running around saying oh I love this person I love that person and and I love everybody as a means of being controversial because if that was really his message from the get-go then he just would have come out with that message and just said it instead of just trying to hey I'm gonna open up by saying I love one of the most hated people in America right now like again there are people who have their reasons for loving and both hating Trump but Kanye hasn't really brought up salient reasons for doing either he's clearly just attracted to Trump and attracted to doing this because of the attention it brings him because of his ego because of what he sees as overlaps and his and Trump's personality and I don't know man it's just kind of disappointing I mean this has always been Kanye's thing for a long time to stir controversy to go nutso to get the media talking about him to get all eyes on him but for whatever reason this time it seems like he's going just a little overboard now at the end of the day I know his hardcore fans they're gonna listen to his album anyway and in the age of streaming this is hardly just a straightforward shot in the foot because after all of this there's gonna be tons of people millions of people who are gonna stream his new album out of morbid curiosity because they have to know what the hell is going on through his head because there are so many people out there that despite the fact that Kanye comes off so unhinged that they're just morbidly curious about everything this man thinks and says and partially for good reason because he is a very compelling artist he's a very compelling performer he has some really great musical ideas that have revolutionized the hip-hop landscape so as unpredictable as unlikeable as out of pocket as out of his mind as yeh can seem to be sometimes typically he always ends up finding a place where he settles down and lands safely you know he sort of creates this tsunami of controversy and then he you surfs the waves again if if you're if you're under the assumption this is the first time Kanye has pissed his fans offers has gotten a large amount of people angry at him you are sorely mistaken I cannot say at this point how I think this is gonna pan out you know especially after hearing how awful this track is as well intentioned as it may be because hey who knows maybe there's more songs exactly like this coming down the pipe maybe he already has a ballot in the works with with John Legend and and Kanye brings all the Trump bars and John Legend brings all the Hillary bars and I I of course just lose my fucking lunch whatever I've just eaten before the song is even done so yeah those are my thoughts on this track for the most part let's just move on because I've spoken enough on it let's get into the tracks that I thought we're okay kind of man but certainly worth shouting out not not blown me away but not bad either you know you guys might digging a little bit more than me the Internet has a new track out featuring a lot of different people the song over here is titled roll burbank funk has one of the sweetest and slickest bass lines i've heard in a while like a lot of internet tracks i'll say that the vocals and kind of the washy somewhat trippy production on the song feel a little awkward at some points however i think i do think it is one of their better tracks and as again i'll say awkward as some of the internet's earlier music was this was easily one of their more slick and i guess a more properly assembled tracks so it does have any it does have me pretty excited so moving on from there stephen malkmus and the chicks have a new track out new album on the way as well and this song has excuse me a bit of a route c lo-fi rough full track with Kim Gordon of all people on guest vocals the song is titled refuse and moving on from there snail mail has this record lush coming out very soon it's a bit of a loaf I kind of a messy indie garage pop tune with some rough guitars and some pretty fun lead vocals the track is titled heatwave it's got an incredibly hilarious hockey theme music video attached to it that I thought was really great moving on from there Mack DeMarco has a new cut out with Melanie Fey eternally 12 it's a nice little guitar jam with some good grooves some good some good trippy bro yeah Yacht rock grooves I hate the rock tag when people talk about Mack DeMarco but there was something about this track that felt like a little bit of a little bit of an adult-oriented rock kind of funk throwback that I thought was that I thought was pretty sweet a little fag over here with cupcake iced out dick and dr. woke on this track as well one of the more I don't know I guess kind of fun wrap trap rap tracks that I've heard in a while although you know it's not any kind of super hard or aggressive song or anything like that you know it's it's about a having a nice stout dick you know and obviously that there's a queer factor here and there's a quite a bit of hilarious bombastic lyrics on this thing about stealing stealing your man because he's in he's in the closet and so on and so forth things that he's attracted to two little faggots it's pretty entertaining I dug it and you know of course cupcakes on the track and she kills it because she kills it every time moving on from there trouble in paradise is a new song from Girl Talk Girl Talk and Eric the architect of Flatbush zombies Fame and this is just this is just the collaboration that I never knew I needed never knew I wanted although I I know I know I have wanted to hear more from Girl Talk and I hope that he comes through with like some kind of project or EP in the near future where he features a lot of different rappers because this one came together really well and you know was a total banger I wouldn't say songwriting wise it was like the catchiest or the most memorable but I had a nice attitude to it you know what I mean like it wasn't blown away anything that I was loving off of that freeway EP that came out a while back but dude I want this to happen just come out with more shit and that's it let's move on to the best tracks of the week although there was one track in this list that I think I accidentally put into the best list and I will discuss that as we get deeper into it but um this first woman I wanted to talk about was the new zeal and ardour wastes some of you guys might remember that I talked about this project on Van Camp a while back he was mixing elements of like blues and gospel and like old-school slave songs with black metal like weird combination I know and and that's not currently the blend of sounds that he's working with currently but um [Music] you know they're starting there's still are elements of metal and soul coming together on this track and on the previous track too and I don't know it's pretty exciting pretty exciting combination moving on from there Thundercat has a new track out titled final fight which is easily one of the best songs that I've heard and put together in a while one of the longer more fulfilling and more intricate tracks that I've heard him assemble certainly like more gutsy than a lot of what was on drunk I don't know just kind of dig in those bass lines and Thundercats vocals those are nice ok this this is the track this is new what a tricks might never track I put it into the best tracks League but it kind of changed my mind just a little bit I do feel like this tracks a little bit more worthy of the mass section it's not terrible but here's the thing I like the dark strange artsy vibe that the song brings it's kind of like a weird dystopian autotune autotune like lead piece of art pop but I feel like the vocal performance is a little awkward like there's something kind of often I guess just a little passionless about the the vocal performance like it's kind of sucked of any any kind of thrill or excitement or emotion or something it just seems a little off maybe it's gonna make more sense in the in the context of the record but I'll say I'm intrigued I will say I am intrigued like did the song blow me away it just felt like it didn't really know what it wanted to be at some points you know and again I feel like I'm mostly kind of getting that vibe from how off the vocals felt but uh but outside of that you know I feel like once again he's pulling together Daniel is pulling together a really cool aesthetic I feel like some of the ideas are there and I could see how he's kind of mellowing out a little bit since what he was doing on a garden of delete you know it's nowhere near as abrasive or avant-garde as a lot of the tracks on there this track in a way actually pretty much reflects the cover seems like very much it's it's like this futuristic but in a way like idyllic but it's clearly taking that idealism and and and taking it to a dark place in a way a dystopian place I could sort of see again conceptually what he's going for here and hopefully it pans out a little bit more but as of right now I'm just like a little bit on the fence moving out from there this tracks singularity is a new song from John Waite everything connected yeah there should be at John Hopkins over here no no there's cupcake there's blank mass there's at the gates yeah that's the new John Hopkins track or the cover for the new John Hopkins record John Hopkins has a new track out titled everything connected and just like songs you've heard from John before you know it's kind of this driving blend of techno and house and there's a lot of like grand very atmospheric very Spacey and epic instrumentation surrounding the synths surrounding the beast surrounding the groove so you kind of get lost in it it's kind of hypnotic it feels larger-than-life it's maybe not quite as I guess orchestral and I guess melodic as some of the material on his last record but I kind of liked that weird hypnotic stillness of the song quite a bit it added a lot to the track for me all right quiz from cupcake this is a new single from her and now of course she is working with some people over at the PC music camp which is really exciting like one of my issues with cupcake music in the past she has incredible personality like great ideas for songs and she writes him really good bars - she has a great flow great performance but her production just always doesn't I think match how unique of a rapper how unique of an artist she is and now I feel like with quiz like we're finally getting that we're finally getting to that point and I'm so happy that it's happening yeah I'm just really thrilled about this track and hopefully she drops more like it in the future and again as far as like her bars and her performance like she goes totally fuckin balls to the wall so shout out to cupcake blank Mass Benjamin John power of fuck buttons fame has a new track out titled odd scene slash shit luck and the song over here is a long winding multi-phased well produced blend of like industrial music a little bit of black metal as well it's pretty intense and it's hard-hitting - and of course given those genres like you have a lot of vocals coming into the fold on this track which I did not know power could sort of perform in the way that he does on this song I mean maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot here and you know calling out my own ignorance because maybe he's not responsible for the vocals maybe I'm just being a moron and you know I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about but for whatever reason vocals are here and they really blew me away like I did not expect hearing vocals on a blank mass song through whichever way they arrived here and god they're incredible they're they're super abrasive and distorted and just like just like really kind of blasted my eardrums out and the the beats the progressions this song are just like really compelling some of the most intricate and just on the edge of your seat shit I've heard come out of blank mass so I don't know man new record on the way I'm hoping a very soon and I think we have one more track that I wanted to mention the new at the gate song believe it or not I think is one of their best in a while daggers black haze and yeah just kind of like a really heavy kind of catchy melodic but badass fucking metal tune and I'm gonna leave it at that guys this has been the latest edition of the weekly track roundup hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully you got some good recommendations out of this thing and yeah yeah yeah make sure you subscribe to the channel check out another video next to my head over here and I love you love you love you love you love you Anthony Fantana forever 
xS9kRoXURvg,hi everyone new phanie sleep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sleep album and the sciences this is a surprise new album from one of stoner metals most important bands if not the most important band sleep sleep is of course a trio featuring al Sisneros on bass and vocals Matt Pike on guitar and now jason roeder of neurosis Fame on drums through the 90s and the 2000s sleeps musical track record might not have exactly been prolific but what little music they did release caused a heavy and druggie underground surge in the rock genre that we are still feeling to this day repeatedly on record after record the band's slow fuzzy riffs built up into these massive mountains of droney psychedelic goodness but the band's key members eventually split off into their own respective bands high on fire and owned and while in a way it sucked to not have new music from sleep every once in a while what few records they did release each seemed like its own pivotal addition to the stoner metal genre plus Madden owls output post sleep has been pretty great too I mean each one in their respective bands has come through with at least a couple of classic records so now we're at a point where it's been 15 years since the release of the last sleep album their biggest dope smoker and of course this new album came out on 4/20 & on Third Man Records of all places third man thank you Jacky boy Jack Thank You Jackman thanks Jackman Thank You Johnny Depp so sleep is back and this record sounds like they haven't even missed a beat while the material on this is similar to that of sleeps other output it's also different at the same time the mix is obviously nowhere near as rough as holy mountains which is pretty notorious for not being the best produced album ever the performances on this record aren't quite as aggressive or animalistic either the sciences is definitely on the more meditative side of the sleep spectrum and yet this record is not nearly as bass heavy or as slowly paced as dope smoker or Jerusalem the sciences hits this kind of successful middle ground between sounding Spacey but also very visceral one has to consider that Matt and Al have had years of artistic progression outside of the sleep bubble and they're kind of each bringing their own experience into this record because there's a really abrasive roar to the tone and Matt's guitars as well as some really aggressive and flashy soloing that wasn't quite as intense as it was on previous sleep records Al's bass work I think has only gotten more simplistic and meditative since his years in ohm and also he kind of brings that monotone deadpan chant like vocal delivery that he kind of honed in that band not the guttural bellowing vocals that one may be used to hearing on sleeps older material so on this record in a way fans can expect to hear elements of ohm high on fire and sleep all at once thankfully no matter whose creative input seems to be taking the reins on a given track it all comes together pretty harmoniously so pretty much every track on this thing save for the tension building intro is a long winding Jami and exciting rock rumination the song marijuana's theme features these righteous galloping riffs and drums that get louder and more intense the track plods along I just love the progressive intensity of the track also Matt Pike rips this amazing like layered guitar solo in the last leg of the song that just overloads my brain it's like great stoner metal it's great stoner rock it just feels like I'm on drugs it's noisy it's overwhelming the song sonic Titan right after is pure thunderous Sabbath worship especially as it transitions into this second track with a groovy ur riff and al pulls out this vocal melody that it's it's just so Ozzy I love the kind of slinky ascending descending riffs they're kind of creepy at this point in the track and we get yet another great guitar solo to finish things off we actually see the return of Al's classic growl on the track Antarctic Ken's thawed antarcticine 's Antarctic uns it's the longest track on this thing at 14 minutes easily one of the most epic the lyrics feature all of this grand imagery of seas and ice and glaciers as one of the more meditative points on the record all I really wish for here is just the the mix had more bass on it because while it's not terrible it's certainly listenable the performance is on this thing are great it just feels a little too hollow or maybe even slightly tinny for a stone or metal record sometimes we have even more Sabbath worship on this record on the track Giza Butler a tribute to the band star bassist opening up with a very pensive psychedelic guitar intro the vocals are somewhat stiff stiffer than they are on the rest of the record in my opinion which is something that has kind of turned me off about some ohm albums a while I think it goes over somewhat well on a majority of the tracks here and on this song not so much and given that it is a butler tribute track I guess I was expecting a little bit more bass work to kind of come to the forefront here I mean there is a solo a bass solo on the tail end of the song but I don't really care for the tone of the bass at all again felt a little hollow and even though I feel like this track might be a little bit of a low point on the album it's all relative I mean in the grander scheme of things it's still pretty enjoyable and then we have the botanist closing things up on this album which is a very kind of moody very dynamic track takes things in a direction with these sparkling spacious guitars that kind of remind me of some of the ballads on Metallica's black album I mean sleep ain't right in a ballad or anything like that but it's a pretty good tune and I think a thoughtful emotive way to end this album - and that's pretty much the record from front to back I mean it's it's really good easily one of the better and more consistent comeback albums to come out in a while a record that shows a band doing what they're known for doing what they've done and doing it incredibly well showing that they still have it it's not so different that it's reinventing the wheel or anything like that or doing anything truly groundbreaking for the genre but the band still did a really excellent job of writing new material staying true to their sound while also incorporating the various musical worlds that each person on this album has been living in for the past 10 to 15 years I'm feeling a strong a - a light 9 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

43tFabU6610,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new Felix Bloom album death in Haiti funeral brass bands and sounds from port-au-prince this is a new album from sound artist and I guess field recorder Felix blooms someone who before this record I wasn't even vaguely familiar with but this album doesn't necessarily require that you are it's a series of on-site recordings at a number of different Haitian funerals strung together across the album as if you're kind of listening to her experiencing one single one the sort of like in a long-running clip show but the most time or what seems like the most expansive recordings are handed over to the brass band bits of course there are quite a few brass band performances on this thing but there's a lot more than that as well sounds of people weeping and crying and screaming their heads off giving final or last words sounds of piano playing and the wake itself and I'm not really sure what to say about it beyond that I just felt like I needed to come on camera here and shout this record out because listening to this was such an interesting and a unique experience I mean it's obviously not like any commercial music album you're going to hear and a bulk of what is actually on this record isn't even just strictly music some of it is just merely talking or commiserating or just the the goings on the audio of the goings-on at this funeral it's less like an album and more like a mini auditory documentary and given that that's the case it's kind of hard to critique it in the same way that one normally would to any other record am I supposed to come on here and say oh the the people weren't crying loudly enough for something you know what I mean I mean I'm not trying to disrespect what's being contained in this album I'm just kind of merely saying that I'm in a bit of a conundrum here and talking about this album in that I can't go about it in the same way that I do any other record because it's not like any other record not that this thing is the first album of field recordings or the first record to document a real life event it's not but it's certainly the first one I've wanted to review on this channel but what I guess I can say is that the recording of this record is very good it gives you a very intense and vivid sense of place everything going on and the brass music featured on this record has an incredibly unique sound there's a variety of different pieces some of which have a more mournful tone others that are a little bit more joyous but there's always a kind of weird sour surreal character to some of the performances on this thing it's kind of like the the musicians themselves in the band are on the verge of just like breaking up emotionally and it's kind of coming through in the music especially when the band as a unit sounds like it's about to crumble and just fall apart pretty much every brass piece and performance on this thing I found to be really intriguing and thrala ng fantastic and all the tracks surrounding these moments essentially tell a very rich story of a long-standing Haitian funeral tradition it's a listening experience unlike anything I've heard this year that's most likely going to be the case for a lot of you as well and I can't really say anything else about it outside of it's not for the faint of heart and I highly recommend it transition have you given this album a listen if you did did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well hit over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the only to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Felix bloom forever 
ZruuCzKf70k,hi everyone knew that Eman tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Perfect Circle album eat the elephant a perfect circle a rock band that originally turned heads in the 2000s for having a bit of an interesting supergroup Eska lineup of course Maynard James Keenan of tool fame on vocals james iha of Smashing Pumpkins was in the band as well - I mean he's still in the band Troy Van Lewin of failure there are also some members connected to the Nine Inch Nails live lineup - and a perfect circle's lineup over the years it has been a bit of a revolving door as well I mean even at one point they featured Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson Fame in the early 2000s a perfect circle was a bit of a different band on the alternative rock scene they were taking a lot of the dark moody and vaguely industrial atmospheres happening in metal at the time and boiling them down into catch your songs and smoother ballads occasionally their first two albums were just a bit too Spacey and maybe a tad pretentious for my taste and all has been silent on the a perfect circle studio album front ever since outside of like a covers album of anti-war songs that went over like a lead balloon still considering how in high regard I hold a lot of the musicians in this band how relatively unblemished their track record is and the fact that there's been talk of a new tool album around the corner at some point I'm pretty curious to see how a perfect circle would approach a new album in 2018 especially since the band I think was always a bit more contemporary and had their ear to whatever was going on in music trend wise as opposed to like tool for example which I always thought was just a little bit more of an indulgence a great indulgence though so what a perfect circle stick to their trademark sound would they update it a bit and would they get a good album cover geez that thing is bug lis but in ugly it's but ugly I mean I can't argue with that a perfect circle does work to change their sound quite a bit on this record to the point where some of the musical passages on this album sound like they've been ripped straight out of the post-rock playbooks of bands like Mogwai or even mono and a perfect circle has always had a relative we dynamic and dramatic sound so it's not really all that surprising that they would take things in this direction however I didn't think some of the new material on this record would essentially be reduced down to really stiff lifeless piano rock though like on the intro the title track to this thing the band puts a bit more gas in the tank on the next track disillusioned while the glistening and Spacey piano passages on this thing may be a little overly dramatic and heavy-handed they do balance out with the consistently groovy ominous and heavy alt-rock sections also on this track some pretty dystopian lyrics about humanity at large being overtaken by animalistic desires man just chasing after anything glimmering becoming easily distracted there's a bit of a pretentious technology addiction angle to this track as well which I don't think is all that well put nor do I entirely agree with it I mean mankind has always been addicted to some kind of technology I mean you guys are using arrows and guns and radios and and printing presses and in in in things that clean water and pasteurized milk you're just addicted to technology the very eerie the contrarian is another track on the record I did quite a bit the song features a bit of harp and sounds like what would happen if you forced sigur rós to write a track that would appeal the tool fans in the mid-2000s some very heavy dramatic drum grooves very eerie lead vocals and as far as the guitar and the bass and the placement of the harp it's all very meticulous how it builds and progresses which is something I typically appreciate out of any music project Maynard is involved with he sees the value in very subtle progressions and builds which helps a perfect circle on this track and others create these depressing musical downward spirals into the deepest darkest depths of the human psyche the song in this case being about lying manipulating getting one over on people tricking others for your own benefit and then religion which has always been a go-to topic for Maynard in his music pops up on this record as well specifically on the track the doomed where it seems like he's portraying Jesus and lyrics as dying and that kind of being a moment of abandonment of not only him but also humanity in general as we now live in a world that Maynard portrays as being evil filled with sloths and glutton and the like the instrumentals not half bad either themes of Jesus and in religious virtue also come up on the track talk talk essentially about how praying without any kind of action or effort to do anything or change the evil in the world is useless and meaningless and pointless and futile and why the hell are you doing it now I don't want to % know what Maynard's interpretations of the teachings of Jesus Christ are but whatever that is he clearly is of the opinion that those both theists and and not so theists are falling very short of that there's also an incredibly dark dense and overwhelming finish of bass and guitars just layered and stacked to an orgasmic intensity at the finish so long and thanks for all the fish is one of the most richest most harmonious and maybe most celebratory tracks on the entire record although it is a song that seems to be about doomsday a melodic send-off for the end of the earth obviously the title is a huge and obvious reference to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy so if you've ever read that book or seen that movie you kind of get what the band is going for thematic Allah as far as the lyrics go on this track however after this song in the tracklist I I think the album mostly kind of trails off though in terms of quality dlb is a kind of gothic and soso piano passage which I guess is fine as an interlude but it's it's not like it's kind of giving us a break from anything that we need a break from on this album much of the record is pretty pensive very moody very introspective what this moment on the record is giving us kind of a breather from I don't know meanwhile the track delicious features some of the most clunky and pretentious lyrics on the entire album with Maynard just trying to pack ten pounds of verbiage into a few minutes off I mean I appreciate his wish to make sure that there's some kind of meaningful deep spiritual or socio political message running through every single song here but this is clearly an instance where it where the the tune of the track suffers at the hand of Maynard trying to fit everything he can think of during his vocal passages not to mention the instrumental on this track sounds like it could have landed on okay computer or like even radio heads the bends not exactly sure what's what's driving that change of pace and to try to take it back to the lyrics easily the song that comes away with worst of them has to be the closer that is the song get the let out which if you look at the lyrics here they're easily the most redundant repetitive and tedious on the entire record I mean maybe there's a particular idea here that Maynard is attempting to communicate on this song but whatever it is he doesn't really build it up or explain it all that well and then there's the borderline laughable a very heavy very dark very funky hourglass which features not only rapping at the intro of the song or at least what sounds like it but also some ridiculous countdowns toward the finish of the song the verses feature these vocals with just like these crazy muffled warped manipulations on them and then some robot vocals as well it sounds almost as goofy and gaudy as like oh god what's that song that doll daga ziggy-zag whatever song that was off of marilyn manson's the Golden Age of grotesque the song feathers is an okay track it's maybe a little bit too melodramatic on the vocal side but it's easily one of the better songs and last light here but really that's kind of it for this album for me it really is a bit of a night and day difference in terms of consistency and quality and focus as soon as you hit that midpoint which is why for me at the end of the day this record is just kind of a mixed bag even as high as some of the high points on this thing are I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry

_C0gp-HN7NY,hi everyone I have pinkeye the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new hopalong album bark your head off dog oh that's gross what happened did you kiss too many cucumbers okay cuz you cuz you're vegan how are you doing this that's just what happens when you haven't eaten meat for 10 years earlier in the decade the band became one of the most exciting new artists on Conor Oberst Saddle Creek label and they built a reputation of recording this really tight nimble indie rock that was equal parts catchy and flashy with lots of angular gymnastic guitar work and of course all this was topped with the strained passionate and somewhat raspy vocals of Francis Quinlan the band's front woman now their last full length record was a little one-dimensional but still all around a really enjoyable album despite that one shortcoming it was their best recorded record yet best crop of songs great performances and this new record over here actually overcomes that problem in comparison with painted shut bark your head off is a much more versatile record also more smooth and laid-back in comparison as well normally that sort of thing would would worry me oh the band's kind of losing their buddy they're losing their fire but actually it's it's not really a bad swap because even in a somewhat more toned down State hopalong songwriting still shines and Francis Quinlan's vocals have an opportunity to show just how versatile they really are some of this record sketchiest moments actually come by way of the band toning things down a little bit because they actually end up sounding a little bit like some of those female fronted alternative rock bands from the 90s that I remember hearing when I was a kid I'm getting some vague impressions of jewell actually specifically on the song somewhere a judge with the breathy vocal harmonies in the background I mean this track to a tee sounds like what could have been a radio song 20 years ago but there's something really fresh and modern about it probably with the plucky guitars and with Quinlan's voice being so idiot Inc Radek and I think on this record she's improved as a lyricist as well not just by way of a lot of these songs being much more complex and tangled narrative Li than the tracks that were on the band's previous album but even some of Francis's most simple statements have a lot of impact like on the intro track where she's talking about what what seems like some kind of relationship between her someone else are just two people in general saying that hey we'll both find out but just not together also to go back to the track somewhere a judge the lyrics on the hook of this song are gorgeous talking about a vanilla Sun crawling across the lawn dragging someone around through her phone like just basically on a phone call their voice and that's another thing hopalong song structurally have matured quite a bit since their last album because on this record they're incorporating more builds interesting transitions progressions and even some really detailed storytelling like in the case of how you got your limp which while structurally may be one of the more underwhelming tracks on the record seems like Direction wise musically it doesn't really know where it's going it seems like the story is really kind of guiding the entirety of the track but it's still a pretty compelling tale of what seems like a professor sort of like abusing their position of power something could be wrong just as intriguing lyrically but a little harder to decipher was the song one that suits me another song with an incredibly catchy refrain that suits me but the lyrics seemed to be some kind of commentary on male leadership youth responsibility I also love the chill but bustling drumbeat on the track what the writer meant feels like a break beat but all the instrumentation laid on top of is so beautiful and serene it's such a wonderful knotty and winding song and I really dig the lyrics about what seems like intentions and and meanings with what someone has written changing over time different manipulations and interpretations being laid onto the work there's also a bit of a religious angle to one of the verses on this track to writing more detailed tracks definitely helps out how belongs long game quite a bit too as the song look of love is the longest track on the record one of the band's longest tracks period but it's just constantly changing pretty logically though and hitting the listener with different sounds again and again and again giving us at the start a wonderful acoustic intro very angelic and then transitioning into some nice mid pace kind of driving indie rock then some idyllic string beds then a few passages of swaying rock instrumentation with slinky guitars and organ some of the songs brighter moments get kind of lost and how convoluted the structure is to a degree which is maybe my biggest complaint about this album in general another track I kind of felt that way about was Fox in motion which doesn't have the strongest intro even if the story of the track is pretty good overall this is just a really good follow-up to hop along last record their most versatile record to date a very great blend of indie and pop and funk and alternative rock with good production great performances nice crop of songs and a singer who you could probably call one of a kind there's no major overarching theme on the record they're not reinventing the wheel musically and I guess there's nothing tying all the tracks together that deeply on a conceptual level but hey I'll easily take that over another generic boring pile of crap indie rock record with no freaking personality or someone trying to sound like Mack DeMarco I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this album transition have you given this out and we'll listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best

D5vrzzxGxwc,"Hello everybody bithony flatano here The Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new J. Cole album KOD, this is the fifth full-length album from the North Carolina rapper and what can really be said at this point that I or Somebody else hasn't said already about J. Cole supposedly woke rapper who does mainstream numbers and yet somehow falls short of his full potential with nearly every release given his track record I'm not really sure if I expected that much different this time around though I know at the end of the day J Cole is- is smart enough to do better He's talented enough to do better so my fingers are always crossed even if his hardcore fans Seem like they're into where he's at right now They don't want him to change and maybe are creating less motivation for him to do so; so this thing is a pretty tight It's a pretty trim album. It's 12 tracks that breeze by relatively quickly and It's it's like 44 minutes or so kicks off with an intro with a lot of spacey instrumentation, a female narrator going on about how the audience needs to choose wisely choose wisely on the journey of life. Honestly, it's not really that exciting or inspiring of an intro and knowing J. Cole I know that a lot of what this lady is saying is just gonna boil down to just Don't do the wrong thing just make sure you do the right thing So we transition into the track KOD, the title track of the album which is actually a decent tone setter for the record in that, it's a kind of sparse, somewhat eerie trap instrumental, a little unsettling but only vaguely hooks that barely sound like hooks and don't transition sonically or emotionally all that much from the verses, a kind of underwhelming vocal delivery and a general lack of focus across the songs themselves Which given the album cover here and given the title of the album which is like kids on drugs or king overdose you would think that this track specifically would be some kind of grand statement on substance abuse and addiction but some of the first bars he hits audiences with on this track is just him complaining about people wanting them to have more features on his records which just kind of comes off as bitter at the end of the day I mean I dig the overall vibe in the style of the track but once again Cole fails to pass the expectations test, and I don't mean merely my expectations or the expectations that his audience puts on him by hyping him up. I mean the actual expectations he puts on his own tracks with the song titles with the album cover with the messaging in the hooks because across J. Cole's discography I feel like there's always been J. Cole and then there is the reputation of J. Cole as this mega woke lyrical miracle with this laser focused intensity on whatever song topic or profound truth that he's dropping in a song when in actuality he's never truly been that at least not for longer than a song or two I mean there are certainly examples of that on this record but photograph is not one of them the song is basically an anthem for every Instagram creeper out there who falls in love at first sight with a picture of a woman totally overthinking the situation as if it's a situation at all ""what should I say, uh I hope I- I hope I can be this person's boyfriend"" It's a kind of creepy track when you get to the core of it It's sort of obsessive, like that weird little ""I'll keep this one to myself"" line in the hook is... I don't know it's it kind of makes the hairs on my neck stand up, not to mention the the subpar singing that Cole lays onto this track too, but the singing on this track is nowhere near that of ""kiLL edward"", the album's only featured ""artist"", and he's on the album twice I pretty much like the messaging in the sentiment of the song: Cole cutting people out of his life who have a toxic impact or are using him, not just in the present, but also reflecting on instances of this in the past, but truthfully it's one of the most hideous sounding songs on the entire record ""gimme drink, gimme smoke
get me drunk, get me a drink"" also this bar on here about not fantasizing about murder because he's sane but he can't get away from this desire to hurt this person who he has in mind which like what what do you even call that? The song ATM is quite possibly the first truly enjoyable moment on the album, first track that really delivers any kind of thrill even with the beat not being the hardest even with the hook being as a redundant as it is it's really Cole's delivery and fast flow and passionate performance that ends up making this song I mean, it's not the smartest message or the most grandiose truth bomb or anything but the track essentially gets to this idea of of greed and materialism and not being able to take all these things that you gather on to the other side Cole also paints a character portrait of this person who benefits profits off the misfortune of others which is easily the more interesting segment of the song a lot like with Cole's last record I feel like I'm kind of getting hints I'm getting like references to an idea of a concept or something like I'm kind of getting flashes of this individual who is is being represented on the front cover over here but Cole doesn't follow through enough to kind of fill this record with I don't know enough internal monologues or points of view from this person to really stitch a cohesive project together where I don't know we kind of get to know this individual or whoever the heck he's supposed to be again on an album Cole has a potentially great point he could be making but it's convoluted by him trailing off into other directions just a general lack of focus the song ""motivate"", it's pleasant while it's on, but it's easily one of the sleepiest motivational songs ever, it's confusingly short as well It's not one of the worst tracks on this thing, but it's essentially a very taxing creepin anthem with Cole rapping about temptation and being unfaithful and and being a Mac when he's out on the road his real opinions and motions on the matter seem kind of vague and at the end of the day he just kind of seems moody because he can't have his cake and eat it too. And speaking of taxing, the song ""BRACKETS"" is literally about taxes. Another painfully boring track on this album not just aesthetically but also structurally: the beat is pretty drab and the song features these multiple vocals snippet passengers that take way too long to make J. Cole's point however the second verse on this record is quite possibly one of the most salient on the entire album I mean while it might seem far-fetched that J.Cole is rapping about an app on your phone where you pick where your tax dollars go, his bars about neighborhoods being taxed and simultaneously not seeing the benefit of that taxation are pretty strong talking about schools not making the grade, talking about roads not being fixed the song ""Once an Addict (interlude)"" is another high point on the album. The song features all of these bars about J. Cole's mom when he was younger in the throes of alcoholism he's about to go to college, he's not really knowing what to do about it, he wants to run away from it. It's easily one of the most powerful tracks he's ever recorded, period really projecting that pain through his pen my only letdown with the song is that it's categorized as a mere interlude when it's just as long and much more entertaining than a lot of the other songs on the record the song ""friends"" right after is a moment on the record where Cole goes deeper into the topic of drug abuse and Honestly Cole is not nearly as annoying or preachy on this topic as I thought that he might have been going into it He's certainly not on the level of a Russ but what ends up kneecapping this song is not only another set of awful vocals from ""kiLL edward"" but also that there's a great build-up but not much in the way of payoff because while in one breath Cole is going in on this track against politicians poverty, traumatized kids people with short-sighted goals like oh, ""I'm gonna be on the Pistons"" ""I'm gonna be a basketball player"" Cole says on this track that he would need 20 CDs to essentially get to the core of of everything rotting America from the inside out, so he takes all this stuff he rounds all of it up only to put a cherry on top and tell the audience ""Meditate don't medicate"", and I don't know maybe that message turns heads at a local dare program, or a food co-op but a lot of this stuff is systematic and in meant to ruin people's lives and create a class of citizen that is caught in the cycle of ""drugs crime poverty drugs crime poverty drugs crime poverty"" with our current drug war and how we treat addiction in this country the song ""windowpane"", I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this track I mean the only thing truly awful about it is the title, beyond that the sentiment of the song is essentially Cole saying, ""I'm telling you guys all this good stuff I'm telling you what to do and what not to do and none of you are doing what I say none of you are listening to me"" which is a little desperate and it's most likely connected to Cole's ego in some way but I do feel his frustration and his anger at just a lack of positive change I agree with nearly everything he's saying and citing on this track, but the thing is at the end of the day the human race is flawed and people are going to make bad decisions, bad personal decisions You can't just merely wrap it or nag it out of your audience it's not going to happen all one could really hope for is that we create a better society where these bad decisions are less likely to happen and that we have better social safety nets for when these decisions occur again it's not that I hate Cole for trying. It's one of the few things that's truly admirable about him the issue is at the end of the day that a lot of these problems are bigger than him or really any of us individually and far beyond his reach even as a platinum-selling rapper I also love Cole's hypnotic flow on this track, the refrain on this cut is pretty cold-blooded as well Cole talking about wanting to see his relatives on the other side, hurt the man who hurt his mom and then we end things off at the track ""1985"" named after the year that J. Cole was born and a lot of people have been freaking out about this cut over the weekend saying ""it's a Lil Pump diss. He's dissing Lil Pump. Lil Pump responded, oh my God"" and this thing is not even a diss track, It's an advice track sure maybe the tone of the song is a little patronizing But J. Cole is smarter than a lot of the people who he's talking about and he's right this song features not only some of the smartest observations on the entire record, but some of the smartest commentary on rap right now We have how some of these new kids could be making more money in the industry Spending their money so that they have more longevity not only in in their music careers but also in life, telling these kids not to fall prey to the trends that they rode in on pulling them back into the ocean after the tide, you know, rolls back. And also how clueless white kids consume their music and view it as a window into authentic black culture and as bland as J. Cole can be sometimes what he says on this track about how long he's going to last in the industry is most likely true as long as he continues to provide this specific thing that appeals to this niche audience that loves them so much at the end of the day KOD is a lot like many other Cole records. there's a lot of heart, and there are some very good ideas here, but there's little to no ambition on this thing and Cole clearly thinks that just because he's past the very low bar of ""Well, I'm not making mindless crap"" he can merely come through the record that overall sounds very low energy, very low structure, very low everything and it's all gravy And I just don't get this insistence on a lack of features not that I think a flood of pop rappers would make this record any better But maybe some more outside input on his music would allow Cole to Collaborate with people who could, I don't know, fill in some of his musical blind spots of which there are quite a few Not really sure what else to say, I feel kind of indifferent, yet again, on another J. Cole album kind of torn because there are highs and there're lows here and really, that's what J. Cole just kind of tends to do, I guess. I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this transition Have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it?

a new reissue of the waves album coming out and there is like an additional like bonus track or at least you know more bonus material coming with this re-release which looks like a wonderful black and white spider the track is all star goth and it's it's an okay cut it's not a bad cut it kind of sounds super fuzzed out and loaf i and a little bit dreamier then i guess a lot of the other material on the album also a tyler the creator demo from like 2016 is floating around the internet now for some strange reason it's not bad but i can kind of see why it was it's a demo and why tyler would have a hard time kind of working out some of the rougher weirder parts of the track into something that might have been up to snuff on something like flower boy next Prince has released a or not Prince because obviously anything that was released at this point is posthumous but new music or I guess a an unheard piece of music from Prince has surfaced on the internet now where it's essentially his version which I mean he wrote the song originally but it's it's a recording of him performing the track nothing compares to you which of course he wrote and handed off to a Sinead O'Connor so it's it's actually one of my favorite songs he's ever written so it's kind of crazy to finally hear him performing it in a studio setting and yeah it's it's a wonderful track it's a wonderful performance I love it and I want to shout out this new portrayal of guilt split with street sex it's it's it's out now on Bandcamp as well as this new EP from a BB O sound machines so there's a lotta there's a lot of stuff to shout out a lot of material like dropped this week this is a really really busy week like there were some tracks that I just had to cut out of the segment entirely because there was just so much to talk about but yeah this has been like a huge music week like just so much just like a flood of new EP s and songs and really everything and I guess 2018 is heating up I mean it's it's starting to be spring it's getting warmer it's festival season now so of course like some of those big albums those big records those releases that labels and artists things sort of think are going to do huge this year are gonna be dropping now and very soon so let's get into what I felt were the worst tracks this week first this new race rumored track with Travis Scott again just feels like another kind of mediocre rodeo left over the track is titled close and God instead of saying you know the this person that they're talking about is close to me I just keep spelling out the word class and it's not very catchy it's just like ridiculously dumb and I just don't I don't get it our people not helping them write the songs at this point or did they just decide to go out on a limb and do it at all and and do all of it themselves and and and now it just kind of ends up sounding like a mess potentially so I guess moving out from there Leon bridges good thing the he's he's got a new record coming out very soon in this track that he's released recently as the song beyond and maybe for some people this this is a one of his better tracks I mean it's certainly a love song that maybe if you throw it on a mixtape or something it you know it might win over your significant other but these are easily some of his most overly sentimental lyrics like ever and not in like a good way to the point where it's like a little tough to listen to but I guess it is a kind of sweet endearing tune to an extent but I could not get into it moving out from their father John misty disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all which I guess it's kind of ironic that this track is long because I do not care for this song at all you know if you didn't know Josh Tillman has a new record coming out very soon it's much more trim and straightforward than a pure comedy from all the songs we've heard so far doesn't seem like anything too weighty or too I guess serious being thrust upon the audience not that Josh isn't a serious songwriter at this point he most definitely is but I guess a lot of people didn't really like the social commentary in the political direction of his last record pure comedy but this new song over here just felt like a total mess to me it's the way that it starts it almost seems like we're starting at the bridge of the song it almost just seems that the whole song seems like an overextended bridge itself and the I guess overly illustrious instrumentation which isn't mixed very well doesn't pair at all with Josh's falsetto vocals that he kind of riffs on throughout the entirety of the track it's uh I don't know just just a little tough to listen to for me total total mess and maybe it might make a little bit more sense within the context the record because maybe it's like more of a transitional track or something like that I can appreciate the sad and broken heart sentiment of the song but beyond that just like the sound of it just was like nails on a chalkboard for me moving on from their couch your chest has a new track out it's titled don't talk to me it features Felicia geisha and it's it's total shit total garbage production sucks lyrics are stupid Cal's flow is dumb and it's not good it's it's not it's it's it's really bad the mixing of the song is trash like the there are these flutes that are too loud the bass is just who the hell makes this thing it's it's trash alright and an ASAP Rocky you just put out a new track titled Hera wanna blunts and it just sounds like a bad demo from 2009 I I just don't get it how has ASAP rocky back slid this much like what how has it come to the point where his music just sounds like nobody on his team is trying anymore I I just I don't get it why is nobody stepping in and just being like hey dude look this is this is not it this is not it Live Love long live we're great great summit someone's I was on the ball and now it just seems like the whatever was there is completely gone and and I don't know where it went but whatever and that's it for the worst tracks let's get into the tracks I was kind of met on not terrible not terrible at all but I just wanted to kind of give him a little bit of a shout out of mention because you know the shout out in the mention because you guys might do them a little bit more than me a new to che amore track Green kind of seems like your standard screamo parsed hor post-hardcore fusion affair for the band but it's it's not a bad track sorry a new track from the voids cool as a ghoul super low five very rough and gritty demo ish cut kind of weird kind of off-the-wall but definitely not one of the better Tunes that they've come out with recently you know I mean it wouldn't really go toe to toe for me with anything off their new album but you know it's uh it's it's a pretty fun cut new janelle monae surprisingly I like that you know I've been super hype on every single single from this album so far and this is the first tractor really underwhelmed me not because I think the tune is all that bad Janelle's emotive vocals are definitely on point with this cut and I think the lyrical sentiment is is pretty sweet as well but the beat is just like the super generic very light diet trap and I don't know it's it's just super run-of-the-mill I just don't get with all the vibrant instrumentation she's hopped on so far with all the promotional tracks why she would even touch an instrumental this plane in this average moving on from there I did kind of dig this other father John misty track just dumb enough to try it's it's a decent it's a decent cut it's a little overly long and and super super dreary nowhere near as catchy as a mr. Tilman which he dropped first to kind of promote this new album excellent song but you know might be a track that grows on me a little bit as I hear the entire record but again not not a terrible track by any means and a new ariana grande over here no tears left to cry sort of a fusion of dance pop and like R&B on on this one it's not bad it's got a good vibe in Ariana's vocals are always on point she's a very good singer but the tune is just kind of lackluster in my opinion like there's not a strong tune to the song and I feel like that's kind of ways preventing it from being as as good as it could potentially be let's move on to the tracks I thought were the best tracks this week ooh ooh and I actually have quite a few tracks in this section a machine drum hype up this is one of the best tracks machine drum has come out within a while it's super I don't know what you would call it jaunty it's very hype it's very upbeat it's very bright and futuristic kind of brings things back to like that somewhat wonky kind of purple sound ish dial that was hot earlier in the decade total banger very fun very glitzy again super futuristic kaleidoscopic in a way to just kind of love the production love the bubbly and and bright and glossy since all over this track next low-tech hunted I I know this artist has a new record coming out via triangle records and beyond that I cannot make heads or tails of this track outside of the fact that I know that I like it and it really kind of stirs a lot of things within me it's kind of like a weird crossroads of industrial and maybe like a little bit of art pop lots of kind of subtly harsh production lots of weird whispery animalistic vocals all over the track it's it's very odd and very primal I'll say that and I wouldn't say it's catchy it's just kind of strange and physical and just like a like a an angry evil sexy tiger growling in your ear like it's gonna kill you in the dark and you're strapped to a chair and you can't do anything you're helpless you're helpless against this track ah like that's that's pretty much what the song is like that's the vibe that's the vibe it's it's pretty fucking crazy moving on from there Ice Age this is probably my favorite track of this new promotional lineup that they have going on so far this song is titled the day the music dies it has some nice horns so nice tambourine and everything it's got a great groove to it it feels like a lowdown and dirty rock-and-roll tune I really don't know what else to say about I mean it's super catchy as well I'm sort of wondering if I'm gonna end up enjoying this Ice Age album because this is this is the this is the best track this is the best track so far and I feel like I don't know I kind of just wish each song was like as hype as this one but hey you know the ice ages is is rarely a band that sort of works in in in single tracks I mean you have isolated moments here and there like God's favorite one where they kind of really nail the whole single thing but either way I'm still pretty excited given that I feel like they've been one of the most consistent rock bands of the decade and you know hopefully this one they kind of knock it out of the park to Fiddler's alcohol one of the band's nastiest and drunkenness singles ever it's wild it's out of control and it's super catchy as well don't they have a song out that's kinda similar to this about cocaine I feel like it almost runs with the same formula but it's just like a little bit more over the top it's just kind of like this really nasty stole faced garage punk tune just about drinking and it's it's totally just fucking out of control and and fun and visceral and a new deafheaven track oh I'm so glad I love this deafheaven honeycomb I feel like the band is reinventing their sound in in ways that are very much necessary at this point I feel like they painted themselves into a little bit of a corner trying to continue to force the black metal black gaze post hardcore post rock thing I feel like they've sucked a bit of the atmosphere a bit of the generic posts rock sounds out of their repertoire and they're focusing more on just muscular fusions of post-hardcore and black metal with just anthemic leads very interesting kind of progressive song structures and it hits a lot harder than a lot of the material on their last record it doesn't seem like too much of a change of pace which isn't necessarily a bad thing because they I think they're going to keep the fans that they nailed with the past couple of records on board with this one but this is sounding a lot more interesting to me than what they were doing on their last record you know not because again because they're reinventing the wheel or anything but they're kind of tweaking their sound a little bit and doing something that is a bit more engaging not so washed out so I'm kind of diggin that and Courtney Barnett digging on this new Courtney Barnett tracks city looks pretty not quite as as lyrically intriguing as the previous couple of tracks that she's dropped from this forthcoming album but honestly every single promotional track so far of this new record has just been fired to me her vocals seem a little bit more animated and engaging the instrumentation is more Drive and propulsion to it I typically do like wordy rock music and to me she's sort of like growing as a narrator as a storyteller and I don't know what else to say I'm just pretty excited for this record and Oh Big Ups has a new record coming out and this new song fear is easily one of the most angular entangled songs that they put out so far fusions of post-hardcore and experimental rock on this one the vocals I think still could be a little bit more distinct which has always been a little bit of a Achilles heel with big ups but they're no longer quite on the Slynt train that they were on their last record at least on this track anyway you know I feel like they're that they're they're toying with the post-hardcore sound and interesting ways and they're dealing more in the underside the under ground version of the genre and I'm kind of liking where they're heading with it and I think that is gonna be it for the weekly track roundup guys that is it the weekly track roundup roundup boo doo doo doo doo remember that's the theme song it's always been the theme song remember all the track's that I talked about in this video are linked down below in the description box and again are Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there and shout outs again to the good people over a seat geek geek geek app all of the information everything you need to see and know down there in the description box once again and I will see you guys in the next video cool cool all right I love you love you love you love you love you forever 
nsO2-Pwoa5s,
cn00K4FqQRE,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new princess nokia mixtape a girl cried red princess nokia is a new york rapper and songwriter who kind of blew me away with the deluxe edition of her 1992 EP last year who if you heard that EP you know stylistically artistically she's really all over the place not just indulging in East Coast kind of boom-bap style hip hop trap rap stuff that I guess is a little bit more on the pop spectrum as well she's not one of the flashy er rappers you're ever gonna hear but one thing that just made her stand out for me was just how eclectic she was and not just in her music but also in the personality that poured through in her lyrics a one song or at least a couple songs that really stood out on that deluxe version of that EP were these tracks where she would make reference to goth culture and not just being interested in it but being a fan of it being a participant and now it seems like that element of her personality is being deeply embraced on this new project over here where she's kind of bringing back this old-school mall emo mall goth fibe but delivering it over this mostly atmospheric kind of dreary trap style production very much in the vein of an artist like little peep in a way and she's pretty much singing all over the entire project I mean it's a huge change of pace it's certainly not something that I would have expected her to do like this is just totally out of left field which in a way is positive and way is exciting that we have newer artists out there who are willing to take huge gigantic risks but when it comes to the execution on this thing I'm not so sure I'm that into what's what's going on with girl cried red for one princess Nokia's voice is kind of odd to say the least it's a little nasally she comes through some weird vocalizations every once in a while but it's not really anything that was too difficult for me to get past however her singing on this record to me just it's very rough and it's very awkward and I'm not really sure what else to say about it not only that but she keeps repeating this line throughout the record this mantra about her heart being broken and Pia and it looks good there on the floor which I mean if this were a hard-hitting line or a bar like I could I could really see it popping up on the record as much as it does as some kind of like theme or mantra or tribute to the sound that she's shooting for but it just kind of feels like a mere one-off lyric in the biggest song on the project it's almost like I'm listening to a glorified single surrounded by a bunch of half-baked tracks that are just all kind of shooting for the same sound because stylistically the EP is really consistent and maybe to a fault because it feels almost like Nokia is trying to write the same song again and again and again and again and while I have no doubt that Nokia is a fan of the cultural movement she's obviously pulling from on this EP it still doesn't change her performance and and the music on this thing from feeling like she's just merely putting it on as window dressing to make some sort of statement or give the audience the impression that she's doing something entirely new or weird when really it just kind of sounds like a bunch of sad trap songs but now it's it's with a slipknot shirt on I mean if this is gonna inspire you go go all the fucking way just like just bring new metal back man just do it I I'm kidding I know that's never gonna happen but still I guess I'm just puzzled us how this EP managed to get out I mean it just seems like there's really nobody saying hey listen you might need to go back and work on this or like maybe this this isn't really done because the whole thing just kind of feels like trap goth pastiche and and really that's it there's there's nothing that much deeper to it the the shows of emotion the depression the sadness it all feels very surface level the production is pretty generic and across the entirety of the project very say me the vocals leave a lot to be desired the lyrics leave a lot to be desired I really wouldn't have even known this was a princess Nokia release had I not been told at its worst moments this thing sort of borders on unintentional parity and it feels like Nokia didn't put nearly as much focus on the sound of this project as opposed to the presentation of it because while that whole new metal an alt metal and like emo scene was definitely my shit in high school this record totally fails to make me nostalgic or even remember that in a positive sense at all yeah unfortunately this tape really fell short of my expectations for this new direction this this new sound for nokia but hey she's so eclectic and so all over the place I'm sure her next project isn't gonna sound anything like this so I guess there's always that to look forward to I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this tape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

BN8x5zo3iNs,hi everyone yo Lolo here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new John Prine album the tree of forgiveness this is the latest full-length album from country and full crock veteran mr. John Prine who has been dropping records pretty consistently since the early 1970s but it wouldn't be until later in his career in late 90s that he would actually pen one of the genres greatest love songs and duets that's the song in spite of ourselves which just one look at the lyrics on this track they're so funny they're so endearing I mean really you put this song on any mixtape for BAE that's that's a win and while this track might be one of prides biggest songs one of his most totally out of nowhere hits it's it's not like this track is all that unique in his discography meaning that Prine has always had a way with words in that he never really minces them from the song illegal smile off of his self-titled debut where he's singing about drugs essentially being an outlet and how him doing drugs to feel better or gain some kind of catharsis isn't hurting anybody or the track don't bury me off of the sweet revenge record a few years later an album where Prine dabbled in just just a touch of outlaw country but prayin is is really no outlaw he's not a gun slinging badass or anything like that he's just a songwriter who does a really great job of balancing balladry with bluntness talking about how he's okay with being fried up in a pan by cannibals as long as he has his one-man on the song ah heck or describing like this wild courtship and in rug burns that he has going on with this iron or Betty woman a few tracks later on the same album when it comes to love and life and social issues that there's nothing really off the table for prime and while he has mellowed out over the years a little bit and his voice has never really quite been the same since his battle with cancer in the late 90s he still has a way of putting things that very few other artists do and now that he's transitioning into his twilight years I would say he's he's putting a heaping helping of charm to kind of sweeten the harsh reality of a lot of these lyrics to I mean I hope I'm half as charismatic as John is on this when I'm his age because his warm personality just pours through on this album it's so goddamn likeable pretty much all the tracks on this record feature very mild rustic instrumentation laid to a somewhat pristine recording the performances on this album feel incredibly organic and intimate many of them riding tried-and-true chord progressions which if you are a full core a country music fan you may have heard them before and topping these songs is of course John Pines warbly slurred and and somewhat gravelly voice which of these three sides you're kind of hearing of his vocal I think depends on the song the emotion of the track the sentiment given prions age his voice is actually still quite dynamic occasionally there's a track in the tracklist that might lack in prions usual wit or grit i think the song ordinary blue is the the biggest offender of that as it just kind of sounds like one of the most ordinary tracks on the entire record and there are moments where this album is so sentimental that it hurts which some listeners might just find to be part of his charm on tracks like boundless love or one of my favorite cuts on the record the quaint and endearing I have met my love today but outside of that there are some real and undeniable highlights throughout much of this LP certainly the case for songs like egg and daughter night Nebraska 1967 where Prine writes lyrics about aging about southern culture about truth against some really sweet saloon piano and organ some clapping some nice background vocals toward the end of the track Brian's lyrics deal more in getting old and deteriorating he's clearly an artist who not only cries in the face of low points in one's life but also laughs the song caravan of fools is easily one of the darkest cuts pryin has ever recorded across his entire career and I feel like one of the things that has allowed him to do that is just the gravelly just tremendous dark depths of his vocal range now the song almost seems to be about the negative side of human nature maybe not stemming necessarily from some sort of inherent evil but ignorant or idiocy driving people to make horrible and stupid decisions this record also kicks off for the hootenanny of an intro the song knockin on your screen which is a track where John kind of closes his eyes and it kind of takes him back home all of this imagery of laundry hanging and it being summer the train tracks what most likely inspired the song is in the process of writing this record from what I understand prions family essentially sent him to a hotel because I guess in his experience he does some of his best writing on the road at hotels so he was totally out of his house out of his element and just had to kind of sit there and write these songs in that hotel in the lyrics of this track I kind of get the hint that he's writing from that standpoint where he is here he has to work on this stuff but he's feeling incredibly homesick there's also the lonesome friends of science a song that kind of hit me as as being almost like Brian's inner Randy Newman coming out a little bit in a way the track is almost a little anti science or anti progress in pryin would rather plead blissful ignorance than understand the truth of life and the world around him but I still thought it was kind of quaint and interesting how it almost seemed like according to him that he doesn't really care what's going on in the world outside of himself because he doesn't feel like he lives in it he feels like instead he lives inside his head and I can kind of understand and sympathize with that mindset when one gets up in age and maybe wants to keep their day-to-day life as stress and drama free as possible so you just kind of give in to the most simplistic approach to day-to-day life in your worldview just to kind of keep things moving smoothly either way the song has a note of serenity to it that I love and again John's blissful ignorance on the track is kind of intoxicating the song when I get to heaven is a closer on the album and maybe one of the funniest and most profound on the entire record the track is part narration and part song and the track is all about everything that he'll want to do once he gets upstairs so to say that he'll have a cocktail he's gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long he's gonna kiss that pretty girl on the tilt awhirl everything that he either shouldn't or can't do on the earth now deeper into the lyrics of the track he's talking about getting back into show business and inviting some choice critics to to his venue forgiving people who have may have wronged him in the past and getting back together with his family talking about how when he was younger his dad said when you're dead you're a dead peckerhead and that's it and he's hoping to uh prove him wrong the record rounds out at 10 tracks 30 minutes or so and it's a sweet little album it's not Brian's greatest artistic feat nor is it I think his most profound set of tracks but for the most part prions age and experience work to his benefit on this record greatly it leads to lots of insight charisma and and very authentic SAP and also to mention once again the simplistic instrumentation prions aged voice are incredible on this record for the most part I'm feeling a decent 2stronk 7 on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like

UAAxRBo4PsQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a quickie review of the new Sabah album care for me Saba is a Chicago rapper who a few years ago caught my attention with his bucket list project which a lot of people were throwing my way like this is a great project this is a great artist you got to hear this you got to be hyped for this he's doing something special he's doing something different he's doing something with depth and while on a level I did acknowledge that I just had a hard time clicking with the album but this wasn't sticking with me sonically aesthetically it didn't really feel special to me or unique in any way whatsoever kind of drowning in his influences in my opinion and with this new record over here it seemed like people were even more excited even more hype the the reviews I've been reading for this album have been even more raves so this time I'm like ok wow he must have really come into his own this time this has got to be it but now I feel like I'm just stuck in a moment of limbo once again with this artist and with a new record I mean certainly it's not awful it's it's not a terrible album I see the appeal behind it but once again I feel like Saba is drowning in his influences almost in a way where who he's pulling from artistically is even clearer being a Chicago boy obviously there is some artistic parallels that can be drawn between him and chance the rapper who was also on this record guy like Nick Jenkins maybe even Isaiah Rashad you know not a Chicago I have still you know he has this kind of a deeper more melodic more expressive rap flow and kind of moody demeanor to his music as well which is similar to what Sabah is doing here and there's definitely like a dab of Earle influence in a lot of his more dark and kind of deadpan rap flows on the record so I mean you're going to hear those influences super strongly on this record to the point where it's almost like distracting to a to a degree at least for me I mean maybe to most fans they don't really care and it just sounds like more stuff that they like however not everything on this LP felt likable to me not only because it sort of lacked kind of distinct flavor but some of the tracks on here I think are easily some of Sabhas weakest the track broken girls features these vocalizations and some lyrics that border on hilariously bad some of the mixing is pretty weak especially on the track grey where some of the auto-tune vocals just don't really sort of I guess meld all that well with the instrumental or their they almost feel drowned in the instrumental while I did like the topical direction of prom king and how sentimental and um I guess autobiographical and nostalgic the story on that track was as soon as we get the beat switch up and we get to the second part of the track King it's like the sound quality of the track drops and it just sounds like a really aggressively performed SoundCloud demo with not one of Saba's better vocal performances he sounds kind of amateurish on the mic very suddenly and that's another thing he's a bit of a vocal chameleon as well and not always to his benefit because I think it makes it even harder to kind of grab on to what exactly this artists sound is or what this album's Direction is really the most cohesive thing about this entire record is just the subtle fusions of track production and jazz rap production which kind of border on being somewhat interesting or unique but it never really reaches a point of excitement or vibrance that keeps me coming back to the album again certainly it's kind of cool that these worlds are coming together and that we have an artist here who is is certainly trying to do something of depth I don't deny that I mean his music is not shallow you know he's not just trying to write shallow Bs music that doesn't mean anything but there's nothing on this record in my opinion that really kind of hits me emotionally or strikes me as being super bleep profound or fantastically written he strikes me as an artist who's trying to do something substantial trying to do something mature but I don't know maybe the experience isn't there yet I'm really not sure it's exciting know and exciting to hear that there are younger artists out there who aren't giving simply into making the dumbest fastest most lowest-common-denominator are possible and if they stay on that path then most likely their music will grow to be more interesting and in the case of sab I hope he finds a point where he can express some sounds that feel a little bit more original or uniquely him so those are my thoughts on it you know I listen to this record I revisited it quite a few times just thinking this is gonna be the time this is gonna be the time where it's just gonna work for me and he's just gonna hit me but in my opinion as hard as he is clearly trying this record is just not it's just not the total package for me over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Saba care for me forever 
x7lQBFEURZY,hi everyone zip the knees OOP tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sons of Kemet album your queen is a reptile this is the third full-length commercial album from the london-based jazz outfit an album that I would love to see go down as one of the more exhilarating jazz records of 2018 it's one of those albums that works in layers and a record that the band clearly tried to conceptualize in multiple ways from the focus on different female figures throughout black history tributed in name and the tracklist each of which seems to be an answer to the title of the album my queen is this person your queen is a reptile witch right from the get-go on this album seems like a kind of aggressive and radical shot at the monarchy and then we have the passion to spoken-word passages that run throughout the intro and outros of this record both of which feature poet Josh a day in the track my queen is a to Eastman in this track he goes into his background as an immigrant he's telling off the Tories he's giving all of these frustrated revolutionary aggressive proclamations his performance on the track my queen is Dorian Lawrence's just as explosive at some points and features a lot of rhetoric about getting the UK back on track and calling out racism going further into the record then there is the band's very interesting instrumental setup which at its core is two drummers tuba and saxophone which on paper might not seem like much you have four players and half of them are percussion but this record is filled with uniquely groovy and deeply rhythmic sounds right down to the horn playing which a lot of the time isn't very smooth for much of this record the sax and tuba kind of lock into these staccato phrasings where they just continually blurt and squawk out these hot blasts of brass occasionally pulling out these really quick speedy hooky melodies and riffs that become more and more hypnotic as the band jams on them there's such a communal momentum and just vibe to the performances on this record and and given just how many Polly rhythms are worked into the instrumentation this could just be my American biases coming in here but there's something about it that feels a lot like an old school old school New Orleans Jazz Band again could be where I'm from kind of pouring through could just be the way that the drums sound against the tuba as many contemporary jazz bands don't even bother to try to coorporate tuba into their sound the Tambor their instrumentation gives sons a feel that comes off just generations old but their compositional their performance style is wild it's crazy it's contemporary of course there are stylistic parallels between this record and African music Caribbean music as well as the track my queen is Phipps Clarke sees the band working through this psychedelic fusion of dancehall and like double reggae with very springy echoes on the vocals which of course are delivered by Congo natty who is one of many collaborators that pop up on this record here and there just to add maybe a little bit of extra horn in the background or something but really the core and the excitement of this album doesn't come necessarily straight from the guests but again just the core of the band and the jams that they embark on on this record every single one of them that is up-tempo is really electrifying and again more dynamic than one might assume given just drums tuba and sax the rhythms are typically what managed to change shape and evolve and grow and shrink in size across a lot of these tracks meanwhile the sax and tuba harmonize they reinforce and they bounce off of each other really well and the chemistry that sons have on this record is so good that it's hard to tell when they're just kind of jamming just kind of riffing just kind of going off or they've transitioned into a spot that is a little bit more composed or just with more preconception like the authoritative and beautiful sax leads that open up the closing track to this thing which were clearly written or the bouncy heavy deep subterranean tuba lines on FIPS Clarke I guess what I'm trying to say is whether it's improvised or whether it's written there's always a strong sense of direction and a lot of muscle to the playing and when the band does manage to go off on a jam it's just so easy to get lost in their doing which is you you know you know it's some good improv when you just kind of get a little overwhelmed by it and it just kind of short your circuits especially when there's just really strong rhythmic backing on these tracks like on the song my queen is harriet tubman i love the drums on this track there's just so much propulsion the horns all over this track are just darting left and right really intensely and this is one of the moments on the album where I feel like the music really has a very clear and direct connection to the person is trying to tribute I mean given Harriet Tubman's story and everything she needed to do to free slaves the fact that there is I guess a kind of speed an urgency to the horns on this track only makes sense the song nanny of the Maroons as well given the time frame of her life as well as her Jamaican heritage the the primordial feel the rhythms on this track just feel centuries-old there's a beautiful old mellow simplicity specifically to this track that just isn't anywhere else and it seems like an effort not only to tribute her historical figure but also maybe to create something that she might have even listened to or had enjoyed right I know I know historically that's a little bit of a stretch but still I don't know that that's just the vibe I got off this track I also love the subtle intro and the progressively blossoming Jam on the track my queen is Julia Cooper it's one of the softest songs on the entire record and yet also one of the grooviest I also love in the second half how the band sort of becomes scattered at one point it's like the instrumentation just isn't matching up but very intentionally and then all of a sudden they just reform and just come back together quickly locking on to the tempo once again there's also really amazing and explosive transition in the second half of the track my queen is Angela Davis where the tempo rhythm really everything picks up and god it's just such a night-and-day difference from this originally very smooth introduction which of course was beautiful gorgeous and then all of a sudden the the tuba starts Bupa doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and just it's just off to the races you know the band doesn't really come at these tracks any one way if I have any nitpick on the record overall the more subtle moments I think could have used a bit more finesse tour could have been a bit more melodic I get some of the more aggressive spots being as rudimentary harmoniously as they are because you know you're kind of you're kind of swapping some of that that melody that harmony out for the rhythm the drive the push the explosivity and while the more mellow moments on this record are nice breathers and for the most part they're not skippable they're not terrible but the structure of these tracks doesn't seem nearly as clear or as well assembled as that of some of the more aggressive cuts that and I found the inclusion of vocals on the record to be a little odd only for several of the cuts on the album to to feature them not that I think it needed to be on the entire album but to have two of those three vocal cuts kick the entire album off it almost sets an expectation for the rest of the LP that just doesn't follow through outside of that though this is a really great LP super enjoyable great recording great performances good writing interesting instrumental combination great chemistry interesting concept and there's certainly something radical and revolutionary and bold about the message of this record as well that I respect I'm feeling a strong a to a late night on this thing transition have you given this record to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

bld_WXq4suI,hi everyone rain the near ain't a no here the Internet's rainiest music nerd and it's time for a y-you know review where I go over gauntlet style a series of records I didn't get a chance to do a full length in-depth review of over the past month or so so I'm here addressing these albums in brief one after the other and yeah that's that's it that's what we do here that's what we do here so without further ado the latest y-you know review on paper I feel like the garden continues to be one of those bands that I should enjoy more than I actually do more now on this latest record that I did on their last one as they've taken a lot of the experimental and weirdo post-punk sounds of that record and fused it with elements of hip-hop and electronic music and more and and now that more elements and influences are in the mix certainly things are as interesting as ever but I don't know I just kind of feel like most of the time the songs are just a little too goofy and disheveled to be all that memorable or be taken that seriously I guess I appreciate them for trying though you know they're certainly trying to do something different the new Black Milk record it's an album that I feel like I should enjoy more than I do but then I keep forgetting that I didn't care for his last record all that much anyway and though this latest record isn't isn't much like that last album I guess it has some of his weirdest most psychedelic production yet that's certainly a change of pace but I feel like these slightly stranger beats don't really add up to all that much and if the production isn't hitting hard and he's not bringing some interesting topics to the table I don't know man I mean black milk's voice his flow his rapping has never been one of his strengths you know he's always been a better producer than he's been a rapper and if the song topics the song ideas and the production is just kind of so-so I mean you're kind of getting to the the strengths what typically should be strengths of a Black Milk record and they end up being either mediocre or just weaknesses so you know there's been a lot of people freaking out about this record and shitting on this record and hating out Snoop Dogg for this record and I'm not gonna say it's great but I can appreciate what he was trying to do with this thing like it's not a Snoop Dogg album it's Snoop Dogg presenting this album it's like he has a passion for Christ and gospel music and he's just sort of curating a series of gospel tracks that he likes and if you actually look into the tracklist here you know some of the features are kind of a who's-who of like people doing well in gospel music that happens to be popular in black churches you know there's even a Mary Mary feature on here and even freaking Patti LaBelle is on a track who sings pretty well you know during her feature during her performance some of the vocals are kind of inspiring then again some of the tracks are kind of awful to which I feel like is it's sort of an inevitability when you're talking about an album of 30 plus tracks two hours of music and if there's anything lackluster about this record it's really just the runtime I feel like if snooper really cared this much about this kind of music maybe he would have cared to break it down into a couple of sister albums spread across maybe a year or so and then really kind of cut it back to the best the best the best most essential tracks if anything that's what kind of makes this album unlistenable it's not even split up into a double album you know it's just kind of like this endless slog of of just contemporary gospel music but it does have highlights so I don't think it's totally terrible you're watching the music news now in the music news metalcore band that has never really been able to come out with a great record in the over twenty years that they've been around still can't come out with a great record more at 11 this super progressive experimental and almost like post rock type band from Canada is back with another album it sounds as epic as ever but I don't know when ever comes to Yaman Takas records I feel like there's a note of grit or melody or just something that's just lacking I don't know what it is like every single project I hear from them sounds gargantuan sounds like it should be exciting and epic but it just kind of fails the connect with me maybe it's just a personal thing at the end of the day but maybe a really what this band needs is for more people to know about what they're doing I mean as much as I feel somewhat underwhelmed by and I can't quite put a finger on why I do feel like they're doing interesting things that are deserving of more attention so you know if you're into experimental rock you're into post rock you're into bands trying to write something epic gargantuan larger-than-life and obviously like there's a bit of a Far East twist to some of the music and some of the themes running through this bands music make sure to give this thing a shot check it out you know for a first outing of sorts this flower truck record is not all that bad if you're into a nice even blend of post-punk and synth pop you're probably gonna like this and I also kind of like the the way that the chunky Australian accent of the lead singer has a lot of character to the record however I feel like some of the songs here a little under written a little so-so and as a whole while I did enjoy a lot of the singles going into this album I feel like there's not quite enough sonic diversity across the runtime of this album to keep it feeling and sounding fresh and exciting throughout the entire thing still though quite a few highlights on this thing and if you're hardcore for that new wave or post-punk sound you're probably gonna want to give this a shot o jangle pop - they definitely appeal to the the jangle poppers this new Diplo EP it's actually not too bad it's sort of I guess unusual for him he's not dabbling in his typical instrumental styles and that's also kind of the case for a lot of the guests he has on this EP it's almost like it was his goal to put a lot of the singers on this record especially DRAM who does pretty well on his cut into musical context that you usually don't catch them in and you know a few of the tracks on here pretty lackluster kind of a mess but you know the the santi gold and yadi track is great the DRAM track is pretty good there are some bangers here not on the traditional sense as not all the production is you know hard-hitting shit like that but there's some good good cuts on here that's alright it's decent you know if you love old-school rock and roll and soul and do up and you like to hear that stuff kind of revitalized with a somewhat tongue-in-cheek indie punk twist and a pretty good sense of humor and irony like you definitely want to check out Shannon the clams they've been added for a long time they've never really quite gotten the shine that I think that they they should have gotten like during the days of Black Lips like being as popular as they were years ago but you know they're still at it they're still doing their thing and there's not a whole lot of artists out there in the indie scene that I could think of that are kind of rocking the sound that Shannon the clams are right now with the devotion that they have for as long as they have so shout out to them I mean it's not the greatest thing I've ever heard but it's a pretty fun sound it's really to the point where all these trap rappers are so cookie cutter that I I could not tell them out of a lineup if you had me listened to many of them in a row it's really records like this that give old heads credibility when they're like all these rappers sell the same all these what was the sound the same it's really to the point where all these trap rappers are so cookie cutter that I I could not tell them out of a lineup if you had me listened to many of them in a row it's really records like this that give old heads credibility when they're like all these rappers so the same all these web was the sound the same [Music] this album sucks my boy Chuck strangers pretty much came through with a decent little album over here Chuck of pro air of Fame he's not just a producer he's a rapper as well you've heard him on those tracks and he pretty much wraps and and produces for the majority of this albums has some decent guests on here as well I mean I wouldn't say chuck is so proficient or vibrant a rapper that he just kind of floors me for the length of an entire project but hey you know he's doing this thing he's showing off his talents and uh I think with more time and more experience under his belt he could kind of get out of the Pro era shadow and get a nice healthy underground rap career going or something you know it's uh it's possibility you know I'm hearing potential here hearing potential some people are asking me the other day Anthony why do you ignore all the bedroom pop where's the love for the bedroom pop and certainly Frankie cosmos is one of the biggest names in that sound in that genre at this very moment and this records not bad but I feel like if this is one of the most significant releases that style of music has to offer at at the moment then I mean it's not in the best place I mean I'm not saying this is terrible but the instrumentation is kind of bland the vocals leave a lot to be desired I mean I know bedroom pop is all about the imperfections but I feel like there's just a real lack of ambition on this record really this album for me is just kind of the soundtrack to underachievement there are some kind of sweet vocal melodies and some cute and introspective or even funny little lyrical quips on this thing and and I I think that they're probably a lot of sad suburbanite indie kids who's feeling like that this album's like their Bible you know and I totally understand I respect that and and I I can appreciate the short song format as well and and I think it's cute and I it's fun but is it like making me want to come back and listen to it like it sure it's certainly Pleasant and nice while it's on but it's certainly not you know creating a niche where I'm like addicted to it or anything you know it's alright for this record and his last one not the collaborative one the solo one Fonte has pretty much kind of cornered the market on these like struggling grown man raps like he's literally writing bars on this thing where he's just talking about stress eating and blood sugar and and certainly there is room for maturity in hip-hop I mean as of late I've heard so many more records and so many more songs that I love I think are great where older rappers are talking about their livelihood their age their family the Kanye comes to mind jay-z comes to mind and there are a lot of other examples too Fontes approach those seems so much less urgent to me and in a way kind of sad but not necessarily in a terrible way it's almost like his his stuff has like a real broad stroke of reality to it because you know not every moment of a person's life especially at this age is glamorous and glorious and and impressive to share I sort of appreciate that about this record that that Fonte is able to go past that TMI barrier and just be like I'm gonna be vulnerable and just really kind of throw it all out there if anything kind of holds me back from loving this LP it's just kind of the bland instrumentation the so-so song structures it's kind of short as well but still I very much appreciate his candor and his frankness I think he's actually being more frank and honest than a lot of rappers around his age range and hey even younger to are willing to be on the microphone so I don't know if you you just want to hear like some fucking real man raps like this is it yeah I could barely make it through five minutes of this record it's so god damn overly dramatic it's so melodramatic it's it's so it's so clogging like Oh goddamn Oh really sentimental I just can't I just can't the the the cringe Lee sad lyrics the the super atmospheric and dainty guitar rock the most of the singing sounds like it's just borderline crying I really can't handle it it's it's just so sickening it makes me want to throw up I'm I I I was this close to just doing it not good on it honestly like I I just can't I can't stand it I can't stand it at all I'm sorry I apologize I apologize to the fans the last record was so much more palatable I didn't love it but I I could at least tolerate it you know this this no I can't deal with this at all I can't I really can't I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm at my wit's end I'm about to have a heart attack I have a condition I can't I can't deal with this I'm sorry new rock marciano album here still got that low-key monotone flow still got that vaguely jazzy soulful very lightly like like ambient East Coast instrumental style that he typically rides a lot of kind of mafioso type verbiage it's kind of really what we expect from at this point not a whole lot to report not a whole lot to report a few dope it's a wordplay there feel some type away you know while you're on the internet type in a way that sort of thing that was pretty dope though smart but outside of that it's it's kind of business as usual it's just alright it's average average Rock project is ition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what

into the first shout out the this whole who run at freestyle thing has been making the rounds in the hip hop community and getting some pretty big names behind the the the freestyle and now the latest is cupcake the rapper cupcake she's done one of the harder free styles in my opinion and it's pretty badass I want to shot that and also the new arca art video at Tisch it's kind of a long music and visual piece involving like stomping on these flowers in these heeled shoes and it's very strange but I think there's something kind of beautiful and compelling and stirring about it as well make sure to give that a shot too let's go into the worst tracks of the week no more beating around the bush what track were the worst so bad that it hurts that's the official worst tracks the week theme song sorry I'm being silly Oh unfortunately I did not care too much about the new twin shadow song when you're wrong I I just couldn't shake the feeling that there was just something really painfully awkward about this track and not in the best way I kind of appreciated the hook a little bit but just the singing the performance and just some of the sounds that went to this this instrumental just super just painfully awkward I really don't know how to describe it Oh diggin on that brand new Taylor Swift Earth Wind & Fire cover that everybody is is up in arms for this week yeah it's it's it's bland pop country trash take on an originally great song so and you know some Taylor fans are like oh my god so it means like this is significant to a relationship like no it's it's still an awful cover I guess it's better than a lot of what's on our new album but yeah it's it's still pop country trash moving on from there the brand new single from Rae sremmurd Guatemala of course it's almost like xxx Tenkasi own opened up the floodgates for these rappers to like make awful terrible Latin pop and not to say the Latin pop in general is bad it's certainly not there's a lot of amazing Latin pop out there my point is is that a lot of these trap rappers are bad at making Latin pop so now Rae sremmurd have taken their hand to that and it's it sounds like garbage next unfortunately yeah you know I'm I consider myself a medium to large princess nokia fan really loved her deluxe project that dropped last year and now she has released kind of this new mixtape which in a word is like her emo mixtape I need to listen to it a little bit more to make a final decision but she has dropped kind of a single in a music video for the track your eyes are bleeding and it just kind of sounds like the generic emote rap-rap that's floating around SoundCloud right now I would have hoped that she would have kind of approached this sound or this idea a little bit differently than a lot of the other artists out there but it just feels blatantly inspired by guys like little peep which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I feel like she doesn't put her own spin on it you know what I mean the lead vocal is kind of annoying the trap instrumental is super flat and generic and run-of-the-mill I guess I just don't see the appeal in this style I guess not unless it were to have some better vocals and some more interesting instrumentation but the approach that a lot of artists are taking to it the approach that Princess Nokia is taking to it here not really digging on it too much do you like her wardrobe though I like that wardrobe I wish I had a Slipknot shirt maybe I'll get one and John Daly actor John Daly comedian John Daly did a funny here and made a like a little zan diss track and it sounds terrible but I guess that's kind of the point because he's trying to make the music sound bad because he's mocking little Zayin so the song is called I'm your tenant and I have no idea what else to say it's it's just a it song it's not even really that funny but I guess I guess a decent parody it sounds like crap just like little zan's music so you know mission accomplished oh and churches God man when did churches start writing just like the worst generic millennial pop ever like complete with the generic whoa-ohh vocals and it has this like super cliched imagine dragons s explosion on the chorus like this is easily one of their worst songs like every single every track leading after this new record has been bad to mediocre I just feel like there's no hope for this album in my opinion all right let's get into the tracks I was met on certainly not terrible but definitely worth shouting out one a brain-dead civilization this is the new track from scar Lord brain-dead if you're into that edgy metal trap rap then you're probably gonna love this doesn't sound too much different than most scar Trax it's okay in general but it's still not a terrible cut definitely worth trying out if you're into that aggressive rap style that's kind of going around in the trap scene right now also knew Kid Cudi song featuring that Smashing Pumpkins sample that everybody is making a big deal out of and it's actually not a bad cut the chord progression that he transforms into these string sections is quite nice the Billy Corgan sample is placed well the instrumentation builds really well and epically Cudi's vocals are some of the best that he's laid out to a track in a while and I don't know maybe the expectations were higher given that this is going to be in the soundtrack to the upcoming rock movie rampage but all in all it was a pretty good track and I thought it was a well assembled well put together production was all-around tasteful and sample included in a very effective and in thoughtful ways so shout out to kid cudi you know didn't blow me away or anything because it's a little over produced a little overly grandiose but it sounded pretty decent it sounded decent next Jenny who vol has a new project coming out very soon on sacred bones records which is kind of her you know musical home away from home this new track is titled spells and it's definitely an interesting change of pace for Jenny whose last couple of records were maybe just a little bit too indulgent and I don't know Avant for me this new track of hers over here is like kind of like smooth sax pop kind of reminds me of a sophistic destroyers caput or something like that are obviously the myriad of influences that go into a record like that many of which come from the 70s and 80s um definitely not a sound or style or a direction that I would have ever anticipated she'd go in but aside from the fact that her multi-layered vocals do get a little grating and the song is a little you know lengthy it's not that bad of a move it's not that bad of a direction I feel like she does this style just as she pulls it off pretty well so I don't know I'm kind of excited to hear her continue to experiment and potentially do something a little bit more accessible you know find a little bit more of a balance between the the weird and the visceral the accessible and the experi mental so on and so forth the new ghost track rats you know I just couldn't shake the feeling that the this track just kind of feels like ghost Road it already you know it wasn't like some of the music from their last record which the first time I heard I was like whoa this sounds like ghost but like elevated like the instrumentation sounds better it's more grandiose this new song rats just kind of sounds like I don't know it could have been like one of the more lackluster caught the cuts off of their last record that and I don't really find the lyrics or the vocal Miller to be that interesting like sure the production is good it's pretty epic sounding for the most part the instrumental performance is pretty quality but I feel like this song was just really lackluster and again vocal melody super annoying super annoying so well it's not one of the worst tracks of the week definitely a disappointment for a lead single for a lead single kind of let down a little bit honestly it's just all right it's just all right and also this new Empress of track trust me baby a nice little kind of low-key bedroom II piece of a bilingual synth pop and I don't know hooks pretty catchy it's a pretty nice tune digging on it all right let's move on to the tracks I thought were the best the songs that really knocked my socks off this week really grabbed my attention one oh this song is titled abyss walker' and it comes from a band by the name of tomb mold now they have a record coming out on 20-buck spin and this is some of the most riffey and intricate and disgusting death metal that i've heard in a while there's a nice guitar work in this thing a lot of interesting flavor it's not constantly ugly all the time though there are certainly some very gross moments and it's super heavy it's super gruesome but I feel like there are some interesting guitar embellishments and flashes throughout the track that give it I don't a little sonic and compositional quirk that just made it stick out a little bit digging on the new Nicki Minaj tracks honestly Barbie Tings and Chumlee I really don't know what else to say I feel like they're just too straightforward super bangers with a lot of hot bars and just really straightforward catchy flow from Nicki you know nothing too poppy or anything that's gonna go viral like anaconda but again I feel like the the rapping is there the delivery is there it's pretty aggressive certainly more badass than like the tracks that she released shortly after the whole Remy Ma thing and certainly more badass than the track she then at least some of the tracks she released up to the the release of pinkprint you know like this is a more aggressive and lyrical Nicki again on both tracks so it's kind of she's hitting you with that with that sort of angle from both directions I have no assumptions that she's gonna continue to move in this direction or something or that I don't know her next record who's gonna be all like this but I can at least say like these two singles were some of the most entertaining tracks I think she's put out in a while so gently gently and again Barbie Tings and again you know kind of a lot of I guess no named shots across these tracks which a lot of people are talked about qotb oh she talked about ready ba oh who's she talking about you know there's a lot of aggression there's a lot of you know posturing throughout the tracks and uh you know it's just kind of a bunch of good old catchy memorable shit talking over some banger beats and again the bar beatings dug on that - next Nikko case echo case new record hell on coming out very soon and this track bad luck is one of the funnier and quirkier songs that i've heard from her in a while kind of has this old-school vocal pop thing going on it's it's got a lot of charm it's got a lot of kitsch and it matches really well with kind of the dark imagery going on in the lyrics so and you know I guess it's kind of fitting for this really odd cover I truly have no idea how she came to the concept of this cover but every time I look at it I'm just disturbed and perplexed like it just seems so surreal it seems so unreal and just the way she looks so raw and meanwhile like the flames next to her looks so kind of cartoony and Illustrated as again just kind of strange and just the hair thing and the friggin cigarettes it's it's odd it's odd but hey I'm liking all the tracks so far I'm liking all the tracks so far next my boy Komachi Washington came out with two brand-new tracks that together are like 20 minutes in total new album on the way it's not three hours like the last one it's two and a half hours and these tracks are titled fists of fury am the space travelers lullaby the former is a vocal led track that is pretty epic pretty grandiose some good instrumental performances throughout the cut and the space travelers lullaby is like this gargantuan Sunhwa piece of son raw worship with like thick dense strings an instrumentation moving harmonically across all these chord progressions like a fleet of spaceships through the galaxy of jazz that that's basically how I can describe that track it's pretty immense and again both these tracks are super long and again he just kind of is is delivering jazz on an incredibly epic level right now and I just I just love that I'm so excited about that sorry I'm making noise I'm just excited I'm just excited digging on that digging on the new Janelle Monae single pink featuring featuring quote-unquote grimes I mean I didn't hear any spot on the track that sounded exactly like Grimes however the instrumental and the song itself sounds like something Grimes would do so I have to imagine that like she had something to do with like the the creation maybe the writing of the song or maybe influenced the track in some kind of way but all in all I feel like it's a fun summery poppy new kind of electro and dance pop with sort of a quirky indie edge single from Janelle it totally unlike the two previous tracks released one of which was like this really I don't know kind of like a epic very ambitious and an inward II rap track with a lot of kind of themes of a female empowerment in lyrics then we had one track that was just like pure prince worship like kiss me rien verted reinvented and then this new track over here again a totally new shade a totally new sound but I'm enjoying pretty much each track equally so I don't know this new record I'm wondering how it's all gonna come together especially since from what I understand the tracks here are kind of close to each other so the tracks have been released so far so how all these songs are kind of meld and reinforce one another I really don't know you know but the three tracks that I've heard so far sound like you know almost like like they could have come for three different artists in a way but just enjoying the quality enjoying the versatility enjoying the production enjoying the visuals - and yeah I have to say as of right now this record is pretty much the record I'm most excited to hear most excited to hear this janelle monae album more than any other record coming out very soon so pretty high and got to give a shout out to Florence in the Machine this new track over here sky full of song one of the better tracks have heard from them in a while and one of the more I guess somber and low-key cuts it's it's rare that we hear Florence singing in in such a sad and subtle demeanor which is kind of an issue that I had with their last full-length album that felt a little one-dimensional across the duration of the tracklist this track over here is is one of the most low-key songs ever and there's just a lot of emotional power in in that reservation in that restraint that is laid into this track because even on a quieter level of Florence's voice still has a lot of conviction still has a lot of emotional potency and I don't I'm just kind of like in the more subtle direction obviously you know I love moments when the band can really kind of pick up the pace and and deliver those epic kind of artsy Rocky papí indie jams but uh this is a nice this is a nice a nice new direction nice nice change of pace and a oles a ILS this is a new metal record coming out via the flen sir and this new song over here is titled dead metaphors and this band effectively brings together elements of progressive metal black metal death metal and who knows what the hell else on this new record and it all comes together pretty well it all comes together pretty well and the song is kind of lengthy but the composition is very fluid very epic I love a metal band that can bring together a lot of sounds but it sounds cohesive and and and can pen a powerful composition so you prog metal guys out there who do like your prog now a little bit more abrasive give us a shot make sure you give this a shot don't miss out on it and that is the weekly track round up everybody that is the weekly track roundup again remember all those songs that I talked about are linked down there in the description as is the shirt that I mentioned early on support the needle drop pick up that shirt if it's still available when you watch this video which it's gonna be around for more than a month for sure and again our Amazon and turntable lab associate links are down there in the description as well alright thank you for watching I will catch you guys in the next video love you love you love you forever

x9e_8zRuuO8,"Hi everyone, Got-thony You-tano here,   the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review over here of the new Kali Uchis album, Isolation. Kali Uchis is a Colombian singer whose hard work payed off after traveling to the U.S., focusing on her music career, dropping a mixtape about six years ago, and then taking advantage of every single collaborative opportunity that came her way afterwards. Quickly landing feature spots with the likes of Snoop Dogg, and GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, Daniel Caesar, Bootsy Collins, and even Gorillaz on their latest record, Humanz. Furthermore, some of these artists and more were kind of stumbling over themselves to get a piece of her debut EP, Por Vida, which was a pretty big breakout for her and features production from the likes of Tyler and BADBADNOTGOOD, Kaytranada, and even Diplo. Now admittedly, nothing on this EP really stopped me in my tracks. I failed to see what the hubbub was about. Kali's vocals for me just kinda came off a little too pillowy, a little too flat emotionally. A lot of her appeal seemed to come down to aesthetic and nostalgia. Her singing to me came off like a less expressive Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon. And then she had this  kind of nostal-chic look to her, like a fusion of Lana del Rey and Amy Winehouse but with kind of a Colombian twist. And a lot of this stuff also holds true for this new album over here, but there's an even larger influx of co-songwriters and producers and features on this record. Just to name a few: DJ Dahi, David Sitek, Romil from Brockhampton, Soundwave, Damon Albarn, BBNG, Tyler, Bootsy Collins again, Steve Lacy, Greg Kurstin, Thundercat, and even Tame Impala's Kevin Parker. Shit, with- [chuckles] with a roster like that this album has to be some kind of grand artistic feat, right? I mean, for certain the production on this thing is super impressive and versatile, too. It allows Kali to explore a myriad of different musical influences, transcending boundaries that are not just based on culture but also genre and even language. But considering that, I still can't shake this feeling that Kali's vocals, even after years of singing and recording and performing are still a little stiff, occasionally awkward, and consistently faint. Most of the time when her voice does manage to pop in the mix on this album, it's typically when it's overdubbed just to add another voice back there to bring it a little bit more presence and volume. Even a bed of lavish, elegant strings served with a lethal dose of nostalgia on the classic pop-soul sound on the song Flight 22 can't really mask the fact that there isn't a whole of power to Kali's lower register. Nor are some of the little embellished background vocals she throws into the track all that either. But you can't, like, really put a bunch of background singers onto the track kinda just throwin' out vocal lines and riffing because it's gonna sound better, it's gonna pop more, and the jig's gonna be up. I mean, for example, just take the song Tyrant featuring Jorja Smith. The instrumental has this kinda slow, old-school, sensual, dreamy dancehall vibe to it and the second Smith shows up in the second half of the song, it's like a night and day difference. It feels likes we've transitioned from a singer who is used to just singing quietly along to her favorite songs in the car and then we have a singer who is so much more expressive, animated, one that conveys emotion and kind of brings life to a track. The song sounds pleasant and it's not like Kali's vocals bring a bad vibe but her redundant rhyme scheme on this track forces her into a lot of really silly and basic phrasing and references, one of several points on the album where the lyricism is kind of an Achilles' heel. Which is also the case in the second leg of the Coming Home interlude, where you can catch Kali singing about uh, she's too skinny or she's too fat, she's too tall or she's too short, she's a peach...some people don't like peaches at all. I like the sentiment of the track pushing forward despite the nitpicky criticisms other people might have of you or you might have of yourself, second guessing yourself. But, Kali's word choice sometimes can be painfully simple and there are at least a few moments on here, most notably the intro and the outro tracks where I think her performance leaves a little bit to be desired. It's a little stiff, it's a little lifeless. And there are at least a few moments on this album, mostly the intro and outro tracks where her voice is really spotlit and you would think in this context, she would give the most electrifying or emotional or exciting performance possible but I'm just left wanting more. All that being said though, I do feel like this album has more strengths than it does weaknesses and the appeal of Kali is kind of far beyond her vocal chops or her lyrical abilities. Because while she might not have the most presence on the microphone, she has enough heart to go into a song with an idea or a topic and follow through conceptually. There's also a lot of pretty compelling and personal stoytelling on this album, too. And there's definitely an amateurish charm to what Kali is doing on this record. Something that wasn't super apparent to me at first, but when I heard deeper cuts on the album, it's clear she's embracing it. Tracks like Dead To Me and In My Dreams are certainly moments on the album where it feels like she's taking her weaknesses and turning them into strengths. Both of which sound like long lost electronic dance pop gems from decades ago by an artist who time has forgotten because her sound just wasn't commercial enough to top the charts in the 70s and 80s. At this point in the material on this album, is kinda reminding me of that Quincy Jones quote from a recent interview where he was saying if you put a great singer on a bad song,  you can't save it. It's pointless. It's useless. But the flip of that is you could put a myriad of different singers or singing styles onto a great song, onto a great track and it's gonna work because the appeal of the best tracks on Isolation for me really kinda comes down to songwrtiting. The song Miami is this dramatic, slo-mo piece of Latin rock. The vocal melodies are simple but super sticky, and the track is essentially about Kali's transition from being a young Colombian girl to somebody who's traveling to America, the ""land of opportunity"" to sort of make it creating music. The vibe of this track for me was pretty powerful some of her lyricism kind of simple but slick and I thought that there was a nice element of escapism to this track, too. Also, the verse that guest rapper BIA brings to the track gives the song quite a bit of grit. A lot of the same autobiographical and aspirational themes pour through on the nocturnal disco of the track Tomorrow as well. There's a real sense of longing and restlessness and ambition on this song, too. It's a song about needing a change. It's a pretty catchy tune, has a sweet easygoing vibe to it and the smart thing about this track is that it plays thematically with the interlude cuts that proceed it and follow it. Now these tracks don't feature any smooth musical transitions or anything, it would be nice if they segued to sort of bring it all together a bit more effectively. But it's still interesting to hear these feelings of needing to get up and go out there and change things juxtaposed against these feelings of second-guessing yourself and being nervous and being unsure, being homesick. There's also the undeniably groovy Just A Stranger featuring Steve Lacy with one of the most earworm refrains on the entire record, 'she wants my hundred dollar bills', definitely something I'm catching a little bit of Rick James vibes off of. But there's something dreamy and surreal about the track, too, despite how hard-hitting and tangible the instrumentation feels. I love the drum groove on here, the woozy synthesizers, the bass line, and the themes of money and desire and survival going on in the lyrics. The song Flight 22, as much as I am apprehensive about some of the vocal shortcomings on this track I like the idea of like, and obsessive crush song about a guy you just saw on a plane. Your Teeth In My Neck feels like an old-school piece of dance pop sounds like it's placed in the 90s and while the instrumental goes over without a hitch and this is easily one of Kali's better vocal performances on this record, what makes the song interesting for me are these themes of greed and materialism,  status and inequality, unlikely topics for a piece of music in this genre but they actually go over really well and say to me that Kali is an artist who has more to say than your average pop singer. The dreamy Latin pop sounds of Nuestra Planeta is not only just another great track on the record, incredibly catchy, the only track sung entirely in Spanish but it's just another notch in this album's versatility belt. I went into this album feeling love already for tracks like After The Storm and Feel Like A Fool as they were super good teaser tracks, had incredibly vibrant, fun instrumentation and that's pretty much still the case in the context of the entire album. The former is a sensual and strange piece of funk with dreamy production, strong grooves, and a decent feature from Tyler, the Creator, and the latter is a bright piece of pop soul with dusty pianos and bright horn sections, very warm chorus vocals and actually one of the animated vocal performances on the entire LP from Kali. The lyrics of the track are pretty bittersweet, just pretty much about being played by this guy who had a lot secrets and baby mamas but you can't yet seem to shake him. He's gotten so into you that he's like integrated into your life, into your feelings, you're wearing his sweater, so on and so forth. Overall, I thought this album was very good and dare I say I loved it despite some of the obvious shortcomings when it comes to the performances. I think this record is mostly on point I think what makes a lot of these tracks great again are just the melodies, the songs, the lyrical themes, the vibe and aesthetic of this album. It's really all over the place instrumentally but feels kind of cohesive well, cohesive enough and there's something vaguely hypnagogic, hypnaGoGic, [chuckles] you know, as much as I like this record, as great as I think it is I walk away from this album feeling like it's just soaked in potential like this is very great, it's very enjoyable but I would hate to see Kali just kind of stop here, you know, drop a second and third record that pretty much sounds just like this. Not only would I like to hear a bit more personality and maybe something a bit weirder in the future but also the possibilities for Kali's musical career in the future I think could be endless if her vocals were just a bit more interesting. I'm feeling a strong 7 to light 8 on this thing, tran-sition have you given this album a listen? Did you love it, did you hate it? What would you rate it?

PZFH6X2ht00,ah hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you're doing well and it's time for a vinyl update where I tell you guys the the records that have recently made it into my collection over here and yeah just just my recent vinyl pickups that I've gotten a chance to listen to and peruse a little bit and and gain a bit of familiarity with so I can actually come on camera here and talk about those records now now in in this vinyl update what what record to start with what record to start with what record should oh oh hey maybe I could start with one of these four sealed copies of Frank ocean's endless you know just just pick one of them you know just not open all four you know just just open one just open one of them one for me I have plans for the other three but you know what one one is for me personally oh it's what's I mean each one is as good as the next so eeny meeny miny moe catch a tiger by the toe if he hollers let him go eeny meeny miny moe my mother told me to pick this one and you are right over here Wow this one this one oh okay all right okay you know yeah yeah we'll go with this one we'll go with this one this one yeah looks gets we'll go with this one all right okay Frank Ocean endless this is the new vinyl record of this album I love the shiny sort of cover of this thing also it says on the front new improved full dimension stereo it makes me kind of wonder if I should do a redo review of it because um I didn't really give the record that much critical overview in my blonde review because I just kind of saw it as like a promotional thing but now that we're talking about improved sound quality over here it'll have an opportunity to just take the record in on its own merits not within the context of blonde necessarily not direct it'll probably easier to give it a listen and give a review of it you know as opposed to having just two projects like dropped on your lap at once you know what I mean I obviously I have not put this on the table yet which is I put everything else here that I'm going to be talking about on the table but I wanted to open this with you guys because it's exciting waiting months for this thing okay Wow there we go it's it's even shinier with the plastic off how is it so shiny it's like it's like it's from the future or something wow it's a nice like rainbow holographic that's beautiful that's wonderful we got a gatefold here no we don't we don't have a gatefold I thought it was a gatefold it's not a gatefold nothing I'm disappointed but I thought I actually thought it was a capable because it feels like a double LP so it is actually a double LP all right let's see it let's see if there's anything in here besides food no nothing nothing in there okay yeah it's empty this is empty not entirely empty there were records in there okay let's let's see um alright slide on me Florida Russia's Russia's - Higgs sideways Mitsubishi Sony don't fucking touch we have the sound equipment over here various pictures of the area in which it was recorded Frank Ocean t-shirt sound vision 46 minutes of 124 hours in the life of Frank Ocean okay then alright is is this like a 46 minutes in his life okay well oh wow wow okay I was just like well why is it like a double LP if this is 46 minutes but unity at your best you are love Alabama honey baby wither huh blots they have a few moody pictures of Frank but it looks like we have three sides here the fourth side is an etching that's interesting yet they're there you guys can see it's sort of Wow yeah yeah we have a cool little itching here of like an image made and made of letters like Oh like almost like computer code it's it's I think it says end well that's interesting it's always cool to have an etching on a record records with edgings are always pretty freakin sweet this is this is very glossy it's very clean it's very pristine it's very smooth looking present there's an etching on both sides while there's an etching on both records okay so each record has a side each record has an etching 120 hours in the life of Frank Ocean 46 minutes of one increment so is this like and less or is that yeah less okay so it says the track titles on the other side to let you know what it's going to be going to that's interesting and I thought there was a DVD with this or something or maybe I didn't order that package it might have been a separate package and I didn't order that and I just I just wanted the vinyl but to all of you who picked this up I mean it looks nice it looks great it's probably gonna sound great the vinyl is pretty heavy - it's a heavy pressing so it's probably gonna sound quite nice and I don't think they would have you know thrown this whole no improve dimensional stereo sound thing in your face if they didn't you know improve the sound noticeably so pretty psyched listen to that again I have not heard it so I have no comments on on the sound of this new pressing of this new record yet but once I listen to it you will know however I have listened to the rest of what I'm gonna be talking about here I have a good selection a fun selection of things starting off with some of the most fun this Deerhoof la Isla Bonita this is an album of dear Huff's experimental rock band indie rock band that I have reviewed numerous times although I did not review the new record because I suck and I'm a terrible person and I apologize okay if the band is watching I apologize I'm sorry I'm a dick okay and and I was I was lacking okay I was lacking last year I wasn't at my best I'm trying to do better in 2018 but this is a one of their cooler one of their more lo-fi records and I had to pick this up because this is a unique pressing of this album no this album is not like some little 7-inch album or something like that this is a book and what it is a book of is flexi discs what the hell is a flexi disc you may ask it's like a little record on a sheet of plastic or like on a cart or a postcard or something a lot of punk bands used to drop these back in the day a lot of record labels used to drop them to is like promotional items that would go with magazines or just kind of release a song to get people hype on an artist you know it would be an efficient way of putting a song onto a physical medium and mass producing it and then being able to distribute it very cheaply you know without having to put it on like a physical larger piece of vinyl that they would probably have to sell so this is a whole book of flexi discs it's the entire album in flexi discs and each each two tracks of the album are a page with lyrics and different pieces of imagery and you know I've owned and have listened to flexi discs before and I didn't think the the ones on this record would sound as good as they do they sound pretty good they sound quite good they they have a nice kind of bass e depth to them that I typically don't hear in a lot of flexi discs but given again that they are flexi is that there is a lot of skipping or there can be skipping they're not perfect you know you do have to kind of expect some imperfections out of the box as it's just literally grooves for a record printed on a thin sheet of plastic that you can just bend so I guess if you ever run across any Flex ease or anything like that keep that in mind so yeah it didn't sound too bad and and you know it reminded me having listened to this this is this is easily one of dear hosts groovier little ow and it was it was a cool little pickup you know it sounded good it's pretty fun to be able to whip that out and it's interesting to uh to see an album you know an artist and a label sort of approach distributing printing an album creatively like that it's a nice little package moving out from there I have a 7-inch record it's a hallmark record this this is a this is a record from hallmark my wife got me this for Valentine's Day and it's it's a it's a 45 and it's like they had this in the greeting card aisle and she says oh I love you so much love of my life and I love you too honey you're you're the light of my life as well and you know xoxo and this is a 7-inch single of in excesses never tear us apart and also on the other side I need you tonight I need you tonight with the trying to take it out over here where's it which way is it coming out between us a come out I've listened to it it oh it comes out this way I'm done sorry sorry guys I'm stupid there you go it's it's it's a greeting-card record i don't know if any of you guys got these for valentine's day but it was quite nice of my significant other to think of me in that way giving me the gift of music exactly what I want for every fucking holiday for the rest of my life good music that's what I want for every day ever you know sometimes it's a little hard because I get spoiled because I'm listening to some you know some good shit all the time but still amazing thank you shout it shout out to Bay next my friend Greg hooked me up with this shit shout out to Greg you know another shout out to the blessings of of having friends with impeccable taste Greg hooked me up with this record out of the blue a bhoot de souffle jean-luc godard 'he's it's a film it's a New Wave French film which I'm unfamiliar with I have not watched the film and I'm unfamiliar with the soundtrack and I'm not much of a film buff but this is like a really good jazz record I mean it doesn't sound too much conceptually unlike a lot of other Hollywood or sort of film jazz soundtracks that you might have heard in the past but some of the baselines some of the rhythm sections are kind of like they have like this drunken lumber to them and some of the horn parts are really are animated and evocative and very expressive there's just like a lot of color and so you know some of the solos or some of the embellishments are kind of weird again to sort of enhance the dramatic effect of the film you know not so much for like hey this is all about our technical chops and you know we're just like having a really hot jam session here but still it's like a really fun colorful jazz record when I first opened up to this thing I was like what the hell is this I have no idea what you're getting me into but when your friends have good taste it's a it's a blessing so next shout out to Third Man Records this is a promo that they sent me for their parquet courts live a third man records a little LP they have here on this thing if you guys are parquet courts records fans I mean parquet courts fans ducking and dodging bodies black and white Vienna to always back in town dear Ramona to send instant disassembly raw milk into the garden sunbathing animals some of this material I wasn't really that crazy about on record found it kind of tedious and and compositionally maybe it still is that to an extent in the live setting but hearing them pull it off live does have like a stronger sense of groove to it a little bit more excitement a little bit more guts to it it's not the cleanest live recording you hear a lot of room ambience on it you hear a lot of crowd on it as well in between tracks you know but I guess if you like the the sense of a of a live show you know if for you those are kind of the the cherries on top of the live experience or even a live record then certainly try this out I mean the performances were decent so if you're your big carpark a course record got fuck why do I keep saying that if you're if you're a big park a quartz guy it's because I'm looking at the labeling up here you should definitely should give this a shot and I'm really looking forward to their new album because everything I've heard from it so far is is pretty hot and while we're on the topic of Third Man Records I will also shut up mr. Jack White picked up a vinyl copy right away of boardinghouse reach oh I'm loving this record mr. white uh I really don't know what to say I mean it's it's a pretty straightforward pressing just black record extra thick though extra thick and a very strange sort of geometric almost portrayal of I guess Jack White or some a bust of someone over here on the back more lyrics and everything more credits it is a little difficult to read some of the lettering but you know not too bad you know I love this record quite a bit corporation such a great song station blue labeling with the white lettering they're very stylish a third man records you they used to be all about the black and yellow but now they're I mean now that neither about the black and blue you know I don't I don't know exactly when they made that aesthetic connection and I still do catch a lot of yellow in their stuff but they're very much about the black and blue these days so shit shout out to black and blue good color combo another dark album cover huh swans the seer I finally got it on vinyl or a rather I got this on vinyl at my Amoeba Records thing you know you guys probably saw me do what's in my bag if you didn't why the hell haven't you watched that segment go and subscribe to Amoeba Records on youtube and go watch my what's in my bag if you haven't watched it because I pick up a lot of good records in that episode and I picked this up I already had it on CD but it sounds better on record that's not always the case with every album with every artist but in the case of swans it's definitely the case especially when you are definitely the case said twice especially when you have as grand and instrumental presentation as this record does has to be kind does as the glowing man does this record is easily maybe like the most loaf is of the three there are some points where it feels like they they reach almost a peak of volume that they can get to but still the the resonance of this album is certainly better on vinyl than it is on CD now given that it is swans and it's you know one of the three albums in their recent trilogy it's a triple gate fold it's a triple record it's big it's huge it's gigantic whoa and and this pressing is most certainly worth it if not just to see this thing's butthole on the back and it just sounds great very long-winded very intense very heady and cerebral but also visceral to experimental rock some of the best material swans has ever done and you know since I originally reviewed this and listening to one on vinyl as well it's it's certainly grown on me since since I originally covered it not that I didn't like it when I did originally covered it I certainly did all right next shut up to the good people over at DFA records not that they sent me this for free I mean I bought it but you know shoutouts to them for coming out with this great album from gorilla toss GT ultra this very strange LSD blotter page over here is basically the cover art I kind of loved the visuals of this pretty straightforward pressing over here not too much to speak of other than just black record lyrics GT ultra and very psychedelic lettering and you also have like these little chemical figures depicted on the labeling of the album - which is pretty fun if you haven't heard this album or seen my review of this please do check it out it's a little kind of art punk cent Punk post-punk record with a lot of influence coming from bands like XTC and Devo you know sort of the freakier side of the post-punk genre in the eighties and the freaky or dancey er side and something when I was listening to the record that kind of hit me which obviously ties in with the you know LSD cover over here is and and maybe this is something that subconsciously appealed to me about the album and made it stand out to me even though maybe on paper the influences that go into this record are pretty obvious but it's rare that I hear this kind of music portrayed in like a psychedelic context and this this record is certainly that like the music is so funky it's punky it's groovy it's very sound rich but it's very trippy it's very trippy as well and very surreal especially when you're reading into the lyrics so give this thing a shot if you have it it's a short record not a whole lot to it a lot of bangers a lot of color a lot of personality here is another one from my significant other I think she got me this for Christmas she got me a few records for Christmas which is always great again when people around you have great taste give you interesting stuff I don't want to put these over here and have them fall off the stand when people have good taste give you interesting stuff because I do know people and have met people who are like I'm intimidated to get you anything you might hate it you know if I haven't heard of it before just like blow my mind just like totally turned me on to something now Bridget Fontaine is a French musician and this record over here listen some of you guys asked me like does your wife like the same music as you and and for the most part yes but she's into a lot of stuff that I'm not even into she's you know on to stuff occasionally that I'm not even into and and I have such a blind spot when it comes to a lot of French music and given the cover given kind of the the computer like letter e and kind of the fuzzed out like old-school digital photos over here I thought I was going to hear like some crazy like experimental synth music or something but believe it or not this is like an avant fulk record an experimental chance fun song record an Avant jazz record there's a lot of spoken word on this thing too a lot of strange acapella pieces with very freaky vocal harmonies it's a very odd record like it's it's not catchy in the least but not in a bad way it's very strange it's very stimulating it's very left-field it kind of makes you want to sample it honestly and sort of brown and white lettering over here not too much to say outside of the the or rather the record itself is in really good shape you know it's a really good shape whoever had it before outside of just like a tiny hairline scratch that didn't really make much of a difference outside of that there's not really much wrong with this pressing sleeves a little torn up but I have some spares over there I'm going to switch it out for another one so there we go easy as pie easy as pie if you're a record collector one of the best investments you can make is just go on the internet and bulk buy just like a hundred paper sleeves that just sit there in a bag and whenever you go buy an older record Hey the sleeves fucked up because the record is older than me just pop it in a new sleeve it's all good alright moving on from there moving on from there now that would now that were passed a Brigitte la Fontaine and not a la Fontaine just Fontaine she actually bought me two records from this artist and another one as well which when I give those a listen you'll you'll see them in a future vinyl update next next is ax to fall from converge ooh double uh double will not double just a gatefold over here I love the art that they attached their stuff typically it's just very dark and morbid and beautiful love the cover love the visuals got like a nice kind of cardboard finish on there nice little insert over here with all the lyrics it seems and this is a very recent pressing that they did if not just this album but a series of other records in their discography that were like limited edition colored copies of these records so I had to pick those up I'm doing giveaways with Elise a few of them not right now in this video though this is freaking cool is that like a that's like a golden blue yeah I mean it's just pretty much the colors of the album cover and it's funny because like the the splatter I don't I don't know if you call it a spider it's more like a blob I guess the blob doesn't necessarily pour all the way through on the other side so it's like it's another it's like a totally different kind of gold and blue mix on the other side very nice very nice definitely one of the best metalcore records you could put your ears on definitely one of the better uh converge records easily in their top five if not their top three probably more of a top three converged record honestly guitar work on this thing is some of Jacob bannon's best the production on this thing is what there's some of their best as well definitely one of their most consistent and solid albums today so make sure to uh that what the heck is going on there what is going on here what is going on here what's going on is it yeah it's it's the the download card it's a download card getting all stuck in there I already have it on CD so stop stop I'm just I'm not I'm just I'm just throwing words out there into the into the ether I like download cards they're nice alright axe to fall great record great record great pressing fun blue colors shout out to Prince dirty mind very nice album not quite as lush or as I guess as I I guess as iconic as 1999 or a Purple Rain but still a pretty great record very fun and sexy photo of the band right there pants unzipped one of them's a doctor checkered pants they're a fun group I've never seen the cover this big before because I've always just owned this digitally you know there's something about this album cover that's always kind of struck me as like a little eerie I don't know exactly the the circumstances under which this was shot or even how this background was achieved it looks like it's it's like Springs from like a bed like mattress or like a box spring or something there's something about princes look on this cover that is so strange to me the handkerchief to me almost doesn't go with like a lot of what he's wearing but still it's it's i grabbing in that it it seems like almost like the most crisp thing in this image everything else has like an oddly soft glow on it he looks like a ghost discover he doesn't even look really looks like an apparition just like everything just has like such a soft look to it I feel like the longer I look at this photo the the more like Prince is just sucking the lifeblood out of me like a Dorian Gray kind of thing it's just a very eerie image but also there's a pin on his jacket over here this is rude boy never took princesses like a big sky fan but apparently he was so there you go and a lot of good songs on this thing I mean dirty mind is great head is great love the song head which is obviously about what you can gather from the song title but still incredibly fun and sexy song a lot of good synth licks and this thing a lot of good bass lines vocally I think Prince is still trying to find himself a little bit you know you can tell he's like going really over the top with some of his like you know squeaky falsetto very expressive you know almost like a cat screaming sort of vocalizations but still it makes the record really entertaining and just unique you know just which made him unique so uh again while it's not his most polished record it's still very fun and entertaining album next shout out to my dude Olaf who I met when I was in New York City doing a shoot talking about kpop music and a lot more with the 88 rising label you'll see some of that video content coming out very soon he had basically a little set back there that they had set up that we were sort of you know interacting in and everything and this dude had brought his record collection down to the place as like a prop so we could kind of sit there in the background and I was looking through it and you know he was telling me how long he's been watching me and everything and he was a big fan and I could certainly tell because a lot of a lot of my recommendations were in the frickin record collection but then he had a copy of this and I was like oh man you know that's a pretty fun album you know it's a record that I know it's not perfect from front to back but it's an album that it has some great synth production it has some funky beats it has some good tunes on it I love the aesthetic of it and you know there's a lot of great things about this Indian Indian album if you didn't know it's it's titled Vega International Knight school so I mean I don't know this is a really good good record from Alan I was like yeah man that records really fun I just love the vibe in the aesthetic of that record there's not a whole lot of albums that to me feel like this album and he says well you know I don't play it that often and the album kind of reminds me of an ex so do you know do you want it and I was like what album reminds you of an ex like what's that that's a reason you give an ad like I have so many albums that remind me of people who who I used to date or something okay what I'm fine fine whatever let's do it let's go um and he just gave it to me it like it's like a nice guy like a nice guy lyric sheet over here credit sheet pretty straightforward double LP gatefold nice like internal art right there like so definitely like some 80s kind of retro futuristic the smut tape the saxophone the guitar looking thing that's a fun little design on the inside and the record itself is uh like a very strange clear ish yellow like a smoky yellow so very fun pressing and again shout out to him just so so happy so pleased so blessed to know people personally who are so generous with the nice music that they have because it adds to my collection it adds to the musical experience again another instance of that shout out to my dude Ben who runs things over at the drunken peasants podcast he sent me some records this past Christmas I sent him some records we had a bit of a record exchange going on the dude is a big pop punk fan a big skate punk fan big nofx fan I've never been a big no FX guy but slowly over the years he's kind of like yeah you should try this you should try that he's kind of turned me on to the idea of no effects and he sent me this EP from no effects that I'd never heard of before I'm familiar with most of their biggest most popular albums like what like punk and rub lake or something like that I'm familiar with a lot of those titles and covers but I'm not familiar with this I was like what the hell is this the decline have never heard of this before the the pledge of agreements to the flags on so forth I've again I had no idea what the heck this was going into it this is a single EP and it's unlike anything no effects has ever done before it's in again which is it kind of blew me away that I had never heard of this before although it's it's it's very understandable that this record would exist because it's on Fat Wreck chords and it came out around you know the the some of the earlier years of the Bush administration and that was when a lot of those types of things were going super hard on the political side of things and this is a single EP where it's just like one epic long like gargantuan pop punk rock opera and it's just this long ambitious multifaceted multi-phased political musical diatribe that flows really tightly and is actually really exciting like some of the best stuff I think nofx has ever written I'm again I was like blown away I did not even know this existed I did not even know that that they had it in them and this is just really great the decline no effect no effects I was just really impressed with this EP really sad to know that I that I didn't even hear this before but you know that's that's a an unfortunate fact of life you're not gonna hear about everything you're not gonna know about everything and that's why it's important to know cool people to have good friends who when they hear about good shit they turn you on to it so that's that's that no effects the decline man this is good it's really good and you know on the b-side is is one of their more popular songs I believe pressed but outside of that you know it's just uh it's just the decline man good EP very good EP and finally oh I lied earlier I lied saying that I opened everything saying that I opened everything but I didn't but injury reserve hooked me up with the vinyl copy of live at the dentist office and a floss and it's it's a double LP it's both records it's in a gatefold that's sealed I don't know I was kind of sitting here wondering if I want to open it you know I have both on CD the records probably not gonna sound too much different than the CD but you know I was just thinking like oh do I want to open it do I not want to open it I don't know if I want to open it I don't know if I want to open it guys I think I might we just want to just just leave it there seal you know just forever I'll do that I'll leave it at that all right you guys are the best I love you love you love you and I will see you in the next video over here next to my head is a nother vinyl update video and you know like the playlist the vinyl update playlist there's also the link to subscribe to the channel and I will catch you in the next one okay forever 
pf0hDdf2QJc,ah hello Matheny wash tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flatbush zombies album that vacation in hell this is the massive second album from trippy New York rap trio Flatbush zombies their second commercial LP and a follow-up to their somewhat underwhelming commercial debut a few years ago 3001 a laced Odyssey which was kind of an awkward transition away from the very psychedelic and grimy and hard-hitting mixtapes that the trio built their name on especially a better off dead amazing mixtape by comparison 3001 was so much more synthetic and hollow stiff didn't have the same explosive sample rich production didn't have that same kind of trippy density their mystical vibe and trademark voices and in group chemistry were mostly intact but just something was missing so I was kind of expecting vacation and held to be the album where the group would come into their own artistically and commercially and certainly on the surfaces seemed like that was going to be the case I mean this is definitely a bigger more ambitious record in track listing alone lots of pretty impressive features on the tracklist to the production in comparison with 3001 is definitely more interesting and sound rich the trio also effectively interpolates a number of different songs or sort of a musical references throughout some of these tracks and occasionally there's a bit of extra instrumentation or even a guest on this album such as Portugal the man who are incorporated very creatively into the track to the point where you have these very pretty gargantuan Indy style vocal harmony is sort of calling away in the instrumental as Flatbush zombies do their thing it's a pretty epic moment on the album a good centerpiece but with all that being said digging deeper into this album hearing the entire thing did not deliver the the non-stop excitement that I thought it would while this thing is 19 tracks it's 80 minutes long about it's not the longest album I've ever heard or listened to and yet for some reason it feels like it oh god I want I wanted to love this album so much especially since the teaser tracks for this thing where we're pretty good headstone you and I and also on paper Flatbush zombies just seemed like one of the most unique hip-hop groups out there right now but there are so many underwhelming deep cuts on this album and really I think it comes down to at the end of the day just Flatbush zombies punching under their weight on this LP and I guess just a lack of artistic progression as well because since their drugs and they're better off dead mixtapes there hasn't really been any growth in topical ambition in Flatbush zombies songs in lyrical cohesion between the members or across entire tracks save for maybe a few songs toward the end or a track about girls on this album plus I feel like the trio has passed this grace period where the novelty of their voices still kind of carries the entertainment value of the song like there has to be something a little bit more to what Flatbush zombies are doing if they're going to maintain interest over a longer period of time I feel like in a way on this album they've painted themselves into an artistic corner much in the same way that the underachievers did on their last LP because in a lot of ways I feel like I'm listening to a longer somewhat more instrumentally ambitious version of what I've heard before but a lot of this album sort of delivers this vague sense of depth and consciousness and and darkness that I feel like once you dive deeper into the lyrics isn't actually backed up I mean it's certainly present on some of the tracks here especially chunky where zombie juice goes at length in a verse about the negative portrayals of blacks in the media division and hatred on the internet kids essentially being raised with no moral compass but then there are tracks on this thing like big shrimp which it just seems like a competition to see who can have the least interesting verse it's just pretty much like some mystical auto-tune pop trap for a more mainstream audience that just doesn't really bring much in the way of substance to the table nor is it that interesting to listen to like the sounds are kind of average it's just passable and that's the case for a number of tracks on this album it would be one thing if there were maybe two or three maybe even four passable track sort of sliding through the tracklisting at various points on this album but the thing is the tracks that are just so-so are in clusters and all over the LP the song leather symphony features lyrics from juice talking about getting green and essentially turning into Peter Pan a simile that's definitely worth an eye roll or him rapping about his third eye just burning and again with with the third eye stuff not that I mind the idea of it or that I think it's bad to be referencing thinking at a higher consciousness level but most of the people who I see mentioning this over and over and over often aren't bringing the weightiest lyrics I mean you have a Sept 12 II on this track who easily had the most generic rap album of 2017 the song real girls follows a formula that many others on here do where you get a so-so Erik verse a so-so juice verse and then Meech does the hook accept a bun B actually shows up on this one buns verse on this track is is pretty general for him I mean I mean super general but he's not even the most lackluster appearance on the record sad to say that that might go to Denzel curry I mean I get what he was trying to do on this very sentimental very emotional very introspective and personal track it seems like he was trying to take it into into like a little bit of a romantic andre 3k kind of direction but these lyrics about like sweet diabetic hugs and kissing mistletoes well III just had a visceral just just you know indigestion kind of reaction to that the song ask Kourtney is yet another song on this record that despite a very potent Lee eerie vibe and these very clear references to the death of Kurt Cobain should have come out a lot more conceptual interesting and and morbid than it actually did in fact the the lyrics that are actually on this track they're pretty low impact sure zombie juices verse toward the end gives a real sense of paranoia but by that point it's really just kind of too little too late and then the song proxy why would the Flatbush zombies put such an uneventful song on a record whose chorus about faith and religion and holy war seems to have little to do with the verse that's around it a lot of these tracks just seem like there is a result of this stream of conscious writing style that doesn't really add up too much as it feels like a lot of what's being written hasn't been drafted much of what's on this album just seems like it's as a result of this stream of consciousness writing style that doesn't really add up into much thematically nor does it sound like a lot on this album has been drafted over and over again to the point where the verse itself stands out as being packed with wordplay or incredibly clever or saying something of significance or something even witty or clever or humorous or just kind of taking things at an angle that the listener hadn't thought of before I don't know sometimes I even hear moments on this record where the instrumentals fail to compliment the songs themselves even if Flatbush zombies are going kind of thematic which i think is certainly the case on the track trapped the instrumental on this song is super soulful it's pillowy it's cloudy it sounds like it should be the soundtrack to like a late-night hangout smoke session with your friends and yet like the tone of the lyrics you literally have Michi rapping about having suicidal thoughts on the song his verse is one of the darkest on the entire record and yet it doesn't really feel complimented by the sound palette of the beat and the flow of the album just seem is really odd as well again it's pretty long it starts off mildly then it gets more aggressive eventually mellows out gets sadder a few tracks later and then for whatever reason the tempo picks up again with some of the final tracks I mean I don't want to beat up on the album from beginning to end because there are some highlights on this thing I think best American all around is a pretty decent track and one of the more deeply political songs on the record even if a lot of the critiques or issues brought up our little surface-level the song headstone is one of the most irresistible catchy and groovy tracks on the entire record and one of the few moments on the album where it feels like Flatbush zombies are going a little commercial going a little bit poppier but it works me cheese hook on this track is pretty sweet and all the verses bring the typically slick and dark and dirty and and morbid tone that I usually enjoy out of an FB z song the song m.bison is another irresistible catchy track it's got some of the most pop and hook on the entire record some of the most head-bobbing flows the song vacation is one of the most mystical tracks on the entire album Joey badasses verse is pretty nice the song facts has some incredibly eerie production and I love the the shouted gang vocals on the hook seems really cartoony and over-the-top and brings a lot of character and personality to the song JT kisses verse on this track even though he's rapping at half the speed than a lot of the other people on the album his verse just has so much more presence it's so cold it's so deadly that Ace Hood line is hilarious crown with Portugal I already said it was a great track you and I already loved it as it was a teaser song to the album and maybe the best song in the last leg of the record is you are my sunshine which is essentially a lyrical tribute to ASAP yams from the heart from each goes over really well but despite all the tracks on this thing that I enjoy it's just not enough I feel like if this record were paired down a little bit it could have been so much more of a solid album but there are just too many lackluster or so-so songs in the tracklist for me to come out loving this album unfortunately vacation in hell is just a very bloated very inconsistent album as much as I do like the Flatbush zombies style and sound I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

mxMQEy8sQJI,"Hi everyone, Anthony Fantano here, internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Cardi B album ""Invasion Of Privacy"". Straight out of the Bronx it's Cardi B, reality star, internet and social media icon, rapper. Cardi's rise to mainstream fame in the past year has been meteoric to say the least. Her stripper to rap superstar transition has been explosive, and pretty much unparalleled. Her breakout single ""Bodak Yellow"" gained momentum very slowly over the course of the summer of 2017 and beyond, and she has dropped numerous chart toppers since. And her new record over here went gold the day of release. She has pretty much outlasted all claims that she is just a one hit wonder, and that her fifteen minutes of fame are almost up, and believe it or not, ""Invasion Of Privacy"" is actually not that bad. I mean I'm not going to say it's amazing or anything, but it's just good enough to where it would stave off claims that she's fallen off or that she doesn't have any long game. Because over all this thing is pretty consistent and even the spots that I don't care for will most likely go over well with her fans. But first let me try to get into the appeal of Cardi B. Obviously Cardi's music isn't particularly smart or flashy or experimental or whatever and most likely every track on this record is heavily reliant on Cardi's co-songwriters as well as her producers. With all of that being said, Cardi represents more than your average pop, trap, or soundcloud rapper right now. Because on this record she is an authoritative, sexually empowered, woman with this rag to riches story that nearly every American dreams of. Which in a way I think hits harder than it does for a lot of other artists out there because Cardi's past in dancing, in television, in these kind of shoddy mix tapes that she was dropping a little while back, has all been so well documented online. Because before Cardi blew up in the music industry, most people online already knew about her as just being this funny, goofy, silly, social media personality that nobody really needed to take that seriously. But since ""Bodak Yellow"" and the release of this album it's all of a sudden like 'Woah, you've really like glowed up'. Another thing that adds to the appeal of Cardi is that her rough and unfiltered personality is so magnetic. I mean, the lyrics on this album range from being hilarious to being brash to being vulnerable. Even a little edgy with the multiple allusions to gang culture and specifically the bloods on this thing. I mean this album cover isn't red or anything but still the content within is about as bloodied up as YG's ""Still Brazy"". And generally Cardi B just seems way less calculated than a lot of other artists who manage to hit the mainstream, typically as a result of working at it for years and years and years and going through this very slow and very measured grooming process. Not that Cardi hasn't been working in the industry or trying to make her way up for a long time, she has, but in the areas of social media and reality television it's the exact opposite of reserved and calculated that gets you views and gets you attention. Given that background, given that experience it very much paints her approach to music and paints her approach to I guess just showcasing herself in the public eye. And I make that point not just as Cardi B as a female artist but I feel like generally male artists are a bit more I guess calculated as well. So this thing is thirteen tracks, its forty minutes I very much appreciate that for a debut it does not overstay its welcome. And it pretty much seems like the name of the game on this track list is to pen as many bangers and highlights as possible. This thing kicks off with the track ""Get Up 10"" which is a dramatic makeover anthem with a lot of lyrics about where Cardi came from, where she is now the track shows a lot of heart for her roots and her family but also a lot of New York grit. And I just kind of love that ending refrain where she talks about getting knocked down nine times but then getting up ten, it really kind of says a lot about Cardi as an artist and basically the theme of this album in general. That will for Cardi to push and succeed, move forward. However, it does't take too long for this record to just totally go off the rails and get insane. And what I mean is the song ""Bickenhead"" which is the most bad bitch anthem I've ever heard in my entire life. Cardi's sense of humor and charisma on this track are incredible, this track in a lot of ways is about the power the power of sex. Every bar on this track is about something sexual, just straight fucking she really kind of takes rapping about pussy popping to a new level. Pussy popping at church, pussy popping on the stove. I'm having a hard time talking right now because I had a near heart attack thinking about the line where she's talking about making that pussy crack a smile. Yeah, that's that's not something you hear every day. And moments like this are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the unrefined extravagance and exaggeration that Cardi brings to this album. Whether she's rapping about a Versace driveway or putting a Louis Vuitton shoe on some trash talking girl's neck. She's rapping about a threesome with Rhianna. Pussy so good she screams her own name. Also calling herself hot 'n ready like a Little Cesear's pizza. I hope you got a check for that. And also like Cardi is just the queen of shit talking on this record like this one bar about how this girl is saying that you know everything down there it's all her, it's all hers, but then she brings up that her thighs don't match, like they're different sizes, they don't look the same. *melon inhales sharply* ouch I also love this one bar where she says some guy is a pussy and a rat like Tom and Jerry. On a lot of these tracks, self written or not, it just feels like Cardi is putting on a masterclass in the hard-hitting, just totally no apologies, no shame, no holds barred verbal nastiness that New Yorkers are known for. The song ""Bodak Yellow"" is obviously in the track listing on this thing, what else can I say about this track that hasn't been said a million times before. It's easily one of the most cold and deadly trap bangers of the decade. And sure, while instrumentally the production on this thing might just be trap 101 and Cardi's flow on this track may just be an interpolation of a Kodak Black flow, but Cardi, with her personality, really sells the track. I mean a lot of new contemporary pop rap and trap right now it's all about personality, it's all about presence it's a personality contest and Cardi, if it's gonna be a competition on a personality level she brings that just *melon yells* When it comes to personality, when it comes to accent, when it comes to recognizability she just like goes super [saying?] And something that makes that work in my opinion is just that a lot of Cardi's rapping feels like she's kind of inviting her fans in on celebrating her success with her, as opposed to just trying to blow out everyone within ear and eye shot regardless of whether or not they're a fan which is especially true on the track ""Best Life"". which is a moment where Chance The Rapper really steals the show. His melodic very uppity very animated flow is here in spades. *melon sings* I'm living my best life and you know that vocal line is incredible, but Cardi certainly holds her own on the track. She is very different in terms of style and performance and delivery than Chance is and you know again just that kind of gritty, nasty, unfiltered New York personality just kind of pours through here, but there's a nice sense of positivity to this track that I feel like was much needed at the middle point of this thing. The song ""Be Careful"" believe it or not has grown on me since I initially heard it and had kind of a negative reaction to it. And Cardi's transition into a more emotional angle on this track, it's a bit awkward. But in a way, with Cardi B, her imperfections are kind of her strengths. Which is something that she even seems to be self aware of as she brings up her crib being messy, her hair being fucked up, or having messed up teeth which she later got fixed but there was a long period of time where her teeth were not in the best shape. But to even reference that in her own music so many times kind of continues, maybe inadvertently, this theme of self improvement and just kind of continuing to work on yourself so that you can be that best person you can be, you can kind of also be on that Cardi B track to success. Now unfortunately, after the middle point of this album, the quality kind of trails off a little bit. One, because some of the guests are a little underwhelming and two, because at this point Cardi B is still not that versatile of a rapper. The song ""I Like It"" is this latin trap flip featuring a prominent sample of the song ""I Like It Like That"" I think The Blackout Allstars version of the track, I could be wrong, could be the original at least that's the version I remember from when I was a kid. As far as Cardi's flow, her lyrics, and the instrumental goes, the track goes over great. Bad Bunny on the track is pretty fine even though I'm not really a huge fan of some of the latin trap crooners that have been making the rounds recently. What's for sure is he has more personality than J Balvin, who in my opinion really kind of just extends the track out a little bit too much, like his addition to the song was really unnecessary. Though I get given Cardi's background and the flavor of the song you would want to try to invite as many relevant people to that sound as possible to a track like this, it's all marketing. It's certainly better than it could've been. Balvin just seemed unnecessary because his vocals in my opinion, not that distinct, and Bad Bunny already outshined him on the track. The song ""Ring"" with Kehlani, I just do not care for Kehlani's vocals on this track at all they sound super sanitized, generic, dime a dozen, I wouldn't even know it was Kehlani if you didn't tell me. ""Money Bag"" is maybe the most unnecessary track on the entire record. Not only because the production is some of the most basic on the entire project, the hook is incredibly annoying, and on top of that Cardi's flow on here is pretty much just a repeat of her flow from ""Bodak Yellow"". It's like her and her producers were essentially trying to you know, go for ""Bodak Yellow"" number two. But making their attempts at just repeating the same formula a little too obvious. In my opinion, ""Bartier Cardi"" is a much better attempt at trying to get another weird, dark, trap hit brewing, which obviously worked because this song went number one as well, but in their attempts to make this happen it wasn't that obvious, it's not like they were literally copying and pasting the formula onto another song. SZA totally kills it on the closer. Her vocals are fantastic, some of the most aggressive and animated I've heard her on any track ever, but as far as a closing track this song to me really doesn't work all that well. This track thematically I think could have fit into numerous points of the album and it would've sounded just the same. Not to mention at this point on the album Cardi's delivery and flow, even though she does have some of her funniest lines on this song is kind of running a little thin for me, like she could use a bit of a change up at this point. ""Drip"" with Migos in my opinion is really weighed down by the Migos themselves as this performance here seems just as average as nearly every other performance they seem to give, on most features and most albums that they appear on these days. And then when it comes to the track ""She Bad"" with YG, easily one of the most tedious hooks on the entire record. I wish YG had like a more prominent or interesting feature on this thing, more interesting than *melon sings* she bad, she bad, she bad, she bad Louis bag, Louis bag, Fendi bag, Fendi bag *sings gibberish* Really the best moment on the back end of this record in my opinion is the song ""Thru Your Phone"" featuring Ali Tamposi, whose name I hope I'm pronouncing correctly, I apologize if I'm not but she's singing along with Cardi on the hook of this track and it's easily one of the best guest vocals on the entire record. I wish she had a credit right there on the title because her voice has this kind of very dreamy, pillowy, sad, moody demeanor that makes the song go over so well because Cardi's voice she's a little bit like a bull in a china shop. It's hard for her to convey super emotional tracks really well sometimes. And this track in particular was one of the more interesting when it comes to relationships on the rocks and this bitterness, this sense of betrayal that she feels. But this track is still one of the more interesting on the entire record when it comes to love on the rocks. It's not like be careful with me, that's a little bit more, I guess introspective with Cardi rapping about feeling insecure, feeling a lot of self doubt because the other person in the relationship isn't treating her right. This track ""Thru Your Phone"" is a little bit more nasty and bitter, a track where she's seeking vengeance over the fact that this person has just thrown her trust out of the window through their infidelity on their phone. Even though this album was a little bit of a mixed bag, it's not that bad of a commercial debut, it's a decent first outing. And like I said the tracks I didn't care for too much will most likely go over well with Cardi's fans but still with what she's presented here, I kind of feel like, I don't know, maybe down the road she could get a bit more interesting, maybe she could kind of work out some of these kinks and become a better rapper. I'm feeling a decent to strong six on this record. Tran- sition, have you given this album a listen? Did you love it, did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best, you're the best, what should I review next? Hit the like if you like, please subscribe, please don't die hit the bell as well and I will see you in the next one.

vdHxMQtIHic,"Uhh, this Lil Xan, Total Xanarchy? It's NOT GOOD Lil Xan is a California rapper who's been blowing up in the Soundcloud scene with some big singles and music videos, most notably the song ""Betrayed"". I never really took him all that seriously because I thought his songs, and his music videos had kind of a goofy feel to them and had no idea that this project was comin' around the corner. I was not planning on this. We're not even at the halfway point of the year yet and this is one of the worst things I've heard all year The beats are mostly these moody spacey trap bangers. They have a little bit of a Yung Lean feel to them like he's definitely ripping some of his shtick off from the whole sad boy movement. And like most other rappers who have come out of the SoundCloud wave his lyrics are pretty dumbed down, pretty simplistic, very blunt, very repetitive. But it seems like he pushes even that to a degree where it's, it's basically unbearable. For example the song ""Tick Tock"", as far as Lil Xan is concerned, mostly consists of him saying ""tick tock"" It's even more repetitive than Gucci Gang Really the only thing that gives ANY of these tracks credibility are the features, the 2 Chainz feature on here isn't bad, the Charlie XCX feature wasn't really... ...anticipated by me, anyway. But she manages to be a little bit of a bright spot on this album. Even the Rae Sremmurd feature is pretty decent like those little boy-ish vocal leads at the beginning of the track actually go over pretty well and are a nice change of pace from what Lil Xan is doing on this thing. Oh and the song ""Round Here"" YG on that track is the only thing that gives that song credibility like what are you saying on this track? What is this song about? If I go to where your home town and there's like a bunch of sad white boys with like beanies over their heads and face tats and like really sad gloomy looks are going to approach me just be like ""you're not from around here"" mrrbbrbrbrbrbrbr And that's the thing, that's the worst thing about this project It's just Lil Xan's voice, his delivery, just everything about his ""performances"" on this project. He sounds like he barely has a pulse half the time. All of his words, all of his flows are just really drawled out and most of his songs don't really have much more than ten words to their name because I don't think that he can commit more than ten words to memory for a single track. ""xan's going to play you, xan, xan, xan xaaaaaaaan"" Lil Xan's voice for me has been one of the most simultaneously grating but also boring sounds I've heard this year. It's so lifeless and uninspired and flavorless, and lacking in personality lacking in anything engaging, like what is so interesting about listening to this guy just eeeeeeh just creak his way through a song? He's like a creaky door that's just opening endlessly, it never finishes opening It's just always creeeeeakiiiiiiiing. And the Diplo song on this thing is ridiculous. How, how Xan ended up with this Diplo beat and *chuckles* It's almost hilarious because he just sounds so out of place on this really uppity, poppy, fruity instrumental that he should have never been allowed to touch. Yeah this record is just really confusing for me I mean, right form the get-go, the opening track where he's saying You know, ""Xans don't make me what I am, Xans don't make me who I am"" I mean for what other purpose does this song exist other than to I don't know convince somebody of what's obviously the truth. I mean, you've named yourself Lil Xan, and at least in part you have kind of created this persona around having had issues with the drug in the past. So, I mean, at least in a way, they've kind of at least formed the persona with which you create your art, so it's kind of the exact opposite of what you're saying. I can appreciate a bit of repetition or mindlessness if we're getting some kind of swap for smarter, more interesting songs like youthful rage, or a sense of humor or something but this album just sounds like shutting your brain off just *wooop, power down*. Because it's not particularly hype nor does it sound very sad either It just sounds really... ....hollow and vacant. I mean even on the ""bangers"" on this record Xan doesn't really have much in the way of presence. He's a very drab figure, I mean, the MOST drab figure on his entire album. As pretty much every feature here and even the instrumentals themselves outshine him. Yeah, this album just sounds like having a weird friend who laughs really strangely at inappropriate times. *haaaa haaaa haaaa ha* This albums sounds like somebody who never opens their eyes all the way they're just always in a constant state of this. This thing also sounds like stumbling upon somebody who's in a stupor and you wave your hand in front of their face they just won't wake up. It also kind of sounds like brain cells dying. Really the only thing I can give this record are some of the instrumentals and the features. Literally everything that is entertaining about this record has nothing to do with Lil Xan. In fact I would say most of the time, what's interrupting the enjoyment of this project is Xan himself. Every time he pops in, every time he repeats a ridiculous lyric, every time he's creaking his way through a verse like he's high out of his mind, the enjoyability factor of the song just plummets like a crashing plane. It's not even that this album sounds dumb, because dumb music can be really fun, It's like this album is less of an insult to my intelligence, it's more of an insult to my humanity. Make music that makes you want to feel alive or feel something just engage in some kind of stimuli, not the musical equivalent of the just like zonking out and just drooling all over yourself and pissing your pants. I guess that's the last thing this album sounds like. Having to take your designer jeans and put them in a heavy wash cycle because you shit them. This, this Lil Xan album, it's, it's not good. -sition. Have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best you're the best What should I review next? Hit the like if you like, please subscribe, please don't die, hit the bell as well. And I will see you in the next one.

back from it supports the show supports the channel and I want to give a shout out to my good boy Frank Jeff sieh who has a new EP out which is linked down there below along with all the other songs that we are going to be talking about in this in this episode per usual all right worst tracks guys worst tracks yes Rae sremmurd has a new track out featuring Pharrell it's titled Chanel and it is easily one of the most tedious tracks the duo has ever come out with maybe it'll grow on me once I hear this new triple disc record they're going to be coming out with this year but I don't know III doubt it it's not one of their catch of your tracks and I just find it to be kind of a repetitive and annoying but hey that's kind of the name of the game these days so maybe the song will go platinum who the hell knows moving on from there Calvin Harrison do a lip oh one kiss the this song pretty much reminds me of exactly what I didn't care so much about when it comes to just really bad house pop from back in the day I mean it feels like a throwback but a throwback that reminds you of all the reasons a certain sound and a certain trend died and that's pretty much how I'd like to put that couch esta has a new song out titled Coinstar which is absolute trash it's for some reason on most major music streaming platforms I don't know how that's allowed but it's garbage per usual just like everything else couch eh esta does this new ASAP Rocky song and single ASAP forever featuring moby of all people yeah every single song ASAP rocky comes out within this new album cycle has just been awful every kind of teaser track every non-album track this track the flows are really boring excuse me the flows are really boring I had like a bit of a heart attack there the song's giving me a heart issue I think the flows are really boring instrumental bland seems a little bit more aggressive than most of the stuff that was on a saps last album but dude just cannot like get a hit together dude cannot get a hit together at this point yeah it's it's it's really just a mess it makes me sad and let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of man you know not not terrible but not amazing you know but we're worth a nod worth a nod you guys might dig them a little more than me oh dang freaking zeal and ardour which is kind of an obscure band camp music project that made some waves a little while back for this weird combination of like blues black metal and like old slavery time work songs like crazy combination of sounds it seems like a lot of those things are still kind of an influence on this newer track although there's maybe more like a I don't know like a hard rock vibe going on with the guitars not so much a black metal thing the black metal theme themes seemed mostly thrown out the window on this track but excuse me it's still a pretty compelling song and makes me excited for the other feature of this project it's definitely one of the weirder more interesting band camps I've stumbled upon and I don't know I just kind of like hearing more coming out of out of this zeal and ardour thing moving on from there the get up kids are back new song titled maybe and they have a new record on the way lyric video out for this track it's a pretty sweet catchy poppy rock song with some punk elements some emo elements just like we typically expect from the get up kids it's not reinventing the wheel something greatest hoon I've ever heard from the band but hey you know it's it's not really that bad you know moving on from their group er has a new track out titled driving which is is not quite as low fie and as I guess says opaque as the last track she dropped from this forthcoming project but it's it's still a very nondescript slow very moody piano tune that doesn't really head in any I don't know in in like a strong direction or anything so it's nice while it's on it's a pleasant vibe but it doesn't really conjure much else you know and you could say that groupers previous music was very much about a vibe as well but previously when it's come to records like dragging a dead deer or alien observer there was at least like more attention paid to texture and and I can't say that's the case at all with like this newest material the sound play the texture just either doesn't really seem like it's there like it's not even something she's attempting or it's just super light and super just uninteresting but moving out from there Onew beachhouse track over here dark spring while it is maybe one of the more baseless songs that we have heard from this new beach house album cycle still this track is is very much outside of the duo's wheelhouse I mean it is spacey and kind of dreamy but the vocals are unlike that of any other Beach House song the instrumentals kind of rough a little distorted so I don't know man beach house seemed to kind of be pulling out all the stops for this new record I don't know what to make of all these singles can't make heads or tails of a lot of them few of them I thought were great or I mean at least one of them I thought were great one of them I thought was terrible so I feel like I could really go anyway on this record all I know is that I'm excited because I'm just hearing something that I have not heard before from the band and their traditional sound their trademark sound I think they've kind of painted themselves into a corner with it I'm waiting from the kind of break out of it it seems like they're really doing with this newest material and the results have been intriguing to say that least so moving on from there Azealia Banks Anna Wintour this is a new single from the singer-songwriter rapper which is not that bad it's it's not a terrible single it does start off terrible some people have been kind of advertising this track as a return to form and in a way it is she goes back to the hip hop the hip house sound and style that she kind of made her name with on 2 1 2 that that's definitely the case however like her singing and the lyrics for the whole first leg of the track total trash just throw it out delete it like some of the worst music she's ever made period but then once you get past that part and you get to the hook and she hits you with a rap verse the beat really starts going and it sounds great it sounds amazing but damn like the first leg of this track some of the clunkiest most overly flowery fake deep lyrics ever heard ever and the the singing for the most part is like some of her worse like some of her worst singing is on this track so I'm really torn on this long parts of it I think are amazing parts of it I love parts of it I just cannot stand I'm just really like I don't know neutral audit in a way because there's elements of it that I think are great thinker of terrible so I'm just gonna leave it at that and moving on from there this new track from Amon a campfire featuring injury reserve pretty low-key banger if you'd like to see a sweat I think you'll like this track quite a bit too it's not a bad song I just wish there was like a little bit more to it I just I just wish there was a grog verse on this thing man or at least a grog hook you know what I mean like it's Easy's like he's kind of incognito he's like nowhere to be found on this track and it's just like you know a little unfortunate because I think he could have brought so much personality to the cut and let's move on to the tracks that kind of blew me away this week or I thought were especially good all right digging on this new track from Sabrina Claudio came out on the 2nd of April or at least this lyric video for it came out and god this is some this is some slow sexy wet sensual sweaty R&B just so quiet so I just hits me in those sexy feels I just cannot I can't I can't describe the sexiness of this song enough I don't know there's some weird vocal kind of tricks that remind me a bit of fka twigs but sabrina is definitely in a lane of her own though she is still in a lot of ways it it within that very moody alternative R&B style that Spacey R&B style were very used to at the moment but yeah I think she's a doing a lot of good things within vocally she's pretty interesting you know vocally she's got some chops you know she's not just like one of these nasally Airy singers with no personality you know there's definitely like some tangible sensuality there that that hits pretty hard moving on from there uh rich Bryan watch out total fuck and bang dude in this music video this music videos Valerius but still is one of his one of his better tracks some of the lyrics are kind of silly but you can tell he's not taking it too serious it's kind of a hard-hitting catchy track and I love the the synthesizers on this beat the web like it's such a psychedelic kind of freaked up sound I don't know I just kind of love the sound of the instrumental love his deep husky voice his flow is good and I just got a lot of uh I don't know kind of low-key monotone deep husky chunky voice charisma so and and I do think this one of his better tracks so it's a pretty good song moving on from there I'm digging on this new track over here from Gabon Gabon Junior kind of like this bedroom pop track titled afraid of me it's a nice little ballot it's pretty cute it's got some quaint fun very very endearing lead vocals and you know some very low-key lo-fi instrumentation and the ballot at the core of it is is so quaint and it's so lovable so you know that that's really kind of what attracted me to the song so much the bedroom pop fans get into it and I see that this is a connected with a top-shelf record so it's good that they're behind it and is that the UH no we got a couple more Oh digging on this new Drake track nice for what I think the music video was like a little corny with all the celebrities in it you know given what Drake was rapping about in the song it seemed like a lot of women he had in mind going through hardships like maybe you could have like I don't know done something a little bit more ambitious or narrative wise with the music video but still it's a little pretty catchy song like it's got a nice straightforward beat it's got a good groove to it and a very prominent Lauryn Hill sample that is executed pretty tastefully and this song I actually find to be catch here then God's plan I find to be catchy er than anything he's come out with recently and it's actually one of his more substantive and emotional tracks he's dropped in a while too so you know he kind of get the best of both worlds on on this cut you know it's not just catchy and dumbed down you know it's good it's got something to it it's got some nice emotional I guess uh empathetic sentiments to it that I like quite a bit and I think we have one more over here this new Denzel curry tracks sumo shadow friggin banger banger alert banger alert whoa whoa Denzel occur he goes freakin crazy on this track he goes Super Saiyan this track and and I don't know if I could really say anything else about it other than that he's just like he's registering on the Richter scale with this song I'm the Richter scale [Laughter] no but seriously listen to it it's it's fire so and I think one more daniel rossen of a grizzly bear Fame he has a new track out titled deer Slayer and it's it's nice to see him releasing music under his own name as opposed to that whole Department of Eagles thing I don't know exactly what has led to that decision but the instrumental ears like really rough and distorted and rickety but still kind of has that very nuanced beautiful balladry to it that we expect from Daniel I kind of like the lo-fi and very nasty kind of textures that are coming out of the song reminds me a little bit of Mount Airy in a way and in the overall it's it's a cool tune you know might be a little too abrasive for some people might be a little too abrasive for some grizzly bear fans you know might might word some listeners off aesthetically but I do think he is doing some interesting things compositionally and vocally and I'm gonna leave it at that guys that has been the episode of the weekly track roundup thank you so much for watching it's like a little bit of a short episode of the weekly track roundup it seems although I blew through a lot of tracks but hopefully all episodes are are this focused are this focused again you're the best and shout out again to seek information down below as well as our Amazon and turntable lab associate links

ug1VSZ0tsUI,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a quickie review of this ruin project played transmissions Volume one now if you couldn't tell from the title of this thing it's a compilation it's a collection of material released sporadically over the past couple of years be it on like an EP or a split or something like that and it all convenes on to this one release over here and even though the music on this record comes from a myriad of different contexts it all sounds pretty a gross ugly horrid blood caked deadly and bloodthirsty now if you couldn't tell already from some of my descriptions there these guys are a death metal band a westcoast death metal band who actually formed back in the 90s but then you had a huge gap of time where they weren't recording or putting anything out I've read a few rumors on the internet as to why that is but nothing I can confirm personally they started releasing music again recently had an album out last year and they followed that album up with this compilation record which is currently being supported by blood harvest and horror pain death gore productions which is a pretty good extreme metal label that I follow somewhat closely just to see if every once in a while something blows me away stops me in my tracks I hear a lot of loud very aggressive very exciting stuff on there and for whatever reason for weeks and weeks and weeks out of everything I usually try on there this is one of the records that I just kind of keep coming back to it's a hell of a freaking death metal album the vocals are super guttural and not dulled up all that much like they have a very low like very throaty almost like you know they almost reach like like that toilet Tambor in a way where you got like that nice gross fleshy gurgle II kind of sound to the vocals the guitars and bass super down-tuned super distorted super rough but the riffs even though it's down-tuned as hell the riffs are tight and the riffs have some really good grooves on them like don't think that because it's way down tune death metal that it's super slow or super boring or it's kind of blah doesn't have a whole lot of you know definition to it it's not that muscular this is a very muscular album it's a very tight record not to say that it's super technical or flashy or anything like that but it's just got good head banging aggressive grooves on it and they just come again and again and again and again the drums had this nice flat fuddy tone to them that I just like hearing on a death metal album just don't want to hear anything too I guess pronounced or dynamic from the drums just like boom boom boom just make it sound like I'm getting a beating and a lot of lyrics seem to do with killing serial killers that sort of thing there they're very morbid band if you couldn't already tell from the title over here it's very gross horrid death metal music I think I might have used the word gross already but again just the the low down tuned very very sour tone of the guitars those vocals are just they're so fucking nasty and man the drums are just mean and again just the way that they perform as a unit nothing about this record seems to over produced or too touched up or anything like that but the performances are just good the performances are tight you I just really get wrapped up in the band performing on this record even though a lot of these songs are just kind of like hard-hitting not a whole lot of tune to them it's just very nasty very dark very ugly like it's ugly it's a very ugly sound this record is ugly as hell and in nicest way that I could possibly mean that I'm not sure what else I can say about it it is a little one-dimensional and the songs run pretty seamlessly given that the band does stick very heavily to this one sort of death metal conception and it is a compilation so it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of attention paid to how all of these songs sound on the whole across an hour of runtime but still man it's it's it's to me like a pretty standout underground death metal record the sound on this thing is heavy it's horrid it's great I hesitate to use the word brutal but it pretty much applies here and they tag some pretty good inch and outros and in vocal cuts on to some of the tracks of this record just to break things up a little bit it does provide a nice bit of breathing room to kind of process all of the awful things that I just heard but yeah I mean I'm pretty impressed with this compilation it's just a really badass death metal comp and don't really have anything to say about it other than that like give it a shot link to give this thing a listen down below in the description box and over here next to my head are some links to check out some other stuff another review the subscription link and and that's it okay love you see you in the next one forever 
m8PBrunDIfI,hi everyone love ffunny self-tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Kacey Musgraves album Golden Hour this is the latest album from golden Texas Sara and songwriter Kacey Musgraves her fourth full-length studio album proper album oh and God is this getting rave reviews so rave reviews and I just don't get it I don't get the hype I don't see the hype I mean I've enjoyed KC's music prior to this album to a degree when her sound was a bit more country Kitsch she was dropping a lot of tracks with cute but rustic instrumentation very bittersweet lyrics songs like trailer song and biscuits and dime-store cowgirl and there was even room for some legit tragedy and darkness in her back catalogue - on songs like blowin smoke while none of it really stopped me in my tracks I certainly saw the appeal in it and the potential crossover - for records like same trailer different Park and pageant material and crossover is the name of the game on golden hour for sure because on this record she loses quite a bit of her country twang dipping her toes into acoustic pop and adult contemporary with like a singer/songwriter twist god this album is bland this is a bland album nearly everything on this record is average the instrumentals are average the singing is average the lyricism is average it took everything in me not to roll my eyes when I first heard the chorus on space cowboy you can have your space cowboy I can't help but feel like what this record is benefiting from right now is just the joy of low expectations not that Casey's prior material was terrible it certainly wasn't but it seems like a bulk of the criticism and the praise surrounding this record is just how great of a record this is for country and it's hilarious that that these comments are typically coming from people that that don't listen to a whole lot of country like because Casey isn't just some culturally backwards redneck or someone who fits so snugly into the generic excruciatingly ly formulaic Nashville country pop sound that we're supposed to like give that standing ovation I mean I'm sorry but no to hear a country singer singing about I don't know piercing her nose and looking at her phone and putting it down it's not groundbreaking it's not like people down in Texas don't have internet or piercings or tattoos believe it or not they have houses as well they live lives that are not too much unlike the ones that you and I live every day sure maybe this is a slight novelty in the country world when it comes to some of the more mainstream releases but this progress is all relative overall does it make for a grande interesting artistic statement not really the only thing that makes this stick out to me as a country album is this records eagerness to take everything country about it soften it bury it in the mix make it sound more faint Casey and her producers and her record label did a really good job marketing this album because it seems like they went into it wanting to make a record that was for people who didn't really listen to much country and that's exactly whose minds this album is blowing because god forbid this record sound rootsy or southern or just even have a little bit of teeth on it aside from some distant reverb II side guitar the song Velvet Elvis just pretty much sounds like I don't know a dime-a-dozen piece of pop rock or synth pop on the intro to the song happy sad with some rainy day acoustic guitars and a sequence beat Casey essentially goes full Dido the song Wonder Woman has so much shimmer on and it sounds like it might as well have been recorded and produced in the mid-1980s though I do appreciate the sentiment of the song being about having unrealistic expectations in a relationship you're not Superman I'm not Wonder Woman let's just accept one another as we are and then the song high horse which is one of my favorite lead-up singles to this album is just a really awful piece of disco pop revival like it comes out of nowhere in the tracklist and this style isn't really doing Casey any favors and getting to the core of these tracks what they're mostly made up of is just these vague sentiments about lovers and family and friends and life in general the song lonely weekend is one of the most emotionally manipulative and cloying songs I've heard in a long time with Casey essentially reaching out directly to the audience saying hey it's okay to be lonely on a weekend okay it's okay if you're alone on a weekend butterflies how is this anything more than just a run-of-the-mill crush song take out the quaint pianos of this track all the cutesy instrumentation replace it with blaring guitars and this could essentially just be a Florida Georgia line song the song oh what a world sounds like if Lana Del Rey had never ever made like a bad decision ever she quit smoking she went to college instead of jumping on the back of that guy's motorcycle and disappearing for a year but like Lana Casey also keeps a little black book of overused adages and cliches that she drops every once in a while like BAM there's a jewel BAM there's a jewel what goes up must come down the best thing this record has going for it is occasionally the tunes are pretty strong so strong that they carry KC's soso singing and lyricism to a point of of tolerability maybe even enjoy ability the song love is a wild thing as may be one of the few total packages on the entire record nearly everything about the track is great Bonnie ocean the track being about how love is just basically an unstoppable force it's it's pretty nice and the song's mother and rainbow are two of the most legitimately I guess dramatic moments on the entire record lone piano ballads but there's not much about them that feels all that country but yeah man this this record is just filled with way more misses than hits for me this was just a really uninteresting record and it's kind of sad that this is the the album that so many non country fans are convening around because it's not like there aren't more interesting things going on in the genre with Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson Katelyn Smith dropped a record this year I believe who was a much stronger vocalist Chris Stapleton I'm pretty sure Lucinda Williams is still kicking even though her latest record wasn't one of her best there are already country artists out there blending other genres into the country sound more creatively and doing it with better tunes better lyricism better vocal performances this is not really the country album that you listen to on the way to like go muddin with your friends with like a bunch of ATVs this is more like the country album that you listen to when you're on your way to the Apple store to get a new iPad I'm feeling a strong core to Olay 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well and over here next to my head is another video you could check out and there's

om3JC1JSdnI,hi everyone flea theny would tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a view of this new Jean Grey and Kweli Chris album everything's fine this is a new collaborative album from two of my favorite underground rappers gray and Kweli Chris Chris is an abstract hip hop artist who really kind of pushes the boundaries of that label he struck me back in 2013 with a record that I thought had something really special on it his his album ghost at the finish line an album that didn't feel like it was filled with songs so much as impressions of songs but songs that despite their lack of structure and despite a lack of energy on the part of Chris as a performer still had a lot of very sharp unique weird ideas interesting song topics there were these autobiographical very vulnerable and self analytical tracks on here like loop dreams where Chris was rapping at length about his attempts to make it in hip-hop music and maybe not doing so well in the process then there were moments on this album that were exaggerated and hilarious like super fuck which is still is still one of my favorite songs period then there were some spots on this album that were super sharp and satirical like Chris had a very clear idea in mind of a target which he was kind of parroting on the song coke rap war game it wouldn't be until a handful of years down the road when Chris would drop a record that I thought was was even better and that was last year's being you as great very cerebral very heady rap album filled with these woozy and eclectic instrumentals which occasionally had like a bit of a cartoony tone to them all of which paired very well with Chris's very low-key almost monotone kind of nasal very froggy voice it's kind of the story of the guy with the softest voice having the loudest brain because even though he's not the most in your face rapper a lot of his instrumental ideas are totally whacked a lot of his lyrics are insanely witty and Chris has paired up with his partner in life and his partner on this album Jean Grey a rapper who I've been waiting for a long time to hear some more substantial records from because in the middle a 2000 she had some very good records genius and this week but her output this decade so far has mostly been very low-key very scattered super independent super DIY Bandcamp releases like her that's not how you do that series in general Jean is just not a rapper who we hear enough from she spits like a demon she has a great sense of wordplay fantastic voice she's a good singer as well she has personality and a talent level that is just too high to be squandered so I'm happy to hear she's playing a large role on this album and that her and Chris are collaborating in a big way on this record I guess they had an EP back in 2016 that somehow slipped by me but everything's fine is about an hour long and the flow and the vibe of this album for frame of reference isn't really that much different than being you is great and jumping off of that I could see Matt villain fans and MF DOOM fans and and fans of the early output on Stones Throw Records getting into this record pretty heavy but while appreciating those references and inspiration points you have to respect the fact that Jean and Chris go into some pretty odd territory with with these sounds so while this record isn't that much different than Chris's recent work it does have a dynamic and a theme all its own and a personality too I mean you cannot really get into this album without having a very sharp and a very dry sense of humor I mean this thing is a mix of irony and just kind of poking fun at a lot of sensitive spots in society but then they also mix that with some incredible moments of vulnerability the opening sketch of this record pretty much illustrates the theme of this record you have this fake game show and all the contestants in response to every question need to say everything's fine everything's okay everything is alright in the world nothing is getting worse there's nothing to worry about and it's that cynicism that carries over on to the next track my contribution to this scam a track that features this very slow lo-fi psychedelic B and Chris and Jean trade bars about like Instagram models backpack rappers you know way mint hey sistar sistar fem see i mean if you take chris's refrain toward the back end of the track where you saying get to again get to again get took in you can pretty much see that the theme of this track is false prophets people misleading you hive mind stupid trends and what's funny about this track and and many others on here is that it sounds and it feels like a song it's catchy i love listening to it but there's also an element to it that feels like i'm also listening to ask it it's like parts kit but part song it's like a I don't know Cheech and Chong record for a nerdy millennial rap fan who wears glasses that are too big because Chris and Jean like like good comedians on this track they're just shitting on everybody they're shitting on everybody and and really that's kind of how it goes for a bulk of the album I mean take the track gold purple orange which features this lengthy verse from Chris where he's just going at all these different stereotypes bringing up things like the alright and black dicks and old people independent women as well great contrasts this with a verse that seems like it's all about her growing up it's sort of like taking these absolutist assertions and assumptions about a variety of things and then taking that and and juxtaposing it with a very detailed story very nuanced story about a particular person and the instrumental on this song is pretty unique it sort of leaves me feeling like a little anxious like I'm locked in in some kind of loop or something that I just can't escape out of it's a very sour jazz groove with these wandering saxophones that are pretty nice but yeah again the track feels like I'm caught in a mental feedback loop I love the track house-call which feels kind of like a loaf i warped mutant version of west coast g-funk which comes complete with a hilari boo radley reference as well as a line saying they ain't trying to ride on us we're like cobblestones also Anna wise and Jonathan hoards vocals on this track are amazing it sort of sounds like a a weirder version of some of the vocal freak outs that you might have caught like an early goody mob record or like an early CeeLo green album I love the soulful low-key and determined track peacock on the record the chord progression on this track is amazing and it's performed by these intensely ringing synthesizers topped of course with Jean Grey's very melodic flow it's a good pairing not to mention this is one of the few tracks on the record that actually takes a very serious and dark tone when it comes to some of the social issues brought up on this thing the song the smoking man from what I can gather from the few verses held within it deals with paranoia accusations conspiracies erratic behavior and these song rivers are great ending to this record these strings are killer Jean Grey's verse on this track is one of the more personal and an emotionally potent on the entire record there are a few bangers on the record too like the very aggressive and hard-hitting zero with this buzzing bassline very punchy percussion and Jean Grey's opening verse on this track is pretty incredible too and then there's oash with Hannibal Buress which if I had to make a guess as to what the mind state was that that he was recording that verse and I would have to guess it was just totally drunk out of his mind although this is one of a few tracks on the record where it feels like the feature is really what makes the song like the Denmark Vesey appearance on this record is really good also your old rugge on this album is pretty great too he's on the song scoop of dirt and I love this one line when he talks about how him and his friends are making music and they're jamming it and then he slaps a phone out of someone's hand for Shazam in it then he's talking about his gut and his hunchback posture and then a few lines later like his butt crack showing it he just like did almost this entire verse just about how like in bad shape iasts and yet it sounded so fucking hard there were a couple of skits on the album that I think did a decent job of key being up the the theme of the record may be even better than some of the songs on the album did although I will say doing better than ever to the story on that track about calling your mom and then like not wanting to be embarrassed about talking to your mom it was it was kind of a weird moment on the record that's still now at this point the the necessity of it eludes me waiting on the moon I found to be one of the blander tracks on the record it's very light jazzy instrumental didn't do too much for me and then breakfast of champions while I loved the refrain on that track and a lot of Jean Grey's lyrics to the kind of fuzzy production that just smothers her and Chris's vocals to me was a low point on the album kind of took the the excitement or the the teeth of the bite out of the track in a way overall though I think everything's fine is a really good set of tracks way more hits than misses definitely one of the more fun weird unique eclectic and smart hip-hop records I've heard this year I wish maybe there were more topical tracks on here and there are a few songs as well that don't even feature gene ready to begin with unfortunately just a few but still I will say though for what was a very unlikely artistic match at least to me from the outset this album just goes swimmingly and as collaborators I would love to hear more from Chris and Jean in the future because in an odd way even though their rap styles seem to have so little in common it's a bit of a yin and yang situation because the the low-key and I guess very even-tempered demeanor of one complements the more cold-blooded and animated and aggressive personality type of the other I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like

GtB-CCWsNo8,all right hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of great albums where I go over a series of Records that in the past month I reviewed very positively and I remind all of you that they're good maybe they slipped through the cracks for you let's go links to hear music and watch reviews for the records that I'm mentioning here are down below in the description box one Andrew wks new record you're not alone great comeback album from the post-ironic hard rock folk hero who on this record has essentially made a self-help arena rock album an inspirational motivational passionate and and very well written like operatic Rock experience it's grand it's epic it's exciting I love the fist-pumping riffs on this thing the sing-along choruses that just kind of light up my soul and make me feel like you know really really positive really positive next really diggin on the new voids album virtue it's kind of all over the place it's a little messy but still it's a very eclectic off-the-beaten-path kind of nut so very fringe art rock art pop record kind of experimental a little distorted a little weird kind of feels like Julian Casablancas and company are throwing in everything but the kitchen sink on some of these tracks some experiments don't go over quite as well as others but they're way more hits than misses on this thing I just love the catchy tracks the fun wonky production and just generally how versatile and schizophrenic in a way the album is after that digging on the new Judas Priest album fire power not too much to say about this record outside of it's just a great heavy metal album with it with a wonderfully classic sound that has a thick modern punch to it Judas Priest I mean this isn't the first late era album they've dropped that was but it's been their first in a while and I don't know they just kind of came back great songs full throttle riffs dueling guitar solos Rob Halfords voice sounds better than ever and just thoroughly impressed with how consistent and exciting of a heavy-metal record this is so Judas Priest fire power it's really good an Avant house wolf with dead magic this is one of the more obtuse records in this video organist on Avon house wolf comes through with some of her heaviest and most cerebral and long-winded and dark and tortured songs yet mixes of experimental rock and post rock and classical music all kind of mixing into this gothic and and dreary sound where you have five or so tracks that kind of come together like a tapestry like a seamless musical piece in a way with different phases again it's very dark it's very dreary and it's very odd if you like your singer songwriters you like your composers too I guess just beyond that more alternative tip and you're gonna want to give this a listen and finally in this video I want to mention a Natalia lava orchid a the Mexican pop and folk singer coming through with Meuse vol 2 which is just a wonderful tribute to numerous styles of Latin folk music wonderful sort of revisions of some great older tracks on this record along with a few originals here and there good vocal performances wonderful dual guitar playing on this thing some great extra instrumentation as well like percussion and bass and so on and so forth I just kind of love the romance the passion of this record and the foreign flavor of it is exhilarating and how could I forget Jack White Jack white with the boardinghouse reach oh this album is so funky it blends so many genres together with the hard rock and Garage stylings that we typically expect from Jack White elements of funk an experimental rock and electronic music as well and it all comes together in such an eclectic and fun and entertaining way it's a very experimental album sure not the most experimental record that we've ever heard in our entire lives but I like the fact that Jack successfully finds a balance between making a record that's sort of fringe it's off the beaten path but there's a note of accessibility to it it's an entertaining and exciting a blood pumping album it's not just like this weird indulgent and difficult to make heads or tails of musical experience it's it's weird but it's a fun kind of weird it's a it's it's it's an adventurous kind of weird it's an adventurous odd Odyssey I think I'm going to leave it at that those were the records that I wanted to mention in this round you're the best I love you love you love you love you love you remember links to everything that you need to see and hear are down below in the description box and hopefully you guys dug some of these records if you haven't tried them already alright my transition have you given these albums a listen did you

3CrD91zHkLg,hi everyone breathe the knee deep tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new voids album of virtue this is the second full-length album from art pop and experimental rock outfit the voids formerly known as Julian Casablancas and the voids because the band was formed by the famed New York singer and strokes frontman and they've changed their name simply to the voids I guess in the spirit of unity cohesion I don't know but what I do know is I thought their last full-length album tyranny was a pretty good record the record contained the very immediate balladry and compelling rock songwriting that you usually get in anything almost anything connected to Julian Casablancas but then there was also something about the band that was totally out there super indulgent which gave their music this very weird edge in all of the guitar riffs on this thing that were super abrasive super grating the somewhat muddy very walked out mixes and then there were also tracks on this thing that were like these monstrously sad and spacious ten-minute odyssey's like human sadness even though some parts of this record might have been a little difficult to digest there was something kind of thrilling about its unorthodoxy for me which is something I was hoping to get a second helping of on this new album over here now by comparison I don't think virtue is nearly as noisy or as abstract as its predecessor pretty much all the songs on this thing have some pretty straightforward hooks all the tracks round out at an average length of time but I do think Julian maintains quite a bit of lyrical personality on this album even if some elements of it are a bit more tame and on the whole I think this album is a more versatile record than tyranny to the point where it is much more difficult to pin down this thing dishes out numerous warped risky Tunes that kind of add up into a really admirable freak show even if it does kick things off kind of mild with the track leave it in my dreams which sonically is coming from very familiar terra-tory there's just something about the pacing of the song that feels like a strokes track but maybe it's just a bit sassier and instrumentally a lot odder of course with these mutant guitar solos and some weird synths and and very strange vocalizations from Julian at some points on the track as he's going into his upper register he really is letting loose on this one but then immediately after this very mild but enjoyable song voids just throw listeners into the raging rapids with curious this thing is like a moody post-punk II piece of Middle Eastern electro fit with some weird auto-tune solos on the back end that are reminiscent of Kanye West's 808s and heartbreak yeah it's it's it's that all over the place the tune is super solid too with some hooky background vocals that stick into my head instantly an undeniable groove as well the song pyramid of Bones is one of the most blatantly political songs on the entire record talking about don't believe the the white man's lies man yeah at some points on this record Julian's lyrics sound like the ravings of a mad but honestly if I was gonna listen to a mad hippy ranting in 2018 this this is the soundtrack I would want it to happen to all of Julian's words about propaganda and disinformation are set to these incredibly driving crunchy guitar riffs and there's a weirdly gothic instrumental bridge on this track that goes over really well a very noisy ending to the song permanent high school is yet another track that at its core feels like a very sad dreary strokes tune but there's enough change up instrumentally and aesthetically that it feels refreshing and interesting I feel somewhat similarly about the very soulful and sweet track lazyboy which features some great drum guitar syncopations the song alienation feels like I'm listening to very sad sanitized futuristic elevator music like I'm like I'm riding up the elevator at my desk job in the year 2048 and I know that once I reached the top floor I'm gonna get fired the instrumental and the vocals on this track are just are just life sucking and I mean that in the best way possible another highlight on this thing is the incredibly funky all words are made up this thing is like polyrhythmic junkyard synth funk for spin-doctors fans in the apocalypse there's some very odd harmonized robot vocals at some point on the song - that really stuck with me and this is one of many tracks on this record that not only blends numerous genres together into a violently catchy cacophony but also it's it's one of a few tracks here that feels like it's living in the past present and future all at the same time the song think before you drink is a decent acoustic centerpiece on the album the acoustic guitar just kind of serves as a foundation for this story that Julian tells about being young being safe being protected and then as he grows older goes out into the world goes to school he's being lied to he's being poisoned he's being ushered into the mentality of the status quo Julian Casablanca is so freaking woke again it's kind of pretentious it's it's kind of like wake up sheeple but the way that he frames it it's kind of hard to disagree with it while recently Julian Casablancas may have done that little vulture interview where he said tons of ridiculous things the way that he framed some of his ideas in his lyrics are so general that you can really apply what he's saying to a lot of different perspectives in a way I feel like a lot of what Julian is saying here is indicative of this immense amount of distrust that I feel like everyone has for the world around them right now what's unfortunate for me after this track is that the album it's a pretty major lull starting off with the song wink another track on the album that's pretty out there pretty odd but at the end of the day I feel like this is one of the experiments that could have been left on the cutting room floor I mean it sounds like Julian crooning needlessly over an endless Vampire Weekend demo instrumentally it's super rough do not think the guitar line fits into this track at all the instrumental is super repetitive super tedious you've heard pretty much everything the song has to offer by the halfway point the song finishes like this oddly long fade-out that just kind of brings the song to a fizzled ending while not as awful instrumentally the following two tracks my friend the walls in pink ocean are nearly as tedious thankfully the song black hole kind of flies in toward the back end of the record and breaks up this pattern of monotony with these thumping kick drums and burning fuzzy roaring bass and these guitar Lee that are kind of layered over one another and have a very sour sound of them and the intensity of this track is is just really smothered aggressively by a song just a few tracks down the road which is maybe the most explosive and aggressive song the entire album has to offer the band suddenly tones things down with the pretty powerful closer pointlessness the track just feels like being slowly swallowed in this digital hopelessness occasionally these rays of light shine down through Julian Casablanca says falsetto but they sort of disappear that they're not staying it's oh it's hopeless it's over it's done you know this was just a quality batshit rock album you know and and it's pretty sweet cuz we just had another one with that Jack White Album I felt like Julian and the band were just doing their best to advance the sound of this genre bring other competing ideas and sounds into it while maintaining the rage and the in the wild demeanor that made it so great to begin with this is the kind of blended everything but the kitchen sink experimentation I would just love to hear going forward and there were just a lot of great highlights on this record from front to back now there were a handful of songs that to me felt like the band wasn't pushing it far enough honestly and a few tracks where I felt like they rested a little bit too much on how weird a song sounded for its entertainment value as opposed to just making sure that there's a good song at the core of that track still though even at its worst what the voids are trying to pull off on this record is at least admirable and even though virtue was a bit shorter than its predecessor I still think this thing was a bit bloated like a couple of the paler songs on this thing could have been left on the cutting room floor would have made a tighter more exciting experience but still feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana the voids forever 
O9valpIpGaU,hi everyone you mess with the melon you get a C's here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new weakened ep my dear melancholy the weakened if you didn't already know is this huge gigantic internationally known alternative R&B vision from the mind of singer and songwriter April Tesfaye who began making waves much earlier this decade with a trio of mixtapes that created a ripple effect a sea change in the R&B scene that we are still feeling the the force of today regardless of how I personally feel about a lot of material on these projects did love echoes of silence though did love that but Able's music his commercial releases since then in my opinion have been kind of inconsistent bulky a little all over the place or at least in the case of kiss land super one-dimensional and unaddressed almost kind of sucking out that risk factor in the experimentation of his earlier tapes Beauty behind the madness was just super inconsistent to me but still had some moments and some fantastic singles like can't feel my face love that track and while I didn't really love his latest star boy either I did get the sense on that record that he was taking a lot of risks pulling out all the stops pushing himself outside of his comfort zone trying different musical styles while not every risk on this album goes over well and it is a really bulky and and just bloated album it does come with fantastic songs such as the title track with Daft Punk which brings us to this new EP which at the end of the day I feel like is one of Abel's safest releases since kiss lands pretty much every sound and every song on this record feels to me almost like we've heard abel do it before just this severe sense of deja vu across six tracks twenty or so minutes the song call out my name while it does have some passionate vocal highs it kinda has a vibe and a swing to it similar to that of earned it off of the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack at least to me maybe the instrumentation isn't quite as ritzy but I feel almost as if Abel is kind of painting himself into a corner vocal this track the song try me is is barely even worth acknowledging not just because the try me try me refrain is really obnoxious but also that the post-production the effects on this track leave the song feeling so washed out you could barely even engage with it the song wasted times puts abel over this very fashionable somewhat bougie very european dance beat it's definitely new for him not something we hear him sing over every day but does it do wonders for his style not necessarily the two tracks featuring production from Gustav Holstein I hoped would provide a little bit of a break up between the other tracks maybe just a different direction or something but honestly the they do no such thing I mean the song hurt you which I do like it does kind of have a groovy slow moody nocturnal instrumental behind it it feels almost as if I'm listening to the weekend try to write another song over an instrumental that vibes very similarly to that of the starboy instrumental there are even a few lyrical moments on this track that are some of Abel's worse namely this point in the song where he is singing about not wanting to be between someone's heart but between someone's legs which makes no sense how do you be between someone's heart I mean if you're gonna tell us this story that you've told us a million times over that you're this badboy lothario who loves them and leaves them and you're not romantic and you you come the night and your druggie and you you treat your lovers badly I mean at least try to use some more interesting and sensible language to to describe the tale may be the most lyrically compelling moment on the entire EP is the closing track privilege which while it doesn't have a whole lot of musical structure to it feels kind of like a motif it's one of the shorter cuts on here does give some intimate details of able kind of realizing hey maybe this relationship that I'm in is kind of toxic it's bad for me I got to cut myself out of here or this is just like a negative thing for me to be involved with I've taken two red pills to take away the blues I've come to realize like I'm Khanh how bad this relationship is and I'm gonna fuck the pain away overall in the CP I'm just feeling kind of indifferent toward it I mean this is some of Abel's most uninvent irreal yet however I'm not really reading into that too deeply as far as what he's going to be doing on his next project really what this feels like is just a series of somewhat passable just good enough to want to release tracks that could have fit snugly into any number of records that Abel has released years ago but maybe we're just redundant or not unique enough to sort of throw on to the fire and the reason I feel this way is that these songs don't really do much of anything different and if Abel has set a tone for anything across his entire discography it's that with each record he does make an attempt to challenge himself and push in a different musical territory this EP unfortunately does not do that however I think hardcore weakened fans who sort of just loved his sound the way that it is don't want it to change don't want him to switch things up too much we'll see a lot to like here but for someone like me who's looking for him to maybe do something a little bit more novel or at least like right up to the standards that you've set for yourself in the past because honestly like as far as lyrics as far as the tunes on this thing I feel like he's kind of sold himself short a little bit I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you are the best you are the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well and that's that's gonna be it over here next to

Bkuty1YL_wM,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for the weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst the worst tracks of the week oh oh it's it's it's your boy it's your usual boy who who does these things Anthony Fantino I hope you're doing well alright let's so let's get into it okay okay you know typically we we go into our Amazon and turntable a blinks at this point though here we go Amazon turntable add links they're down there in the description box treat yourselves and let's get into the worst tracks of the week as usual worst ranks of the week that's what we do first we are starting off with this new single pineapple from ty dolla sign featuring gucci mane and quavo excruciating ly like half-assed chorus on this one and it's it really is so obnoxious that it ruins the entire song I feel like ty himself is the least impressive thing about his own track which is really like the worst position to be in when you come out with it with a new kind of promotional single so at least Gucci Mane at the front end of the song was sound and smooth I'll say that much new track from Maddie who you may know as the the keyboard player of bad bad not good he's embarking on some solo material has a new song out called embarrassed it's kind of just a very washed out slow summary just dreamy pop sound that that I don't care too much for I don't know I mean dude dude has hella chops on the keys but this first solo for a foray into solo material at least from what I understand just sounded super generic and just really under written kind of surprised that he didn't go back to the drawing board on this one new church's track never-say-die every album churches come out with like the while their first record had some commendable tracks on it the further they go down the road the more they just sound like a generic electro pop outfit and and this this this new single is essentially peak generic electro pop really just kind of a throwaway track whose lyrics are so tedious and redundant on the chorus it sort of makes you wonder why they didn't try to rewrite the hook given that it's going to be the most important part of the song then kardi be a new track out be careful I don't really know what kind of numbers this new song is doing as of right now but this this track can not cannot possibly do as well as all the huge chart climbing number one hits she's had so far like not only does this track sound under-produced her vocal delivery on it is super underwhelming she almost sounds like she's amateurish on the the track or as if she hasn't been rapping pretty consistently for the past couple of years it's like she's regressed a little bit in terms of her energy and her delivery and her charisma and then on top of it the story in the song which is is probably the most compelling thing about the track isn't even really that interesting I mean the track is all about being heartbroken to being mistreated and kind of a romantic relationship and while I guess I feel for the sentiment of the song cardi B just does not sound as interesting and as hard-hitting and as exciting as she typically does on a track you know maybe that has to do with her trying to go really uh introspective and kind of vulnerable on this song which is a welcome change of pace but still it doesn't help the fact that the track just sounds like it's mixed very low-budget and produced a very low budget just not really the exciting you know hard-hitting sounds that have kind of brought her to where she is today I'm sure there are some hardcore fans are gonna follow her down this road but um I don't know there's just something about her presence on this song that we've something to be desired and I leave it at that and also this new ASAP rocky track featuring block boy JB ASAP rocky progressively sounds worse and worse and worse on his own music I really don't know what it is I could barely make it through the entirety of this song because a saps portion of the track on the front end is so painfully bad that it basically makes the entire song just not listenable I don't know what happened with ASAP Rocky unfortunately I feel like he was almost like given access to maybe like 45 minutes of fame instead of 15 because you know you had that initial tape that was fantastic follow-up commercial record was really good and then all of a sudden it just started going like again every single time the dew drops a new single it's it's just a mess like the tune isn't there his lyrics stink and on this particular track he's like doing these weird warbly auto-tuned vocals that just sound awful yeah dude every new track this guy comes out with total throwaway despite the fact that back in the day like he was just pumping out hits he's had great songs whether he was kind of the genius behind that or somebody else was I don't know but wherever that genius is it's it's not here now it's not on this track let's move on to the tracks I thought were kind of meh not terrible but definitely worth mentioning and shouting out a new bio track why oak track excuse me lifer is probably the most I've enjoyed a song from them in a while the lead vocals are a bit more animated than they typically are on a Y oak song whose sound is typically very Spacey and dreamy I would actually say this is a one of their more lively tracks a very passionate sad moody instrumentation that's that's kind of a little a little thrilling I like to quite a bit it has me like maybe looking forward to the new album like a touch moving on from there this new track from smoke purp and murder beats featuring little yachty and offset it's a banger it's got a lot of slick lyrics on it but it's just two minutes and change there's not a whole lot of structure to it not like a big massive hook to it or anything you know III think these new smoke purp and murder tracks are decent but they don't quite have the rawness of a lot of the tracks on Dead star and that has me a little concerned even if the material has been like okay next Hinds have a new track out titled finally floating you know more fuzzy buzzy a very fun carefree garage pop from the Spanish quartet continuing to dig what they're doing you know might cover the new album when it drops thought this new track from Daryl Hall and John Oates with train was actually not as bad as it could have been kind of brings back those old nostalgic days of the the 70s and 80s when Hall & Oates were just writing some of their best stuff but no I mean it was a cute little single you know it was it was catchy the the vocal work was great the instrumentation was really feel good you know they just kind of have that same you know nothing's really wrong everything's just like a paradise type of vibe that hollow notes used to bring back in the day so it's it's not a bad track I'll say I'll say like there were some moments where they sounded like very aged you know but the tune was there so after that blue and Knotts have a new track out titled yesterday featuring scene and Elsa Lisa Marie and you know it's kind of a very underground somewhat raw and rugged jazzy very lyrical just like two MCS just head to head just spittin non-stop bars back-to-back on a single cut nothing too crazy about it in terms of structure or anything but some of the sampling was actually quite smart the way they worked you know the the melody into the whole yesterday theme and the title of the song I thought was pretty cool and at the gates have probably the best new single out titled a stair bound in stone from their forthcoming record if you're into metal music that's very propulsive very straightforward very in-your-face and quite melodic make sure you check this one out and let's get into the traction I thought were the best ones this week we're blowing through this episode excuse me alright new Tyler the Creator Okura the the track that everybody's like so hype for this week Anthony what do you think of okra okra came out okra Anthony okra okra well one there's this amazing Jamaican vegan spot around the way from where I live and they make some fucking awesome okra I'll say that much but as far as the track Tyler goes into a somewhat unexpected direction on the song I mean he's made hard-hitting tracks before but this track is a legit trap banger but has those kind of quirky buzzy kind of punky qualities that you look for in a Tyler track so and obviously there's that weird piano break in the middle of all of these verses that's a little kind of ominous and sour and awkward which is kind of another one of Tyler's musical calling cards the song is just 2 minutes and change and in in the in the description of the song itself on YouTube Tyler describes the track as a throwaway track so I'm not really sure if this song is going to be indicative of a sound or direction he's gonna be moving in or if this song is gonna be landing on anything I'm I guess right now is most likely not however I feel like the reason even though this is a throwaway track maybe we can just kind of call a non-album track at this point the reason this track is coming out is because Tyler at this point with the success of flower boy behind him has a lot to brag about and that's essentially I guess the entire purpose of the song like you look at the lyrics you look at the visuals in the video the whole thing is just like I'm the fucking best I'm fucking awesome Timothy shall ma come get this bitch like he is just fuckin bragging on another level of course Tyler is written braggadocious bars before you know we know about how many people Tyler has slept with and when they sleep with them and you know how many stairs or floors this house has and so on and so forth we've heard it before but this is just like again it's on another level and on top of it just the flashiness of all the visuals and just like the gold and the clothing and the chains like things that we haven't typically seen Tyler covered himself in and again again I think it's all for the sake of just like flexing so fucking hard on this song and in this music video this is like Tyler's hardest flex ever so you know the song is that substantive it's got some fun bars and I feel like the the way they kind of made me pitched his voice or how he kind of delivered his voice and a somewhat higher register definitely brought the song in interesting kind of quirk and freshness and you know definitely a little different for him it's definitely not you know a throwaway track as far as its quality you know maybe for Tyler it's it's not like worth putting onto a record because it doesn't really tie into anything thematically and it's just kind of a standalone piece where he's just like getting in your face and just showing off just like how well he's doing but still like esse tune in terms of its flow in terms of its energy in terms of its production I thought it was really good so I mean even if he does continue on to a different path into the future thematically I hope he's able to kind of bring at least some of these things into whatever musical direction he's moving into because at the end of the day I did like the vibe of the track a lot moving on from there the lemon twigs fooling around and Taylor made the lemon twigs are a music duo that up until this point I didn't really take too seriously they just sort of sounded like a less interesting Foxen to my ears but like somehow quirkier and sillier like almost like they were like a joke duo or something to an extent but they have a couple new tracks out and this one namely fooling around has this amazing like hardrock classic rock style to it and all those eccentric qualities that I heard in their music prior comes through in a big way but I don't know they're just electrifying they just work time I just push you guys and urge you guys to check the lemon twigs latest stuff out because they are doing some interesting things and I feel like they could potentially be part of a growing trend of artists kind of revisiting a lot of these sounds of rock and glam rock and pop rock from the past but like bringing them back with a certain level of Flair and style next I got a thank accelerator for this one they put on this excellent little techno track from journey deep evolved quite right this track is a banger the the sounds the production on this track are fantastic like this is a fucking awesome like twisted winding little dance piece with a lot of character to it I'll say that there's some good phases to the structure of the song too and don't really have anything else to say other than that it's just like a really great piece of techno moving on from there John Prine has a new record coming out very soon and this song that he's recently dropped from the record guy excuse me god only knows is a pretty quality track it's got uh some nice endearing heartwarming background vocals very rustic but I guess a gently played country and country rock instrumentation it's got a good vibe to it and it's got me looking forward to the new record and I think this might be the last one over here no second-to-last this is the new idk track featuring Joey badass and Russ it's a total banger and it's kind of hilarious that this track would come out around this time not having anything to do with Joey or idk whose performances especially idk s on the first leg of the track are fantastic but Russ follows up the back end of this song which understandably so I've been seeing a lot of people give idk a hard time for this since he released this song but to be fair Russell's performance on the track is actually not bad you know he's almost got you know I got a look for a second just to verify this but there was something about Russ's rapping on the track that just reminded me of almost like that rapper despot you know I don't know if that was like like a I guess conscious influence or anything on the song yeah it seems like Russ's from New Jersey but there was just like something that was so like so New York hip-hop but like late 2000s like earlier this decade you know and still whatever at the end of the day I thought his delivery was really good some of his bars were pretty sharp so I'll just leave it at that it wasn't a bad performance you know he followed up the back end of the track really well and it was pretty ear catching you know at least more ear catching that I'm usually used to hearing him and moving on from there we have this new track from hot dad a track tributing Shania Twain a singer-songwriter Shania Twain and this song is not only just another quality track written in his typical throwback 80s kind of new wave sandbox style but all the lyrics have been lifted from comments or just communicate left on the Shania Twain Facebook page so of course the the lyrics are fucking amazing and and weird as hell too and I will just I'll just I'll just leave it at that I love the song a lot I think it's really great and miraculously some of the lyrics are rather the posts on the Shania Twain Facebook page work really well as as lyrics to songs namely the one that hot dad uses as the title to the track so and that my friends is the weekly track roundup remember once again our Amazon and turntable lab links are down there in the description box and I hope you guys got some good recommendations out of this episode you're the best love you mama mama forever 
05AewlnZfE4,uh-uh hi everyone is Cory Feldman okay here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the self-titled superorganism album superorganism is a london-based music collective with like seven or eight musicians who actually managed to land a hit a viral internet hit before they even met in person that's the future now bands duo's musical projects rap groups everybody's just meeting each other and collabing on the internet what's what it is well even though this phenomenon is relatively new superorganism sound on some of their biggest tracks to me read as being kind of old their music called back to the dense quirky playful instrumentation that used to get tons of attention in the indie scene in the 2000s through artists that kind of sat at a crossroads between pop music and psychedelic music as well as like maybe even electronics and Glitch pop D Intel and the unicorns sweet trip or Fiery Furnaces maybe like anything off of elephant six I could also see fans of Animal Collective and Flaming Lips appreciating what superorganism has to offer maybe I'm going a tad bit too far with the comparisons there but there is something about this band's music that just reads to me as as studied they don't sound like a bunch of kids with no frame of musical or cultural reference just throwing a bunch of at a wall or trying to copy one of their contemporaries so while superorganism sound as kind of a familiar energy to me they do bring more synthetic and punchy or production that I'm used to hearing with this stuff more funky beats insane samples that do so much to color the topics of these songs like motivational speaker Tony Robbins or like vocals from what sounds like a nature documentary water splashing alarm clocks ringing snapping cameras people eating crowds cheering car horns honking just to name a few things I mean the band's music isn't so sample heavy that they're like the books or anything like that but you know it's it's pretty plunder phonic accompanying these samples in the mix are of course all these fat bulgy rumbling synth lines string guitars sweet background vocals trippy effects lots of weird glitchy embellishments and edits there's a lot to this band sound so many of these tracks while they are super catchy super easygoing very poppy are very intricate the most unassuming thing about the band's sound has to be the vocals of their frontwoman or no Noguchi who pretty much sings every track in this semi deadpan very gentle very warm and welcoming vocal delivery it's not too animated it's not too expressive it's not exactly ear grabbing but couched in the incredibly dense and colorful and and vibrant sound of superorganisms instrumentation it works and even though or no isn't a very animated singer she does manage to express a very potent sense of Millenial malaise I'll say that pretty consistently these songs are just an explosion of texture and color which is great I love that about the album but at the end of the day it is the very dreamy endearing Tunes that kind of sells this record the song everybody wants to be famous the sliding guitars and really trippy effects and samples and edits the ear worm hook I could go into all of this stuff all day but really what I like about the track is that it's it's an interesting little statement on vanity and desire for fame in the social media age call it an anthem for internet stardom if you want I also love the very blissful nobody cares which to me almost seems like the antithesis of the track that I just mentioned where it seems almost like a moment of serenity and freedom where you can kind of do whatever you want because nobody's bothering you nobody cares I don't know if maybe this is kind of like a coming-of-age song or an adulthood song but the previous track that I mentioned is all about having people's eyes on you whereas this track is is very much about nobody really being concerned about much of anything you also the crunchy skipping beat the vocal harmonies the laser synthesizers and the twisted manipulated guitar lines bring this track a lot of instrumental color the equally sticky and surreal something for your mind is just pure surreal ear candy it's all good while not may be the best song on the record is a good tone setter on the album for me with all of the songs welcoming and very funny samples the boo me beat and very cheery background vocals and the title track on this album is is kind of like a I don't know like a mission statement for the band this track is pretty much superorganism sound to a tee it's just like lots of funky beats and crazy sonic fireworks flying by in every direction and even though it's very hectic there's a lot of cacophony there are a lot of weird intricate little additions to the song everywhere all over the track it's it's still very catchy and given the tone set by the lyrics kind of silly and tongue-in-cheek too even the song reflections on a screen has grown on me since I've listened to the album again and again and again sure the best coast ish Beach guitars played throughout the track do kind of put a sink in my stomach but still I think the track is really cute you can throw it onto the ever-growing pile of millennial love songs set in the age of the internet where you have basically a longing and emotion being placed on a stage of glowing screens and empty chat boxes my issue with the record though is that it's kind of short it's just 30 minutes and change and it's kind of front-loaded around the middle half of the album it does start to fall apart a little bit the song nice March has a great sense of place especially with its story with its samples but it's it's maybe the most underwritten song on the entire record the song prawn song is almost bordering on novelty it seems almost like too silly for me to take seriously in any way shape or form I appreciate that it's trying to have fun though maybe people will enjoy it more who relate to a lyric about kissing a prawn and getting a cold sore and the song nighttime while it is kind of a catchy funky fun tuned and the album off production-wise it's one of the blander tracks on the record like the instrumentation it's not quite as adventurous and cutting-edge as it is on nearly every other song here overall I thought this album was pretty good enjoyed it a lot certainly a lot more high points than Lowe in the track listing here I just wish it was a bit more consistent and I wish that there was just more still this

2akyCFh6DOg,hi everyone cache the knee checked an oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new preoccupations album new material preoccupations is a Calgary Rock quartet this is their second full-length album since undergoing a politically correct name change in 2016 from what they were formerly known as Vietcong now in this transitional moment the band recorded what I felt was one of the best posts and art punk albums of 2016 a record that in comparison with their older work under the vietcong name was so much more versatile and dynamic not just simply a slightly more experimental and odd take on the Moody and very dark sounds of Joy Division and with this new album new material I was essentially looking forward to another helping of that or even more progression but the lead singles the teaser tracks to this record did leave me kind of concerned mostly because I I didn't really care for them mostly because I found the production and the mixing to be so washed out and kind of horrid the song espionage features these squelchy hollow bass lines grinding away and a mix that feels way too roomy for the lead vocals like they don't feel that supported there's like a very distant snare hi-hat pattern going on in the background but it doesn't provide much in the way of propulsion to the instrumental mostly I feel like the mix on this track is made up of ghostly reverb apparitions as opposed to like tangible instrumentation still at the core of the song it's not a bad tune sort of sounds like a nod to Gang of Four with its driving groove and its call and response vocals I also like the sinister keyboards that pop up on this track and the last leg there are some admirable qualities to this song but they're simultaneously are characteristics that are really just kind of tests the boundaries of my ability to enjoy preoccupations music the song disarray suffers from a similarly cavernous mix to the point where the kind of dreamy post-punk ballad contained within loses its shape still I do find some of the refrains on the song to be kind of haunting disarrayed is and beyond these teaser tracks I'm feeling pretty mixed on the deep cuts as well the song decomposed caught my attention right away with it's cycling very tight groove and drum pattern topped with these sparkling squawking guitar peji OHS that just like they're very sour and soaked in a very bright Sheen not really sure if I care for the syrupy lead and harmonized vocals that topped the instrumental though they kind of moan out and grow very tiresome before the track is even over and feel kind of out of place over the very aggressive rhythm section of the track the song manipulation feels like a heftier more patience testing serving of the vague ly tortured cacophony that the band has been delivering up into this point just kind of feels like a forgettable motif in the middle of the record the song antidote has more meat on its bones it has this cycling very funky but dark groove shouty lead vocals and these hypnotic shimmering synth chords pulsating at a very quick pace but then suddenly the track transitions into this very off-kilter drum pattern with these vocals that are like really deadpan and kind of ominous and creepy it's almost like a goth Punk chant it's very cultish however it grows very tedious before the song reaches the the six-minute mark it's it's almost like the band was trying to dare listeners to finish the track I appreciate the band changed things up and the industrial aesthetic of this portion of the track but the fizzled out ending the fact that this leg of the song doesn't really go anywhere just leaves me cold the two most likeable tracks on the entire record actually came toward the end I'm not talking about the song doubt which in comparison with the other tracks is so washed out and so patience testing it almost reaches a point of parity no I really like the song solace which is probably the album's catchiest track a lot of very groovy angular rhythms and driving bass and sharp guitar leads the song features a smooth transition into a very overwhelming kind of fuzzy saturated hook and despite the deadpan delivery of the vocals the we are the melody I guess you could say of the vocals is pretty catchy and the song compliance the finisher to the record which oddly enough is this experimental rock drone it's hypnotic it's enveloping its sinister you can really swim in the sound of this track sonically it's very pleasing to me but I just find it odd that for a band like preoccupations a song like this becomes a highlight not just kind of a weird experimental way to end the album just to be like at kind of a kind of a gotcha no it actually manages to be a highlight among a batch of incredibly lackluster songs and instrumentals as much as I've admired and enjoyed preoccupations material up until this point there was just something really off with this album there was something off with the song writing something off with the production for me it was just their most lackluster release yet and I really don't know what to say about it aside from that I'm feeling a light too decent 5 on this thing pretty indifferent on it transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

P32evYxRvTA,hey everyone Noam Chomsky here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Prime album prime to prime is a hip hop duo consisting of two pretty legendary artists I'm talking about producer and DJ DJ premier who has helped soundtracks some of raps greatest voices over the years jay-z NAS of course he was one half of Gang Starr boogie down productions you know Karis one mop deep biggie just to name a very select few and Royce to 5/9 who has been known through his multiple solo records as well as one-fourth of slaughterhouse as one of the best lyricist the Midwest has to offer now prime formed in 2014 to a lot of fanfare they had a pretty big record with a lot of great features on it a lot of hip-hop heads both young and old seem to take to the album I personally wasn't really stopped in my tracks by it I found releases from bus driver and open mike eagle and run the jewels and Freddie Gibbs an ad-lib to just be way more compelling and interesting exciting the album while it was commendable I thought sounded a lot like just some old heads trying to stay contemporary and updated there wasn't that much material on it either I just thought it was maybe kind of a one-off thing that I don't know what wasn't gonna continue past this point but whoa prime is actually back it's actually like still a thing and I thought well at this point let's just let's just do it let's give it a shot they're obviously not giving it up let's see what they have to offer now that it's another release maybe it's a little bit more well oiled and interesting a few things are for sure on this project one there's definitely more material just under an hour of music on this thing a lot of decent features ranging from Big KRIT to Rhapsody to yellow wolf and it's definitely a more versatile project you can really tell that primo and Royce were trying to make a lot of different tracks that came at a lot of different angles instrumentally the album really is all over the place and I mean that in the best way possible this record really kind of showcases just how fantastic and talented dynamic primo is as a producer I mean I guess if anything is the selling point of this album it's just how much ability primo has to adopt and succeed in a lot of different hip-hop and a lot of different instrumental styles however there were some glaring flaws for me on this project that kind of kept me back from loving it even though I find a great deal of this album to be commendable one I find the record kind of bloated like it did not need this many tracks and maybe the reason I feel that way is there's quite a bit material on this thing that I find kind of underwhelming or just to be sort of redundant because Royce I respect him as a lyricist I mean I've been conscious of him since I was a young little Slim Shady fan and and loved his contributions to bad meets evil outside of a good handful of tracks on here much of what he delivers on this album is just general slick braggadocio which I guess is fine if the wordplay you're dealing with is like super high-grade you're just dropping one fricking quotable after another but that's that's not necessarily the case here as there are multiple tracks on this thing they're just kind of breezed by without so much as a like a memorable moment I'll say sunflower seeds is one probably made man is another but when Royce and primo do hit an aggressive peak it can be pretty exciting I mean at least there are tracks on here like one of the hardest which is most likely the this album's aggression fever pitch and there are other tracks on here that conceptually narrative lis are super smart super compelling black history is one of them where Royce kind of goes through the backstory of not only himself but primo talking about his early years with Gang Starr and just kind of bringing that together as both of their contributions to the music game and the track with Rhapsody on here is one of the best conceptual relationship hip hop songs I've heard in a while just pretty much these two people tied up in a relationship where they're both unhappy they're just at each other's throats and the aggression and the frustration coming from both sides of the aisle on this song it's just you can really feel it a lot of Royce's rhymes on every day struggle are pretty great too directly referencing the infamous show on complex referencing joke button pretty much the hip-hop game in its current state without warning with Yelawolf is a pretty great moment too but you know again there are just a lot of spots on this album that to me come off super mild a lot of weak hooks one on here where he describes an interpolation of that ended up being pretty weak a song in here with Dave East where it's it's literally a track about being born in the wrong generation which is not exactly the I don't know the the the tone one might want to strike in 2018 you know there's a handful of great tracks on this thing great verses and fantastic beats it's just that this album to me it just didn't have much in the way of long game Royce is gonna need to be as consistently interesting and fantastic as primo is on this record if they're ever going to put out an album of this length and it's just fire from front to back while Royce always bring some good flows on tracks and there are some pretty substance of songs on this record especially toward the back and a lot of cuts on here especially the more in-your-face songs that are a little bit more slick-talking and macho the the substance there I feel like I could get almost anywhere sure is it a slightly higher lyrical quality than that of you know your average SoundCloud rapper yeah but outside of that there's not a whole lot to praise it on I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't die and hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another review you can check out there is

GyXofB1k24A,Hey hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jack white album boarding house reach songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer formerly one half of the White Stripes mr. Jack white out with a brand new commercial album his third commercial solo album and I use the word commercial very loosely here because there's not much about this album that is that is very commercial this is maybe Jack White's most unmarketable album yet to the point where I'm not quite sure what to make of some of this record but simultaneously I can't help but be in awe of just how off the deep-end Jack White is on this album I'm so happy I am so so happy that he has broken the cycle of writing coffee house Rock of writing tote bag rock on his past two records blunderbuss and Lazaretto both of which are decent albums I think they're decent albums they're listenable they're fine but are they as top-notch as previous material from the White Stripes are they as exciting are they cutting edge and both records to me at the end of the day just kind of felt like mild exercises in blues rock and garage rock revivalism with kind of a singer/songwriter flair boarding house reached though by comparison is much more experimental but somehow more aggressive and more hard-hitting as well to the point where I think a lot of Jack White's hardcore listeners might react to this album somewhat negatively because it is kind of a kooky album and goes against the consistency Jack White has delivered over the years because boarding house reach not only explores the hard rock and the blues rock and the garage rock that Jack white is known for but also elements of funk and electronic music and art an experimental rock some of the production on this thing is kind of glitchy and noisy and very abrasive they're elements where I feel like he's he's throwing in these little interstitial instrumental bits some of which may be original some of which may be sampled and it sort of sounds like he's pulling together some kind of maximalist hip hop beat where he's constantly just throwing samples in your face or different musical bits a lot of the production on this thing is very intricate very complex and kind of a psychedelic surreal it's almost like on this album Jack is rebelling against himself against everything he's sort of built his name on up until this point away which to me is something that definitely comes through on the opening track to this record connected by love a song that originally I hated I hated this song when I first heard it I was convinced this was like Jack White's worst song period the song is backed with this really stiff instrumental this cycling roaring buzzing synthetic bass line a very simple slow kick drum pattern swinging hypnotically against these skittering weird percussive bits kind of panning from the left to the right channel but Jack White's vocal performance is what ended up kind of winning me over on this song because not only do his lyrics on this track have these subtle nods to technology with him being connected to this person by love but also there's this amazingly nervous tension in his vocal performance that is pretty incredible there are many points on the song where it just sounds like Jack White is ready to pop that and the swelling wall of instrumentation on the chorus are truly what really kind of makes the song fulfilling and interesting also the aesthetics of the song are kind of at war with themselves with Jack's voice the rock instrumentation the electronic bits also these weird chirpy background singers definitely some of the weirdest background singers I've heard on a jack white track ever again even though I was feeling very negatively toward this song when I first listened to it it has grown on me to be one of his boldest ballads yet and there are a handful of other tracks that kind of are a bit of an aesthetic and anachronistic clash of electronic and acoustic instrumentation the song why walk a dog has the sequence drums in three it's it's kind of like a very stiff electro blues tune but it's very dark it's very downtrodden it's very depressed features these watery serene kind of trippy synthesizers that they kind of have a bit of an organ tone to them the buzzing synth bass on this track is kind of intense too and Jack White's vocal performance is so dark and the lyrics to me just kind of feels like he's detailing a relationship but not necessarily a romantic one one where he is being treated as the lesser as like a commercial product really what I think he's trying to describe on this track is just being used being viewed as like just an object which might be in line with a few moments on this album where it seems like jack is kind of commenting on creativity and commercialism and the commodification of art and music honestly the only issue I have with the song is I wish it was longer I just love the the sound of the track I love the loud gargantuan mutant guitar solo of which there are many on this record like there are a lot of guitar solos that are just like fuzzed and burned out and glitched out and just like freaky as hell there's also on the back end of the record a country tinged ballad performed in close vocal harmony on the song what's done is done it kind of reminds me in a way of a lot of tracks off of the new Justin Timberlake record where you have this melding of vocals some folk instrumentation some synthetic drums however in this instance it doesn't sound like total crap no it actually sounds good like the way that the electronics balance out with the acoustic instrumentation is tasteful the vocals sound great and the tune is really dark and compelling too but really where this album is at its best for me are on these exciting fusions of rock and electronic music and funk songs like corporation which to me reads almost like a lick or a groove out of an old meters song the groove on the song is hard it's nasty the drums are exciting it's just it's just pure experimental fun on this track with all these you know weird little shouty refrains with Jack White making these proclamations about wanting to start a corporation and that's how these days you get any adulation again this track bringing back the themes of commercialism and corporatism and greed the track hyper me so phony AK which I might be mispronouncing is another funky experimental cut on the record although it may be it's the one moment where I feel like Jack really truly goes overboard with the ascending and descending like clicking and cycling synthesized that are mixed so hard they're just like completely in the right channel they're just kind of blue throughout the entirety of the track with almost no change whatsoever the rest of the mix is packed with like these flashy jazzy saloon pianos loud roaring guitars booming drums these really twisted vocal manipulations so when like a background vocal pops into the mix sometimes it'll be at a normal pitch sometimes it'll sound like it's melting before your ears it's a little difficult to listen to you for me even now but still and I'm kind of in awe of just how cacophonous the track is the song Ice Station zebra is just as bold just as funky but there's a lot more organization and harmony to the instrumentation the instrumental on this song is really just too intricate and insane for me to even begin to start describing but really what kind of cells this song for me our Jack White's shouty pretty much wrapped vocals on the song which after listening to it multiple times it just kind of hit me this is so bec like Jack was just listening to odelay Arabic mellow gold Arabic and and this was just like could have possibly been an inspiration for this his lyrics on the track or absurdists they're silly they're kind of tongue-in-cheek at points but there are a lot of moments where it seems like he's making reference to creativity the creative process saying that all people who are making something or copying God and then there's the very explosive over and over and over over and over when Emma no ma'am killer groove killer productions super fuzzy freaky guitars on this thing this was one of the tracks that I heard prior to the release of the album that got me thinking well you know actually this this could be a great album this could potentially be good and and maybe Jack White experimenting with more groovy instrumentation and more electronics might might be a good thing might be a good thing and I got to tell you with the rest of this album growing on me this song has just like become so fantastic to me the sound play is just top-notch on this track and Jack works in so many interesting little instrumental bits just in between the grooves or different passages and sections of the song again kind of reminds me of like a hip hop beador an old-school hip-hop instrumental where all of a sudden a DJ would just like throw a drum break or a horn break or something into a track just to change things up or provide a different sound or tone or vibe and the song respect commanders is separated into two distinct parts the introductory moment of the track feels like a rock band trying to recreate the the days of like 80s electro funk with these speedy like clockwork drum beats these old-school gargantuan synth hits whoo whoo the production is kind of trippy and psychedelic too it feels like again a rock band trying to recreate like a in Afrika Bambaataa instrumental and then all of a sudden we transition into this slow heavy just foreboding hardrock music where Jack White is singing about respecting a woman and she's basically at her command it kind of kind of makes a the idea of respecting the fair sex seemed like kind of dark and kinky then there are some really odd spoken-word moments on the record like getting the mind shaft which feels like like something pulled straight out of The Flaming Lips playbook later the track transitions into this really funky psychedelia with talkbox vocals and very playful grooves as colorful as it all is it's still pretty abrasive and weird and there are a handful of kind of short somewhat gimmicky interstitial tracks that bring the album from one section to the next the song everything you've ever learned sounds like a commercial for a dystopian future with Jack white in a very kind of eerie announcer voice talking about oh this is a advertisement for everything you've ever learned the song Esmeralda steals the show is this really odd story song set to acoustic guitar it's like a poetic story and Jack white is kind of performing the song and two different voices and two different vocal styles in each channel kind of reminds me of The Velvet Underground a little bit and the fourth track of the record which I'm not even going to try to pronounce please just show the title of that thank you very much is a little poetic bit performed by CW Stoneking it's very dramatic it's very theatrical almost feels like he's performing in character on the song the poetry is set to this really dramatic violin music that sort of sounds like it's from the Eastern Bloc and the finishing track of the album is maybe the one spot on the record that kind of let me down a little bit it feels like kind of a forgettable moment even though I do kind of like the jazzy smooth lullaby ish change of pace of the instrumentation the melody and obviously this is reference in the title of the song itself is a play on a Dvorak song I'm terrible when it comes to classical music to just just leave me alone but still like I'm super impressed with this record I did not think I was gonna like it at all but honestly I've expected way more of Jack White than he's actually been delivering since he went solo four years four years given just how eccentric he is and how left-field he portrays himself to be I feel like this is the kind of thing we should have been hearing almost all along this record is such a creative display of texture and sound and color and Composition it's an aesthetic rush it's incredibly dynamic it's challenging and it's overwhelming and yet it's very methodically composed like you can definitely digest it but it hits you with a lot but at the end of the day Jack clearly wanted to come through with a focused and a catchy and a coherent album so you know I just love controlled creative chaos and and that's what this album is to me I like a lot of the lyrical and conceptual themes that kind of reveal themselves as I listen to the album again and again I feel like this record really works in layers there are so many amazing details I can come back to and pick up as I listen to the album again and again and again and in a lot of ways I feel like Jack is making a record that is truly reflective of the over saturation of the information age and simultaneously rebelling against modern rock orthodoxy and for me this album is also proof that whether or not rock music is refreshing or is pushing the envelope is dependent wholly on whether or not the artist is willing to take it there all right I'm going to leave it at that love this record great record fantastic record feeling a decent too strong 9 on this album transition did you give this album a listen did you love it did you hate

AhVPv5q9Ik8,"Hey everyone, Anthony Fantano here, 'The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd' and it's time for a review of the new Mount Eerie album, 'Now Only'. This is singer/songwriter Phil Elverum's latest musical transmission under the 'Mount Eerie' name, and Phil, if you're unfamiliar with him, in my opinion, is one of indie-folk's and low-fi music's most creative musicians, creative producers, not only when you take into account the fantastic albums he came out with under the 'Mount Eerie' name but also 'The Microphones', 'The Globe Part 2', 'Lost Wisdom', 'No Flashlight', 'It Was Hot, We Stayed in Water' and also last year's incredibly devastating 'A Crow Looked at Me', in my opinion, one of the best records of last year while also being one of the most emotionally traumatising as the album is a deep dive into the excruciating details of Phil's life around the time his wife passed away of cancer. Singing about her sickness, her passing, therapy, single fatherhood also wrestling with the feelings of grief, shock, denial, etc. This next album now only deals in a lot of the same themes, feelings, experiences, but is decidedly different stylistically the instrumentation on this album isn't quite as stark, isn't quite as low-key. The writing and structuring of these tracks is not quite as direct or pointed either, there are quite a few long and very winding songs on this record with some kind of meandering narratives, it's almost like Phil is writing a letter or a postcard just off of the top of his head to a loved one or, I guess, generally his audience. Of everything that's been happening to him, even down to the minor details since we last heard from him and honestly, it's all got a little bit, just a little bit of a Mark Kozelek, Sun Kil moon vibe to it. It's an interesting influence to hear pop up in Phil's music, as well as other records too, it seems like this long, rambly, uh, very off-the-cuff songwriting style that Mark has popularized this decade has been adopted by quite a few artists that I like. This album is 44 minutes features a handful of tracks that range from five to about 10 minutes. Some of the moments on this record are really emotionally compelling and heart-wrenching. Very straightforward in their storytelling like the track Tintin in Tibet which is a minor reference within the story itself contained in the song where Phil is essentially singing about being younger, having met his wife, living in a moment in their relationship where they were just deeply in love, finding out about one another and then juxtaposing that against moments in their relationship when she was sick and their time together was coming to a close. It's a really hard-hitting moment on the album, it's a strong sentiment to start the record off with and it's painfully clear that Phil is still kind of suffering through the agony of his feelings around this and understandably so. But it seems, at least to me, that when Phil switches over to tracks like 'Distortion' that are a little bit longer in their run-time and a little bit more rambly, a little bit more dishevelled he is no longer playing to his strengths as a songwriter or maybe this is just something that he needs to feel out a little bit more in order to make a more compelling track because while a lot of the same themes of emotional pain and loneliness and even a bit of a narrative moment where Phil is talking about being younger and having a pregnancy scare. Even though this is all very familiar given what he's been singing about lately, it's all kind of inconclusive and doesn't add up to too much. It's an OK listen at the end of the day but I feel roughly the same way about the 'Two Paintings by Nikolai Astrup', track the second longest song on the album later in the tracklist. I love and am enchanted by Phil's music a majority of the time, but do I find him to be so gripping a storyteller, to have so strong a delivery that he can just throw any minor detail out there and it just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat in a song? Not necessarily, although I understand why at this point in his life he would kind of be obsessing over every minor detail as it does add to some incredibly cutting moments on this album especially on the closer where he is singing about his daughter wanting to hear Mommie's record, a record with her mother on it as she was a musician as well, a recording artist and this leads Phil to a point where they're listening to the album and he is sobbing in the middle of eating breakfast, something that personally I can't even begin to imagine dealing with. The title track on this record is one of the more succinct ones in the track listing it has a purposefully sweet and very melodic chorus that kind of talks about death and dying in a somewhat flippant manner about people getting cancer and dying getting hit by trucks and dying, but I feel like this is all a very admirable attempt by Phil to make a statement on just generally the callousness that a lot of people have toward death or just being so absorbed in their own issues that it's not really something they think about when other people may be going through it. As we see Phil filing through a hospital setting, as we see him filing through a setting where he's at a music festival and he has to play these, what he describes as 'death songs' for 'kids on drugs'. And then there is the maybe most haunting and morbid track on the entire record, 'Earth', which not only has a pretty interesting 'Wolves in the Throne Room' reference but is also a song where Phil is literally dealing with the transformation of his significant other from a living breathing human being to cremated ashes, remains. The instrumental on this track might not seem like much more than just some droney keys and guitars, occasionally a sort of wild, loud, distorted indie rock passage but it serves as a pretty great backdrop for his attempt to kind of process this, because it's really just kind of intense with how directly he stares into this abyss of death in his art, uh, especially as of late to the point where I find his music to be enjoyable and bold and brave and unique but also concerning too, which I guess that that's been my attitude since the last album as well, I mean I love Phil's music, I think he's a great artist but still I hope he's doing better, I hope he's healing, I hope he's okay. To me this album is a bunch of very good 'Crow' afterthoughts, sort of like an epilogue of sorts in a way. I liked it quite a bit, as a fan I like that he took some compositional risks on this record too, but it's maybe not an album I would recommend to a newcomer as it correlates directly with the last record which one probably should listen to first and isn't necessarily one of his most accessible. I'm feeling a decent 7 on this one transition, have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best, you're the best.

weekly track roundup bam bam all right ahem ahem ahem let me clear my throat all right our Amazon and turntable lab links are also down there in the description box if you feel free to hit those up treat yourself and here are the worst tracks of the week oh my god here they come oh boy oh gosh ok one track mind new track from 30 Seconds to Mars featuring ASAP Rocky a really awful terrible washed out modern pop slash rock song are they even a rock band at this point and nothing in the instrumental sounded vaguely like a rock song it just sounded like overly Moody super atmospheric awful tasteless crappy trashy like millennial depressed pop so I don't know there's there's really nothing about it that sounded good just sounded like generic sad pap so let's move on to something else sadly did not enjoy the new preoccupation single at all this new track being titled disarray honestly almost everything I've been hearing since the release of their last album which I enjoyed quite a bit it just kind of sounds like really I don't know bland a way to Reaver be generic post-punk this doesn't even sound vaguely experimental or interesting or jagged and the way the group's past material has under different names as well knew Kacey Musgraves track that many of you probably know Casey as a country artist but she has essentially tried her hand here at like writing a little disco pop and yeah God is it dime a dozen and forgettable and just so non important it's it's it's pretty forgettable I'll say that and this group that's been making some waves recently at dmas group from Down Under I believe who have a bit of an old-school Britpop sound problem being that that sound is incredibly tired at this point and they bring absolutely nothing to the table in terms of like hey here's a different sound or a little bit of a I don't know an experimental edge in it or this is what makes us sound different than every other group that popularized that sound during the 90s literally nothing they literally nothing it's pretty much 100 percent in exercise in nostalgia this song being titled for now and I don't know if you're a Brit pop addict then maybe give it a shot but don't be surprised if you find nothing distinct about it at all so those are the worst tracks of the week let's get into the songs that I felt we're okay it wasn't crazy about him but certainly wanted to shout him out you guys might dig him a little bit more than me this new track from a new sign Eon Sub Pop Records you know I believe is how this person's name is pronounced given that I have a segment on the channel called why you know review but I have an urge to say why you know but of course that's that's probably not how this artists name is said but you know the track is titled no going back and even though this track came out in in March it is pure blissful summary indie pop and and not really in a kind of a cheap awful way that there are some quirky bits there sort of characteristics of the instrumental the voice is very high-pitched and again summery bright shimmering I guess the the the word I'm looking for is orgasmically heavenly I'll just kind of leave it at that again pure summary indie pop there and it's not a bad track you know I prefer things a little bit edgy a year but it's it's a pretty sweet tune moving on from there new unknown Mortal orchestra track everyone acts crazy nowadays and unfortunately a lot of what I've been hearing from this forthcoming record is uh while it is funky and in psychedelic it's very kind of faint and super low-key and I'm just not really being hooked in by it maybe it's something that's gonna Wow me when I hear the entire record but so far the this new crop of tracks from um oh is just coming off really really mild and not in the best way moving on from there you might have caught lately that a series of covers have been dropping in celebration of Elton John like a new covers project that's going to be releasing very soon and this latest one with q-tip featuring Demi Lovato is not too bad sure it's a little over produce a little clean whatever but it's catchy it's sweet and it's a nice revision of the track don't go breaking my heart moving on from there we have let's eat grandma a new up-and-coming kind of experimental and art pop duo the instrumental on this one is kind of intricate it's really overblown in some ways but I do dig the vocals on it quite a bit it's a got kind of an eccentric angle to it it's very rich I guess I'll just put it that way maybe too rich in some respects but as far as the instrumentation the layers the melodies it's it's very rich it's very colorful next this new track from freakin Ice Age forthcoming record I really don't have any clue as to what they would drop this track out of the blue because it's it's not much of a single it's not much of a teaser track just kind of seems like a very low-key one-off deep cut type song that might work is like I don't know an interlude in between two more exciting cuts just kind of seems like a non-starter of a ballad and it's got nowhere near as much bite in terms of instrumentation or performances every other song has been dropped so far I mean it's not terrible it's listenable but it's it's not really attractive as a as a teaser cut in my opinion moving on from there a little pump has dropped a new gucci gang remix with everyone in there mom on it 21 savage bad bunny like you could see the cover over here everybody is on this freaking song Gucci Mane's on the track everybody is on this remix it's eight minutes long while it's cool that this happened I don't know if I ever really needed eight minutes of gucci gang in my life I do like the track I thought it was gonna be a hit when I first heard it didn't know why it wasn't a hit already and I still enjoy a little pump but again eight minutes of gucci gang it's it's a little excessive it's a little excessive but hey everybody does their thing everybody does their thing on the track so moving on from there christian fitness has a new song out christian fitness of falco formerly the future of the left mcklusky you know if you're a noise rock fan post hardcore fan you probably know i'm talking about over here he has a new record coming out very soon apparently this track fan base only song is the opening cut of the record it's a little short but it hits hard it's got some very cheeky fun lead we'll give it a shot give it a shot and the production on Christian Fitness I will say is is improving it's it's been a little rough in the past but I it's it's it's getting better moving on to the best tracks of the week the first one that I want to mention here is a song that blew my mind pretty early in the week of the Zilla cami so Smule uh Thrax i don't know who these boys are I've never heard of them before never heard of any of these guys look at their social media and everything seems like you know the the the the following is relatively underground so far they're yet to hit the mainstream but they had this new track out on WorldStarHipHop and it's the most off the fucking wall thing I've heard all week it's like the most crazy aggressive just like in-your-face trap music taking it back to like some early 6:9 stuff to Skaar Lord that sort of thing you know it's it's almost like trap musics answer to new metal yeah sure in some respects it's a little overdone so bombastic it's a little corny but hey it hits hard it's exciting it's like like it's it's it really is over the top it really is blood pumping so and I kind of love that about it and I don't know hopefully they keep the the bangers coming moving on from there shoutout to tabby fellow youtuber music reviewer music reactor he has a new remix of the track dust cap from little yachties latest project little boat to which all y'all are under rating you are under rating little boat to okay I've been getting shit for two weeks now Anthony you suck little boat to sucks it's not that good you're under rating it you're under rating it and ASCAP is one of the best songs on it and tabi obviously saw some potential there did a sweet little remix obviously he is a more technical rapper a little yachty right off the intro to the song all the way through so you know expect that and he's got you know an eccentric little delivery to shout out to tabby he's a nice boy he's a nice boy I hear he good table manners so if that's not a good reason to listen to a rapper I don't know what is alright moving on from there Royce to 5/9 has a new track a new single out featuring J Cole Bob Lowe boat it's a little bit of a dark nostalgic track kind of going back into both artists past and it's it's just kind of like a the series of sad depressing very telling confessional memories good smooth jazz jazzy instrumental and just quality song all around these two it's have these two collaborated before on a track because honestly if they haven't it's uh it's long overdue and I'm glad it came out good so give this track a shot next Rico nasty trust issues this tracks above a banger oh god it's a banger oh I like it so much oh it's such a nice banger Rico nasty if you didn't know as far as like this new wave of very aggressive underground rap artists Koshi is one of the most wild and aggressive and just actually got like just she's just I know I keep saying this lately but she's off the wall she's off the frickin wall she's in the red and she just got a lot of personality just bursting through through the mic through this music video as well if the song is attached to make sure to give it a listen it's a good song it's catchy it's not deep or anything but no she's got some got some fun bars on there a few more tracks left I think we have this new track from Flatbush zombies vacation in hell new record coming out very soon this new song you and I featuring dia or daya hope I'm not pronouncing that correctly is an incredible little single not gonna spoil too much about it but production is great vocal chemistry between these guys fantastic it definitely has my mouth watering more than anything that was on their last commercial record I don't know what it was exactly about that album where it sort of seemed like there was a bit of a rough transition between doing a commercial project and their mixtapes before were more superior were more superior in my opinion however this new track over here seems like that rar and more intricate Flatbush zombies that we've known in the mixtape era sort of coming to commercial fruition so I'm kind of excited about that loving the track it's a good one next Czar faced an MF DOOM they have a new collaborative record coming out very soon this new track over here titled bomb throne is excellent great production duman's our face do their thing why am I so coughed up over here why I have so much fun my throat oh it's good it's good it's good it's good moving on from there a producer who I caught over at tiny mixtapes thank you very much for that has a new track out coming on a various artists compilation on his jazz record label it's not his label but the label that he is on the name of this guy is botany and to ledger is the name of this track it's got some pretty fun samples it's a danceable song it's got some driving kick drums and a funky beat and just all-around some very solid creative production that has caught my ear and now I'm just gonna be I'm gonna be on the lookout for this guy because it seems like he's got some good stuff going and make sure once you get more info about this check out that various artists comp too because who knows this could be the the tip of the iceberg for the record label maybe they got some more creative stuff on there and oh I got a shot at shadow block boy black boy JB for this revision of the song Rover Rover 2.0 featuring 21 savage doesn't seem like too much instrumentally but block boy and 21 savage are just animalistic on the track I guess a block boy is 21 savages you know more is cold-blooded style but it works they kind of complement each other well because they just have separate energy levels and vibes you know 21 savage for me he's a great feature you know he's he brings in a totally different vibe and tone than most other rappers and artists and again super dark super cold blooded Minea while to get acclimated to a song when it's just him but when you have somebody who is that block boys energy level coming through and just providing some counterpoint to that it does provide a good balance so excuse me what was before a song that didn't really stop me in my tracks didn't really feel like much now has like some tighter flashy er I guess kind of rhythmic fills and again that 21 savage feature I think adds a lot so it's a nice little revision remix 2.0 and that's it for the weekly track roundup guys all of those tracks all of those songs are linked down there in the description box check those out check those out but along with again the link to download the geek app more information on that in the description box and again promo code drop $20 off you're the

L4LIeT2rxCg,"Guys, come on. This Wendy's mixtape... It's NOT GOOD. So, the fast food chain Wendy's dropped a five track, 10-minute EP of songs, and I guess it's... being marketed as a mixtape. If you remember not too long ago, Hamburger Helper did something a lot like this, but put out like a crazy collection of five or six tracks or so, and they were they were really off-the-wall. Like, a lot of cartoony, weird fricking trap tracks like they were legitimately, uhh... wild and experimental at a few points, but mostly it just felt like a bunch of novelty throwaway trap. I'll most likely never listen to it again, but at least it was entertaining while it was on. This Wendy's EP though, I could appreciate a few things about it. I do like the cute cover art that is a very clear reference to Notorious B.I.G's ""Ready to Die"", and I like that it being a ""Wendy's mixtape"", and ""Wendy's"" is a woman's name, they got a female rapper across the entire EP. But beyond that, there's nothing really good about this EP. Every single beat is generic trash. Just sort of sounds like somebody in marketing was going into YouTube, saying... Uhhh, such-and-such type beat! Drake type beat! Metro Boomin type beat! And this person rapping on every single track here, I don't know who it is. She kinda just sounds like a dollar store Jean Grey. Super uninteresting vocal inflections and flows, she's very OneNote. Clearly not giving her all here, and why would you? They're songs about a fast-food restaurant ""beefing"" with other fast-food restaurants. There are a lot of funny little bits of wordplay about meat, and serving people, and customers and so on and so forth. There's nothing interesting about it. It's literally a 10 minute commercial! You're just subjecting yourself to a 10 minute advertisement. Did you sit through the advertisement that played before this review? No, of course you didn't! You skipped it However, you're sitting here through this 10-minute long song advertisement for Wendy's?! *weird noises* This is gonna be fucking hilarious. When trap is just completely out of style, and just like 15 or 20 years down the road, we look back on the bad novelty commercial music that came out across our generation. This will certainly be a highlight. I don't get how anybody's listening to this and not sorta thinking in their head, like that Steve Buscemi .gif where he's like, you know, dressed like a cool kid, and he's walking, and he's like ""Hey, fellow children! Here's my trap mixtape! Aren't I cool? Aren't I connected with the youth? A real, cool, hip, young, fast-food corporation?! This is shit. This is dumb. This is stupid! It's... and above all else, it's not good. Have you given this EP a listen? I hope not. Uhh... over here, next to my head, is something that's better, probably way better. And, uhh...hit that where the link to subscribe to the channel, or the link where you get a reminder. The bell, because apparently YouTube doesn't put videos in the subscription boxes of everybody.

iXiIx4DKKbs,hi everyone cool today cool tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sumac n kg hi no album American dollar bill you keep pacing sideways you're too hideous to look at face on this is a new collaborative album featuring two names in the worlds of heavy and experimental music one sumac contemporary sludge metal band spearheaded by guitarist songwriter Aaron Turner of Isis old man gloom gray Machine Fame and then you also have catchy Heino prolific Japanese experimental music artist I don't really know what made these two worlds collide honestly but seeing them come together was truly enough to pique my interest personally I've never been a super-huge Isis and Aaron Turner guy though I have you know shown my respect to the band before they are a good band I get why they have fans I get the appeal it just hasn't really appealed to me personally and sumac every album so far has just been kind of man to me but still seeing them come together with an artist like hi no to me says whoa this could be a moment that really kind of adds the eccentric weird elements to their music that I kind of always wished were there and in a way that's kind of what this record brings I mean this album is over an hour of heavy noisy abrasive freewheeling improvisational noise metal the album here features five tracks whose song titles are about as difficult to digest as the music itself for example we have parts 1 & 2 of what have I done I was reeling in something white and I became able to do anything I made a whole imprisoned time within it created friction stopped listening to warnings ceased fixing my errors made the impossible possible turned sadness into joy I don't I don't know there's also parts 1 & 2 of I'm over 137 percent a love junkie and it's still not enough the pieces on this album they're winding they're tense their explosive sometimes feeling a little disjointed disconnected kind of obtuse all over this record there's this really dramatic drum playing which is kind of exploring the space between these seemingly improvised guitar passages hi know also provides these really aggressive strange vocal freak-outs a lot of it's pretty harrowing a lot of it's pretty massive bone-crushing riffs and and noise and distortion but despite a lot of this record feeling at least a little off-the-cuff there is a surprising amount of chemistry between the band and hi know here sumac really seems to provide a lot of the rhythmic and sonic muscle on the record that kind of allows Heino to color on top of that with his voice and just some really angular strange guitar work now while I enjoy this record a lot and I think it's great I like the performances I like how rod is and it's certainly the most interesting thing I think either these artists have been affiliated with in a long time but I guess the novelty of this record did wear off on me a little bit as I came back to it for repeated listens because it's it's not quite as experimental and it's not quite as an orthodox as maybe I would have liked because there's certainly a lot of similarities one could draw two other artists from this record that are on the noisier side of things bands like Indian or swans or Boris though I guess it is kind of interesting to hear a singular piece of music that can draw those kinds of comparisons and while I do think sumac and hi knows strike a good balance between just very spacious tense patience testing passages and more visceral moments on the album the more I listen to it the more I really wanted from it more versatility more experimentation more sonic adventure more compositional risks more intense highs as well because after a while some of the noisier and more long-winded spots on the album might just kind of grew numb to them I'm not trying to knock this album though it's still easily one of the better experimental rock releases you're gonna hear this year and if you are on the weirder side of the spectrum when it comes to rock music if that's kind of where you like to hang out you do not want this to slip by you I promise you I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're full of thoughts okay Anthony fan ten oh another video over here next to my head that might be of interest to you also the link to subscribe to the channel forever 
h4d-M5jbx8Q,haha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new neighbourhood album it's its self-titled these guys were a California pop outfits their third full-length album spearheaded by frontman and songwriter jesse rutherford the group has been popping for a number of years now with a lot of incredibly viral internet singles daddy issues blue flowers some of the teaser tracks to this new album have been doing the rounds on YouTube as well previously the neighborhood's music didn't really stop me in my tracks it felt kind of run-of-the-mill mostly it was just very shiny primped indie rock and pop with lots of lyrics about love interests some very moody atmospheres as well but despite how heartbroken and how dark some of the music might have felt I always found their stuff kind of safe kind of bland very average with a lot of colorless keyboards and boring lead vocals lifeless beats and very ethereal toothless guitars that kind of serve as a reminder of the guitars plummeting cultural stock even on some of the neighborhood's most compelling tracks like r.i.p to my youth you're just kind of getting slightly above average singing some very subpar mixing as well I mean yeah sure some of the lyrics on this tracker kind of sad kind of cutting but the song is just pretty much wrapped in this vague malaise that doesn't really add up too much honestly I'm more sad when I run over a squirrel by accident in my car which is a legit sad thing you should not be killing living things if you can keep yourself from doing so go vegan the neighborhood's latest record sees their sound getting diversified a little but they're not just simply a moody indie rock and pop band anymore now the band's high gloss finish comes with elements of electro and synth pop as well as a splash of R&B hanging in the air too but damn this this does not sound any more interesting what is this album is it m83 recording bland or music under another name so he can sell double the amount of albums to forever21 shoppers is it MGMT being forced to stop being weird at gunpoint is it God telling Sufjan Stevens that he needs to make music to appeal to white alternative R&B fans or else he's not gonna be able to meet Jesus when he goes to heaven the aesthetic of this album is so gray gray gray it's so painfully drab just the sound of this thing the instrumentals it's very low impact I mean occasionally a vocal melody on the hook will kind of pop a little bit but again low impact and it does not help that most of the time the lyrics are super insipid and delivered in this I don't know this gutless baby man voice the lyrics on this thing are so plain and boring an unimaginative and don't really describe much of anything in an interesting way I feel like this is the way you would talk about a woman or relationship if you're just super attractive and you're not the type of person who really needs to say anything interesting or slick to get somebody to be interested in you I feel like I'm just kind of chewing on a piece of stale white bread I mean I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody is a cute sentiment definitely one of the nicer messages I've ever heard come across in a love song I can certainly give the neighborhood that but still the poetry that you find on this thing is is just about as shallow as what you might find on a chain-smoker song it actually kind of makes the chainsmokers look like frickin Shakespeare this record lyrically instrumentally vocally I just feel like I'm being subjected to 40 minutes of sexy suburbanite sadness it's kind of like I'm trapped in a tacky black and white perfume commercial that plays during primetime on MTV or vh1 it's just kind of one moody forgettable pop tune after another and I don't know it kind of gets even more weird awkward and cringy as the band tries to incorporate these distorted dark R&B elements yeah I'm not digging this this is this is very much not for me I'm feeling a light too decent for on this transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts okay Anthony Fantino the neighborhood over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit the link to subscribe to the channel and slap that notification button that Bell button too because you never know you never really can trust the YouTube sub box to put your videos in there sometimes so make sure you do that as well cool see you the next one forever 
0Z9n4DNNsy8,oh boy oh boy oh boy tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Judas Priest album how is this possible how is it how is this happening right now what what the hell is this Judas Priest one of the longest-running bands in the history of metal eighteen albums almost 50 years as a band they've literally just dropped one of the best heavy metal albums of the decade one of the better records of their career I mean I guess it's not too improbable given that the band is pretty much consistently released music since their inception it really is a testament to the idea of keep on keeping on and I guess it's not that uncommon for some of the original acts in heavy metal to have a late era album or two that is fantastic I mean priests themselves did it after 20 years as a band with painkiller in 1990 Maiden did in 2000 with brave new world great album easily one of their best and Motorhead as well had a good run in the 2000s with motorized ER and inferno and kiss of death also the band except in 2010 with blood of Nations and there's also newer acts out there such as ghost that in a lot of ways have kind of brought back a somewhat old-school heavy metal songwriting style an old-school heavy metal vibe sound energy not to mention there have been a handful of groups like Satan and Hell who were originally writing music years ago but have reformed to a newer younger audience that have been enjoying the old-school heavy metal sound who enjoy hearing songwriting and melody and devilish camp comeback to the forefront in the Middle's onra and priests bring all of that back and more with this record that just sounds like a full throttle revitalization of that heavy metal aesthetic even the cover art on this thing calls back to that sleek metallic murderous aesthetic that was on the front of so many Priest albums back in the day also the guitarist of the previously mentioned band hell has a hand in some of the production this record Andy Sneap and also on production with this record is tom alum a longtime producer who the last time he was producing with priests was what I believe that the late 80s I mean you're kind of talking about a guy here who helped the band craft their classic sound the throttling guitar riffs the Dueling solos the epic theatrical vocal performances all the anthemic and soaring vocal and guitar melodies I mean firepower is pretty much Judas Priest as they have been known and loved but maybe just a little bit heavier more vibrant chunkier this time around I mean if there's one thing that makes this album stick out to me amongst the rest of Priest discography it's that there are these really interesting vocal passages on your vocal layers that sound really cartoonish and demonic really sinister I mean sometimes it sounds like I'm listening to a chorus of vocally trained demons all singing in unison or just like cackling or providing just like some weird evil color and the background of these songs it's pretty menacing and adds a lot to this very explosive heavy metal music I mean we're almost talking merciful fate levels of theatrics here I mean the sound the production on this album the performances as well they're excellent they're near flawless I mean maybe what's here isn't quite as flashy and intense as some of priests records in the past that have been more on the speed metal side of the spectrum but the vibe of this album for me is just near flawless it sounds and feels great however for me the real draw of the album it really keeps me coming back to it is just the quality songwriting I mean not only are priests sounding better than ever but they are delivering some of their best material today there's so many tracks on this thing that have multiple phases to them versus pre choruses choruses bridges solo passages I mean the songs on this thing are really well built they have great progressions great flow and each one of them is packed with these glorious triumphant dark guitar riffs and leads that have some real bite to them sometimes the guitar work on this album can be really exciting sometimes really foreboding but the most stunning thing maybe on this entire album are rob Halfords vocals which are just excellent the dude sounds better than ever I mean nearly every singer in the heavy metal genre that was one of his contemporaries have obviously changed vocally over the years maybe not quite what they were but honestly I cannot say that about Rob Halford at all on this record I cannot there's like literally nothing vocally on this album that I have a problem with there's nothing literally vocally on this record I feel as out of place I feel like is not quite what it used to be if anything over the years his voice has has shown more character because some of his singing on this thing is just is downright diabolical on the title track as he's singing about the futility of fighting for peace and the demise of man and war he sounds so commanding and authoritative on evil never dies he's singing about the Eternity of evil itself about how the devil still lives down in Georgia I love that song reference there and he just sounds evil himself on this track he sounds like the administrator of my eternal punishment in hell necromancer is one of the most brutal sounding tracks on the album just by guitars alone but the track is literally Rob Halford singing about somebody bringing the dead back to life some of the cartoony weird background vocals get even stranger on this track as it sounds like a chorus of mutated zombies are singing along with the hook song flamethrower features this kind of sassy somewhat bluesy intro riff but then goes right into this high-octane heavy metal guitar work lyrically the track reads like it's literally about being incinerated by a flamethrower and God the hook the pre-chorus on this track is even better like great build ups on this song great ways to introduce the numerous passages of these tracks again just like every song in here built out so well also on the track lightning strike is Halford to singing about peeling the skin off the demon's face now to balance some of these harder fast or more aggressive tracks out there's a good deal of very powerful larger-than-life more nuanced ballads like heroes for a Bruins the song No Surrender the track sea of red that has a pretty extended little acoustic bit of instrumentation at the start of the track of course that song being the softest of all of them here is the closer then there's the supremely eerie Specter in the tracklist of this thing if there's any real downside to this album it's just that it sounds very predictable if you've heard much of Judas Priest's late 70s early 80s output you know what's going on with this record and then there were some tracks in the track listing here that to me didn't feel like they were exploring the band's original sound enough not adding that much to it nor were they showcasing as many interesting instrumental or vocal passages hard hooks tracks like traders gay and children of the Sun and lone wolf still though even those tracks are pretty listenable I wouldn't really skip any of them immediately and overall this is just a really exciting heavy metal album so much so it just makes me want to throw my freaking horns up ah are you trying to say this album made you horny no no no no no no no dition have you building this album oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the

UHn-uNjJAoY,uh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new young father's album cocoa sugar this is the latest full-length LP the third full-length LP from scottish award-winning music trio young fathers this album was one of my most anticipated of the year and not just because I thought the group's last record white men are black men too was one of the best albums of that year it was an experimental and international collision of lo-fi pop hip-hop and soul music but that's always kind of been young fathers modus operandi but I think over the years they've actually gotten better and better at taking these genres blending them into a seamless unique trademark sound and my hype for this project built up as it sounded like young fathers we're going to be putting out one of the most high fidelity projects yet with this one because while in the past I have enjoyed a lot of the group's previous material some of their best stuff has been put to a more low fire recording that naturally is is going to shy some listeners away and while their 2014 album dead was maybe the most popular record yet it got them on Mercury Prize I personally was not really as crazy about it despite the more high fidelity recording I felt a lot of the grooves a lot of the performances felt a little rigid a little stiff however that rigidness didn't seem to be quite as much an issue on tracks like TOI and in my view the teaser tracks to this album Coco sugar on the hole though is is not a bad record it's a sweet little album and like most of young fathers releases a lot of the songs on here don't have a whole lot of single power but they reinforce each other as a collective there is some pretty good sequencing on this album however that doesn't prevent some of the songs on here from sounding like maybe just over extended interludes or just songs that could have used I don't know some better structuring bolder choruses like the song tremolo which to me seems to be like one of the more uninspired tracks on the record I thought it was kind of interesting how the lead vocal effect of the song played into the lyrics of the track about body and soul but still it didn't really feel like one of the more exciting and passionate moments on the album with its very rudimentary intro beat and some of the vocal layering and keyboards that come in later not really being all that thrilling the song FIFA is kind of ominous it features some wacky kind of cartoonish rapping some fractured drum and piano phrases it just kind of feels like an Avant rap soup that never quite forms into anything cohesive it's just like a bit of overly long filler I kind of feel the same way about the track wire which doesn't sound terrible but doesn't really add much to the entirety of the record the song Wow has a driving beat some strange and unexpected instrumental detours and some oddly deadpan lead vocals but none of it really builds up much in the way of momentum and it's just one of the more forgettable songs in the tracklist here despite it being one of the longest and while the intro and outro tracks on this album aren't bad they don't do much to bring a grand sense of closure or build up any excitement or set the tone for the album granted young fathers aren't really much for just slapping a song together into a simple verse chorus verse sandwich but I feel like their avoidance of that structure or their lack of will to build a lot of these songs up into anything triumphant or exciting just shows a lack of ambition I can appreciate when a song structured sort of veers out of normal expectations but what young fathers are drawing up on some of these tracks just feels more underwhelming than unorthodox despite my litany of complaints about some of the tracks on this album there are certainly highlights on this thing the track boarder girl is fantastic hits hard has a swooping beat that sounds like a broken machine or something wonderful vocal layering these weird ddddd deities since just kind of coloring the background it kind of reaches this instrumental peak where everything on the beat everything in the instrumental the vocals it all just sounds so collected I feel like I'm listening to a large group of musicians in a circle all playing collectively creating of a groove of vibe and aura a song features a powerful groove and one of the most interesting instrumental ascensions on the entire record the song turn is a pretty interesting ballad on the album if not just for its lyrical concept it seems to be all about growing progressing changing getting better but simultaneously not losing touch with who you are not changing who you are not losing touch with your roots song Holy Ghost is a smart braggadocious banger I got the email a pummeling beat kind of rolling kick drums some odd synthesizers a really great collective vocal energy between the members of the group a lot of lyrical nods to religious lore and mysticism the song toy has one of the most tense and exciting instrumentals on the entire record and in my view is easily one of the most haunting ballads the group has ever drawn up with some pretty intriguing lyrics about what feels like I don't know love attraction sex money there are some good highlights on the record but really for me just not enough to keep the entire thing buoyant there were a lot of tracks that just fell short to me and in general this to me while it was not a stiff record and it was not a terrible record I honestly think it's it's one of the group's more mild releases definitely one of their safer records a little letdown with the fact that they didn't take the opportunity here to make something a little bit more in-your-face a little bit more up front a bit bolder I'm feeling a decent - strong six on this thing transition have you given this album we'll listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

yTjabKwoo_k,hey it's time for the latest y-you know review or I go over a series of albums that I didn't do a formal review of and just kind of talk about them gauntlet style you know in one short video after after the next and and that's all so this is the latest installment I hope you enjoy it will link you to a playlist of other y-you know review videos at the end of it so here we go we a lot of people been asking me what are my thoughts on on earth gang and the new earth gang material and I think it's pretty decent like for a southern rap outfit like they have tight flows they have melodic elements as well like they have a lot of those eccentricities that you want in a southern duo like I definitely hear like goody mob reverberating in their music and artists like that but do their songs and does their style like stick out to me beyond that not really but there's certainly a nice baseline of talent and ability here like I get why they're appealing to people you know but it's not really sticking out to me but you know if you're looking for some good southern rap music with nice quality flows classy jazzy kind of mystical production goodness sing a shot apocalyptic sad depressing dystopian drones for the end of the world oh my god it's Ronnie he made a whole project full of bangers with a lot of different rappers and a lot of the songs are pretty catchy it's a little bit of a mixed bag some of the features on that good but the beats are bangin and they hit really hard and it's a loud album and it's fun wow yeah this this is just kind of an average indie rock album at this point some post-punk vibes here and there but just just just kind of phoning it in okay hooyah I'm talking about your album I've listened to it okay I've listened to it I've been listening to it I've been hearing it and I think it's okay I think it's alright your flows are fine you got that gritty dark southern rap style feeling those three 6 mafia vibes I get it I get it it's kind of cool but but vocally stylistically it does it doesn't really stick out to me you know it just it just doesn't stick out to me it kind of goes hard it kind of bangs but I don't find it super catchy the lyrics are all right some of the aggressions cool there's a flee attitude there but I don't know it just feels a little one-dimensional to me I don't know it's it's fine while it's on why would Albert Hammond Jr do a solo album just to do just do like basically light variations of stroke songs well I wish this record was basically the last strokes album but just performed and recorded well and with Julian singing obviously but because I don't know man this is back but but you know I guess this is some kind of decent super epic high gloss indie rock it's not much edge to it and not all the songs are catchy I don't know man Between the Buried and Me used to put out some some pretty cutting edge stuff back in the day but now they're just just kind of like watered-down prog metal and the idea that this is the first of two parts of something it's it's not terrible but it's not thrilling either I don't know just feels kind of safe for the genre and and I'm not really gonna hold my breath for whether or not they're actually gonna be taking risks or doing something groundbreaking or intriguing on the next part of this thing either so dad at that that I was so excited to review whatever the next carpenter Brit project was going to be after you guys turned me on to this this this music and I uh I felt like this is a moment when an artist sort of decides they're gonna come out with a big kind of splash a big commercial record and in the process of doing so they kind of changed their sound in a way where they no longer are playing to their their strengths anymore and the inclusion of kind of I don't know more traditional song structures and and more vocals on this new release over here really just kind of watered down and weakened Britt's appeal and sound and maybe in another context on another album it could work but I don't find those things to be all that well executed here so it's it's a little underwhelming unfortunately but still a lot of that cool 80's groovy synth wave shit that's further back in his discography is still very nice and I'm still enjoying that so this album took so frickin long to come out but it's here the the 3 3 or the the the 3 into the third installment the new dobry album and honestly in comparison with 2 3 which was the last record of his that I listened to the the beats are not quite as weird or dark or cutting edge a lot of good features on this thing though like it's basically a who's who of underground left-field like you actually want to hear these MCS because they're fucking cool and they're like way out of like the norm they're unorthodox as fuck rappers because they're really creative they're off the beaten path you have greats and classic dudes on here like MF DOOM and you just kind of go down the line to some of the newer cats on here as well who are actually equally talented but much like nearly every other producer album that you're gonna run across these days it's a mixed bag it's all over the place like the quality of the song really kind of depends on the quality of the the feature there the songwriting is OK but some of the beats some of the instrumentals that kind of are interspersed in between some of these feature tracks I don't know some of them some of this bland or beats in my opinion but it's it's not bad it's not a bad listen I I think we can say without debate that this is the the worst ministry album it's the worst one of Montreal kind of coming through a little bit of a bounce back here from their disastrous previous record innocence reaches it this one is all right it's a lot funnier it's a lot groovier some of you guys who like the dance ear tracks off of hissing fauna and some lanta twins you'll definitely like instrumentally what some of this album has to offer but vocally lyrically and as far as songwriting goes like these are some of Kevin Barnes most phoned-in tracks I do appreciate that he was trying to go a little experimental and ambitious here with how the songs on this thing are formed creating these like half songs where there's a transition and then you go into a different track entirely because the the tracklist is relatively short but every song has like multiple phases to it so that element of the composition I like quite a bit but to me these songs were really just obnoxious and and continued to wear on me as I listened through the album while it's not one of my least favorite of Montreal albums it's it's certainly far from one of the best I enjoyed Fromm's last album quite a bit spaces I believe or at least that was the last record of his that I covered a really beautiful minimal piano passages all over that thing dizzying hypnotic wonderful this new record though kind of takes those same minimalist vibes but they add in some electronics it's a lot more faint sonically the sounds and performances are not quite as bold and and vivid and as a result I just kind of ended up going comatose during my listens of this thing I mean it's it's pleasant it's nice to have on in the background but I didn't find it to be very engaging I'll say that much well well well there's a new Decemberists album and it sounds kind of average the songs are really plain and it's probably their most predictable release ever indie Foulke is just it's just not doing too good New Yo La Tengo over here it kind of reminded me quite a bit of the last record of theirs that I covered I think it was fade where they were almost going on like this kind of psychedelic very very smooth very low-key jeroni almost ambient direction but it seems like they're going down that rabbit hole even further on on this new one over here like this is so faint this is so faint to the point where it doesn't even really feel like a novel experiment right now it just comes off kind of kind of lifeless and drab yeah I just don't see this album doing much to cut through the the noise of the modern age but you know maybe this is gonna be a little Indio ASIS for a lot of people so I guess if you're looking for that kind of thing something that's really gonna turn the volume down and allow you to just shut off from the aggression of the outside world that this will do it there's a riot going on and we're just kind of sitting here having a little powwow quietly in the corner we're pretty desperate right now for like a new face in the world of trap music if if this is blowing up I mean it's not terrible but it just seems so average you know I mean the beats are pretty run-of-the-mill there's nothing really about Greedo that sticks out to me lyrically vocally stylistically I mean he's certainly versatile in that he can both rap and sing but I don't find a lot of his hooks to be all that sticky it just kind of it just kind of rings to me as being okay you know it's it's just it's just kind of alright it's not really that weird it's not really that eccentric it's not really that groundbreaking it's barely even memorable in in my opinion but I don't know what the fuck do I know I guess I guess I don't know anything this new Kraus album is actually one of the freshest and most interestingly produced shoegaze records I've heard in a long time the sound is so psychedelic it's dense it's incredible the colors Duke the colors it's all just washing over me it's just expanding my mind sonically but the thing is the songwriting is just okay the vocals I think are pretty underwhelming not that interesting I feel like this project is is more of one of just sonic wizardry than it is musical composition the sounds are great sounds are great but the songs [Music] the new Iona Li formerly I am am I Who am I who work I've enjoyed and reviewed in the past to me this just felt like a really long overblown electro-pop record that was kind of dark a little mystical but nowhere near as cutting edge nowhere near as as legitimately eerie as some of that earlier material that she broke out onto the music scene with it's okay it's fine but it is very long-winded for me you know and just sort of average for her not really that adventurous but I don't know I don't know she's certainly more interesting than your average electro pop artist you know but this is just not her best work in my opinion this new record from Lucy was actually kind of solid for the indie tinged singer-songwriter genre didn't really stick out to me in that style of music but the vocals are pretty solid these songs are decent I guess I can just come on here and say that if this is your vibe if that is exactly the kind of thing that you go gaga for most likely you will not want to miss out on this record but for me that that's something more I go crazy for when something feels like a real artistic peak in that style to me this didn't feel like that but certainly not a bad record for that sound session have you given any of these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the

gWUdEgaTdo8,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new xxx 10th Ozzy own project question question mark it's question mark this is the latest album from viral controversial polarizing musical figure xxx 10th asean who initially a handful of years ago blew up off of these overblown hyper aggressive super bombastic soundcloud singles last time i talked about his music at length was in 2017 with the review of his big commercial debut record 17 which was essentially this really half-baked self-absorbed album that I named my least favorite record of the year now was I too hard on the album was I being too hard on him personally I don't think so because 17 was essentially just messy lo-fi emo folk standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these really forgettable rap tracks much of the material on this thing was like the length of an iTunes preview it didn't really leave much of an impact on me much of it just felt like I was listening to some fake deep tortured soul thing also let's not forget to mention that this album was essentially a huge turn away from the sound that kind of brought ex to prominence in the first place granted in his early singles and loose odds-and-ends tracks he covers a lot of stylistic bases but honestly I don't really think anybody saw what he was about to do on 17 coming and on top of thinking his first foray into commercially released music was really underwhelming and super mediocre I think I liked any other reasonable person out there have a right to be concerned about the various allegations and controversies surrounding him so I guess the question remains that since ex still has a lot of fans a lot of validity in the music industry and he still continues to receive cosign after cosign after cosign after cosign what does he have to offer on another full-length album while this record does certainly deliver more than 17 did I would say it's even more of a mixed bag ex covers more stylistic bases across the length of this record for better for worse and while there are some moments on here where he sounds better than ever there are also some tracks where he comes off more ridiculous than ever of course like with 17 this album is kicked off with instructions because what ex is doing is so impossible deep that it needs to be explained now granted some things are so unorthodox that they might need some explaining like I don't know a conceptual rap album about a man who's travelling through space on an intergalactic slave ship trying to escape his captors however this record isn't really doing much to legitimately explore or experiment or push the envelope it merely just explores what x dubs at the start of the album as more alternative sounds which I guess maybe a younger more rap centric audience wouldn't necessarily be familiar with that being said though the sound of this album is far better than that of 17 the downside though is that much of the material on this thing is just as half-baked and weakly structured as a lot of the material from 17 was pretty much every song on this thing delivers a pretty quick instant vibe it's a sampling a very moody rap and folk and rock typically blended together but sometimes separate the song alone part 3 that kicks the record off features X singing pretty prominently a lot of a very whimper e nasally lead vocals he's just crying out over these acoustic guitar peji OHS it features a very eerie atmosphere and hits a kind of cool emotional peak at one point but the thing really fails to leave an impression at 1 minute and 49 seconds I mean it's it's like a sad folk song with a big gargantuan beat behind it it's it's not a banger meanwhile the lyrics on this track are about as melodramatic as as like an Evanescence song I'm tired of hate I'm tired of love I dug my nails into my arms she turned and left all my scars what is my worth my worth I mean the song changes almost sounds like the intro to in Evanescence song with its dreary pianos and faint strings though I do commend X's singing voice on the track now alone part 3 does transition nicely into the next track moonlight which is almost as under written but still X's singing on this track is pretty sweet the beat also features these really weird intriguing swirling keyboard arpeggios that are constantly pitch shifting in a kind of glitchy way it's odd but pretty as well sad while being incredibly short is one of the catchy ER and hooker songs on the entire record features a boomy beat rattling high hats kind of watery cavernous keyboards this refrain that I just cannot get out of my head I'm sad I know yeah I'm sad I know yeah but I find the weirdly manipulative lyrics on the track kind of disturbing like hey I'm gonna hurt myself if you leave me typically I kinda like hearing very dark emotions play out in song but to me this just felt like unhealthy behavior with a pop even ear the song remedy for a broken heart just kind of sounds like speedy rapping over some very sad slow acoustic guitar samples and what sounds like a drunk Bon Iver moaning out in in in like a closet I mean it's listenable but but is it blowing my mind is it making me sad not not really floor 555 takes it into a totally different direction with ex spitting very quickly very aggressively over this Bhoomi cloud rap instrumental it's very distorted very bassy suddenly he goes into this screams delivery where he sounds kind of like an angry constipated Eminem but I guess it sounds like he's really exercising some anger here the song numb might be a mere extension of an instrumental and kind of a chorus a single chord progression but it's actually one of the more solid cuts on here just kind of progressively layering on more vocals and more guitar leads as the song goes on sounds more and more epic and luscious though the song again does sound kind of out of place because it feels like an extended interlude among all of these songs that don't really feel all that fleshed out now the track infinity is like an East Coast hardcore hip-hop track kind of boom bap II kind of jazz rappy featuring Joey badass I can't really deny their artistic chemistry on this track it's probably the only saving grace of the song though I can't really understand Joey's attraction to collaborating so frequently with acts outside of I don't know one artist kind of bringing relevancy and in viral popularity while the other has more artistic legitimacy the song is passable it sounds decent but there is a head scratching intro on this song like any hardcore hip-hop throwback from the 90s that kind of starts off with the MCS on the track just talking shit sounding hard but they're literally talking about catching chlamydia and gonorrhoea and about how that's like gee shit and how Joey's going to catch all the diseases in the world so the world doesn't have anymore diseases it's not it's not really how diseases work I think Joey understands that but I'm just not seeing the metaphor I know I'm taking it more seriously than maybe I should but this intro is quite possibly the worst thing on this entire album it made me cringe so fucking hard I time-traveled back to the dark ages for people who didn't bathe regularly and didn't have plumbing knew that catching chlamydia was not good for you the song go and am kind of bangs pretty hard it's got a decent hard-hitting beat but x's ridiculous lyrics and silly baby voice all over the song make it kind of hard to take seriously and there's literally a line on here talking about how he's the shit so he needs a diaper and then honestly the album kind of goes further downhill from here the triple dollar-sign track featuring matt ox is an airheaded auto-tune ballad with a lot of vocal riffing it's just really generic maybe the second most generic track on the entire record to smash featuring PNB rock which again is just more auto-tuned uninspired vocal riffing X can't really consistently land the finish of a song so of course he's not really nailing the landing of the finish of this album in the second leg the song I didn't even speak Spanish lol is this really terrible I don't know maybe he's being serious with it maybe it's just a parody it's like a piece of Latin pop rap I just kind of feel insulted listening to it like I get Dumber with each replay and considering the rise in popularity of Latin pop music and Latin rap music as of late I wouldn't be surprised if some people are no kind of pissed off about how much of a mockery the song sounds there's kind of a quick turnaround with the song hope we're ex references the parkland shooting right at the start of the song dedicating the song to the kids who lost their lives or were affected in the shooting however it just kind of seems like a like an offhanded reference to that tragedy as the rest of the song doesn't really seem to dive deeply into that topic or anything related to it I mean at the end of the day I guess it's a nice thought but this song sounds just as rushed as nearly every other track on this record the songs gets ofrenda though is actually one of my favorites here one of the better conceptual tracks on the record and a pretty hard-hitting punk rock instrumental on it I love the various phases of the song and I like how the track is essentially all about fighting off the the difficulties and the challenges of living with mental illness it's a pretty commendable point on the album but the only other track that kind of goes into this direction stylistically is maybe that song with Travis Barker which is kind of like a really angry indignant badly mixed emo definitely not a high point on the album for me and when I say Travis Barker I mean yes that Travis Barker of blink-182 playing drums on the track so yeah you have elements of trap on here cloud rap punk rock emo Foulke again I can't really knock ex's versatility and the mix on this thing is definitely better than what he's done in the past the singing is definitely better than what he's done in the past seems like maybe he's trying a little bit more lyrically but that doesn't really change the fact this album is pretty much a mixed bag with way more misses than hits and those are pretty much my thoughts on this album and on this album only now as far as X as a person I don't know the guy personally everything I've read about him up until this point is still a concern for me even though I've seen as of late he's been making some attempts at softening his image doing charity work etc etc I have no issue acknowledging when somebody who's problematic or somebody who is controversial has made a compelling piece of art there are a few tracks on this thing that I actually think are pretty good pretty decent but most of this album is just a crapshoot which is why I feel a strong three to life for on it transition have you given this X album a listen did you love a digit it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't get get mad just because I didn't like it I'm not gonna like everything I'm not gonna like everything that you like you're not gonna like everything I like but you know if you actually have like an issue with something that I said in the review then just then just comment on that okay over here next to my head is another review you can check out that and the lane to subscribe to the channel you have to me Fantana forever 
5dYRPSXQtyg,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week and they're all linked down there in the description box I shaved the mustache off my face I looked I look weird to myself because I've been rocking the mustache for so long I don't recognize myself anymore anyway alright let's let's stop beating around the bush let's get into the tracks first of course down there our Amazon and turntable lab associate links hit those up treat yourself and I also want to shout out that there is some soundtrack music almost like a random array of tracks Bladerunner blackout 20 22 from Flying Lotus I dropped a bunch of different tracks on Soundcloud this week all in relation to this you can sample them down below alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week starting off with this new song from the chainsmokers over here everybody hates me basically trying to make club music sound as emo as possible maybe in a way this is kind of a meta approach of just talking about how much people dislike the duo's music as at this point but you know go into the club like everybody hates you using the club as a place where you can just get all your sad feelings out it's it's it's it's kind of corny I can't really stand it honestly probably one of their worst tracks in a while I mean before they were just kind of writing very bland pop with super shallow manipulative stories but now it's just like God just stop next Rivers Cuomo has a track called medicine for melt for melancholy man he is trying so hard to just like write write the quintessential millennial pop song ever since that last Weezer record and I guess what he's a gonna be doing with this solo project he most likely has coming out very soon based off of this song it's got kind of a kitschy I don't know old-school vocal pop vibe to it obviously you're gonna pick up on that aesthetic just on the album cover this alone but you know of course you have some millennial losses and you know background vocals and that sort of thing and super glitzy instrumentation a very bland very run-of-the-mill I just don't I just don't quite see the appeal here but keep keep at it rivers as long as you come back every once in a while that something that sounds halfway decent and oh god this new this new a little dickie track Freaky Friday I mean I guess it's not the most annoying little dickie song given that most of the track is pretty much just Chris Brown but it's just the concept of the track and I don't know I feel like this song is just generally kind of gross I feel like it just feeds off of this assumption and stereotype that little dickie because he's sort of not your average looking rapper he's not your average rapper he's no cool he's not hip he's not really that popular nobody really takes him seriously I mean nobody really takes him seriously because his songs are essentially dick jokes not literally but in the figurative sense anyway that's why people don't really take little Dicky seriously and then to sort of bring Chris Brown into the fold and have him sort of joking at one point about hey nobody's mad at me about my past anymore now that I've become little Dicky and we've swapped bodies and it's a really kind of corny concept for a song it's got it's got a few chuckles a few giggles in the music video but it's it's not a track I would ever want to listen to by itself Jesus Christ it is not a track I would ever want to listen to you by itself it Dickie has essentially become the Lonely Island at this point maybe a little edgier but he's not really much more serious than the Lonely Island on this song I don't get why people sort of freak out about him or act like he's like the the greatest thing to happen to hip-hop right now is whatever moving on from their tracks though they thought were just merely okay but certainly wanted to mention it certainly wanted to mention him all right first off this new track from Twin Shadow this new song is titled brace featuring Rainsford it's got kind of a futuristic soul kind of quality to it very uplifting very triumphant instrumentation at some points on this track not one of my favorite songs he's ever done but you know still not a bad track overall next new void song they dropped a few new tracks this week but the one that I'm talking about here is alien nation probably one of the slower and more underwhelming singles they've dropped so far for this album cycle but they've come out with so many freaking singles they've gotten to the point where you're essentially putting out deep cuts now you know what I mean and and almost treating them like single tracks this track again it's not terrible it's not the most exciting single they've dropped by far but I'm sort of anticipating this is gonna be a cut that grows on me a little more as I hear the entire album next new rock Marciano he has a new project he's got a new track over here featuring Action Bronson the sauce and the corniche cornish probably not pronouncing that correctly but you know here I'm slapping myself for you through the internet but it's not a bad track you know it's got some chill laid-back instrumentals just like you expect from a rock song and the action bronson features pretty decent moving on from there a Pearl Jam can't deny me actually one of the most fiery singles the band is come out with in years quite the ferocity they used to back in the 90s but still it's actually not that bad of a single it's pretty a compelling tune and Eddie Vetter you you still got those pipes he still got those pipes next enjoying this song from Asch Cuccia not a bad track a Roja I hope that's how it's pronounced the electronic music producer who I've covered on this channel a few times before is kind of heading in a different direction it sounds like with his newer material he's actually uh coming through with the voice on this track but the instrumentation the production is pretty experimental it's pretty odd I don't know I I I would say aesthetically it kind of feels like an art pop track but he's doing some kind of weird kind of out there maybe ARCA fans will be into it I'll say that much maybe ARCA fans will will be into what he's doing on this new track over here because yeah well there are tinges of artpop there it seems like a little weirder avant-garde off-the-beaten-path for it to just simply be categorized as that and let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best tracks of the week we are blowing through this episode alright next we waste time faded which is this what the hell am I looking at here how am i oh yes oh my god the new scar Lorde track faded oh my god this rapper just fucking blowing my mind with this with this single it's so edgy it's so hard hitting it's so distorted it kind of reminds me of some of those early six nine singles back when he was like a little bit darker and a little bit weirder and a little bit more experimental and then he just sort of went into making this generic scream trap now scar Lorde is is sort of more on that experimental tip and there's something about his style and just his musical aesthetic that kind of reminds me of new metal a little bit but I don't know kind of just like or maybe even like industrial rock I'll say that more more industrial rock if you can imagine like an industrial rock version of trap music I feel like Skaar Lord is doing it and I kind of hope he continues doing it because it's it's like pretty fucking tough as nails it's pretty exciting honestly moving on from there new nerd remix featuring Rihanna the track lemon I like it I think it's fun remix I think it's fun maybe some people think it's dumb but I actually think it's a pretty fun remix if you've heard the track lemon before which I hope you guys have it's one of the best singles last year I hope you guys have heard that track the the Drake remakes over here it's it's not bad it's fun moving on from there Leon bridges who is an artist previously that I've never been super huge on he's always dealt in the sounds of soul and blues and sometimes some older shades of rock music that I hear kind of getting picked up in his music but this is the single that he dropped over here one of a couple tracks that he just recently dropped a bet ain't worth the hand is one of the most emotionally striking songs that I've heard this year so far I have ever heard from him like from the chord progression to the song structure to his vocal melodies to the emotion in his vocal performance this track is killer this track is fucking awesome this track holds so much weight the passion on this song again the the dude has never really struck me down emotionally before quite like this and I'm really happy that it's it's it's finally happening you know to me he always struck me as like kind of a bit of a I don't know I'm almost like one of those revivalists acts that you can't really truly get into unless you're really like vying for a hit of nostalgia from the particular era of music that he's pulling from so hard but I feel like he's almost transcending that now with how good this frickin song is again really one of his best tunes that I've ever heard moving on from there Oh gene grain quality Chris they come up again with a new single banger alert this one is titled zero super grimy grimy ass beat harder bars and deliveries on this track not quite as low-key as a few of the recent songs they've dropped I don't know man this just continues to be one of my most anticipated albums of the year I love that these two are working together I love it they're complementing each other and the tracks are just coming out great you know if you're really into some left-field alternative hip hop music that has kind of quirky and in an eclectic sona then you're gonna want to hear this hot dad has a new single out which is actually when my favorite singles of his in a long time if you're not familiar with hot dad he is a producer songwriter a multi-instrumentalist who creates these really tongue-in-cheek funny but also very smartly written and entertaining synth pop tunes they have a bit of a nostalgic factor to them and a lot of them deal in the internet and they have a sharp sense of humor and this one is titled just tell me what font to pick when I'm making websites for kids and it's got like a weird little rat passage to it too it's easily one of his best written most hilarious tracks he's ever done I love how a lot of his tracks just sound like super weird obscure tim and eric' sketches that like never happened i feel like you could make an entire sketch show around at least half of the man's discography so I'm just really enjoying this new hot dad track shout out to hot dad and this new Courtney Barnett song is fantastic the music video is really fun and creative too but this honest title need a little time I love how our songwriting is just becoming more emotionally potent more melodic I have thought she's had a compelling voice before compelling voice before but the whole long drawn-out talk singing thing just really didn't do too much for me with her previous material but the more tune full track she's been delivering as of late for this new a new upcoming record have been have been great I'm enjoying this one almost as much as the last single which was sort of an attack on rape culture this new one over here is is much more I guess inspirational at least from what I'm catching from some of the lyrics in the music video but uh that is going to be it for this week's weekly track round up everybody we did it we made it we did it thank you thank you again again all the artists everything that I talked about in this video it's linked down there below check it out listen to it for yourself and I will see you guys in in the next in the next video okay Anthony Fantino weekly track roundup 
guuWxHnQZf4,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and I'm gonna do a quick review here of the new Remo Drive EP these guys re Bloomington Minnesota band or I guess they once were a trio now they're a duo they've recently signed to epitaph records you guys might remember that last year I covered their Greatest Hits record enjoyed it quite a bit they had a really refreshing sound in the emos onra in that they really kind of focused on good quality sharp memorable catchy songwriting not so much just the the Moton the emoti is good but there's gotta be a song there and Remo Drive had songs they had songs they had songs up the wazoo and even though some of the recordings in some of the production around Greatest Hits was a little rough around the edges it seemed as the people over at epitaph saw the potential and what they were doing picked him up and now with this new EP they essentially deliver what the title says pop music and and not just simply pop music within the genre of pop music but they are delivering a sweeter cleaner sleeker poppier version of what fans might remember from their last record they're incorporating more elements I would say of indie rock and power pop pop punk has always been in the mix there with Remo Drive but I'm feeling a little bit more of that it's a trio of songs last eight minutes in total I would say the most emo track on the entire EP is the final track heartstrings easily the most dramatic of all the cuts there but the two previous songs the opener is actually pretty bouncy pretty sunny pretty fun has a good groove to it meanwhile the second track on this thing is also pretty summery - seems like the the doo doooo sound I almost said trio there seems like the duo sound has lightened up a little bit I'm not exactly sure if that is going to follow through on the rest of a new album it's it's not a bad recording you know I guess this is the recording quality that I wish Remo Drive had on their last full length record the one thing I missed though I guess so far in the band is just that I don't know that that ballsy performance style the anxiousness the emotional and anxiousness the anxiety that was coming through on some of their songs I thought the lyrics felt a little bit more raw and cutting on greatest-hits in comparison with what they're doing here and I don't know that there was just a bit of a sweatiness you know that rough around the edge while it did hurt some of the songs in the long run the performance style was definitely gutsier you know the performances felt more wild I could definitely attribute that to the drumming on the last record can't say the drumming is as animalistic is as explosive on this new record though still though it's it's not a bad crop of songs and I can't really fully judge or I guess lay a hard opinion down on the direction the band is going in until I hear more tracks I mean so far I could say not bad fine trio of tracks I can't say any of the songs on here have instantly become any of my favorite Remo Drive tracks but you know I'm willing to hear out where the band is headed on this one and so far it doesn't sound terrible so the that's essentially my take on the on the little EP it's very short just a couple tracks you know get into this thing if you're looking for some emo blended with power pop and pop punk and indie rock and a splash of alternative rock mixed in there too it's very well produced the songs are pretty sturdy the vocal performances and and I guess the performance style just come off a little bit mild to me but outside of that it's a decent rocky EP from a new band who I guess I'm just kind of keeping my eye on because they could potentially do something interesting check the EP out down below in the description box and over here next to my head is another video that you guys can check out hit that up or they link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next one Anthony Fantana pop music forever 
7TABeq5TLGY,hi everyone ex the nice Ike tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Natalia la huaca de album muses vol 2 Natalia is a Mexican pop singer whose talents have been reverberating louder and louder north of the border over the last few years mostly thanks to her 2015 album hasta la race an album that successfully blended elements of Latin American folk with contemporary twee and indie pop also last year she landed a pretty prominent vocal spot on Disney's coco soundtrack and in 2017 she also embarked on the first volume of the music series that this record is the sequel to which from what I've read I guess the sessions were so fantastic and there were so many musical results from them that there was enough material for another volume now the previous installment of muses to me red as Natalia exploring a variety of shades and sounds within the world of Latin American folk but still in a way maintaining a pretty firm grip on her Papa roots but muses volume 2 to me reads like a little bit more of a clean break from the poppier sounds of the last record to be blunt about it this album is pretty much 13 tracks almost an hour of elegant gorgeous beautiful and rustic Latin American folk which really runs the emotional and instrumental gamut from the incredibly groovy and bombastic opening track the rhythms the horns the background vocals on this track it's all bright it's all vivid it all hits incredibly hard we quickly transition into more low-key moments on the album like Alma Mia a track that is as quiet as it is stunningly beautiful it's a song where you the instrumentation is not quite as aggressive not quite as loud and instead we get a lot more interesting very jazzy chord phrasings and guitar embellishments throughout the track all of which are executed on these very crystal-clear plucky nylon strings the ballot on a media Uno is aided by some very nice glossy reverb steady guitar strumming some very nice harmonized guitar leads so that that kind of sparkle like stars in the night sky which Natalia's voice just within like a moon a big bright beautiful full moon the song - so he dose changes things up with a three four time signature some really sharp snappy rhythms beautiful they just melt my brain the song do where main Negrito has these very steady mid-paced sensual rhythm guitars and while yes there is a language barrier at work here for me there's just a mood and a vibe of the track that feels distinctly kind of sassy and coy no surprise that a track titled luz de luna has kind of a nocturnal vibe to it it's one of the milder moments on the album for me maybe a bit of a lull in the record but still it does feel kind of special in that while it is not the loudest or the quietest or the most stark track on the entire record it is one of the most intimate it feels like one of the closest tracks like Natalia's voice the guitars they just really kind of create almost like a beautiful but kind of claustrophobic sense of space on the song almost like her and los Marino's are kind of trying to keep the song a secret the beefy drums and rhythms on the track derecho are fantastic they add a lot to the hypnotic guitars on the cut there's also this nice sweet droning tone that pops up in the background of the course that just adds a lot of a very subtle tension to the song and there's also the very dreamy and inspiring track eclipse which is so beautiful and just so serene that I want to wrap myself in it like a blanket and get into the fetal position and go to sleep for the rest of my life the song destined Ossa in comparison with the other tracks here has kind of a play style and a chord progression that feels distinctly older distinctly archaic in comparison with a lot of the peppier and smoother and more contemporary sounds on these Latin American folk styles and I think the reason for that might have been that there are two vocal guests on this track actually two pretty big names in Latin American music oma report une dough in Eugenia Lyon believe me I'm in over my head here when it comes to a lot of this music I'm not expert on either their careers or anything like that however I do know a good recording when I hear one I know some decent production when I hear it and I know a good vocal performance when I hear one as well these three kind of trade verses and their points on the song where they harmonize collectively and God God is it gorgeous the intense pacing of the song tastes ego raises my heart rate the closing acoustic instrumental on the album is very nice touch as well that I enjoyed a lot I'll say that maybe there are a few tracks that kind of pale in comparison to others and as a record it is a little bit bloated I do kind of prefer that in a way the last installment of this series was tighter at around 45 minutes but still the material on here is fantastic it is high-grade it is high-quality and this is easily one of my favorite records of the year one of the most beautiful albums I've had the pleasure of listening to this year again some points feel a little comatose and and as an entire album it can feel kind of Sammy Sammy which is maybe why again I wish that tracklist was pared down just a smidge just a little bit but overall like this is easily one of the best albums in the genre I think you may hear this year I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it do you like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling like you're full of thoughts over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or they'd like to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana amuse us vol 2 forever 
Kh2_xvw3LUA,but hey everyone wouldn't that he would down here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new David Byrne album American utopia David Byrne one of the most enigmatic musical figures of the 1970s and 80s is back with a new full-length album his first solo record in like 14 years or so the last of which was grown backwards however David Byrne has kept himself really busy in between these two plot points he has been working on soundtrack music and he's had a slew of collaborations one of the biggest of which was that great record he had with annie clark of saint vincent love this giant another project between this album and his last that is really stuck with me is his brian eno collaboration everything that happens will happen today an album that was just this pristinely produced futuristic art pop album which made me feel like i was living inside of a perfect polite society where everyone wears white suits the workdays are short the days are always sunny and everyone takes their dog out for a walk at 8:00 a.m. sharp and now David Byrne returning with American utopia I'm kind of catching a lot of the same themes and vibes that I was off everything that happens but it delivered in a different fashion American utopia deals pretty deeply in the ideas of paradise and bliss and conformity with some added nods to darkness and American politics as well as hyper awareness of things like body parts and the brain a cockroach living in the cosmos of your house and the the sentient of a chicken I read that this album was kind of a grand statement on US politics and it also has a very kind of hopeful angle it looks positively toward the future if that is the case I didn't quite get that at least not in spades there are some tracks on here that are very clearly political without a doubt but for the most part I think a lot of this record boils down to many of the same societal critiques that David Byrne has always laced very subtly in his music throughout the years another familiar thing about can you tow Pia is that it is instrumentally dense it is deeply groovy and also emotionally awkward but I guess with a new fresh very vibrant instrumental palette this album is a very tight 10 tracks in 37 minutes and it's got a pretty decent batch of highlights within it too like the tropical island funk on the song every day is a miracle which is as feel-good as the title suggests the intro the verse of the song though is pretty dramatic builds tension very nicely features David Byrne just calling out and waxing poetic on things like God as well as elephants not being able to read newspapers and loving one another the chorus is fantastically rich as I said earlier really feel good and I love how he just kind of comes together with a lot of different musical shifts throughout this track I mean the contrast he creates on the bridge of the song has kind of a dystopian edge to it that I like a lot be very short but heavenly dogs mind is another track on here I enjoyed a lot a song that's really the most bold political statement on the entire record as David Byrne uses the blissful ignorance of a dog's life as a parallel or a comparison to the lack of influence and impact and control that the electorate has over the powerful over people like the president over our politicians the equally euphoric track bullet reaches a heavenly peak as well despite the fact that it's it's such a morbid song the springy guitar leads on this track as well as the vocal harmonies that David Byrne brings to the table are really lovely but the intro is pretty dark and there are some other tracks on here that take kind of a dark turn they're a little edgy and have some hard grooves to the songs it's not dark up here and everybody's coming to my house two of my favorite tracks on the entire record not only because they're well produced great beats great bass lines good good lyrics as well but for me these two tracks are emblematic of just the spirit of the Talking Heads still existing to this day and David Burns music but with just a I guess kind of a sadder dreary er aesthetic to kind of match the social climate of today where this album does fall short for me though is in in a few different areas for one the flow and the pacing of this record it just kind of feels like a compilation at the end of the day there are some tracks on here that they didn't the track listing are not that great kind of pale in comparison to others or change sounds or change moods so wildly that it doesn't really fit in with the record the song here is maybe the clearest example of that as a closer as a finisher it doesn't really make much sense it doesn't really tie the album up all that much it's a very intriguing song about different portions of the brain serving different purposes but I don't know just the the instrumental feel so sterile and feels so alien in comparison with all the rich groovy instrumentation that kind of packs out the rest of the album there are some points on here where I feel like the album falls short on lyrics as well like on I dance like this which to me was a moment on the record that came off kind of plain and underwhelming as far as David Burns language I know he's not known for being all that flowery with the the words he chooses he's typically pretty blunt pretty straightforward but with that occasionally I feel like he borders on being mundane like on the song doing the right thing where it feels like he's doing his best to try to I guess Lampoon these really drab and self-absorbed tourists but he just kind of ends up embodying those things himself on the track a few of the vocal performances on here are a little weak leave a bit to be desired and occasionally the awkwardness of this record does permeate the music so much that I feel like it holds it back a little bit mostly on the song this is that which was a really syrupy kind of unfulfilled ballad that never really truly got started got its momentum up for me still overall it's not really that bad of an album generally I think it's pretty good it's some pretty forward-thinking art pop with a lot of interesting instrumentation good production good songwriting and a unique persona that only a guy like David Byrne can bring to an album I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best year that what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe

CCJZO4I2SS8,uh hi everyone - II win tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little yadi mixtape a little boat - little yachty is a Georgia rapper who's been making waves and rap game for the past couple of years now really ever since he started dropping some preliminary singles that ended up going viral from his original little boat mixtape which I liked quite a bit which people still give me a hard time to this day for liking this mixtape I enjoy this mixtape okay let me let me live what made this mixtape special for me is that it was packed with this really sunny carefree trap with very goofy but kind of unique rapping from the king of teens himself I love the really euphoric in unorthodox production on this thing and the way it melded with a lot of yachties auto-tune vocals and some of his other weird vocal inflections and ad-libs also I love the weird double persona duality thing going on with this project the yachty boat double sided identity I mean sure yadi is not the most skilled rapper in hip-hop and he is far from the greatest lyricist the game has ever seen but there were a lot of weird eccentric and unique qualities and characteristics about this tape that just made it kind of irresistible for me despite some really obvious flaws for me yadi was coming off as one of the true eccentrics in this new wave of whatever you want to call it soundcloud rappers otto crooners mumble rappers my worry though coming away from this project is that little boat was essentially going to be a flash in the pan it was going to be a fluke and it seemed like that was going to end up being the case because the following mixtapes summer songs - was kind of hurried didn't really have as many fantastic tracks on it although I didn't really put too much stock in that mixtape didn't really shake me when I saw that I ended up being kind of indifferent toward it but yadi fell off hard with his commercial debut album teenage emotions it seemed like he might might maybe come through on this thing but this is easily one of the most over bloated and just overdone commercial rap records of the decade it felt like everything that made yachty great originally but just watered down to the point where it lost its appeal not only that but there were just way too many tracks on this thing way too many tracks just really plain songs expensive production and all of the really uniquely weird qualities that made the little yachty special previously we're just stripped out of his sound and with all of this corporate oversight going into the album he still managed to drop a bar where he mixed up a cello with a clarinet thankfully though little boat two is pretty much a return to form for me nothing on here sounds like it's trying too hard to be a hit or trying too hard to be serious in comparison with the original little boat tape there is a similar balance of bangers and ballads on this thing being delivered in this really raw off-the-cuff fashion with a healthy dose of youthful exuberance the major difference though with little boat 2 and its predecessor is that there is a huge influx of these really dark minimal Spacey trap Tunes that didn't really play too much into the vibe of the last little boat tape maybe yah Dee's feeling kind of dark on this record feeling kind of Moody a direction I don't really mind in concept although it does seem like little yachty has kind of abandoned the formal separation between the yachty and boat personalities maybe it's still here in spirit because yadi hasn't totally abandoned the sound from the original little boat tape but the formality of the intro on that tape along with some of the theatrics in between songs we're part of what made that project and yachties special by comparison on little boat to the song self made is such an uneventful opener I mean it might say a lot about how little yachty perceives has come up in the rap game but it's not really much of an introduction to yachty as an artist so little boat 2 isn't quite as thematic it's not quite as well groomed and tightly sequenced as its predecessor at the end of the day it just kind of feels like a collection a compilation of tracks but it's still actually not a bad listen this thing is a pretty decent collection of very fiery low-key bangers total irradiating this base energy with production that is consistently dark and kind of quirky and yes while it's not deep it's it's not trying to be deep it's just it's just fun it's just fun there were a lot of highlights in the tracklist for me here love the song boom with ugly god I love the cavernous hypnotic trap instrumental on this thing the deep reverb the very subtle but very hype ad-libs the line about somebody taking one of yachties chains and then all the years boom ugly gods feature is actually not that bad he changes up his flow a little bit and even dips into an auto-tuned passage is kind of a chameleon here the song oops is really strange bassy and mega skeletal super minimal like everything you need nothing you don't just a little bit of percussion here a little bit of bass there's like a lot of space in this B and yadi kicks the song off with with a pretty decent triplet flow I do not get why people constantly rag on him for not being able to rap dude can clearly rap there's some decent chemistry going on between him and 2 Chainz and K supreme on the track like they definitely complement each other on the song the song count me in goes much harder instrumentally is hilariously boastful that one line on here about him stacking shit call him Adi Rothschild there's tons of overblown bass on this thing and these reversed hypnotic arpeggios that are really trippy the songs she ready with P and B rock sounds like a Airy pretty track ballad that could have been on the original little boat tape but a little bit sleeker a little bit more commercial a bit catchy er definitely one of the better PNB features that I've heard since I caught with of the dude I love the woodwind keys and and leads as well meanwhile the song das cap is cold it's murderous it's frightening I love the yachty line on this track about copying an island and putting himself on the map yadi continues to bring the viscera and the energy and the excitement and the hype with tracks like pop out huh which is loaded with these shouty refrains and just totally freaky ad-libs like that like they're not even thinking about what the ad-lib is gonna be anywhere they're just like oh oh like I just love the funky energy behind these tracks I just can't deny it also NBA young boat which is probably one of the only times I will sit through and be a young boy rapping but whatever Silva beat was pretty incredible him and yadi traded it off nicely on the track another killer refrain on the song flex Loki beat flex on the buck boys hey cuz you suck boy baby daddy with a little pump goes over without a hitch the closing track of trippy red is pretty nice too I love the trippy red continues to explore some really weird vocal ideas to me he definitely stands out as one of these Auto crooners I just kind of wonder if he'll ever pull together a super tight super solid taper album in the near future overall little boat - it's not a bad project I like it quite a bit I'm sure I will continue to get shit for enjoying little yachties music but I mean I just fucking do and for me the original appeal of little yachty to begin with has returned on little boat - maybe he's not outdoing himself maybe he's not going above and beyond or getting super ambitious with it but this album for me has a ton of throttle it has a ton of attitude it has a lot of heart he's just kind of throwing out the sporadic creativity and just letting the chips fall where they may there are a few generic and kind of nondescript tracks that I think could have been cut from the project entirely like the song talked to me nice featuring quavo which just sounds like a Mego song without the rest of the migos but it features a little yachty and i'm just so tired of their sound at this point they just oversaturated things in my opinion while I enjoyed the more low-key direction that yadi took this project and I feel like generally he overloaded little boat - with a bit too much of that it's it's kind of bloated a little bloated meanwhile songs like love me forever which was a very nice Airy euphoric ballad is is just a minute and change could have been so much longer and more fulfilling but still I'm pretty happy with the results of little boat - I mean didn't quite make the splash that boat one did but a lot of good things about this in my opinion I'm feeling a light 7 on this transition have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

zvh62IPMCuo,hey everyone be even a girl tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new logic mixtape Bobby Tarantino to logic very young very popular Maryland rapper new mixtape the sequel to his 2016 Bobby Tarantino tape also following up his hit album last year everybody one of the biggest rap records of the decade really and if Bobby Tarantino too was another album another commercial effort I might kind of be excited for it but Bobby Tarantino too is not that logic this is mixtape logic which by comparison with his typical album stuff is so much less ambitious even if he does punch out a few more bangers here and there that the releases his mixtapes are a little bit more easy to listen to I was feeling even less excited about this tape given it's just a Bobby Tarantino sequel too because across the entirety of this thing logic doesn't really seem all that focused on saying anything of substance I mean sure there are a lot of lyrics here about his personal life there is a generally positive vibe across a lot of these tracks he encourages people to uh you know like themselves and stuff which is good but a lot of it doesn't really add up into much of a thematic song idea on top of that there's very little in the way of anything original here sonically meaning that once again logic is just xeroxing whatever seems to be trending in the rap world that has just kind of caught his ear for whatever reason logic just seems really really focused on on Travis Scott right now there are a few tracks that just sound like blatant Travis Scott ripoffs boom trap protocol sounds like something off of rodeo on the song Wizard of Oz he goes into this auto-tune passage that sounds exactly like what Travis Scott would do want to feature or something the song what's up with Big Sean sounds like I don't know almost like a cruel summer left over especially given the vocal sample on that track it's clear that that is a point of reference for him and he's just doing it there's some instrumental and flow nods to Drake on this tape the the song 44 more as much as I do like that track there is a point in the instrumental where you get some metallic pieces of percussion and some call-and-response vocal samples that that sound like they're straight out of Kendricks DNA which is I guess the umpteenth time that logic is copied Kendrick and it's it's all very obnoxious but if I could play devil's advocate here for a minute let me let me pitch it this way logic does this and he's been doing this for a long time and maybe the reason he's doing it is to sort of show that hey I'm a talented guy and I can copy other MCS sounds I can copy other rapper sounds let even Really Trying all that hard maybe it's in the spirit of like you know great mixtape error little Wayne where he's like grabbing somebody else's beat and just kind of body in that beat maybe logic is like just kind of come through and saying hey you know your sound your sound your sound I can do that I could do that I could do that and while in one breath maybe that is pretty cool especially for a logic fan to hear him kind of doing this musical chameleon thing I also don't think there's a whole lot to what logic is doing when he's embarking on these watered-down versions of other artists sounds because rarely do they end up as good much less better than the original and I feel like for an artist of logics talent because the dude can rap and his status in the music industry he could pretty much emulate anything he wants like producers will line up around the block to put together a beat and get paid to put together a beat to sound like artists X Y or Z for whatever his new mixtape is gonna be so again I'm kind of left at the conclusion that I feel like doing things like this is kind of a waste of logics talent and just shows an overall lack of originality but logic wearing his very contemporary influences very loudly on his sleeve is really only one of the complaints I have about Bobby Tarantino too given some of his biggest tracks as of late have featured him singing he really kind of puts the pedal to the floor on that with this project and while logic definitely did hold his own on tracks like that suicide hotline song I do enjoy that track the singing that he delivers on the track every day with production from marshmallow on that track which is like almost as bad as Jake Paul's every oh the the singing on that track is awful the sing the song overnight is is virtually unlistenable I would play a clip right now but I do not feel like I do not feel like a dmca today it's it's not a DMCA day not only that but there are so many tracks on this thing that are so short so inconsequential they feel kind of like needless bridges to nowhere which is kind of unfortunate especially for tracks that have a great beat have a great feature have real potential they just don't really have that much of a topic or a concept so logic can't really go at length on them the song state of emergency case in point the best songs on this thing generally don't really have a strong topic just kind of a fast flow a lot of charisma from logic coming off the mic and banger beat the song yuck the song forty-four more and the song warm it up which goes into more of a boom bap direction all those tracks are great love all those tracks but that's about it for songs on this thing that I think are actually some of logics best I guess another thing I could give this project is that the features generally are pretty good although I can't tell 100% of the time if that's because the they're truly great or if I'm just happy to be hearing somebody else other than logic on the microphone because while he does have a lot of flow he does have a lot of rhythm he doesn't have a whole lot of song ideas I mean the most focused song idea on this thing is The Wiz Khalifa track which is just basically a weed anthem but still the features on this thing are pretty good The Wiz Kalifa feature I think is one of his least irritating in a long time Big Sean's feature is actually pretty tongue-in-cheek pretty funny I love the line where he says he sticks to the code like a finishing move or him saying that he's so blessed he's gonna drop a gospel album the production is pretty bouncy it's smooth that's bass heavy it's more intricate than your average track production but I don't know nothing super cutting-edge unfortunately Bobby Tarantino - it's it's just as passable it's just as average as its predecessor so I don't know I just have a hard time justifying any kind of excitement for a mixtape like this a guy who has a mid to high level of technical ability not a whole lot in terms of an original sound obviously ripping off ideas left and right from his contemporaries not a whole lot in the way of focused song I is or themes or concepts not a whole lot in terms of quotable one-liners or jokes or bits of wordplay songs are super short not very well-structured a lot of the time again I guess the flows are there the production is there positive vibe is there but outside of that Bobby Tarantino too does not really have much going on for it I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing Tran wake up Morty wake up you gotta wake up we're about to go on another wild and crazy adventure Morty okay well I called the aux cord uh really Morty I'm tired of listening to rust Morty I'm tired of listening to Russ I'm not gonna believe rust grandpa Rick why because there's a new logic mixtape out no because there's a new love dammit look I know you Morty I know you couldn't resist hearing that corny cornball copy Travis Scott whose tab is Scott okay Morty I get it you have to be of a certain level of intelligence to get Travis's music I get it this is why you'll never get the aux cord Marty this is why you'll never get the aux cord we're listening to rodeo and I'm deleting your Spotify account 
kWFTOmDsgd0,"[Music] hooray it's here it's here it's here it's another episode of it came from band camp where I go through a bunch of weird stuff that's on band camp it's pretty self-explanatory let's let's get into it the first one in the list here that I'm going to talk about is a release that was at one time on band camp not on band camp anymore and that is an old mixtape from the late 90s that apparently Tom Hardy rapped all over yes the actor Tom Hardy mixtape late 90s so the mixtape went up onto band camp apparently was like uploaded by the dude who he was working with on the tape because they were officially a duo and it did not take long for it to get taken down however the mixtape is still floating around on the internet it's it's currently on YouTube right now so this is kind of a band camp release was that one time at band camp release what let's preview a little bit of it [Music] that is some wild rugged English boy rap he's like he's like the British wu-tang you can tell the late 90s he was that dude who was he was bringing real rap back he was bringing that real rap back just cut just coming straight out of England it's it's a fun time it's a fun listen okay look let's not spent on that this next one is an interesting one comes comes as a direct recommendation from my dude Austin it is a release by the name of troll from none other than James Ferraro it is reworked excerpts from two operas James put out last year bio meme morphogenesis and the deluge a couple of tracks featured legendary Vocaloid Hatsune a Miku got some sweet Vocaloid collaborations coming down the pipe they're gonna take over James looking more dapper than ever in his band camp profile photo I do love that tie and his hair is looking quite luscious I'm gonna give a shot to the track bio sewer and we'll we'll see where that takes us [Music] that's pretty sick I like that quite a bit I love his melodic progressions I love his chord progressions on this track some some of the mixing and some of the layering I think is pretty genius I love the way the vocals feel I'm kind of disembodied and and weird and robotic it's kind of surreal and disturbing though the track does make me think that if I only had MIDI instruments to listen to for the rest of my life I would I would want it I still though I think a lot of the ideas on this track are really cool and can we just say that this mspaint looking cover art of an alien busting out of the body of some guy like assuming he's just kind of writhing on the floor in pain is is fucking amazing this next one's gonna be a fun one you guys are gonna enjoy this one it's it's called Bullet For My Bloody Valentine the the loveless poison so this is basically an album where the music of My Bloody Valentine and the music of Bullet For My Valentine are mashed up and layered on top of what nothing and slowed down into a droney ambience and it's it's actually not as awful as you might assume just based on the description and we are going to sample the track I only hit the floor I hope this person didn't give themselves like tinnitus or something at editing and and producing this III hope that's not the case but yeah this is this is actually quite nice it's very ambient it's very washy it's actually pretty intoxicating it kind of reminds me of a lot of those weird I guess you could call them remixes that were coming out a little while back where they take a very popular pop song and sort of stretch it out till it's like slowed down a thousand percent and then lo and behold it becomes this elegant beautiful gorgeous ambient peace seems like we're undergoing a similar process here but it seems like the layers and everything is just like thicker more ambient more blissful but whatever this person has done to achieve this sound it's a it's quite beautiful quite stimulating okay on this next one since we've already opened up the mash-up floodgates is another mashup project where we have basically the the music of MF DOOM being pulled together with the music of oh god I can't even say the music of crust punk band doom which of course those were going to come together at some point eventually so let's give a shot to the track strange system and see see what we're working with [Laughter] which have a man trapped in speaker laughing people to the memory just another felony to arrest anything could be the one - ugh - the best Sally that when they get hungry Strangeways it's actually kind of cool to hear this because I think it actually sheds some light on the commonality between these genres of music that we see as being so separate because the the flow that doom approaches this song with could easily be applied to a number of hardcore songs but instead of just screaming these lyrics at the top of his lungs with a kind of a Punk delivery or a metal delivery he's just kind of calmly rapping the words out but still the rhythm in the flow of his words could be thrown onto this kind of riff onto this kind of track easily and it would totally fit on it so it actually doesn't sound as out of place as you might assume just from you know the names attached to the thing now what would an episode of it came from and can't be with without some covers this is a covers album from hanging dong which I guess is a project related to the music board on 4chan collectively they have gotten together and have decided to do a bunch of Beatles covers oh nice there's Cal chesta right there on the album cover oh and and there's also me and Yoko Ono and MC ride and elliot rodger what the fuck either way they have managed to come together with 51 Beatles covers I really don't know where to start on this thing so honestly I'm going to pick one of my favorite Beatles songs whichever song is one of my favorites that ends up stopping me in my tracks I am going to play happiness is a warm gun I love that song the structure of this song is amazing okay [Music] she's well-acquainted with the touch of velvet hand like a lizard on a windowpane I don't know if I care for the the acoustic direction the the all acoustic direction we we need some bells and whistles on that track we need some bells and whistles on that track let's try taxman though mildly interesting the weird low phytate got it some obvious musical embellishments missing here and there but it's it's kind of interesting direction they took it a hard day's night let's do it Oh God not now this this is what I came to expect and I as bad as it is I'm glad I'm getting it someone whistling in the background is someone whistling is there is there like a lone Whistler just continually just I want to try so many of these tracks but we can't try them all let's let's go for come together one of the most recognizable bass lines in rock history let's see if they do it justice [Music] does no one own a bass does anyone own a fucking bass all right we're gonna finish it off here with something which i think is one of the greatest love songs of all time so let's see if hanging dong is able to achieve the same level of beauty and finesse in their rendition of something of course of course it's with a ukuleles [Music] yeah you know never trust a white person with a ukulele that's that's my advice in life next we're going to be revisiting with an artist we have talked about before on the it came from band camp series impossible nothing someone who originally caught my attention for his amazing and prolific beat music and electronic music albums with like an entire record with a track named after every letter of the alphabet and each song is ten minutes long who the hell does that I don't know so since that band camp release impossible nothing has actually dropped quite a bit of material on the platform this record over here is his latest it is titled chronometer namah namah con chronometer makan cron nem n nomicon Crone this thing is 26 tracks of course every single song is ten minutes we're just gonna try the twelfth track l and and see where it takes us complex I mean it's not just it might not be just such a simple fire the fire whoa whoa put that fire on hold turn down the heat for a minute oh thankful thank you thank the Lord okay okay okay bring it bring it bitch [Applause] that's some trap inspired hi-hats right there that's some trap inspired hi-hats [Applause] those horns the horns [Applause] [Music] I like how consistently layered and dense and intricate and detailed this guy's stuff is and yet he sticks pretty hard to that Lofa aesthetic everything's kind of distorted everything's kind of grimy maybe it's a little too brittle at points but still I like the way he kind of makes things sound a little messy but also very very refined okay we have one more artist in this episode of the it came from band camp series it's it's Graham Lampkin salmon run and amateur doubles as Austin tells me over here sound artist Ram Lampkin recently joined band camp making his previously out-of-print solo albums available digitally salmon run is his most well known album and is considered a modern music concret masterpiece followed by amateur doubles which consists of extended prog based loops assembled and recorded in a moving car I'm down I'm down for that shit let's try the track Glink a mix [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] very interesting very pretty very intriguing it reminds me of a lot of like Old English vocal pieces like gospel pieces but there's just something about the editing and the processing of all that makes it sound really otherworldly and surreal and just very strange and weird plus all those effects and sounds kind of making a racket in the background gives that gives the track a weird sense of place as well but god I love the vocals on that I love the way the vocals are processed and treated on that track it's very uh it's it's regal it's experimental I know it just feels vaguely religious we are also going to give a shot to this amateur doubles track 3,000 miles away let's it's let's let's give a little preview it is 18 minutes we're only gonna hear a bit of it but still [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I mean from what I'm hearing so far there's a pretty interesting piece there elements of what feels like progressive synth music in here jazz music in here ambient music like almost like a space prog kind of thing but it's obviously coming from a lot of these sounds and genres had a very experimental angle yeah it's very compelling its compelling it's compelling and I'll leave it at that this has been another episode of it came from band camp all of the artists all the projects that we talked about in this episode are linked down below if you

1KlxNiSkblY,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over with you guys what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week let's go first I have to mention our sponsor I know that a lot of you guys are into live music live musical performances I know I am that's why I'm tired right now because I saw a bunch of shows this weekend I saw David Byrne I saw Alex Cameron so I'm a little I'm a little dead tired right now but for those of you who have not been to shows all weekend and are looking for more shows to go to specifically in the Texas area during South by Southwest the good people over feed bands who have done sponsorships with the channel before are doing a March

that's gonna be linked down below along with the Facebook event link to this event along with the Eventbrite link to this event so be there thanks again to feed bands for sponsoring us and like I said not only should you check out this event but check out what they have to offer over there on the site for music fans and music artists as well you know they do interesting vinyl runs for independent artists and they're getting a lot of good a good underground artists music printed all right guys all right all right or right or right or right let's get into I think one shadow that I have to do of course our Amazon and turntable lab associate links are down there in the description box if you guys want to treat yourselves but also our good friend Frank chap si has a new project out Frank Jeff C of volume 2.2 it's out any of via Bandcamp and all other platforms streaming platforms or you can typically find mr. jab C's music he has asked me not to review this it's I he said to me Anthony my EP is a 10 and I that's that's it's it's gonna totally ruin you and destroy your brand if if you go and review it and it's I don't want that to happen to you so he's just a good he's a dear friend he's looking out for me he's worried about me you know he wants me to be well so I guess just know that he says it's a 10 he says the best thing he's ever come out with so there you go it's a link down there in the description box for you to check out cool cool alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week I just got a text from my good friend Jeremy over here who typically assembles the single art to these the these segments and he texted me he said fuck I forgot The Decemberists cover art which is hilarious thank you very much Jeremy the The Decemberists have a new single out the single is obviously going to make it into the worst tracks segment this week the single is titled once in my life which is actually the amount of times that I want to hear this song just just one time in my life no more than in one single time please thank you really they're kind of quaint funky sound is is really truly wearing thin and I feel like they've kind of painted themselves into a very annoying kitschy on creative corner and I'm not really sure how to explain it outside of that so thank you very much Jeremy for that shout out to Jeremy alright moving on from they're not really into the new zoo and tame impala collaborative track my life I guess I don't mind conceptually him going in a more electronic direction with tame impala since that's kind of weird things seem to be going as far as musical trends overall and he seemed to take to electronics pretty well on the last team Impala record currents but to me just kind of coming out with some very bland eerie I don't know just like techno house fusions is just really uninteresting me I guess but that's just me that's just me moving on from there the new xxx tent Ozzy own track that came out last week which actually on the surface the song to sound that bad it's got a hooky little vocal melody but what kind of made this song wane for me was that it's really redundant it's really repetitive like much of his other tracks I don't really know if he knows much about structuring a song and on top of that the deeper I got into the lyrics the more disturbed I got because if I'm reading them correctly it comes off kind of like a threat to kill yourself if somebody like leaves you or distances themselves from you which is a grossly manipulative maybe a behavior that somebody else he knows exhibited and he's kind of just commenting on it but either way the the framing of that isn't quite clear if that's the case and it's just just seems like a really gross manipulative track to me I don't know but again that's just me moving on from there let's get into this next track from sting and Shaggy yeah this is this collaborative album it's it's it's still coming it's really happening it's it's real life guys it's we're not we're not lying to you sting and Shaggy they do have a collaborative album coming out and this new song is titled morning is coming it sounds just as phoned in as the last track it could barely even sit through it and oh also Lily Allen has too painfully boring tracks out titled three and higher and I'm not really sure what I need to say about these songs other than that let's let's get into the tracks thought it was kind of man not terrible but not amazing either you know these tracks I felt like they were worth bringing up worth mentioning worth pointing your attention toward remember every track that I mentioned in this segment is linked down there in the description box so you can hear it all for yourself let's see new vince staples track this song it's it's alright you know get to get the fuck off my dick it's not one of his better tracks and in fact I don't really think it's meant to be one of his better tracks to me this song is just kind of a follow up of that big kind of meme promotional campaign he had earlier in the week get off my dick where he's essentially daring his haters to fund a two million dollar GoFundMe to make him go away which even if that did end up happening I sort of questioned how long he would actually go away if he would ever really truly go away permanently because honestly an artist at Vince staples level he's he's said to make way more than two million dollars over the course of the rest of his career so I don't know I haven't read the fine print or anything so maybe the agreement was that he would go away for a limited period of time or whatever but just two million dollars even if it's just kind of all at once I don't know to me Vince staples in the long run he's gonna make way more than two million and as an artist is worth much more so if anything I feel like he kind of low-balled himself but that's just me but the song itself is okay it's kind of redundant it's kind of repetitive but you know if you're into the meme if you're under the joke it's kind of funny this new track from Ash a day is out whoo whoo whoo flower of the universe it's kind of pretty tuned nice pretty epic elegant tune for this note for this new Disney a wrinkle and time soundtrack the track certainly sounds better than some of the weird costumes that I've seen in the previews for the movie so I guess well I guess we'll say that moving on from there new Peggy new JPG mafia definitely not as hard or as crazy or as experimental as a lot of the cuts off of Peggy's recent veteran project which if you haven't heard is one of my favorite rap records of the year but certainly worth checking out definitely a fun cut next this new song from ohoo though this is the new Grouper track part lot this it was kind of hard to kind of say what exactly makes this track cutting edge because I don't really feel like there's not a lot about than that makes it super cutting edge you know I read her and more sound intensive and and ambient and jeroni stuff this to me was just very a distant very minimal very uh I guess a moody piano ballad without a whole lot of structure to it it was nice and pleasant while it was on but maybe a lot of other tracks on this forthcoming project that is linked down there below on Bandcamp maybe maybe a lot of the other tracks had the same vibe so it'll all reinforce each other or something as an entire project so I don't know maybe this one song by itself doesn't hold a lot of weight but maybe in the context of the record new dr. octagon second single to drop from this project so far this one to me lyrically it was much less gimmicky than the last track much more enjoyable excuse me check out dr. got octagon if you haven't it's been decades since dr. octagon has teased toward a brand-new full-length album shout out to Kool Keith next Ben frost has a new project on the way this new song over here is titled self-portrait in ultra marine again a song that a lot like a lot of the material from his previous record really love the sounds really the really love the textures but the melodic composition of the track the structure of the track kind of left a lot to be desired for me wasn't too exciting didn't really keep me on the edge of my seat but still Ben frost does incredible things with sound and with texture to me he's an ambient artist whose sound treatments are very very vivid and if you could even call him an ambient artist I mean is a jiron artist experimental music artist really lovely he does the sound love his sound play it's usually very textured very noisy so also wanted to shout out which is linked down there in the description box the new Joey badass slash xxx tent Ozzy own collaborative track which isn't too bad you know it's not amazing but still I'm kind of sitting here wondering like what like why why I feel like Joey creatively and artistically is like so far in a head of X and I don't know I I just feel like creatively there on two totally different planets and I guess I just don't really see the I don't know I I guess I guess I just don't see the draw and now that I've heard both of them on this remix I don't know I'm kind of sitting here wondering like what are both of them really going to bring to a collaborative project but I don't know I guess I'll just wait and see I suppose okay let's get into the first best track of this week new uncle Adams single friends over enemies a lot of you guys might know uncle Adams as a Canadian rapper bit of a music meme I've talked about his music before a lot of people have portrayed his music in a very negative light and he's come out with some goofy tract he's come out with some questionable tracks however this new single over here it's one of his better produced tracks one of his better written tracks it's got a pretty compelling music video attached to it too dude's actually coming through some pretty smart heartfelt stuff and wanted to celebrate the fact he's come out with something really good this time around and also wanted to shout him out and thanked him for being a good sport doing that interview with me on the second channel not too long ago so shout out to my good dude uncle Adams alright next this new song the club from Hines the garage rock sort of a indie rock or indie pop quartet this new song over here really catchy chorus as I said kind of fuzzy buzzy mix it's got a lot of a bratty energy to it that I like quite a bit it's very fun tune this new song over here from serpent with feet bless your heart killer imaginative inventive I don't know it's it's it's really just like from another frigging planet and that's all I can really say about it right now that's all I could think to accurately describe it like they're elements of it that feel like are coming from the artpop realm the avant-garde realm the R&B realm it's it's really all over the place it's beautiful it's serene it's really like so friggin ahead of the curve I'm just really not sure how to completely make heads or tails of it but I know that it sounds gorgeous I know that it sounds inspired and it sounds like everything that I heard recently from that EP dropped under the serpent with a feet name a little while back but just kind of elevated you know just just elevated and I'll leave it at that moving on from there this new paul de jong track you fucking sucker Paul of formerly of why am I being an idiot the books came out with a new track over here a new solo project coming out soon via temporary residence records and this experimental sample based folky number is hilariously foul at points when the at least in regards to the lyrics the guitar passages are pretty cute too it's kind of a weird song for Paul but honestly I'm loving it I think it's got a lot of character to it I think it's really fun I think it's got a good sense of humor but it's also kind of a catchy - I don't know if you check out any song on this list this week just for its oddity do this one next Oh new parquet courts track wide awake I love this song I want more music like this this is great this is fantastic this track has showmanship this track has personality it has energy as a great be a great groove I'm just like falling apart here I'm tired but I'm still I'm still excited enough about this track to sing its praises and tell you how incredible I think it is I don't know I just really love the catchy lyrics I'll have the attitude of the song this is one of parquet courts gutsiest songs but honestly that was also the case for the last single off of this project - so maybe this is gonna be parquet courts gutsiest album I don't know just all I can say is fuck yes to this track fuck yes Niko case hell on is the title of the new track over here that's a very elegant epic singer-songwriter tune a lot of dark music passages on it as well kind of love the multi-faceted vibe of the structure on this track it's kind of epic and looking forward to her new record she's really never come out with a terrible one so really no reason to believe that this next one won't be fire to singularity god I'm just I'm just falling apart over here I'm just falling the fuck apart singularity singularity oh this is this is the new John Hopkins emerald rush beautiful tune great chord chopping on this track I'm just gonna leave it at that it's great fucking song new Big Ups track PPP these guys are kind of taking that whole like I don't know post-punk post hardcore experimental rock who the fuck knows what it is like noise rock thing to a new level like I don't even know where they're at you know they're just like a totally different point on the map and it's freaky it's freakish it's animalistic it's fucking off-the-wall shit so Big Ups to my dude dudes and Big Ups new beach house track yes this is the most cutting-edge shit that they've done since since Teen Dream this is the most cutting-edge shit they've done since that record this is the first time since that record I feel like the duo has been legitimately trying to like experiment with their sound in a super tangible way and I don't know like the ideas and sort of the distortion and the weird mixing like it's enough to make me rethink maybe my feelings on the previous track which I did not like at all but now I'm actually like kind of excited I want to hear Beach House take a risk because that you you can't be this pitch work darling forever transcend that you know and and it feels like they're they're trying to challenge it a little bit with this new track over here you know it's got that same dreamy sound but it's a little noisier it's got some bite to it you know there's something kind of weird about it and kind of ambitious too so I'm loving that and this new Anderson PAC track over here which was attached to a new music video featuring fka twigs dancin like crazy definitely not as rich melodically and is funky as a lot of the material that we typically hear pack on there's kind of like a weird still stillness and in minimalism to the instrumental on this track but I still think vocally he's got a lot going on and I think there's a lot of good things about this track about this song and that has been the weekly track roundup guys hopefully I've kept it together relatively because I am I'm about to turn this camera off get this video I'll wrapped up and crash I'm gonna crash hard really hard guys really crash really hard alright you're the best I love you I'll see you in the next video forever 
0dVNV1Q5jjU,hi everyone Anthony Benton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new on a Vaughn house wolf album dead magic this is the fourth full-length album from Swedish organist composer singer-songwriter Donovan house wolf whose career I've been following kind of casually since her twenty twelve albums ceremony and I still found her music pretty compelling even though there were some some obvious shortcomings for me the instrumentals maybe weren't active or vivid or dense enough the vocals might have felt a little bit too distant difficult to kind of connect with in any way significantly her music felt super abstract but not incredibly fulfilling at times but still her records had a lot of characteristics that just continued to haunt me the varied roni and dreamy organ escapes her very eerie singing style her music felt mystical and occult and strange had this very dark and neoclassical kind of gothic aesthetic now all of that and more appears on this latest record from Anna along with some very linear meditative experimental rock passages sometimes sounding a lot like what's been popping up on the three latest Swans albums but with more of like an orchestral or a classical edge there are also moments where Anna's music reminds me of that of Julia halter but maybe with a more of an edgy and dark and nightmarish sound I think fans of Jenny Hvar would appreciate what Anna's doing here too and vocally on this album I occasionally get a Kate Bush vibe but obviously Anna comes too much different artistic conclusions is on an entirely different journey one influenced more by contemporary experimental rock and classical music than Kate Bush could have ever been because I kind of get that similarity more from Bush's earlier career not so much from her later and more I guess accessible releases her bigger releases like hounds of love this album is 47 minutes it's spread across five tracks so of course with that ratio you're gonna get a few lengthy monsters in the tracklist here and each song really kind of has its own progression and feel the mysterious vanishing Elektra is one of the somewhat shorter songs and the track list here is loaded with these heavy primal riffey guitars slogging their way over a patient groove orbiting around these riffs are some spacey acoustic guitars and and they're topped with Anna's howling voice the intensity of this track just grows higher and higher and higher as it moves along and if any song on here is kind of like a dead ringer for a track off of swans to be kind or their last record the glowing man it's it's this one the marble eye is this very long solo organ piece loaded with these gothic chord progressions and classical arpeggios it very much adds to the feel of this album has an odyssey as a journey because this record is more than just simply a set of songs it's kind of like this tapestry it's a progression it's like a large experimental thematic music piece with just different movements and sections because this very evocative Oregon Odyssey is what brings us into the dreamy ballad that is a closing track which while I wasn't impressed with Anna's more subtle vocal approach on this track I much preferred the the bolder singing she delivered earlier on the album it's still a very pretty song my only true disappointment with the track is that I just wish the ending was a bit more built out and solid the song to me sort of seems to fizzle out of nowhere I was kind of hoping for a more elongated droning outro that I could just kind of coast out on just send me out to sea for a Vikings burial given the track is seven minutes long I feel like there was plenty of time to possibly build up the outro to this track so it doesn't just end so abruptly but whatever I haven't even talked about the two largest and most core tracks to the entire record which is really where a majority of this album's ambitions lie there's the 16 minute ugly and vengeful which starts up a lot like a post rock song has some Godspeed You black emperor vibes right at the intro I'd say just this apocalyptic ambience eventually a rush of heavy guitars but what's kind of different in Anna's case because it's not just some second wave post rock ripoff is you have this totally different vocal approach obviously a different approach to chord progressions this organ this devilish vibe the emotion of it - I mean again to go back to the singing Anna's singing on this track for me as transcendental when she hits those Wow like those highest most passionate highs I feel like I'm being transported into another friggin dimension the last leg of the song is kind of like a really weird jammy blend of prog rock and post rock sounds it's pretty cool and then there's the intro track the 12-minute the truth the glow the fall which has a very chilly moody organ intro I feel like I'm paralyzed laying flat in a forest leaves are falling on me I'm deteriorating I'm just being buried with snow and rain and debris it also helps that lyrically I'm just catching a lot of nature themes throughout the album - the middle point of the track eventually builds up some percussion the instrumentation starts to ascend build up tension for the final leg of the track that is kind of this very droney shoegazing layering of guitars and a lot of other instrumentation it's just gorgeous there's an aura around it it's a really blissful there's an overwhelming fullness and brightness to it I mean for such a long track it does have a very fulfilling finish and that's pretty much it those are the five tracks which again come together pretty well as a holistic piece of music dead magic there are some moments where yeah Anna does kind of where her influences on her sleeve and I am left not just with the final track but just in general wanting more from her and from this record as well but still I ended up really enjoying what Anna had to offer on this record and it is hands down easily her best work to date I'm feeling a strong seven to a late eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it your the best year the best what should I review next hit the life you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana on oana bon house wolf forever 
iSK2hb2z0us,ah hi everyone smash is coming to the switch here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new titus andronicus album a productive cough this is the fifth full-length album from Glen Rock New Jersey band Titus Andronicus a group that despite some lineup changes and music style changes over the years is still the the brainchild of singer-songwriter Patrick Stickles and I went into this record with a lot of positive vibes a lot of happy thoughts not just because I thought some of the teaser material for it sounded really good but also the band's last album the most lamentable tragedy was truly a record that lived up to its name it was like this overly long unbearably lo-fi folk rock opera in five acts in one breath while I appreciated the ambition of this LP that Patrick was really reaching for the stars with it I also found the album to be kind of unlistenable this new album though is much more manageable by comparison it's just seven tracks that are 46 minutes in length and for the most part it sounds like Patrick and company are indulging the sounds of like bar band rock or some Heartland rock but with a socially conscious edge that takes a more punk-rock and anarchist tone which in concept for me sounds like a pretty cool idea I mean this style of music is typically pretty blue-collar doesn't shy away from addressing or talking about the problems that face and affect the working-class and that is an element of this genre that Patrick is really quick to embrace especially on tracks like realtalk as well as is more personal rendition of Bob Dylan song like a rolling stone my issue with this album though comes mostly down to execution because even though I like what titus andronicus is doing aesthetically the performances and the writing on this album will leave a lot to be desired because their tracks on this thing that become painfully tedious before they're even close to finishing like the song Real Talk we're at the five-minute mark you pretty much get the idea of the song if someone so says that such-and-such is this bad then we're in for a really bad or wha that's pretty much the lyrical rubric for the entire track and it gets so tiresome maybe if I was in a bar and saying loudly with other people with a few beers and me it would sound more exciting but hmm and then we have the song home alone which yet again is another piece of very strung out bar band rock which does very little to justify its 8 minute runtime outside of some very mild jamming and guitar solos and reiterating maybe some of the most silly refrains Stickles has ever wrote mommy's not home daddy's not home nobody's home I'm home alone like what and then you have the vocal performances on this thing like on the opening track number one in New York the song sounds like the longest and worst sing-along ever it's kind of like a teary-eyed piano let pub rock tune but there are all these vocal layers on the track half of which sound like they are trying to sing the song and a slurred drunken stupor meanwhile another chunk of the vocals sound like they've forgotten the lyrics entirely and they're just trying to mouth along with what Patrick is singing it sounds really terrible really sloppy and I kind of get the same vocal vibe off the song mass-transit madness which to me is is just as unlistenable there are a couple strokes of genius on the album above the bodega for sure is one a really catchy passionate tune it's hard not to get wrapped up in especially since the lyrics and the message of the song are so smart basically talking about how easy it is to confide in or find comfort in strangers and and the difficulty patrick has keeping secrets from them I really love the lyrics of the track crass tattoo despite the fact that it is yet another moment that I feel the vocal performances are kind of underwhelming and uninteresting I really love the lyrics on the track crass tattoo even if it is a song that to me vocally is very underwhelming and then I really do enjoy Titus Andronicus his rendition of like a rolling stone I like the angle of personal suffering that Patrick takes with the lyrics as he kind of changes them to be about him instrumentally their take on the track is actually really fun wild sweaty it has a certain kind of gusto to it while staying very true to the original blueprint of the song but outside of those couple of cuts I really don't enjoy much about this album it just feels to me to be like a an unsatisfying mess it's like on the cusp of something great and yet it continues to shoot itself in the foot again and again and again as I think Patrick and company kind of rely a little bit too much on this whole heartland rock aesthetic to make the album appealing when really it should be the songs and it should be the singing and it should be the musicianship that pulls listeners in not the novelty of mimicking the sound of a bar band I'm feeling a light too decent five on this thing transitioned have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best

tLWPSqE0DC4,hi everyone yellow flannel are here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Andrew W K album you're not alone Andrew W K is a new york-based multi-instrumentalist songwriter folk hero and avid partier and you're not alone is his latest full-length LP andrew has been at this music thing for a long time but his first big musical breakthrough came in the early 2000s and the shape of his debut album I get wet a near novelty album that took the anthemic sounds of arena rock and took them to just the most sugary and enthusiastic extremes imaginable a sound that even the most Brighton upbeat rock bands of today have have not caught up with yet this album also sported a mix that was so bright and so saturated like it was difficult to listen to closely for the entirety of the album it's kind of like staring into the Sun despite its obvious flaws I get wet is actually in my opinion one of the best rock albums of the 2000s now andrew kept the party going for a few more records going even more noisy and experimental with the wolf a few years later also incorporating some grander pianos more epic instrumentation and some interesting instrumental interludes on the following album close calls with brick walls and while both of these albums also had highlights on them to me the whole very surface level party party party was wearing a little thin it was clearly a stick but still Andrews instrumental and compositional ambitions seem to get bigger in a way with every record to the point where a few years later with albums like Cadillac 55 and Gundam Rock he was literally indulging in ambient music and new-age music and in rock opera now around this time Andrew kind of bowed out of music for a little bit at least as a recording artist he was helping to run one of the biggest clubs in New York at the time the Santos party house opened in 2008 ended operations in 2016 and with that I guess andrew is now making his grand turn to music and what a grand return this album is this record is a massive musical run standing at 52 minutes and the emotions and sentiments of this album are huge as well this is kind of the Andrew W K that we've always known and loved but he's a little more mature and experienced and just filled with sagely advice I mean this is still a very kitschy thunderous arena rock album loaded with roaring guitars and glitzy synthesizers dramatic drumming and of course Andrew W K is very throaty masculine growls which he occasionally switches out of here and there for some vocal performances that are a bit more I guess elegant more vulnerable the vibe of this album on the whole is feel good its celebratory its triumphant its motivational and to kind of get to the maturity of this album while this record is still about partying and the songs mentioned partying in numerous contexts partying is is no longer literal it's it's much more metaphorical this time the party becomes more of a philosophy than an actuality and the ethos of which is facing down your fears overcoming obstacles always trying always trying succeeding not shrinking in the face of a challenge rolling with life's punches and the flow of this album despite how long it is it's pretty sweet and packed with highlights one of the opening tracks on here music is worth living for is in true Andrew W K fashion with blaring guitars and glistening since a huge sing-along chorus Andrews music is sounding more life-affirming than ever and maybe this is just a personal bias here but I just personally identified with the song so much oh god if it weren't for music I'd probably kill myself I'm not even joking and I'm not even talking about right now it it would have happened a while ago the song I don't know is an exciting throttling rock tune about just it being okay that you don't know how everything's gonna work out you don't know exactly what you're doing or where you're going in life you're going to have moments where you're unsure the song features driving drums very forceful but elegant keys of course the mix is super phat super heavy super saturated its pummeling it's exciting this track and so many others on this album as well are incredibly assuring and welcoming and warm I get the feeling I get the sensation that Andrews trying to reach out through this album and help me and help anybody listening to this record it's literally a 52 minute self-help arena rock opera in addition to tracks like this there are several spoken word interludes where Andrew continues to give very much needed advice and perspective the song give up on you is some fantastic Lichter anthem shet it opens up with some very beautiful and powerful vocal and piano and guitar layering sounds very epic sounds very dramatic there are moments on this album that to me come off as epic as a queen or a meatloaf track but of course it's executed with Andrews usual bluntness and brashness the song keep going continues a lot of these same themes it's pretty much a motivational anthem meanwhile tracks like The Devil's on your side kind of analyze the yin and yang of life the light and darkness of our human existence in a spoken word piece Andrew displays the devil and darkness as almost like something to overcome something to challenge you something to help you something to kind of educate you about life and in the song he almost displays the devil as almost like being a cheerleader for for you now this track along with break the curse has maybe one of the most amazing and gigantic instrumental builds on the entire record at this point I think you kind of get the idea of what we're dealing with with these songs like we're always being motivated we're always being pushed we're always being inspired the instrumentation is always huge it's always blood pumping it's always trying to elicit these powerfully triumphant feelings the song total freedom is a nice change of pace on the album vocally and instrumentally oddly enough the song sounds like what might have come of a collaboration between the killers and Coldplay both of their creative peaks in the 2000s meanwhile you're not alone is a totally excellent closure not only instrumentally but philosophically for an album of this style it's nice to hear a record that that ends pretty much as strongly as it begins my one major critique of the album is that it is a little OneNote instrumentally it points it is a little OneNote emotionally it's a little bloated at 52 minutes there are a few tracks in the middle that to me while they are more low-key I could see the the change of pace andrew is trying to bring here it does create a tiny little low in the tracklist tracks like party mindset and the party never dies but honestly these tracks I don't even really dislike them they're not even awful songs it's just that maybe given the versatility Andrew showed on tracks like give up on you in total freedom it would have been nicer for him - I don't know experiment or take another risk or do something a little different with these two tracks outside of that though I think this is a really great record it's a fantastic comeback for Andrew I think it's a very entertaining rock album very fun album and it's rare that you get a record that is just bleeding and oozing with so much just raw positivity and is trying to inspire its listeners to feel the same way I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this record transition have you given this wonderful inspiring album a listen did you love it did you hate it

6VJulC5QLhY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tory Lanez album memories don't die this is the second full-length album from Ontario rapper Tory Lanez following up 2016 I told you never really did a formal review of that album unfortunately it was just way too long way too cumbersome packed in with all of these unnecessary skits respect to Tory on that though he was like a stream trolling pioneer because why record like 30 50 songs when you could just like record 15 and do a skit every other track I mean goddamn but outside of that will really let me down with that album was just Tory's inconsistent style he just felt like a very focused group part rapper part singer kind of an amalgamation of trendy styles and his contemporaries obviously trying to shoot for the mainstream but not really having that unique creative spark to maintain anyone's attention within it I don't doubt the dude has raw talent I mean he certainly had enough of it to pull off a sway 5 fingers of death freestyle but very little of that grit and lyrical talent actually turns up on this new album outside of the very rare heartbreakingly introspective and personal moment on this album like these song pieces featuring 50 cent whose lyrics are actually so cutting and in so painfully sad it's actually a difficult song to listen to all the way through so while you may get a few moments like that on this record what Tory mostly focuses on with this album are things like very breathy bland Airy gentrified dancehall occasionally Tory is even singing on this album and this really I don't know auto-tuned very odd baby voice that doesn't even sound like him it actually makes me think I'm listening to a different performer entirely especially on tracks like skrt skrt whose lyrics devolve into absolute trash by the way a bulk of this album actually kind of flows a lot like Drake's more life playlist except maybe it's a little bit more formal the song seemed a little bit more purposeful a little bit more structured but overall this album is just as much musical wallpaper and while I don't totally mind that sound I guess what I'm listening to Drake do it I feel like I'm actually listening to Drake not just someone merely copy him it's actually kind of weird Tory Lanez does not really seem all that shy about biting from champagne poppy on this record I mean I get it he's a fellow Canadian he has looked at like a god-king in the rap game he does set the creative tone for the mainstream in a lot of ways so yeah Drake's influence is felt in multiple corners of the industry but it doesn't change the fact that songs like B BW w as well as benevolent sound like Drake leftovers like circa if you're reading this it's too late I even get Drake vibes on this album when Tory is like delving into these very personal very confessional tracks like on tell me or don't die I mean the consistently smoky Spacey moody trap music we're beyond the point of if you're reading this is too late it's just kind of like if you're copying this you're too late so not only is this album very nondescript painfully derivative but there's some real lame-ass features on this thing too the nav feature No thank you the fabulous feature double No thank you the future appearance on this thing is painfully average and the first four bars of The Wiz Kalifa verse on this thing is like maybe the hardest 13 seconds to listen through on this album it's really enough to hit the skip button but to get back to the UH originality of this album the song hate to say actually features a beat and a flow that has appeared on a few different tracks that are at least a couple years old one being the song 3:30 a.m. from six seconds and the song Preem from the student named are mean and the guy who produced the six second song is actually credited as a co-producer possibly an inspiration for the be on this track because the beats do sound identical they literally sound the same and I'm not really sure if there could be a bigger acknowledgement of yes I've heard this song and I'm basically going to copy it mostly this album is just really inoffensive super smooth bland pop rap occasionally it's kind of sexy on tracks like connection or even dance for me but sometimes Tori can't even manage to keep that up as some of his auto-tune vocal josè Shinzon the track busted down sound absolutely ridiculous unfortunately there's just not a whole lot of substance to this album on the whole lyrically or instrumentally there's a few flashes in the pan here and there of what might be an inkling of an authentic artist with integrity who wants to actually make a statement and has the talent to do so but for the most part Tori's just trying to write bubble gum you chew it up you spit it out and then you grab another piece of bubble gum and that's it but honestly in this case the chewing process is kind of over before the song is even done so I'm feeling light 3 on this thing it's pretty plain a lot of lame songs on here it's unimaginative and Torrey is just so similar in so many ways to his contemporaries I just fail to see the point of this album's existence transition have you given the sound boom a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comments in the comments if you're feeling like you're full of thoughts ok Anthony

hE0DlvHdwuA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quick little review of this new Reggie Snow album dear Annie this is the big debut full-length record from this Irish rapper that I've been following for a little while now he's actually got quite a few singles and EPS out it's a kind of odd that it's taken him this long to put an album together but it is a pretty big record it's a lot of tracks it's over an hour long he really wanted to step into the full-length album game in a big way I guess so I can't fault him for that and even though I'm pretty excited for the dude making this step in his career and it seems like a lot of his fans are really loving this record I personally am having a difficult time appreciating this album and in him left pretty indifferent toward a pretty lukewarm on it much like everything he's dropped up until this point however the issues I've had with his past work are almost worsened by the fact that these problems I have are stretched out for over an hour of music the main issues I have with this record being the generally hollow toothless smooth and very pleasant but forgettable jazz rap production something that I feel like in small doses can be pretty great especially if an artist is doing a super introspective track or something like that but for the amount of times that Reggie revisits that sound on this record he really does kind of make it lose its flavor it really does kind of wear out its welcome next the general lack of engaging lyricism on this record I mean for an album that is so low-key and is so subtle I went into it hoping that he would come together with more introspective tracks more tracks where it was easier to just sort of focus on the lyrics because there was so much going on as far as wordplay and narrative I would assume that's kind of gonna end up being the focus of an album that is this quiet and this subtle but lo and behold a lot of what Reggie kind of pulls together are kind of funny little quips one-liners not necessarily a bad thing but maybe something I would enjoy more if they were being portrayed a bit more bombastically or delivered in a more engaging tone which kind of Lee me too the final big issue that I have with this record and that's just Reggie's delivery and flow while for a song or two I do enjoy the very subtle very low-key whispery aesthetic that Reggie has going I certainly know a Reggie verse when I hear one I know a Reggie song when I hear one but for the long haul I have a difficult time engaging with and even being interested in these super low-key whisper raps I get that he's not the only rappers of spitting bars at this volume or with this level of subtlety or even like a monotone voice however some of those artists that go down that road that I enjoy for example kah or maybe even quoi like Chris have super unique in super eccentric qualities that almost make up for that lack of volume whereas I can't really say that's necessarily the case for Reggie with maybe the exception of some of the more melodic and ballad like tracks on this thing or the track LMFAO which given every track leading up to the song I would have never guessed you'd have gone in almost like a dance pop rap direction and actually have the track end up being one of the best on the entire record still though at the end of the day I found this project super one-dimensional super underwhelming and as interesting as it is to have a rapper putting on for Ireland and the way that Reggie does his music just isn't quite as fiery as I guess I would enjoy any rappers to be much less his so yeah pretty lukewarm on this thing over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or they link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana forever 
EB90JSzqtjQ,
grjt_FMLTTw,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd you know you know who it is and it's time for another segment of the weekly track roundup after hours in the dark where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week all the tracks that I mentioned in this video are linked down there in the description please check them out and yeah that's it without any further ado let's get into it of course we have to mention first our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there in the description box treat yourself treat yourself to yourself something nice and I want to shout out one track before we get into the worst tracks Weird Al Yankovic one of my favorite artists of all time came out with a Hamilton polka I mean if you are a Weird Al fan you probably loved his gigantic epic amazing polka pop medleys and essentially he does that just kind of treating the music from Hamilton to a polka medley it's a pretty fantastic and very seamless very amazing really one of his best medleys in my opinion so make sure to check it out it's down there in the description box all right let's get into the worst tracks of the week it was it was kind of a it's kind of a bad week and there were actually some tracks I feel like I could have put in here that I didn't but I don't want to talk forever in this segment so first this new logic track with marshmellow man I loved logics last song that 44 more track was fire it was fucking fire his flow on that track a lot of his lyrics were witty Bangor beat this track however is really terrible singsong he pop rap don't care for the instrumental at all this this is this is unfortunately when I do not enjoy a logic song understand the dude's talented I think he does come out with great tracks every once in a while but there is this tendency of his to kind of make songs that go more in this direction that totally rub me the water the long way and just are not for me but moving on from there a new Godsmack song does any does anybody need to really need to know what they're in for on this track I didn't even know they were still making music and in that that Sun logo God in high school I I saw so many people with that Sun logo worst thing ever and the tattooed I mean but also a new track from future titled I can't wife no thought I also can't put any effort into this song either this has to be one of his most wash rinse and repeat most formulaic most phoned in songs I've ever heard future on I know that like totally annoying obnoxious hook on this thing I I guess if the future fans still love it the future fans still love it but I feel like he's running out of ideas at this point if this is gonna be his biggest latest single it's just really I don't know average auto-tune trap to my ears and finally in this section new Albert Hammond Jr track set to attack probably the first single from this upcoming album of his former strokes member or I guess are The Strokes still together they're kind of on and off at this point but I use coming out with some sort of solo material here obviously Frances trouble is the record and this song to me sounds like literally just a strokes leftover like it's an okay strokes leftover but like how is Julian in the voids writing crazy experimental futuristic pop rock and you over here like still shilling this sound it just doesn't sound right it sounds awkward like if you're gonna break off from the group do something that's worth listening to outside of the group this to me just sort of sounds like a boring rehash but I digress let's go into the tracks that I thought were met not terrible not amazing certainly worth pointing your attention toward though this new track over here from unknown mortal Orchestra not in love we're just high a nice funky Pleasant little psych pop track I guess not the most instrumentally lavish or creative or catchy song I've heard from the project in this recent album cycle and and in recent years I loved the last full length record this one under well me a bit but it's still decent it's still decent this new law reverse track featuring Sufjan Stevens is a pretty nice piece of indie folk some pretty enchanting acoustic melodies on this cut that I thought were quite nice and there is there some kind of I don't know certainly a weird sort of vocal chemistry between Tver and Sufi and you you don't really think of either of them as warm singers but there is sort of an odd Ness and a standoffish nough stew both of their voices that in a weird way complements each other on this track that we thought was pretty cool next this new song over here what's what song is this this is the new ASAP ferg track if I am correct featuring Denzel curry and idk Kristi Yamaguchi very creative or wait is this is this the don't worry no more yes this is a worry no more with Diplo featuring santigold and little yachty sorry about that this track is kind of fun there are some kind of silly dumb lyrics on it but I actually do like the kind of carefree attitude of the track Santigold and yadi don't do too bad on the track at all Diplo comes to round the production here it's very fruity very summery a very colourful very fun track and I do like the the sentiment of the song too moving on from there churches have a new song out featuring Matt Berninger from obviously the national kind of a bland electronic kind of indie tronic track it's it's ok it's it's not anything to write home about in my opinion at the gates some new dense heavy kind of melodic metal here on this one not really anything groundbreaking from the band if you are unfamiliar with at the gates I recommend checking out their work they have a lot of great fantastic sort of extreme but again very melodic metal albums they're some of the best in the genre but this latest track over here didn't seem too incredible to my ears but still produce well still performed well still in the vein the style that you typically expect at the gates to perform in moving on from there this is the kristi yamaguchi track with denzel curie IDK ASAP ferg you know beats okay flows are pretty good i would say the best thing the track has going on is just the the vocal chemistry between these three and how they're different styles just complement each other on this track like each member comes through on the song and kills it but is it like the best song either the three of them have been on I don't really think so it kind of lacks a strong or an interesting hook but but still you know idk probably one of the best guest verses I've heard him on Denzel kills it as usual and Ferg seems to come back to a more colorful form on this cut so you know I'm not gonna not kind of scoff at it's pretty good cut and next or rather finally I believe this is a from the new a place to bury strangers track if I yeah that's a new a place to bury strangers track there's only one of us that's pretty dark heavy shoegaze II post-punk II track definitely one of the most sonically interesting and creatively produced that I've heard in this new album cycle given the genres of music that influence a place to bury strangers I've always wondered why just their sound scapes and their sound palettes aren't more adventurous and experimental and colorful and just kind of trippy and inventive and off-the-wall this track to me sort of seems to be taking a step in that direction even if I find the song itself to just be a little run-of-the-mill but still track worth shouting out and track worth paying attention to let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best this week the best tracks of the week remember all of them link down there below really loved this new young father's track toy not quite as structured as the last song that they put out but still very tense funky and weird experimental blend of pop music of rap music of electronic music you know there's just such an interesting cross-section of genres coming into young fathers sound these days that you really can't kind of pin them down into anyone's onra and that's part of why I love what they're doing this to me as a single didn't seem as catchy as the last track but I'm sure it'll fit into the tracklist pretty nicely you know they come through with their triple threat vocal thing in very odd again tense instrumental just kind of loving what the trio is continuing to do here seems like they're growing in really interesting ways and I'm glad that they're finally working with a more high fire recording again because while some of their best and most interesting ideas have sort of come out when they've been working with lower fire recordings I'm sort of hoping that they can come through with a something that is as impressive is as sonically interesting but just a little cleaner and a little bit I guess more mainstream you know because I would really love to see them blow up I really love to see him blow up next new void's track Julian Casablancas and the voids formerly that now they're just the voids the track is all words are made up probably the funkiest and pop iasts of all the cuts that have dropped in this album cycles so far it's linked to a really goofy ass music video - which maybe was a little off-putting for me at first but when I was just paying attention to the track I just kind of really fell in love with how quirky and tongue-in-cheek the song is to me this came off is like maybe the most fun void song ever I really don't know what to make of this upcoming album I mean I've loved every track so far that I've heard as a teaser but there are some cuts that seem a little mellow some cuts that seemed deeply experimental others that are just pure bliss and fun this album could just be all over the place and could be one of the most fun and inventive and off-the-wall rock records that we hear from Julian Casablancas and that we here this year so I don't know I'm just really looking forward to it just really looking forward to it next apparently Lorde and run the jewels are going to be going on tour soon and - I guess mark that occasion LP and killer Mike have come through with a remix of Lord's song supercut so they gret they basically grabbed her vocals and reproduced the whole thing and you know through through verses on there through some fire bars on there and shit and I love the way LP produces around Lord's voice on this track because not only does he fit her into this completely revised instrumental but the way the he produces around her and I guess I shouldn't have expected otherwise it sounds exactly like a run the jewels song like it sounds like her voice was originally meant to be in a run the jewels track and I'm sure part of the reason they did it this way is uh so they could perform this track together which I'm sure is gonna be really fucking epic live just really loved the remix really loved the revision love the way that they came together on this track I'm sure anybody who goes out to see them perform is gonna have a good time hearing uh hearing this revised version of supercut next new Jean Grey and quali Kris new music video featuring Hannibal Buress and Eric Andre one of the odder and more abstract tracks that have dropped from this forthcoming album so far but still I like a lot of the I guess uh descriptions and stereotypes and their attempt at kind of breaking these stereotypes that come up in a lot of the lyrics the track is titled gold purple and orange are really silly quirky tongue-in-cheek music video they're really on and kind of on some hipster hop shit but still I think it's a good track I think it's a interesting forthcoming album really looking forward to seeing how they end up working together for an entire LP man new jack white track over and over and over like my opinions and feelings on these new jack white singles have really run the gamut from like literally the worst song he's ever written to like holy shit like this is mind-blowing and this track falls into the the latter of the two because I just love the heavy and distorted and just like crazy guitar riffing on this track combined with the background vocalists who are so like full of personality and I don't know man it's just like a it's I don't want to say it's an awkward combination of things but it's a very unlikely combination of sounds and the the background vocalists or I guess the vocal trio that appears on the track there's their performances so I don't know it's so raw it's not like super super I guess so rehearsed that it's like perfectly in sync and clean and everything like there's definitely a wildness to that vocal trio that lands on the track that I think is really awesome and adds a lot of personality to the cut I don't know man I mean this regardless of whether it's it's great or bad this new Jack white album sounds like it's gonna be his most experimental yet that's that's for sure gonna be the case most experimental Jack white album yet which regardless of my feelings so far on every song that I've heard has me excited because honestly I feel like Jack has way too much talent to just be playing with all of these older sounds in a really unimaginative way like he is an artist who could be doing more cutting-edge shit and I'm glad he's finally taking that risk taking that dive taking that plunge because God like I feel like his solo material so far has just been so unimaginative and and now I feel like he's really just really taking it to the fucking hole on some of these new tracks so oh man new track from Ice Age featuring sky ferreira who was that looking forward to hearing her on an Ice Age track but lo and behold it's actually a great track really love horn sections on this track love how soulful this song is to me it's even better than the last song they released this to me this track feels like a a logical conclusion from a lot of the material on their last album you have a lot of this rough wild post-punk inspired rock music with this extra instrumentation it's dirty it's sweaty but it's also passionate and soulful the last track to me while it was very good it felt to me more like almost like a marching Church track which if you're familiar with you know Ice Age and the universe of side projects surrounding this this rock band then you know you're you're familiar with marching Church already if not I've done a review so check that out but to me the last track sounded a little bit more like marching Church not necessarily a bad thing but to me this track felt like oh that this is the shot of energy and an emotional fire I'm looking for moving on from there a couple more left ooh love this new everything-everything track they have a new EP out which I was not anticipating so the English art pop outfit experimental rock outfit everything everything their last length album kind of underwhelming to me a lot of the very quirky eccentric and futuristic qualities of their past efforts do not really turn up on the album in my opinion and felt like some of their blandest and most energy sapped songs yet to me though this track that I wanted to point you guys to breadwinner is not only I think a statement on modern society and and masculinity as well but also just incredibly bubbly and very colorful and very polyrhythmic instrumental which is exactly the direction that I love hearing the band going exactly where I think they succeed the most musically so just kind of love hearing them deliver that sound I don't want a very well-written tune so everything everything breadwinner and I think we have a couple more I want to shout out this new dj khaled track featuring jay-z future and Beyonce it's actually a pretty good song you know I'm not anticipating DJ Khaled's next record is gonna be good or anything like his albums do tend to be just overloaded just too many features too many tracks too many bad tracts too much hot garbage but every once in a while you do get like three to four singles out of each album that he drops that are actually great and this is one of them jay-z's verse is really great futures appearance is actually kind of thrilling and Beyonce brings an incredible amount of swagger during her portion and the track in the back end and I think that's gonna be it guys weekly track roundup is over and done with again everything is linked down there in the description for you to check out as far as the new songs and all that

m80fpwG_GGA,hi everyone Duncan afar Tanner here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new turnstile album time and space this is the Baltimore band sophomore album their first four roadrunner records which is pretty exciting it's awesome to see the metal community embracing what this band has to offer especially since in a lot of ways I feel like this album is an improvement on their last record and in just about 25 minutes - on this new album turnstyle is sticking pretty closely to their tried and true very old-school bombastic over-the-top East Coast hardcore sound with the shouted vocals and the guitar riffs that make you want to jump the fuck up and stage dive into a crowd of people and and mosh until basically your your limbs disintegrate overall the band's music is coming off way more versatile and catchy this time around they're getting more wild in the studio with effects infusing more melody and harmony very subtly into these hardcore ragers mostly via some sung vocals and some background harmonies also you have surprising instrumental additions occasionally like the very peppy keyboards on the song high pressure which I love and occasionally on this thing it seems like they're like these very subtle nods to 90's and 2000's salt metal and in radio rock again very slight very subtle typically executed pretty tastefully and it's nice to see these additions it's nice to see these risks on this new turn style record because truth be told even though the band played with a lot of guts on their last album it still sounded pretty meat-and-potatoes this time around it really seems like they're doing everything they can to build their sound out so it has just a little bit more musical depth to it my issue though and I do have an issue of course I have an issue is that not every attempt of that goes over well and even with turnstyle trying to experiment in the way that they are on this album they're still one of the blander bands in this genre I don't really find them to have that distinct of a sound and I'm just having a difficult time committing this album to memory despite the fact that it really should be infectious as hell I mean I definitely give the band points for the killer performances on this album there are a few groups out there playing this genre of hardcore with the gusto that turnstyle does I mean I just break a sweat listening to this album but still their tracks on this thing like big smile which failed to leave an impression on me in any way shape or form outside of the finishing refrain of the song meanwhile their tracks on this thing leaving a mark on me for the wrong reasons like the song moon which to me feels like what would happen if you force the lead singer of the Barenaked Ladies to croon his way through a bunch of speedy spiraling hardcore riffs still though the first leg of this album is relatively solid real thing is a killer opener that thing hook on this track just reminds me of everything that was great about metal and hardcore 10 to 15 years ago the song generator is a bit heavier and catchy air has this massive juggernaut style cro-magnon guitar riffing the start of the track is enhanced with these haunting vocal harmonies meanwhile there's another portion of the track that features these really cheeky uh I don't want to be blind as another moment where these smoother more melodic vocals kind of pop in after a thunderous riff and elevate the track a little bit more high-pressure I already mentioned I love those keyboards it really makes the track pop out in the tracklisting but around the midpoint of this album even though it is very short I feel like the record loses steam runs out of ideas a little bit or these very minor applications of some background vocals just kind of lose their flavor don't really continue to add that much to this Bands brand of hardcore like the track lost another piece of my mind which to me just seems like a very average piece of crossover thrash like it's gonna take more than some atmospheric vocals to bring any personality to this song same thing with the closing track - I mean I can appreciate the band is trying to make their tracks a little catchy er without dumbing it down and basically turning hardcore music into pop which so many bands of the 2000s did in a really disgusting way I can tell they're trying their best not to step over that line even though you do have vocals like on the song right to be which come off way too sugary not to mention that at this point on the album the band's riffs style is starting to run just a little tedious again props for trying to work outside of your comfort zone but unfortunately this album does not maintain my interest for the very short run time that it lasts it's kind of one-dimensional it doesn't really stick out in the style of hardcore that the band performs within it's kind of unfortunate that my feelings on the south have waned a bit because my initial listens of it were pretty positive because I was whipped up in the energy of the Bands performances but as I kept listening again and again and again it became sort of apparent just how run-of-the-mill a lot of the compositions and then sounds on this album are and that a lot of these additional vocals they're kind of window dressing I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're feeling angry or a thoughtful comment in the comment if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head another review you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana turnstyle forever 
2WiS99Qukxc,hi everyone spank the NIEM ain't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new against all logic album 2012 to 2017 this is the debut this is the new album from the once mysterious music project on the other people label a music label run by none other than electronic music producer Nicolas jar one of my favorite electronic music producers spaces only noises one of the best electronic records of the decade I don't care what anyone thanks so I take notice when something gets posted on to the other people YouTube channel because not a lot of stuff goes up there I mean the last material Nicolas jar put on the the channel was like leftover stuff from his last album cycle and I also enjoyed some of the artists he was putting on when he originally was running the clown and sunset label a little while back so when I went in to sample these tracks from this artist I assumed was brand new the production style sounded a lot like Nicolas jars although I didn't necessarily assume anything because there were at least a few producers on clown and sunset that sounded a lot like him the production on this thing was very cool very funky very deep a pretty subtle approach to the house music genre and I guess the cat couldn't really stay in the bag because now pretty much everybody and their mom knows that against all logic is in fact Nicolas jar I guess with the age or some of the material on this thing some of it had been circulating around for a while ultimately it doesn't really matter to me under what umbrella the music on this thing is released I think the music itself is fantastic and I'm really happy to hear Nicolas jar kind of making his return to house music because he just sounds better than ever doing it seriously though I think this album is incredibly cutting edge and blows completely out of the water much of what Nicolas has done up until this point because I think Nicolas is production on this project is funkier it's more melodic it's more cerebral he gets more ambitious with samples on this thing to lacing numerous pieces of soul music into these tracks whether it be horn hits or vocal leads like on the track I never dream which features all these cascading vocal samples that kind of bleed into each other in a really psychedelic way also transitioning into some really blissful synths and bustling beats nearly every track on here features these nocturnal groovy rhythm sections that can't be denied also on every track here very round full baselines some of which really just like kind of overtake the lower frequencies of these tracks they're just monstrous or pieces of bass and some pretty cutting-edge sound play too right from the start of the project where it sounds like Nicholas is working with these like distorted samples and he kind of fusses them out to to to a very uh I guess abrasive effect there are so many unique musical moments on this project that make individual songs stand out the song some kind of game features these soulful passionately vocal samples as well as like these hypnotic mashing piano chords the song hopeless has these eerie and impossibly dark synth leads the track is beautiful at subnautica there are these weird noises shots of percussion working into this very intricate beat that gives the song weird sense of place like it's being recorded in like a I suppose like a factory floor or like a loft and attic the bouncy remixed funk of the song nowyou has not only just funk vibes but disco vibes too I can't not move to it even though the track does oh I think a lot of its appeal it's very glitzy appeal to its core sample I think Nicholas does a great job of building musical passages around the sample to me that's where a lot of the magic of this project happens in Nicholas's ability to sort of string entire tracks off of a single sample or a single idea case in point the song City fade which features these tense house piano chords which really could have been plugged into many a house song but I feel like Nicholas breaks the formula up with a pretty intense and complex beat and these ghostly haunting choral vocal samples when we move past this introductory passage Nicholas takes these synthesizers and the drums of the track and strings them into a passage that's pretty jammy almost at the point where it feels like I'm listening to a group of musicians playing together as opposed to more so one man assembling all of it in a computer and Nicholas does get pretty inventive with how he revises or applies samples in this record like on the song now you got me hooked which samples very generously from the dramatic song you got me loving you and Nicholas just finds a whole nother groover this sample just building his own pieces of bass and percussion into the sample because when I first heard it was kind of difficult to tell where Nicholas's input started and the sample ended he's just that good at picking a sound palette where everything kind of just feels very one oh I just love this man's approach to sound I love his approach to sound he just treats sound so nice he treats it so nice another thing I have to compliment pretty much every single track on this record with is the amazing progressions Nicholas works into these tracks rarely is a moment or rarely is a song on this album tedious redundant not heading anywhere the progressions on these songs are fluid they're cinematic they're engaging they have a fantastic balance of tension and release jar takes these songs into really creative and unexpected places while simultaneously just building all of them out very logically this is a fantastic electronic music album I cannot say enough nice things about it it is records like this that remind me that hey it's really fun and its really great being a music reviewer because if I was not constantly trying to find what is the newest latest most interesting thing an album like this could certainly just float under my radar totally unnoticed but now that I'm doing what I'm doing I don't miss records like this thank the Lord because this is just it's an excellent record groovy record very fun record very engaging very fulfilling and even though it does have its slightly mild spots the songs such a bad way is certainly one of those and on the whole the project is pretty much just like a mixed bag of tracks a little bit of a compilation the overall vibe of these tracks really just enhance each other in the album listening experience because they're all so entrancing they're also transcendental and kind of eargasm ik - I'm feeling a decent too strong 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen I hope you have because it really is that good of an album anthony Fantan oh here Nicholas jar against all logic video here next to my head give it a shot also link to subscribe to the channel you're the best my forever 
fPZwOG2RcFU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new sob RBE album gangin this is the breakout full-length LP from West Coast rap outfit sob RBE they are a four-piece that had some viral singles last year that landed on their debut album a lot of eyes are on them right now as a result of that also because they had one of the hottest tracks on the new TDE kendrick lamar curated black panther album the personnel of sob rber as follows young teo slim eb de boi & lil g truth be told these Vallejo California boys are not the most lyrical group you're going to hear this year and a lot of them show very little in the way of interest in in rapping perfectly on on the tempo of the instrumental these guys are kind of messy kind of amateurish they repeat a lot of flows and if you've heard 10 of their songs you pretty much get the extent of what they're going to say lyrically you're pretty much getting a lot of cutthroat very gritty Street raps about drugs sex gang violence with hilariously foul similes and wordplay but all of this is elevated to a degree with SOPs raw energy their group chemistry their personality and the cutting edge way with which they fuse pop rap trap and the typical sense and grooves that you hear coming out of the Bay Area what's especially you're grabbing are these beats that have this super smooth atmospheric moody style and the way that kind of clashes interestingly with these really harsh rough flows and deliveries especially from guys like slim EB although these sung vocals that typically come from young Tia or a nice smooth counterpoint to that he's not the greatest singer you're ever gonna hear but he definitely holds his own occasionally all of this adds up into some very incredible very inventive bangers like the opening track carpooling on this thing probably my favorite track on the entire project but a lot of these same sounds and ideas clash hideously on the very next track on me especially on the first leg of the song where it seems like the the bass the kicks the rattling hi-hats and the flows just cannot come together harmoniously over the course the 15 tracks on this thing it becomes very apparent that while the boys have some great ideas and they have some very good songs they don't have that many tools at their disposal because after a while some of the tracks on this thing do get redundant and kind of tedious and a little samey doesn't make it a terrible project though it's still pretty decent background music still pretty decent party music for the length of the entire album but engaging with each of the 15 songs here directly can be a bit of a slog I think a lot of the elements and characteristics for a great song are here and occasionally they do line up especially on the track always which feature some of the most singable vocals on the entire record also the song God which is a uniquely vulnerable moment on the album and the song paid-in-full is an incredible exciting banger even if the beat is little trebly and it has uniquely Californian sound to the bustling intense beat on this track is incredible it's just a shame that moments like this are a rarity in the tracklist it's just after a while sob sounds sort of comes off Airy wash rinse and repeat much like the latest migos project culture - but sob didn't need to pack their project with 90 minutes of material to get there while sob does have a distinct sound and style I want to hear more of in the future I would just hate to see them continue stretching these unique and occasionally fantastic ideas out to the point where they feel less significant than they actually are that and I guess I would like to hear better more focused songwriting more diverse instrumentals rapping that is a little bit more just a tad bit more on beat it would be nice if all of this happen I think it would put sob closer to coming together with a more solid and potentially even a classic project but as of this point all of them are still so young the the group in a lot of ways is still in its infancy who knows if any of this is gonna pan out who knows if any of this is gonna happen fingers crossed but I don't know I'm feeling a light two DS and six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana sob RBE forever

kkDCuMYeX8I,hi everyone big Vinny hug Chan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new 6-9 mixtape day 69 this is the debut mixtape or project from New York rapper 6-9 or Takashi 6-9 or just simply Takashi he has been making an incredible amount of noise in the rap world over the past few years with a gauntlet of viral songs and singles and one look at this dude should give you a pretty clear idea as to how he's gotten so popular because in the SoundCloud seen in the SoundCloud world it seems like a lot of the artists on there are in a race to become the loudest wildest and and quite literally the most colorful rapper it's almost to the point when I look at some of these rappers and it just reminds me of the old days of new metal I especially get that vibe musically off sumit akashi's older singles like yo Kai and Zeta zero these tracks account for some of the most insane hip-hop to come out over the past few years but as Takashi has grown more popular over the past few years he's just become harder and harder to stomach for one a lot of his latest tracks just seemed like a really one-dimensional attempt at going commercial with more conventional production with more industry friendly features and his aggressive posturing seems more programmed than it does natural or exciting and then there's his unag Norah bolete - a 2015 charge of using a child into sexual performance which is deeply disturbing not just on its own but also in light of the cover of this tape referencing a kid's cartoon granted it is a kids cartoon that a lot of adults enjoy - but still also there are numerous lyrics on this project about essentially pressuring your sexual partner into having intercourse with like your friends or the rest of your crew which is exactly the kind of behavior that got 6:9 in hot water to begin with I get that he is paying or has paid his debt to society at this point but honestly it's it's all just really kind of difficult to come to terms with now am i surprised about this not entirely I mean 6:9 portrays himself to be an outlaw among laws also the repeated calls of scum on almost every track of this record which of course comes stands for society can't understand me which is kind of weird like it's you're not that difficult to understand you you're not you're not a Rubik's Cube even if you do share a similar color scheme I mean one of Takashi's earliest singles was the tracks come life I guess the point that I'm getting at is Takashi is exactly what he portrays himself to be he's not lying he's not joking he's not playing so I guess if you're gonna follow what he does and listen to his music go into this project understanding that and while I guess in one breath while that's something I appreciate about Takashi in another breath that doesn't necessarily mean I feel as music or anything especially with what feels to me to be a lack of layers or a lack of really anything substantive or interesting it's just kind of a lot of overly aggressive posturing for the sake of overly aggressive posturing the aesthetic of these tracks is similar to that of a lot of different soundcloud artists although not quite as cutting edge as some of the music he was releasing a few years ago and like I said earlier in the review I get the feeling that he's trying to do what he can to make his music more palatable for a more mainstream audience especially on tracks like Rondo featuring Tory Lanez or Kiki with a boogie with a hoodie and Fetty WAP on the hook as a rapper Takashi doesn't really bring too much to the table outside of a lot of yelling some of the tracks on here do get pretty murderous and dark though they also have this loud repetitive banging quality to them that kind of reminds me of like I don't know old-school crunk music but but with the scream vocals on top of it maybe even crunk core music of course with like a side of trap and hardcore maybe even some metal but truth be told Takashi's lyrics are pretty basic if not occasionally embarrassing he rehashes a lot of themes occasionally he rehashes flows I mean he even puts a song on here two times because he has another version of it with an offset feature there is a painfully bad closer on this thing with super messy mix like none of the instrumentation none of the sounds on this thing actually complement each other the swelling synth leads the rattling kind of cacophonous trap beat Takashi's constant yell rapping and this weird howling singing voice that just feels so out of place there are things about Takashi's music that are slightly compelling and definitely hit you hard and grab your attention especially if you're just listening to one or two tracks at a time but with one track after another on this thing it gets really tiring with the fact that Takashi really only has one Lane one sound one delivery it actually becomes pretty mind-numbing even though the runtime of this thing is really short just like 27 minutes the production on day 69 is really the project saving grace although for SoundCloud rap for overly aggressive hip-hop right now it's not that cutting-edge occasionally it goes super abrasive distorted or atmospheric on tracks like 93 the tape has a cool vibe but it's just way too OneNote to be entertaining as a whole nor do I think Takashi has the artistic ability to carry an entire project even if it's just for over 20 minutes yeah it's how he pits aggressive it's wild there's a lot of energy but it's not really anything I haven't heard done before very recently better by other rappers with catchy lyrics more versatility more charisma and more personality and a better ear for production to which occasionally does run kind of bland on this thing which is kind of saying a lot considering the production is really the best thing about this I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this tape transition have you given this tape of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you Reina you're the best you're the best what should i review next it's like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts I'll see you in the next one over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana de 69 forever 
iWzmbuxGU00,hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it's the weekly track roundup after dark where I go over the worst and the best tracks of the week in my opinion whoa hope you're doing well every track I talked about in this segment is linked down there in the description I'm marking doing this video off of my to-do list all right let's get into it let's get into some track recommendations first of course our Amazon and turntable live associate links are down there in the description hit them up treat yourself and let's start off with the worst tracks of the week not too many this week it was actually a pretty good week a lot of tracks that I loved or thought were fantastic excuse me alright new chainsmokers track it came out a little while ago but I'm finally catching up with it now it's it's definitely one of the quirky and quirky or and more tongue-in-cheek tracks that duo has ever drawn up but I just find it excruciating I was also kind of let down a bit by this new track from the Bands superorganism who have an album coming out very soon via Domino Records they actually seemed pretty interesting pretty big band pretty versatile and zany colorful instrumentation kind of reminds me of some of the freakier and more fun indie bands that came out in the 2000s and a lot of ways reminded me of what made sort of that new wave of indie pops so interesting excuse me made it so interesting in the first place however this new song over here are reflections on the screen it's obviously it's a song about relationships possibly even friends as well all being done over the internet and the digital age and so on and so forth but honestly listening to the song is about as interesting as watching somebody just stare at their phone screen it's it's pretty pretty boring maybe that's intentional maybe they're trying to reflect I guess a lack of excitement in 24/7 and if they did that then kudos to them they really captured it moving on from there let's get into the tracks that I thought were men you know no not amazing not terrible just kind of wanted to shout them out mmm but still again I had a hard time throwing tracks into this section because even some of the songs in here were pretty decent but there were a lot of tracks that sort of wowed me this week tracks that I thought were amazing this week it was a really good week but Twin Shadow has a new single out Saturdays and I believe he has another out as well but this one features the band Higham and it's actually really like kind of great smooth very funky and infectious synth pop track a little bit of an old-school splash of kind of reverb on it too it's got a got a nostalgic aesthetic to it it's a very fun tune very very well written very very fun I guess it didn't really blow me away but you know still it's still a decent all-around decent track the new Remo Drive track is okay to me it's not quite as raw in as emo as their earlier stuff while the recording quality is definitely better they have a new EP coming out very soon and it looks like they are now currently signed with epitaph records which is pretty exciting for them not sure where things are gonna go from here I guess I am again excited to hear that studio recording overall is better new and improved but the the energy and the angst isn't quite as raw and electrifying as I guess it used to be so it'll be interesting to sort of see where the band goes from here how they progress how they evolve I guess if they land on their feet moving on from their post Malone has a new single out with ty dolla sign it's a pretty woozi and atmospheric and very moody a lot like rock star but nowhere near is catchy still though Malone and ty do deliver some pretty compelling vocal performances I just don't think it's like the best tune that I've heard him dropped like definitely not as interesting a single as his last single but still AM I'm mostly holding out hope for his forthcoming album beer bongs in bent that it's going to be decent if only if you know if we have more tracks on a like rock star all I really want at this point is that it's better than his debut which it can't be too hard to do that new Mount Erie track which is a super long super wordy very verbose very personal a lot like the previous single that Phil dropped looking forward to this new Mount Erie album coming out this year after that a miracle which is a new synth pop duo or just sort of like Goffe since pop kind of new wavy duo they have an album coming out this year via relapse records features Daniel O'Sullivan who has been in a lot of different bands collaborated with a lot of different artists over the years who I'm a big fan of he's been in the band Guapo which was a really cool experimental rock band that I was a big fan of he's collaborated with other bands that I love like Sun and Steve Moore of zombie Fame so they're kind of getting together on this thing of course collaborating with other musicians along the way too and the again there's they're essentially coming through with this weird gothic to a degree very sad very moody synth pop sound and I don't know it's it's interesting that these two worlds have collided and it's interesting to see the genre of music they're making here and it's interesting that they're putting it out a freaking metal label so I don't know man it there's just like a lot of weird X Factor's here this song over here called light mind very interesting video the the I don't know that there's something about this track that while it didn't blow me away in my first few listens like I feel like it could grow on me a lot more as when I hear the album because there's definitely like a weirdness - an eccentricity to it that uh that that's kind of drawing me back in again and again and again a new little dragon track titled suede AZ it's not quite as redundant as a lot of the songs that have been dropping on their most recent material however it is super super low-key and didn't quite leave much of an impression on me but still I'm looking forward to giving a shot - to their next full-length LP and hot snakes have you track out which is pretty catchy SubPop is gonna be dropping their next record the name of the track is death camp fantasy super sharp infectious hook on this song not quite as like wild and out of control as a lot of the Bands older material like in their heyday and everything but still you know those indie rock and post hardcore vibes are coming through and so far it sounds like the the totally wild uncontrolled sound being swapped out for what's essentially just I guess some more memorable more hooky songwriting it's it's not necessarily a bad trade so uh let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best this week tracks them excited me the most a lot of songs in here I'm getting excited to talking about this because a lot of great songs dropped this week Venetian Snares and Daniel annoy hopefully you know who these two people are if you don't Google is your friend apparently two more worlds colliding that I did not expect at all are going to be coming together this year Daniel annoy who if you remember producer I know he does a guitar I don't know how many instruments the man plays he's getting together with Venetian Snares experimental electronic music producer Venetian Snares and the first track from their upcoming album is like some of the freshest stuff that I've heard either of these two people involved in in a long time like it's super dense it's super glitchy but there's that added sort of weird washy almost shoegaze II kind of psychedelic atmosphere that it seems like Daniels bringing to the table but actually ties together kind of well so I don't know I'm just looking forward to seeing where this goes like interest piqued interest piqued moving on from their new street sex track sort of seems like the the duo is doing a better job on this new song over here of kind of fusing some of the newer sounds they've been working with with the very brutal industrial a very hardcore brutal industrial sound that they're known for the title of the track is in contempt new screaming females track called I'll make you sorry which again it sort of seems like they're really going down this road of like writing some of the most melodic some of their most catchy rock tracks yet and in to my ears going over really well like mmm this is actually probably the record I'm the most excited to hear all the way through in review this week because for me the screaming females have always had more potential than they've oh then they've sort of capitalized on for a while you know their first couple of records are fucking fire just from front to back fire but I feel like they they hit like a little bit of a slump for a while where they were kind of rehashing a lot of ideas and kind of repeating themselves but it really sounds like they're doing something super fresh and a bit more ambitious on this new album and I'm just like psyched to see them kind of progress and you know very few bands have been around in the indie scene and have been plugging as hard as they have and has have been as consistent as they have for as long as they have so just like undying and unending amounts of respect for screaming females like no matter whether their albums are amazing or just merely okay because there's so much talent in each member individually they just are so DIY til they die and I just can't say enough nice things about screaming female so I'll just continue on next new parquet courts song which is kind of like a two-parter here almost had to start a fight and in and out of patience not only is the instrumentation on this thing it kind of celebrates the same kind of post-punk vibe and indie rock vibe that parquet courts is known for but like it seemed really experimental and kind of winding and very weird this time around also I loved the way that the two sections of the song kind of transitioned sort of seems like I don't know just just some of their most progressive stuff that they've ever written and dropped so far also I can not get enough of this single art like it's absolutely fucking insane along with the music video too so I'm I don't know man just like so many artists are just dropping fucking fire this week parquet courts dropped fire hyk dropped some fucking fire 44 more is like one of the best songs dudes ever recorded super fast flows lot of witty lyrics banger beat loved his voice loved his delivery on this track like it's such a great song I wish it was on his last record but man this was like seriously a nice pick-me-up for logic and a nice follow-up to all the good things that have been happening for him this past year you know I wasn't super crazy about his last record unfortunately I feel like a lot of people kind of bust his balls about the biracial thing but honestly I think there are a lot of good things about his album sometimes I feel like it's not deep enough or he doesn't go far enough but he's still very talented rapper and every once in a while he does come through with a really great song and I think 44 more is an example of that also but where do I even start Janelle Monae Janelle Monae dirty computer new album dropping this year make me feel Django Jane two songs two music videos drop this week how do you know what the fuck to say this is like some of the best material she's ever written period hands down don't at me like it's fire it's amazing like Django Jane is this like super empowering amazing just above and beyond like a transcendental rap tune where she just pretty much lays out all the reasons that she's so ahead of the game so cutting-edge how she's been so cutting-edge how she's been just like on another mental level when it comes to just music in general and love the visuals of the video to think her flow thinking of delivery is awesome and then make me feel fuck this song is sexy this song is so like in comparably sexy and sure it's like a huge Prince homage like so many elements of this track musically and I feel like just the vibe of the song in general just so feels like Prince's kiss but Monet and you know whoever else she's working with musically on this track just had this genius I guess kind of vision of reinventing it plugging in different sounds kind of recreating a very similar group in a very similar vibe but totally coming through with like a very different sound and something that is so updated so contemporary and so her - you know the point of inspiration is very clear but there's nothing really about this song that says I like it's it's so much of a carbon copy I just would rather go listen to the other one like both of them are so amazing and I can't even deal with how sexy the music video is it just I'm I get all anxious thinking about it I can't I just I can't talk about it anymore I need to move on to the next thing because these songs are fucking amazing like this sets my sights in my expectation so much higher for dirty computer than the teaser tracks did for electric lady like Electric Lady teaser tracks were fine but to me that album just felt like Monet was kind of resting on her laurels a little bit not really pushing boundaries in the way that I felt like she was on arc Android and now I feel like that is back that risk factor is back that bold sound is back I feel like while the influences are clear she's not SuperDuper wearing them on her sleeve to the point where it's like okay like like what's the point really what are you doing to me this is just like she's just pushing forward and I fucking him here for it I am here for it cannot wait to hear this album next new hopalong song not able I was kind of underwhelmed by the last single to drop from the forthcoming hopalong album which if you haven't heard of them before you know check my review back catalogue I loved their last record they're an indie rock band with a lot of instrumental talent especially when it comes to the vocals last song though underwhelmed me as I said felt a little bland for them kind of a little safe like they were really playing it super low-key this new track over there kind of goes into a full direction though which is a sound and an aesthetic that actually fits them really well they take to this sound they take to the style very well instrumentation is beautiful vocals are much more intimate than they've been in the past but still very intriguing and you know if there's one thing about their last record that I would of critique afore it is that it is a little one-dimensional you know there is kind of a sameness amongst a lot of the songs and what makes me kind of excited for this forthcoming album given what I've heard so far is that maybe they're really kind of experimenting and getting out of their comfort zone and trying a lot of different things and given their talents given their songwriting ability I'm definitely intrigued to sort of hear where that might take them moving on from there flower truck Australian band bringing together elements of indie pop and post-punk and jangle pop new record on the way very soon this new song is titled enough for now incredibly cute like heartwarming music video love the shouty lead vocals love the dreamy synthesizers the bass groove is great to saw these guys play live when I was doing a speaking tour down in Australia not too long ago and I really don't know what else to say I just think it's all around a very fun a very good song shout out to flower truck I think they're very solid band moving on from their new Flatbush zombies track new Flatbush zombies will be a new album on the way to this one is titled headstone to me definitely one of the most commercial sounding tracks the trio has ever put together but still pretty decent hook a lot of great bars on the track definitely not as like Hollow and in sort of lifeless feeling as a lot of the tracks from their last album sort of feels like the production is a bit more full a bit more heavy I guess I'll kind of leave it at that again not quite as wild and just like as crazy as you know some of their best stuff that they've put out in the past but still still a banger still is still a pretty pretty forward-thinking a hip-hop track and a new father John misty track goddam the hits keep coming I'm just like how many songs that I loved this week but the new father John misty track is actually really great what's funny is is Josh sent me like like a nearly finished version of this track in an email like months ago and I was afraid to listen to it because I didn't want to hear like a demo version of anything and it was it was a like I said a version of this track and it was almost like identically the same as this song that we're hearing right now and I feel like an asshole for not listening to it because it's like fantastic I love it I love the sad dreary lead melody of course Josh's lyrics are as witty and as funny as ever overall I'm just like really impressed with the song to me felt like a song off of I love you honey bear but sort of like the negative I love you honey bear the dark I love you honey bear so I don't know and of course you know with given the title and given the concept of the track it's a very funny and an intriguing self-reflection of sorts moving on from there against all logic which is an electronic music project on other people records that I shattered on Twitter not too long ago maybe a week or two ago because I liked some of the material I was hearing on there and now the news has come out this week that oh lo and behold that's actually Nicolas Jar recording under this name so that's pretty cool definitely give a shot to the track we've linked down there in the description box some kind of game I'm really looking forward to reviewing this at some point I think either before the month is out or early March because it is actually really good and I think that should be it for the weekly track roundup all those tracks are linked down below make sure you try not make sure you give a listen to them like again so much amazing music dropped this week I just so much to talk about oh and I actually missed one track the album art didn't make it into here for some reason but it is a link down there in the description a new track from the band gorilla toss a non-album track track is titled spider herd and again if you watch my review of their last album they bring together elements of like dance music and post-punk but the freakier side of the genre like XTC like that shit like Devo like that kind of thing but but sort of noisy and freakish and over the top and that track is amazing as well so a lot of personality a lot of fun a lot of good grooves I'm gonna leave it at that those are all the songs that I wanted to point you guys to you're the best love you hope you got a lot out of this video hope you got some good wreck nations and I will see you in the next one cool Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever

le1lEwOXQq0,ah hi everyone Ithaca Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a quickie EP review of the latest EP from kerokero bonito tot - EP Totec don't care WP kerokero bonito is a pop trio hailing from the UK whose record that I reviewed not too long ago one of my favorite albums of that year is actually one of the most bubbly colorful fun and personality driven pop albums to drop this decade smashing together elements of dance music and hip hop as well as Japanese pop and synth pop it's not going to be for everyone some people are naturally going to find kerokero bonito just a little too cutesy and funny and weird and and I don't know childlike so I get it if you're not a fan I get it but they have a new EP out which I was very excited for after they dropped one of the teaser tracks to this thing only acting which was kind of a change of pace for them because it was a guitar driven track not so many beats and and since lace throughout the cut there were actually a few musical passages on this track that they're read to me as being like pop punk esque and overall it was a style of his a vibe it was a flavor of the band pulled off pretty well despite it not playing - they're typically cute and eclectic strengths so that did have me pretty excited to listen to this new EP however it is kind of a letdown in my opinion it's just four tracks it's just 11 minutes so pretty scant songs on this thing not really all that fleshed out and the rest of the EP is guitar driven as well which is not necessarily a bad thing however I don't really think this sound plays to kerokero bonito strengths nor do I think they really kind of built these songs out all that well because for the most part what the band delivers here is just a very bland watered-down indie pop sound some of the tracks on here actually sort of sound like what could be demos for songs that they might build upon down the road build up into the impossibly cute sound they're known for on their breakout album while some of the melodies and the vocals on the CPR are okay it just doesn't really have that much bite it doesn't really have that much color it doesn't really have that much energy either the EP overall just feels very dry and kind of falls flat on its face outside of the track only acting I'm really kind of indifferent toward this thing I don't really care for it that much and there's very little on this EP in my opinion that is going to keep me coming back to it throughout the year so while I'm glad I guess the band took a risk tried something different or maybe showed a roar and more stripped backside of themselves to their audience this is just not really all that interesting of a release to me and I personally can't wait to hear the trio get back to some more cutting edge sounds but those are my thoughts on the EP over here next to my head is the Sheraton review as well as a link to subscribe to the channel if you want to hit those up that that would be nice you can also leave an angry comment in the comments if you're disagreeing with what I'm saying or leave a thoughtful comment which would be preferential preferred Anthony Fantana kerokero Benito forever

EcFJbKJxjDA,"ha ha ha hi everyone twinfthony twintwano here, the internet's busiest music nerd and its time for a review of the newly revised version of Car Seat Headrest's 'Twin Fantasy' a 'Twin Fantasy' you mean like this? that's not a twin fantasy that's a twin nightmare [distorted] straight out of Bandcamp singer songwriter Will Toledo aka Car Seat Headrest one of indie music's fastest rising stars and the album that put him on the map essentially 'twin fantasy' aahhh a record that at the time was very messy but showed a whole lot of heart Will essentially landed a music label deal off the off the buzz, the online buzz, that albums like this on his Bandcamp page were generating and immediately after signing he began plugging away on new releases that had a slightly better recording quality. he eventually ended up dropping one of my favorite albums of 2016 one of my favorite rock records of the decade 'Teens of Denial' this thing is just loaded with witty profound takes on the struggles of early adulthood the emotional limbo many twenty somethings probably find themselves in during their college years so after dropping a record that pretty much went toatally against the downward trend of most rock music today and and served as a reminder of what can make the genre so exciting you have to kinda imagine that Matador Records would just let will do whatever the hell he wanted and *laughs* in a way it looks like they did with Will's new album over here essentially being a full re-recording and a reassembly of his his biggest and most popular Bandcamp release 'Twin Fantasy' now despite the fact that i really enjoy Will's music and i have a lot of respect for where he came from 'Twin Fantasy' is an album that i've never quite been able to appreciate sure while it is a Bandcamp classic the recording for me is always been way too chaotic way too messy to really like all the way through even if there are some really loud, noisy and experimental mixing ideas on on the record that i think for the most part Will was just trying to make up for uh i i guess a lack of resources and equipment with just some uh very risky uh risks so he comes back with this new version of 'Twin Fantasy' this reimagined re-recorded version of 'Twin Fantasy' and for me personally it's pretty much improvemetns on all fronts i feel like i'm now able to enjoy this album as the diamond in the ruff that it is. if you enjoyed the instrumentals on 'Teens of Denial' you are going to enjoy the instrumentals on this album they are a few degrees noisier by compairson but i think that was mostly Will trying to do his best to sure, improve the the work of art that he's made here but also stay true to the original piece he pays homage to lo-fi aesthetics while pretty much putting together a series of tracks that are very well assembled and the end result in a way is kind of anachronistic it's it's weird to listen to and perceive this album coming after all the work that he has done up until this point because its kinda like going forward but also backward at the same time in comparison with his latest material in my opinion 'Twin Fantasy' isn't nearly as instrumentally ambitious i find the songs on 'Teens of Denial' assembled a bit more smoothly and personally i find his lyrics to be more eccentric, hilarious with these very vivid descriptions of emotions and scenarios that he's moving through i just feel like with his latest material we get a more detailed but vivid image and character portrait of the person who's personality and experiences are fueling these songs now in my opinion Will's song writing has changed and improved by leaps and bounds since he released 'Twin Fantasy' even with some of the alterations on this album having to do with some of the flow of the tracks or how the instrumentation paces out or Will's also making some lyrical alterations to a lot of tracks here but still even with all those changes what continues to remain true about 'Twin Fantasy' is that it is a super emotionally knotty and difficult album drowning in a sad chaos of sexual confusion, love, drugs and um *smacks lips* um *smacks lips* youth the opening track to this thing is roaring exciting song that really kinda sets the tone for the entire record following cuts that are a bit more measured and based around a more simple verse chorus verse format tracks like ""Sober to Death"" incredible catchy, super compelling interesting tune as well about essentially uh misery loving company sharing in your emotional problems with another person all of these very *laughs* difficult feelings are condensed into a very rowdy lo-fi rock tune the song ""Cute Thing"" has turned  into one of the most adorable tracks on the entire record talking about needing Frank Ocean's voice and James Brown's stage presence to essentially uh become a rock god which is one of the many funny lyrical switches on the album because prior on the original version of the record uh Will was talking about Dan Bejar's and John Entwistle's and you know what for me ""Cute Thing"" is one of the few tracks on the entire album that originally translated pretty well in fact i will say i kind amiss the nervous energy of Will's voice that was on the first version of the record but the pulsating dinga dinga dinga ding synthesizers and the very well executed vocal harmonies that kinda bleed into each other really chaoticlly are a very nice swap the song ""Bodys"" features all of these echo splash sequence beats there are actually a lot of incredible grooves and on this album that didn't quite pour through on the original 'Twin Fantasy' like in comparison with 'Teens of Denial' and nearly everything Will has done so far this is a pretty danceable record a very physical and visceral album despite just *laughs* how sad a lot of the emotions going into it are but again on ""Bodys"" this track features all of these echo splashed sequence beats a lot of references in the lyrics to dancing it's kind of about giving into this carefree, freewheeling youthful energy. the song has a fantastic groove great momentum, there's a crescendo after the half way point that is super exciting: it's a bloody mess of synths and drums and bass and guitars it's the kind of chaos where all the instrumentation is adding into a very collective and purposeful way then with ""Nervous Young Inhumans"" we get yet another killer driving drum beat, very sharp synth lead we do have a bit of an outro monologue that in my opinion goes a little long uh this isn't something that i was super crazy about on the last record but i actually prefer the previous monologue before Will totally just flipped it on it's head and added something completly different maybe this new one adds a bit more to the narrative however i i enjoyed how meta the last outro was because the song itself is pretty meta making references to art and writing and the creative process and i'm loving this new version of ""High to Death"" which in comparison with the old one is so much trippier and very psychedelic and weird especially with like all the reversed guitar la la la i definitely do get the sense that *laughs* the wall paper in the room is spinning it's very surreal and i love the return of the stop smoking melody in in a very dreamy fashion on the track too of course you get these multi facited monsters on the album as well these tracks that are ten plus minutes long and have numerous phases to them it's super epic uh ""Beach Life-In-Death"" and then ""Famous Prophets"" a new and improved version of the track features six more minutes of music bringing the length of the track out to sixteen minutes which now has a bigger crescendo a nice little piano part and an overall i just enjoyed what Will did with this revision a lot i mean pretty much any of the issues i had with this album had been mostly to do with the original source material and Will in my opinion growing as a song writer growing as a musician since the release of this album i still do prefer [Teens of] Denial which in my opinion has grown on me even more since the release originally but i love this new version of this record because it just allows me to enjoy this record for what it really is and that's just a great album i'm feeling a decent strong 8 on this thing transition: have you given this

6Z8yUX3JE-c,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd throwing together a quickie review for this new Raven Lynnae EP that she has recently dropped if you're not familiar with her she's a singer she's an R&B artist hailing from Chicago she is now signed to Atlantic Records she has dropped this five-track EP which is titled crush and Steve Lacey's production is all over this thing Steve has been getting a lot of attention lately thanks to the work he has done recently with Kendrick Lamar on damn and also yeah that that little solo like little project that weird solo demos project that dropped that was that was pretty decent however I wasn't really familiar with his work with Raven until I actually kind of stumbled upon the tracks sticky which is the lead track to this EP a fantastic track one of my favorite tracks of the week when I talked about in a weekly track roundup incredibly eccentric fun flavorful song Ravens vocals have a whole lot of character they're very eccentric there are a lot of very weird and in fun vocalizations all over that track the song feels sensual and poppy and sexy and while it does have its roots very firmly in kind of the old school of R&B in the 90s there are something kind of advanced and futuristic about it as well now Raven and Steve clearly have good chemistry together when it comes to songwriting and producing and laying a good vocal track down on some of these beats but unfortunately a lot of the songs to follow sticky are not quite as cutting edge not quite as envelope-pushing though it does show that Raven and Steve together have quite a bit of versatility I'm not sure if as Raven grows artistically and continues to release music for Atlantic Records because I don't see why they would just drop an EP with her unless it totally flopped which from what I've been seeing the reception of this so far has been pretty positive I don't see why they would release one single EP from her and just that'd be it so as she continues to move forward I'm not sure if she'll keep working with Steve I hope she does because it seems like they have a good thing going I'm loving tracks lie computer love on here which is a nice kind of long-distance love song mostly about longing and kind of wanting the other person it's not quite as I guess a digital and futuristic as a lot of songs that are sort of on this same topic but I do love the very speedy and nimble vocal harmonies and melodies that her and Steve pulled together as they sing the following two tracks the night song which comes off a little bland to me and four-leaf clover Steve takes some solo vocal passages on this track they're sort of trading spaces it's a duet of sorts but their vocal chemistry is really there it's a little awkward a little stiff in my opinion but still it's a very well produced EP it's very well put together EP the songs are very tuneful they're very sweet they're very easygoing pretty much everything that you would want in a good R&B tune good groove very intoxicating a very smooth sound but not not enough I guess in terms of just um I guess risk-taking but looking back into her past she's been dropping music pretty consistently midnight moonlight and moon shoes in 2016 and 2017 respectively she's been opening up for Sousa she had vocal appearances with no name and makjang khun's which escaped my mind at the moment that I was listening to her solo stuff and even those previous EPS while not every track was super cutting edge there were at least a few moments here and there where she's like really doing something and really starting to come into her own as an artist I mean even when Raven Lynnae is playing it pretty safe she's far from just your average prepackaged commercial R&B singer so I don't know at this point it seems like she's been having this ongoing relationship with Atlantic Records and I'm just hoping maybe an album comes out at some point soon because to me this latest EP sounds like some of her boldest some of her most well put together and some of her most focused material yet because overall this is a pretty solid EP could become one of my favorite EPS of the year come list time in December and I'm gonna leave it at that make sure to hit up the link down there in the description to listen to some of the stuff on this EP transition have you given this EP listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts okay over here next to my head is another video you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Raven Lynnae Steve Lacey crush EP forever 
SUi5leRIR80,having a headache having a headache hi everyone long for the wait annum here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of our worst ooh best series where I go over the core studio albums of a particular artist and I rank those records from worst to the best and obviously in this episode we're talking about Bjork legendary Icelandic singer songwriter producer arranger I'm going to be spanning the entirety of her studio album career though not you know the cool stuff and the sugar cube stuff and you know all the all the other stuff though I do recommend you try out those albums if you get a chance and listen even sticking to Bjork's albums from debut up until now it was really tough making this list because Bjork is a unique talent and every record she has ever put out has a totally different sound palette and style and looking across her entire discography Bjork has never really come out with an awful album so even as I do rank these records from worse to best keep in mind the differences in quality from each record is pretty miniscule okay let's go Volta Bjork's 2007 album commonly regarded as her weakest release and I can't really disagree personally I have difficulty getting into a lot of the tracks on this thing and on top of it contextually this album doesn't really seem to hold much significance in Bjork's discography either the 2000s were really interesting time for Bjork she was pretty much riding a high of Fame and critical acclaim after an amazing run of albums from 1993 debut all the way up until Vespertine she pretty much had veteran status in the music industry a hardcore fanbase so she began to embark on some of her most ambitious musically and conceptually albums yet and volta is one of those albums however it is arguable that this album is we're a lot of Bjork's ideas don't translate all that effectively even if on paper it looks like it should be a total firework show because you have some production on this thing from the likes of Timbaland a lot of very punchy and experimental beats pretty raw vocal performances rather than that of what was on her latest couple of albums at the time like there are a few spots on this album that to me read as aggressive as some of her days in cuoco you also have guest vocals from a note nior Antony as she was known as at the time a 14 piece brass ensemble and some of York's most politically charged lyrics ever like on the track earth intruders or the very revolutionary declare independence however on this album I find some of the brass mixing to run a little thin not add quite as much to the album as I would have liked or you have cuts on this thing where the horns just completely take over and the end result is just kind of this blobby mess of vocals and in horn sections that are very slow very frigid somewhat lifeless and some of the politics on this record come off a bit like sloganeering it's it's a little all over the place too not quite as pointed as maybe I would have liked and I didn't really feel like the vocal chemistry with a note me on this thing was really there either despite Bjork's apparent love of her vocal talents however there are some incredibly bold moments on this album that I think are amazing namely the song innocence which is one of the most insane Bjork songs ever I can't even begin to explain this tracks anatomy the squelching synthesizers and what sounds like repeated samples of a gun firing and a person getting shot some very thumpy kick drums and one of York's most catchy vocal lines ever there are quite a few cool moments on the album just like this but I feel like overall the record just did not go far enough or that this very bold and groundbreaking sound really should have been kind of the guiding rod for the entirety of the album so while there are some songs and ideas on this album that I just think are great I do have to ask myself is the album all over the place are the concepts narrative Lee and sonically executed all that well are they delivered consistently when I think about these things I do have to come to the conclusion that this is really my least favorite Bjork album and as she continues to release more records it just seems to carry less and less weight in her discography utopia Bjork's ninth studio album falling relatively low on the list but I don't think that's because it's a bad record and maybe this album will grow on me with time I do think this record has some interesting ideas and to sound all its own in Bjork's Canon given the nature sound effects and the woodwind ensemble that she enlisted for this album some of the tracks on this album as a result of these things are stunningly beautiful transcendent mind-bending as I said in my review I feel like I'm listening to some kind of space-age flute Orchestra performing in a bird sanctuary but this album is also one of her most cumbersome standing at 70 minutes in length also this record is kind of a weaker follow-up to her 2015 album vuln Akira from which she extended a lot of the themes of heartbreak and divorce and romance into slightly awkward and in very bitter territory at times which is occasionally to this album's benefit but occasionally not as much sometimes Arcas production on this record which it should be noted this is like the closest and most consistently she's worked with a single producer in a very long time considering just how much are kaput into this record and the previous album volnek era however I much preferred Arcas input on that album as opposed to utopia over here because sometimes our cos beats run a little messy and cluttered and and really an oppressive way smother the dynamics of Bjork's vocals and also the flutes that were brought into this record and as far as musical and narrative concepts in the Bjork discography go utopia is is not one of her most fully realized but it's still relatively consistent I just think there are other albums she's put out that offer more seamless listens it's not a Bjork album I would recommend right off the bat for beginners but still pretty decent volnek kira 2015 album Bjork's eighth studio record the predecessor to utopia both emotionally and somatically given that that album was building off of the breakup that this record is about this album is pretty much Bjork's breakup album because the lyrics on this thing literally go over the demise and aftermath of a long-term relationship that she had with artist matthew barney and this is easily one of her most painful and sad albums I guess I do get the sense on this album that I am being transported somewhere much like I do on a lot of other Bjork Records but in this instance it's to a very dark very paralyzing place specifically on tracks like family and then Black Lake and while this album is a much more somber side of Bjork you can almost hear in a very subtle way that she's going back to the very lavish and very organic instrumentation that that palette that she had going on with mm one's Vespertine which was a record that was inspired by the the love and positivity that she was feeling for this very same relationship at the time but now these very wintery sounds that inhabited that album are so dark and they're so negative the production input from ARCA on this album is very tasteful very subtle occasionally results in a lot of very intriguing glitchy beats we also see the return of a note neon this album to who I think Bjork gels with vocally so much better here than on volta so while this album is not one of New York's most cutting-edge records from a compositional or Sonics standpoint this is easily one of the grandest displays of emotions that she's made across her entire discography that emotion just happens to come from a very dark in a somewhat more subtle place with the exceptions of tracks like not get on this thing where you can really hear in her singing the emotional trauma and all these fears and anxieties kind of compiling all at once I would also say that volnek era is one of her most theatrical albums like this is definitely a record that I could see playing on a stage show with a small pit orchestra with like some kind of silent interpretive play-acting itself out to the score I can't quite put my finger on what about the album makes me feel that way but still I personally love the record I think it's a great album in her discography although I wouldn't recommend it to a newcomer unless you were ready right off the bat to go to a very dark place debut Bjork's 1993 album it's sort of strange calling this a debut considering just how long york had had her feet in the music industry before the release of this album but i guess it is a debut of sorts this is one of York's most celebrated albums however it is falling somewhat low on my list below the halfway point yeah and I get why people love this record it used to be one of my favorite Bjork albums but while I do like a lot of the songs on this album I can't really celebrate this album as being much more than a starting point a very good starting point because while some of Bjork's most notable tracks do land on this thing like Venus as a boy or human behavior in one of my personal favorite Bjork ballads does land on this thing anchor song she also has an excellent cover of the jazz standard like someone in love on this thing too however some of the tracks on this thing do and abruptly they lack structure there's little in the way of Sonic cohesion across the entire record some of the instrumentals do sound kind of rickety even for the 90s truly what Bjork sounds like on this album is a burgeoning artist who is still finding her sound still finding her footing but still even at this point there are some stunningly beautiful things about Bjork's music specifically her voice she still had that voice at this point very early on in her solo career and at this point it was in a very youthful and a very exciting prime and she also seemed a little more wild and I guess open to experimentation on this album too and as a fan it is pretty exciting and interesting to hear Bjork at a point in her career where she is so willing to wear her influences on her sleeve the amalgamation of music styles that would eventually carry her on to bigger and better records jazz and electronic music and dance pop and post-punk which is why if you are a newcomer to Bjork's music I do recommend that maybe you kick things off with an album like debut because there's a certain level of familiarity and maybe even normalcy to the music that she's delivering on this album that you might take to more easily then if I were to just throw you directly into let's say an album like biophilia so while I do think debut is a very good record I still think a lot of what she did on this album is is surpassed by what she delivered on post her next record and I think that's everything I want to say about this album Biophilia 2011 album York's seventh studio LP and one of her most ambitious concepts ever Biophilia is Bjork's environmentalist opus the song subjects on this album are inspired by the likes of seasons and nature in the earth and the moon and even DNA and not only is that reflected in York's lyrics but also the the literal musical composition itself in how a lot of the music on this thing sounds grand and intergalactic as well as even like very primitive and stripped back like primordial specifically on tracks like dark matter and Hollow and again the inspiration the natural world has on this album goes beyond an aesthetic level for example according to Bjork FR the song moon was composed with the literal cycles of the moon in mind uh note some of the very strange unique and custom instrumentation that went into this record - one song in particular on here the track Thunderbolt actually features a singing Tesla coil not something I think a lot of albums could boast and given the rollout of this album the performances of this record the app that was attached and release along with this album - that allowed fans and users to kind of interact with the music itself there is an interesting conceptual meld here of nature and technology the one thing I will say about biophilia though is that it is not one of York's more accessible and hook and catchy albums not quite as groovy as some of her more popular works as well I myself had a somewhat lukewarm reaction to the album at first when I did a somewhat rust review of it with my wife but then girlfriend at the time it came out very cute I regret nothing still though as the years have drawn on I've realized that this is one of Newark's more out-of-the-box releases also one of her most mystical and otherworldly albums - as even some of the more skeletal tracks on the track listing here ranked as the records most compelling pieces of music because there are just these beautiful ballads all over this album these beautiful ODEs to the natural world songs like virus and Moon and mutual core thunderbolt and cosmogony there are points where I do wish the album was a bit more grand instrumentally though I do appreciate some of the unique instrumentation that was included on this somewhat sparse release I personally have grown to love a lot of this album sounds and themes and I think a lot of potential newcomers will as well once they get more of a fill of maybe her other records Bjork's second album here post 1995 release now as I stated earlier in the video when I was talking about debut I feel on this album New York was just kind of building off a lot of what she was doing on that album delivering on to fans an album that was just as versatile building out a lot of the same musical inspirations but just more fully realized Bjork's vocal performances on this album while they are not nearly as animated and as wild as they were on debut they are certainly more masterful and authoritative commanding and angelic yet also kind of alien the instrumentation on this thing was immaculate but still relatively down-to-earth like it was still very clear that she was grabbing a lot of influences from art pop and alternative dance music and trip-hop and there are some tracks on this album where Bjork begins to dip her toes into the huge gargantuan soaring and transcendental balladry that she would basically perfect on homogenic a few years later personally I love posts I think it's one of York's better records and the enjoyability of this album for me really comes down to just each song individually being great it's just a really well put together very cutting edge very imaginative set of art pop songs which was not just capitalizing on but also advancing pushing forward a lot of the musical trends at the time things like house music and a lot of the more contemporary fusions of electronic music and pop but pulled off with this mountainous arranged instrumentation in this vocal style that you're only gonna get out of Bjork album oh yeah and there's also another amazing jazz cover on this album - a rendition of the song it's oh so quiet Bjork steak on this track is wonderfully theatrical and freaky one of my favorite moments on the entire album I love the ritzy instrumentation and the in the walking bass line on this track the horn section is wonderful too but yeah this is one of my favorite Bjork records to me this album it's it's like futuristic bangers from the 90s if you give this record a shot I highly recommend tracks like army of me or enjoy tracks that to me push pop music to the brink with some very subtle nods and stuff like industrial but really the bread and butter of this album are these incredibly dynamic and and amazing ballads that to me just sound futuristic even today hyper ballad Isabel modern things these tracks that feel like these enchanted string kissed anthems meanwhile tracks like possibly maybe and you've been flirting again serve as a reminder that nobody does a love song quite like Bjork the closing track headphones is one of the sleepier numbers on the album and kind of gives a music appreciation angle to the romance thing so again posts for me is just one fantastic track after the next it might not have the same conceptual impact as a lot of the other records that she's dropped over the years but that doesn't really matter to me when you have songs that are this good when you have a tracklist that is this consistent and flows this well and post was still ahead of the curve in a lot of ways even if it was just the tip of the iceberg of the musical boundaries that be or could be pushing down the road next on my list we're essentially in the top three here is Bjork's 2004 album medulla placing pretty high here even if for a lot of music fans over the years this record has been kind of difficult to swallow because personally I feel like this is one of York's most bold and daring albums following the very lavish and synthetic Vespertine Bjork decided to take things pretty experimental and a very vocal direction resulting in what I think is is maybe Bjork's most interesting and in fully-realized instrumental concept and that is an album that is is largely based around the human voice to the point where nearly all the instrumentation you hear on this thing comes out of a human's mouth so you have a London choir on here an Icelandic choir third singer Tania to gawk someone listed as a human trombone you have beatboxers on here as well as mike patton of Faith No More fan Tomas mr. bungle Fame there's a lot of instrumentation on this album a lot of the mixes on this thing are pretty dense and because again it's largely based around the human voice Bjork needed a lot of personnel on this album there are a few tracks a few tracks on this thing to have a little bit of piano a little bit of synth bass but a lot of the time what you're hearing on this record is the human voice even if some parts of it are just electronically edited to make the pattern sort of sync up especially the rhythms the beatboxing now as a result of that this album is gonna sound odd to a lot of people it's most likely gonna be a challenging listen for a lot of newcomers it's been a challenging listen over the years for people who even appreciate New York's music and I guess I myself while I love love love love love this album I do hesitate to call it a perfect album some of the beatboxing does still feel a little awkward to me to this day it does take some getting used to and occasionally I think the mixing of the vocals leaves a little bit to be desired because you do have a limited frequency range in the human voice and you have so many human voices in the mix at once it can get just a little muddied especially on tracks like where is the line still though it's pretty easy for me to overlook a lot of the flaws on this album given just how groundbreaking and sharp some of the songs on this thing are I would also like to give Bjork some long overdue credit for embarking on these vocal experiments in a way that was that was very very risky before groups such as tune-yards or Dirty Projectors or Animal Collective would would popularize this very thing maybe without the beatboxing but still but a lot of highlights on this album a lot of highlights I love the wonderfully strange and and intriguing throat singing and hyperventilating on the song ancestor all of these synthetic vocal manipulations and and chorus whooping on the chorus of the track Oceania and I do think some of Bjork's most interesting and in stunningly beautiful songs land on this record - the song desired consolation is wonderful the track I think is one of her most well-written and hooky songs ever the song submarine as well is beautifully eerie absolutely love it I like that the songs on this album are so great they don't get sort of drowned in the the odd vocal based concept of this thing they're not lost in the indulgence of this album to me this is a very well written LP it's got a great flow I think it has an interesting I idea concept behind it it's a thrilling musical adventure and only the way Bjork could do it next on my list second - the best is Bjork's 1997 homogenic a record that I place here because I think it is one of York's most consistent albums one of her best written albums one of her best performed albums one of her most popular albums and in my opinion her first truly transcendental album consistently from front to back the first record where I think she hit upon a particular vibe a particular sound that would just go on to define almost the entirety of her career from here on out because what do you get on this thing you get some of the most advanced and ambitious art pop ever just very progressive cutting-edge electronics soaring string sections and vocals that are just cinematic just uh larger-than-life Bjork's vocals at their most dramatic and expressive at the time the song bachelorette for example is a track of love and devotion and attraction it's got a thunderous beat these juggernaut string sections Bjork singing is incredible the song has this heavy undeniable urgency to it it's like the fate of the fucking world depends on this romance that is the immense and intense level of emotion just pouring through on this album that we're talking about here the song five years features all these distorted skipping very intricate rhythms topped with an incredible vocal performance from Bjork where she is really at one of her artists and most experimental points on the album like she's just a wailing and hollering and blurting out kind of like a saxophone we have the glitchy and very robotic Pluto and the sweeping and elegant joga there's something about the electronics that a few points on this album that seems like it's it's rudimentary or it's primitive intentionally like I'm listening to some old craft work or something but then a lot of the vocals in the arranged instrumentation surrounding these electronics that they're wrapped up in seems super advanced very very complex it's like this album delivers this wonderful amazing cross-section of a lot of the more abstract and aggressive sounds coming out of electronic music and dance music at the time getting mixed with just this very dramatic very emotionally stirring art pop music because homogenic is not just one of York's best albums but it is a quintessential album in the art pop genre it's a quintessential album of the 90s itself and it's also worth asking would mainstream music and would pop music in general sound as grand and is over the top and as ambitious as it does today if not for albums like this if not for the advancements that Bjork made on this album whatever producers mark Bell made on this album if not for the advancements of contemporaries at the time like Portishead it really is a great record with a great flow a lot of fantastic songs total groundbreaker and it's one of those critically acclaimed it's one of those classic records this that's actually a great listen I swear to you it's not just like you know people who think that they're smarter than you telling you something's good and that you need to like it because they tell you you need to like it but still though I do recommend that newcomers prime themselves with maybe a little bit of her earlier work to kind of build up to this point and my final album my favorite Bjork album the record that I see in her discography to be her best mm one's Vespertine if homogenic was an album that basically sounded like the biggest thing on planet earth Vespertine to me is is just so gargantuan and and so otherworldly that it's in another galaxy there are a lot of familiar elements on this album that that carried over from york's previous LP a lot of the electronic rhythms and since some of the string sections Bjork's voice as well but all this has undergone a gigantic renovation and has become so much more dynamic subtle and refined it's like Bjork has found a way to mix the organic and the synthetic elements of her music on this record in such a way where it's a little seamless and it becomes difficult to tell where these two worlds begin and end especially with all of these strings and and harp and celesta and music boxes on this album kind of melting into each other not to mention all of the amazing micro beats bra by the likes of Matt mousse on this album one of my favorite musical duo's and I'm so amazed that their contributions on this record to this day sound incredibly fresh the tone of this album is consistently beautiful and inspiring it's wintry it's passionate as I stated earlier in this video a lot of björk's inspiration for writing on this album was from the relationship that she was kicking off pretty much with Matthew Barney which given that eventual romantic demise and how it played out on records like volnek era and her latest album utopia gives this album now for me a certain kind of sting I guess it's it's sort of hard to enjoy it in the same way that I used to or sort of look at it in in the same exact way but really that doesn't take away from just how beautiful a lot of Bjork's vocal performances on this album are how beautiful a lot of her poetry is on this album and it certainly doesn't affect at all just how gorgeous I find a lot of the instrumentation on this album to be obviously in my opinion the most gorgeous of any of the album's she has released so far and I'm gonna leave it at that guys that is my worst to best those are my favorite to least favorite Bjork albums I know that there's a lot I've left out in terms of context and and background on each album but this video already took so long to make and so long to write and I felt like I kept you guys waiting long enough to do this video and

q1bvVAqXx3Q,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where i go over the new singles & tracks that i thought were great that i thought

over here of a new track from the drums they are doing a charity single here which is pretty fantastic for Mexico so hit that up prick up that track buy that track for a good cause if you do end up enjoying it or even if you don't end up enjoying it because it's for a good cause and I also want to shout out a new cover that Smash Mouth did of car seat headrest it's it's linked down there as well and also my buddy eclectic method came out with a new song which is linked in the description box where he just samples me like crazy an eclectic method he's a bit of a sample sample based music artist a bit of a mashup kind of guy the mashup artist is probably in inaccurate in accurate description there but you kind of know where I'm coming from there he sort of took a lot of different video and audio chunks from a variety different reviews of mine sort of strung them into a song which is actually pretty hilarious and entertaining and if you hit that track up if you go listen to it not only does he make money off of it but I do - I'm getting a portion off of it as well because I'm I'm sampled all over it baby I'm all over that track baby so I guess in a way this is sort of my formal my formal Anthony Fantana music debut I guess you could say so alright oh I guess it's titled under the needle drop not Anthony Fantana but you get what I'm saying alright let's get into the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks to the week oh no the worst tracks of the week Oh naughty naughty tracks oh you're so bad you're so naughty oh let's stop joking around that were the worst tracks of the week one this new of Montreal plateau phase no careers of no corruption I don't know what Kevin Barnes is doing on this track it just kind of seems like he's going through the motions of performing a very tired shtick on not only this track but the last of Montreal song single that I heard which was actually a little bit more cutting edge than this one this to me feels like instead of pushing forward and coming out with something exciting and different Kevin is just like I don't know trying to trying to relive of Montreal's glory days from like 2004 five six or something I'm really confused by it it's a very mediocre track and the music video is actually kind of difficult to watch and also the new Beach House song another sort of indie mainstay from the 2000s that I think had a real future ahead of them after their teen dream record but instead of pushing forward and continuing to experiment with the dream pop sound and maybe transcend that and and their pitch work status entirely they decided that they were just going to come out with bloom which was pretty much a rehash of everything they had done up until that point but just you know with better production just more panoramic recording and mixing and all that stuff so while people receive it well at the time I feel like each new project and song I hear from them is just getting more and more tired and uninspired in this track it seemed like there the title of it being a lemon grow your glow rather lemon glow is uh while it seems like they're trying to experiment a little bit and try something different it just sounds horrific aliy awkward just really really awkward Legrand's vocals aren't quite as helped by that little extra splash of reverb the beat is really weird that there is that usual type of atmosphere that kind of makes their music so intoxicating yet they don't really replace it with anything to sort of make the track a bit more engaging or entertaining in any way so I'm pretty uh pretty let down by these these two new tracks I'm gonna move on to the tracks that I thought were met not great not awful but certainly worth shedding out and mentioning first this new single from yg which doesn't have the you know quite the west coast DJ mustard style I guess kind of Bay Area sounding g-funk inspired vibes that are all over his his last record this is a more contemporary more like trap inspired affair the tune itself isn't bad he just sounds kind of weird to me over this production I don't think it does a lot for him personally but you know I feel like he's trying to progress forward trying to do something different trying to advance we're trying to do something a little bit more modern and it's it's obviously a pretty gritty song a lot of gang references throughout the track to I mean just look at the freaking cover that doesn't need to be explained to you most likely it's not bad you know I'm sort of looking forward to seeing what he does next because while I do love his his last record I don't expect him to try to do the same thing over again completely this new track from the body is actually kind of compelling it does have an odd intro the shrieking and the beat don't really do all that much for me however the lingua Ignasi vocals her vocals that kind of pop in around the first third of the track and the strings that kind of build up and up and up higher and higher and higher as the track progresses are pretty incredible I've got to say I'm kind of intrigued by this upcoming body record though I've never been head over heels for much of what they've done so far outside of their debut which is actually pretty incredible pretty noisy pretty freakish new track from Rena saw a Yamaha intensed a seam track so sorry if you're I don't know a little a little late on this one it's not Valentine's Day anymore although this track is it's it's kind of sexy it's kind of a no-strings-attached kind of deal I didn't care too much for the melody on this one but still her voice and the kind of retro kind of futuristic production is there I just didn't care for the melody at all just felt like really tense and just really I guess not pleasing at all to the ear but still there were a lot of other things about the track that I thought were pretty good as up to snuff as I have expected them to be given her nice output so far I'm loving this new single and music video from Lala's this new song of theirs being titled secada I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly the the music video is like an old sort of like novella or like a Mexican soap opera or something and the whole track sort of sounds like surf rock with just like like a splash of just like Latin flair to it it's a very nice a very nice track didn't blow me away but it's it's pretty good it's pretty fun listen to dr. Octagon track I think dr. octagon is like definitely back here like this is definitely the dr. octagon I remember however the concept of the track is octagon this octagon that octagon like it's it he really goes overboard with it to the point where it's like I know it's almost hard to enjoy because I can't like not laugh at it but obviously there is an element of it that does feel kind of comedic and kind of telling too it just feels a little overkill you know what I mean but listen to it for yourself and you will you will hear how lyrically like laser focus this guy gets on a concept and an idea and if you haven't listened to well I'm gonna be doing you guys a disservice here if I don't bring this up if if you guys haven't heard I just want to look it up because I pronounced it wrong all the time dr. octagon ghana ecology octagon ecologist if you haven't heard that record you're you're fucking up you're fucking up you need to do yourself a favor dr. octagon a cop and can't dr octagon colleges I'm really bad at pronouncing and reading things but you guys you guys already know that by now alright moving on from there this new single from Diplo featuring DRAM is pretty interesting like there are points when I wish the instruments a lot a bit more punch and a bit more viscera to it but essentially Diplo and DRAM come together and like I don't know like deliver this 70s soul rock tune drams vocals just totally turned up to 10 and he is just soaring through this rock mix which again it does sound very sequenced and synthesized so it's not quite as explosive as I would like to be but damn I would I would love to hear DRAM at least for a tracker to like front a band that play is this kind of music like he pulls it off so well most of my issues again come from the production side of things but DRAM just fucking kills it on this track if you listen to this track for anything like listen to it for drams singing because it's amazing he's such a versatile artist I mean this in Black Milk track was okay True Lies I thought the production and some of the vocal layering were sort of messy but I did appreciate the lyrical concept of the song quite a bit and still looking forward to his upcoming album here and that is it I think until I get to the best tracks however that is not all the tracks I also wanted to shout out down there in the description box the Newmark kozilek song which Austin wrote a blurb he wrote a write-up for it's a very lengthy track it deals at least a little bit in the school shooting that just occurred on Valentine's Day of course because mark is somebody who writes about very very current events and his feelings onset events especially when they are sort of very public and very national tragedies so that's no surprise the instrumental is one of the most interesting I think he's pulled together in a while but the weird like Bill Evans Bob Evans narrative detours the track takes I think could have just been cut entirely and to me personally feel like kind of like a distraction from what may have originally inspired him to write the track or what what at least feels like that given how the song starts you know so in a way I do appreciate mark sentiments and I like what he's doing instrumentally but also simultaneously I'm disappointed and kind of just scratching my chin and and just wondering like what exactly is is the end or I guess the the the point of sort of going so narrative that you're basically like doing an internal monologue within an internal monologue within an internal monologue with an internal monologue you know it just kind of seems like you're kind of losing the the I guess the the narrative of your own song in a way but I guess that's that's my that's my personal thoughts on it and also in this section of the video the best tracks I have forgotten to have my buddy Jeremy add in some art for the new Ice Age single which is gonna be linked down below and is actually really good so don't miss out on that one alright new track from the void so I got a lot of tracks in this episode man I got a lot of tracks in this stuff is a new track from the voids they have a neutral beam out coming very soon titled virtue obviously and this new song of theirs is type of pointlessness it's one of the saddest ballads actually the saddest single to come out from this new album cycle it's like absolutely heart-wrenching I love the instrumental love Julian's voice love that I'm hearing something a bit more experimental from the band not quite as Street as the the first couple of singles that they dropped also new Sofie track amazing production total banger totally futuristic totally blow my fuckin mind I can't wait to hear this goddamn album I I don't know what I'll say man it's like the craziest most Avant pop like I'm hearing this decade you know it's like totally just scrambling my brain scrambling my brain I can't even begin to fucking describe this track accurately you know like I feel like since Sofie has taken the initiative in adding more vocals and lyrics to our music that it's it's really just kind of coming together in a way into something totally unique and different I don't know I and I don't feel like I'll have an accurate explanation until I hear the album but I'm just loving everything I'm hearing so far another thing I'm loving is this goddamn Raven Lynnae tracks sticky produced by Steve Lacey who did a little bit for the new Kendrick Lamar he also had a I think like a demo EP thing come out last year that some people were crazy about I wasn't that into it but still doing work for Lynnae on here someone who I'm not familiar with prior to this track but she is fantastic well not only is Steve's instrumental here great like it's so funky it it's a really interesting blend of pop of funk of R&B of a lot of different things and lynnae's vocals are really just kind of like the the showstopper you know they're really just like the the focal point of the track and not that she at least from what I've heard so far seems like a super flashy or super technical singer but she has so much personality and she kind of brings all these weird like somewhat spazzy but also very sensual and intriguing vocalizations into this track that really kind of grabbed my ear right away she's just she's just got like kind of a weird fringy angle to her approach on this style of music that I think is really cool I'm appreciating a lot moving on from there nuke caro bonito song where everybody's been freaking out because they're like Oh Caracara bonito there they're putting guitars in their songs where the sense the song is called only acting and a lot of those elements of western pop and japanese pop still show up in their stuff but then there's like a bit of a pop punk element that pops in here too that's actually pretty awesome I like it a lot it's very fun it just kind of keeps up that same kind of cutesy energy but it has sort of a gutsy a little bit of an edgy thing going on now that they're kind of fucking with a rock sound a little bit on this track all around a good tune and an awesome risk that they took that I think panned out very nicely not that I'm anticipating that the entire record that they drop next is going to be a rock album but it is a really cool thing that they did here and I am hoping that this single is on the new album new Joji i guess project it's kind of like his last EP that i reviewed this is sort of like the the built up version of it with a bunch of remixes and stuff and there's one particular remix of the track demons which lunes produced lunes of tonight fame it's actually like really amazingly chopped up like total banger and just like really a futuristic sounding very colourful very bubbly and very bouncy moving on from there new Frank Ocean cover of the song Moon River which was actually one of my favorite ballets for a long time love Audrey Hepburn singing on that track at first I thought Frank some vocal layering on these song was a little weird a little gimmicky but then I came to appreciate it after a couple of listens his rendition is pretty heartfelt but I will say there is kind of a weird I guess kind of standoffish nough subversion of the track which i think comes through on some of those weird vocal experimentations but I do think he does take some very interesting but subtle liberties with the melody and the lyrics of the song as well which I think are pretty refreshing moving on from there this is it nope there we go this is the new single from Courtney Barnett which man I didn't think I would end up loving the new Courtney Barnett song but here we are it's titled nameless faceless not only is an incredibly vibrant colorful fun interesting music video but the song topic of this song is super fucking serious basically kind of tapping into that mental fear of being a woman and walking around at night feeling unsafe keys clutch 3 between your fucking fingers because you're afraid you're gonna be attacked or assaulted or whatever so uh the the way that she kind of condensed that down into a very rough and wild garage rock tune was very interesting and not only that but I think as far as I guess recording and song structure and sort of the the way the band is performing and sort of gelling on this track it's much more interesting than the kind of lazy laid-back very moon as somewhat like um I don't there's just like a real sense of malaise in in Courtney's past records that didn't care for all that much this track to me felt very urgent and in an exciting way and I feel like she's taken her very narrative approach and very wordy approach to lyricism and songwriting and minoo actually turned into something incredibly interesting with this new track over here given that it seems like topically she has so much more purpose on this track than on previous songs where it seems like she's just kind of drawing on and on and on about whatever sort of thing happens to be popping in her head it's it's not particularly for me for me I get why some people dig it but I'm just liking the direction she's taking on this new track so much more it just seems way more engaging I guess moving on from there new code orange single it was an Adult Swim single that I didn't mention last week it slipped by me or I was aware of it but I forgot to add it and I'm trying not to let these songs slip by me anymore when they do stick out to me and this is actually one of the best tracks have heard from the band posts album so it's actually pretty awesome that they were able to come through with another I guess kind of banger that's a fusion of like elements of alternative rock and metalcore and there were some like really weird crazy post-production edits and and detours in the track that were pretty amazing as well I'm hoping that Code Orange just continues to experiment push forward and just like I don't know just like not only not only just push shove violently burn the boundaries that I think are limiting a lot of rock and especially loud Rock and extreme rock right now because it seems like they're really experimenting in a way that a lot of their contemporaries aren't and I think the song over ears is certainly proof of that one track over here I wanted to point your attention to is the new cock pistol Cree track check yeah man and she just came out with this new single new video as well it's hilarious it's catchy it's a song all about I guess relationship dynamics to sort of put it lightly if you don't remember cock pistol Cree she was featured on God what song was it but it was on a clippings debut record for Sub Pop she had one of my favorite verses on there and I know she's been coming out with stuff since and this is probably the the best track that I've heard her drop since that feature and I'm loving it a lot like it's definitely one of her catching your tracks definitely one of her more compelling vocal performances and some of her best verses and lines as well so a shout out to her and I want to give a shout out to the new on of on house wolf track new album on the way dead magic this new song over here is titled the truth the glow the fall it is a 12 minute monster in only the way that someone like Anna Vaughn house wolf could deliver it it's an epic you know long-winded very heart-wrenching piece the organs they're the the atmospheres they're you got to hear it it's amazing its immense and that has been our weekly track roundup guys that has been it so thank you for watching you're the best I love you remember again the good people at Squarespace to help bring this video to you and our Amazon and turntable lab associate links and I will see you guys in the next video I love you weekly track roundup forever 
t3CA5MUoE6Q,hey everyone hey everyone hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another y-you know review where I go over a series of albums that I didn't get a chance to to review full length styles so I did a little bit of a gauntlet thing and and here we are here we are so we're just gonna get into the records we're gonna get into the album's uh let's go new evidence album listen evidence he is a little underwhelming for me on this album I wish the record was a little bit more experimental and cutting-edge but this guy is one of the coldest dudes to ever touch the microphone and he still sounds like it on this new project two very lyrical lots of heady cerebral bars on this thing some good guests some decent production - I just wish it was a bit more exciting but shout out to evidence he's he's always very consistent very good and again if you had told me this was a pianos become the teeth record like I I would have never believed it until I actually saw the title on the cover of this thing because it sounds like a generic indie leftover from the 2000s that's just like a little emo a little dramatic like it's it's so derivative it's so nondescript there's literally nothing special about this album I'm actually kind of amazed at how unoriginal it is like it's it's it's really a feat to come out with a record that is this lacking in anything memorable anything defining its congratulations I I guess I was somewhat excited for this new porch's album I thought some of the promotional tracks were pretty decent but honestly I feel like the vocals were just are just really drab the beats are not quite as groovy and and danceable as I guess I would have liked them to be I mean I admire what porches tried to do on this project it's unlike anything that has been dropped under the porches name before but still it's it's it's pretty it's pretty drab in my opinion pretty drab this Lonzo album is garbage it's freaking garbage dude he sounds goofy on the microphone like Jesus Christ why man he's got a really think like he can just basically do anything white coming together with a good rap record it's it's not that easy you can't just be famous and have like a lot of money and just like do a rap album you know this is trash this is garbage dude this is frickin garbage oh my god this is this is like the most generic trap record I've heard in a long time like when when there's some auto-tune on the students voice he just sounds like a like a like a great value future I I don't I don't get it like the beats are dime a dozen his vocals I guess I wouldn't even be able to pick them out of a lineup the lyricism like what we're sysm like it's so bland it's like such a placeholder it's like this is something that people listen to when they're waiting for something actually interesting to come out please this is this is so forgettable seriously like I thought that metalcore was was almost like nearly creatively bankrupt last decade but I feel like we've hit a new low here with all the really wimpy melodramatic post-hardcore elements flowing throughout this thing and in a few moments where it just feels like I'm hearing some alternative R&B in the production it's so glitzy there's nothing exciting or raw about much of any of it like this is I admire the dude's hustle and it seems like you put a lot of heart into this thing but at this point he just sounds way too young and way too undefined for me to really kind of gravitate toward this record in any significant way like when I first heard it I felt like it was listening to dissection 80 but like way less exciting and so much more cumbersome and I guess kind of all over the place but still it seems like he's trying to do something with a bit of substance on here more substance than a lot of rap projects that you're gonna hear this year but still I feel like there's a bit in the way of execution and interesting instrumentals that's left to be desired but I guess as long as he keeps at it and he's continuing to try to do something better than you know the average I guess there's still reason to pay attention to be curious you know I feel like Laurie Anderson and the Kronos Quartet is just a bill that when I saw it like that should have just been fireworks that should have been instant fireworks but instead it's like I'm listening a really weak dark moody watered-down neoclassical music about hurricane sandy and I don't know it just it just reminds me of like forgettable post-rock I don't know like the narrations aren't that interesting the string compositions aren't that interesting I'm just kind of scraping to find anything exciting or even vaguely intriguing about this album and it's just not really here it's just not really here I was kind of fucking with this band sound on their last record where it seemed like they were a little influenced by women one of my favorite Canadian indie rock and underground bands and then I caught them live with Deerhoof and they were amazing so tight live like incredible performance great instrumental muscle interesting time signatures and grooves throughout nearly every track but then when I hear this new record over here I feel like the grooves and the drums and the bass they're not really there they sound really Hollow then I have them that much presence the guitars had this annoyingly metallic and twangy tambour to them that sounds like steel drums which I've heard other artists do before but I feel like it's just a little overdone on this record over here and the vocals sound like such like I don't know like a panda bear ripoff like obviously there's a little bit of Brian Wilson influence on here but it feels like it's only coming by way of Animal Collective to me this record just kind of sounds like Animal Collective trying to do math rock and it's such I don't know like a futile exercise I guess I just don't see the appeal in this project like I get that some of the songs on here are pretty big hits but I just feel like that chief young thug is so corny some of the more low-key and acoustic tracks are pretty but I don't really think her voice is that interesting or exciting like it's not that sexy it's not that expressive she just kind of sounds like I don't know one of many very young just plugged in pop songs dresses that don't have much in the way of personality and have more production value than they do character on a record you know some parts of it are listenable but when I say it's memorable what I say it's exciting not not really no imagine this two guys from the Midwest signed to Def Jam come through the project that sounds like a bunch of old school like gee funk and Bay Area stuff and it's kind of catchy but they also overloaded this project with a bunch of songs that didn't need to be here some slick flows on here some cool grooves if that interests you I guess try it I am horrified by the album cover on this thing I I do not I do not want to subject myself to this I refuse I refuse I refuse I refuse I'm just I'm not not putting myself through the torture okay I'm gonna do something else gonna do something else the body and full of hell I kind of regret not reviewing this last year it's decent it's okay I would say it's about on par with their last collaborative album if you're looking for an interesting fusion of experimental music Noise music metal and metalcore like the extreme the most abrasive elements of the metal underground give this thing a shot you know I definitely think the body and full of hell complement one another when they land on a record because I think full of Hell brings a lot more viscera and a lot more energy and a lot more I guess explosivity to what the body does meanwhile the body brings a certain level of experimentation and adventure to the very meat and potatoes and an aggressive and muscular sound that full of Hell brings on their records however I just wish that they would come through with an album that felt a little bit more I guess thematic and satisfying and ambitious because the two projects they've released so far just kind of seem like is somewhat interesting smattering of collaborations just kind of sprinkled about this LP some hit some don't some feel more fleshed out than others it's just not all that consistent it just doesn't feel all that built up you know what I mean but it's it's worth a try it's worth the try if you're looking for some extreme experimental music I'm glad this new balance of Bashan EP is decent but like I don't get the reasoning behind just dropping all of this music across a bunch of EPS and and that's probably as a result of my ignorance that I don't know that I guess I'll admit I'm not up on the the Belle and Sebastian narrative at the moment but I I guess I just wish that they would drop a great record instead of trying to come through with some gimmicky vision as to how to release all these new songs that they've penned because I really don't feel like it's that interesting I don't want to look at it I don't want to look at it anymore this album sucks like this is like his R&B album like he's just like auto-tune crooning I nearly every track here it's garbage like the lyrics suck his singing sucks the production is generic as hell I don't get the appeal of this this is just trash this is like the worst thing he's released so far it's truly the worst thing he's put out and his last record like who even paid attention to his last record who is still saying Tyga hey put out some more music oh I know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna come out with a terrible R&B album er I just autumn to myself the whole frickin time oh that's great do that that's a great idea we'll put up money for that what why this is terrible and who the hell okayed this fucking album cover it's hilarious that back in the day I remember Kanye like complaining online about oh they won't let me put up the album cover that I want to put out for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and it's like okay how does he get a hard time with that but this is fucking okay this is okay like we're cool with this like what the fuck ashin have you given these albums a listen did you love him did you hate him what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I review
