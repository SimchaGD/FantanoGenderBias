cRO0BuhzDsw,hi everyone trapped in any fact Hanano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Alex Cameron album Miami memory this is the newest full-length LP from Australia native singer and songwriter mr. Alex Cameron which has been one of my most anticipated albums of the year mostly because I have been dying to hear more from this guy ever since his 2017 album dropped forced witness which was easily one of my favorite records of that year Alex on this project showed an incredible knack for lyricism showmanship character portraits storytelling also hilariously rude one-liners on many tracks here embodying these completely scummy personas with criminal problems Peto problems anger problems relationship problems forced witness pretty much serves as a dark and funny analysis of the sleaziest men that Cameron could imagine playing out over some truly fantastic instrumentals embracing a golden era of synth pop and groovy Heartland rock there is definitely a bit of slick Springsteen and Mellencamp swagger to a lot of what Cameron was doing on that record I think a good chunk of that has carried over onto his latest effort here too so again forest witness loved that album wanted to hear what Alex Cameron was going to do after this but sadly could not bring myself to be excited to hear this new album mostly because I was shocked by the sound of the lead singles from this thing the title track divorce both of which feature these incessant looped cheap sounding bits of cyclical percussion that kind of ruined the groove and the instrumental flow of the songs for me I thought the third teaser tracked to this thing far from born again was actually one of Alex Cameron's best songs from the outset I thought that it was a romantic and lovely ode to sex workers but it was slightly sad too still here that that grimy little rasp in his voice in favor of I guess a cleaner vocal tone however now that I'm hearing the entire record I am growing to appreciate why that that change in vocal delivery is there I'm now having some of these tracks I was once questioning growing on me a bit I think the biggest changes in Alex Cameron sound and writing style on this project come as a result of him no longer singing in character as he is performing these songs the tracks on this record are Alex essentially singing from his own personal experience which of course up until this point has has informed and influenced all of his writing to some degree but not to the point where he is literally singing about things that have happened to him as the narrative voice that these things are actually happening to and many of these experiences revolve around the relationship he has with a significant other from teetering on the edge of divorce to becoming a stepdad Miami memory is not a super romantic lovey-dovey vanilla ass album though in true Alex Cameron fashion he focuses mostly on when things are going to hell and delivers a hilariously disastrous take on it occasionally detouring into like I said earlier and ode to sex workers or even a dated view on masculinity with the track bad for the boys which feels like a consciously satirical but also very serious and genuinely enjoyable update to Thin Lizzy's the boys are back in town but we'll get more into that later so Miami memory contains all of the wit and the tuneful glory that has made Alex Cameron great up until this point it's just got a bit of a different delivery a different recipe I liked a lot of the qualities of step-dad the opening track on this thing where again Alex Cameron is essentially celebrating becoming a stepdad it's a righteous tune where I guess he's trying to relate to a significant others kid explain the reason for his presence in their life I saw your mom on a TV show and that was that my bags were packed it's no wonder that Alex Cameron finds it so easy to embody these characters in his songs because even when he's singing about himself and things that he's doing he is still a character singing bars like butt you see my name in the headlines and they're all pissing on me I'm your stepdad Alex Cameron essentially comes off like a volatile but well-meaning character in a TV drama d instrumentally the story is set to these very rigid blaring synth chords that just don't have enough groove to them in my view in the mix much of the instrumentation feels like it suffers at the hand of these blaring synthesizers that I just wish that there was more balance between all the sounds here on this track the hook does blossom pretty nicely though with some light guitar and ringing tones I do like that quality of the track and there is something kind of shabby and rickety about the instrumentation here that reminds me of not Alex Cameron's previous record but the one before that where his sound and aesthetic was a lot more low fie and quirky I guess I just assumed that once we were getting those high-gloss fantastic instrumentals off forced witness Alex would just continue to exist in that space but no and in a way he has reverted to a place where he is embracing much weirder instrumental palettes which has its pros and has its cons like the next track the title track that cyclical beat that is a through-line from the front to the back of the song initially I was really deeply repulsed by it even though I did like the lyrics even though I did like the tune at the core of the track it has grown on me a bit since I've been listening to the album more and more I now see the beat as a bit more hypnotic in true Alex Cameron fashion it is equal parts graphic and romantic talking about in a loving way holding this person's hand so they're not too far out of reach and the juxtaposing that with eating their ass like an oyster them coming like a tsunami and watching them pleasure a woman while you carry on I don't think the record truly gains its footing in lights up until the third track here far from born again which is the swanky groovy fun playful tune again about sex workers portraying them I think in a much more honest light as workers as adults making adult decisions paying bills I love the glitzy instrumentation on this track I like the doodoo to do background vocals and the track from front to back is packed with one-liners there's no romancin when a woman makes a money from dancing she is not gonna follow you cha also they're angry little dogs but she don't care what they say same men that tell her stop are the same suckers that pay far from born again she's doing porn again also are you seeing what I'm seeing in control in command I think is an essential lyric in the song because it's like alex is admitting we're acknowledging the fact that he is looking at this profession or looking at the people doing it in a different light than most people are and he is not seeing a slut a whore a terrible person somebody who is out of control of their lives and doesn't know what to do a total mess he's seeing someone who is in control in command he's seeing the effort the time the energy even I guess you could say the artistry that goes into these professions the purpose it serves and the giant market behind all of it because it truly is one of society's greatest lies that we have this thing that a vast majority of people consume and yet the people who create this thing that so many people are consuming are chastised they are shamed I think the genius-level rioting continues on to the next track Gaslight where Alex Cameron makes a pretty funny observation about gas lighting within a relationship gas lighting each other for various reasons and also using the gas light as a metaphor for something - I guess shine or light away the whole thing is placed over this really jangly almost folky instrumentation it's lush it's pretty but quite rustic and organic - instrumentally bad for the boys is a classic piece of piano rock that would be very comfortable in an old-school New York dive bar the track is essentially about old sexist attitudes catching up with guys who refuse to let go of them as I said before in the review it's pretty obvious that there is some clear inspiration coming from Thin Lizzy's the boys are back in town a little instrumentally a little aesthetically but mostly lyrically with Alex in the lyrics mentioning these men by name who have essentially fallen victim to these dated attitudes good old Dane what a shame done for a sexual harrass claim what about Phil lost his chill had to eat that damn red pill now you're living little lives without women and blaming them for all the change you thought the boys were supposed to stay the same but no one cares about the good old days so it's a cute playful tongue-in-cheek socially aware bit of piano rock commentary about shifting social paradigms and also about the bitterness that some guys can't seem to let go of because they're not being given the same unearned privileges that previous generations of men may have had at least in the sphere of relationships or gender politics anyway so yes while we do get a bit of mockery of people who might decry something like PC culture simultaneously alex does understand the importance of being able to live your own life by your own standards let loose and exist without a filter at least in some contexts mostly on the track PC with me which is a very funny song reminding me of a time I interviewed Alex Cameron and he spoke of his significant other almost driving him to a point artistically where he is taking more risks being less afraid of saying the wrong thing he is essentially singing about his relationship with this person in such a way where it is a safe space in that they don't have to be PC together they don't have to be PC with each other I love the tracks vintage piano rock instrumental pallet I love the background vocals I love the horns shout-out to Roy Malloy also the regal chords transitioning into the hook on this thing are fantastic I love Alex's hilarious lyrical references to Santa with AIDS and sodomy and Berlin there are a lot of things that you could certainly accuse Alex Cameron of as a result of his songs as a result of his back catalogue but being ill-intentioned and pulling too many punches are not two of them we also had the fiery divorce which is another track whose instrumental I didn't care for it at first but there isn't too much in terms of intrusive sequence percussion or anything on this track so warming up to it more was pretty easy with a few more lessons really it's the explosive lyrics of this track that light it up and sell the song essentially threatening to leave the relationship divorce just called things over and doing it in such a dramatic and uncaring fashion and even though everything alex is saying and sharing is very clearly something he will regret later it feels so good in the moment for him to say stuff like I got friends in Kansas City with a motherfucking futon couch definitely a highlight on the record in the tracklist there are certainly a few underwhelming cuts I don't care all that much for we have the sleepy dylan-esque ballad other ladies and also the very so-so end is nigh the closing track on this one is pretty strong though not only is it a very nice ballad but it ends with a closing monologue that I think sums up a lot of the feelings of the record gets down to lingering feelings of jealousy when it comes to one dealing with your romantic partners past because there are people on all sides of the gender aisle in in the world of love that can have trust issues can have jealousy issues when it comes to thinking about who our ex's previous partners were thinking that they were at one time in love with somebody else and Alex Cameron addresses these feelings get some closure and some resolution on them again in this beautiful monologue where he essentially comes to terms with the fact that these things in the past have happened and and what matters the most to him now as far as keeping this relationship going loving this person being their rock being their support in my view on this record Alex Cameron is truly sounding as good as ever as far as his singing his lyrics his writing his song structures everything I just wish there were some instrumentals here that were a bit smoother let me stress the Alex Cameron is in my view a pretty unique artist and what makes him unique is that he is absolutely killing it when it comes to writing witty and smart songs about love and masculinity from a male perspective and not that anyone even a man deserves special treatment for coming to the conclusion that things like sexism are bad but still this is something that needs to internally be turned off there's only so much yelling at there's only so much canceling you can do to really curb it and when it does happen I think it's important to embrace those that do so and and celebrate that especially when they are able to make such compelling art on the matter I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have you given this album a

toward hurricane durian relief it is upsetting in my opinion that the world largely has turned its back on the incredible destruction that has followed in the wake of durian and at least some of what REM is is going to you know the the good they're doing here it's going to have some relief I know there aren't a lot of huge REM fans in my audience but if you're a national fan you know and I know some of y'all are out there give this track a try give it a shot maybe even buy it because you know REM have been a huge influence on the National over the years and the instrumentation on this new track is is quite sad and syrupy so uh you know I think I think the National fans will definitely appreciate that and get into it let's get into the worst track so this week excuse me there's gonna be a long episode of let's argue everybody I have a lot of tracks to go over so you know bear with me if there are some that I just gloss over a bit because there are so many to cover there's somebody to talk about first one is this latest track from our boy Russ it is titled rent free given the title I already knew what the song was going to be about it's gonna be about his haters and he lives in their heads rent free or specifically his enemies but I feel like this track proves the opposite because you're literally making a song about the people who you claim you're living in the heads of but obviously they're living in your head enough for you to make a song about it and drop it as a single you know just usual rust logic and obviously like usual boring flat production mediocre rapping and just all-around boring we also have Halsey who continues to be one of the most I guess uninteresting voices in pop music I mean there is a severe lack of creativity on this new graveyard single it's kind of plucky it's got a lot of quirky percussion on it and the vocals are absolutely forgettable I just don't get what's so interesting about it moving on from there Green Day father of all the opening track the title track I guess of there to come very soon new record and I did a full length track review of this one on the Fantana channel you should check that out because I do go much more in depth on my feelings over there but this pretty much sounds like a really old stale 2000s era faux rock-and-roll kind of garage rock tune the sort of stuff that Green Day objectively even though I wasn't really crazy about the American Idiot era was doing much better than in terms of just like having a more standout memorable distinct sound now they're just kind of making this trash song that has no personality to it whatsoever I'm sure this will all work its way into an overall concept on this new album in some way shape or form and and even if it does I don't anticipate that making my feelings on the track grow any any warmer because frankly I find this would just be really basic underwhelming and lacking any distinct qualities whatsoever we have fka twigs who has dropped a new single holy terrain with future boring beat future is not utilized in a very creative way and overall it just sounds like a Bjork Vespertine ripoff but with no personality whatsoever and not much in the way of above an interesting or memorable song it's but what is it is this a pirate hat this is a pirate hat right now we're just gonna move to the next one Fall Out Boy with Wyclef Jean dear future self hands up one of the most annoying songs I've heard this week vocals are uppity guitars need to go into the recycling bin and I'm just really not sure what else to say it's absolutely absolutely obnoxious I cannot stand it we have Drake behind bars which is a track that he saw fit to include in this new compilation of tracks for this top boy comp which essentially is is music inspired by a really cool UK television series that I guess Drake has has played a role in in getting it to come back because I guess there's been a pretty large gap of time in which it's it's just been gone and I I admire that about this project I mean I think it's cool that Drake is getting you know involved in um storytelling based media in this way and I think that his involvement in this project is cool and I guess at the end of the day all that he's done is just kind of like thrown his name behind this compilation and thrown his name behind this project in order to get it some more buzz and that's ultimately I think a good thing even if the song itself is like really underwhelming like the flow is trash the bars are boring but it's Drake literally anything that he does and will do will grab people's attention and get people talking so you know I think that's ultimately he wanted to do here I don't think he was trying to make or deliver or give to us one of his best songs that he's ever done or anything like that more just to kind of draw people's attention to this you know uk-based series that seems pretty worthwhile and also a you know mind you they're actually a lot of cool names on this compilation you know aside from the Drake track which is just a bonus track you know we have Pop cannon here we have GATS on here we have little Sims on here who has made one of the best hip-hop records of the year so you know get the single shot because a lot of great uk-based artists on this on this comp that are definitely worth your time we have a boogie with the hoodie who has come through with a new track mood swings which essentially sounds like an auto-tuned heart attack it's terrible we have Charlie's Angels the the film soundtrack single from it don't call me and don't call me angel with ariana grande - iris Lana Del Rey yeah it's it's pretty much just like a trashy not all that good bad modern soundtrack collaboration without much chemistry from any of the artists it's just big names to get you to look at the track to get a look at the trailer to get you to look at the movie I don't really think the fact that this song is so painfully mediocre reflects on any of the artists involved it's it's just a really bad Hollywood song and that's all there is to it let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of met that I thought were kind of underwhelming but still worth pointing out because I think I think you guys might like them more than me we have Twin Peaks whose new record is out now the indie rock outfit with with a bit of an Americana even folky at times edge again new record here it's been a while since they've come out with a new record last time I heard their music they weren't really doing too much for me I wouldn't say that's the case for a bulk of the material on their on their new album either but hey I think that there are a lot of people out there who are fucking with their music more than me you know if you love singer-songwriter music with kind of a quirky indie edge to it because I do think the guys do display some wit and you know occasionally a a good sense of humor on their tracks on this record I just don't really think personality-wise and and stylistically it stands out all that much for me nor does the songwriting blow me away a lot of the time but oh mama is the name of this track I recommend that you know some of you guys if those genres of music tend to be your favorites give it a shot give it a try we also perfume genius I in the wall I'm not really sure reading into this new song and who mike is collaborating with on this like where exactly this is going because this is not your average perfume genius song this is very much like Mike's vocals not delivering like a sad soul-crushing ballad it's it's more like a psychedelic experimental dance tune where his vocals was kind of like lost in this haze of effects and just really out there production I can't really say I'm all that crazy about it but I am intrigued so I don't know I guess I'll be just looking out to see where exactly this goes not exactly what I would expect from perfume genius and not sure I want to hear more songs like this but I will color color me interested I guess we have m83 who has dropped another track that is essentially like a bit of an old-school synth Odyssey but with kind of a modern beat behind it frankly I find this style in this direction really boring loon to fail is the name of this new track which I'm probably not even pronouncing correctly but yeah I'm not too crazy about it frankly I guess less long-winded than the last single that has just been dropped but again if you didn't really like the style or the sound that was being chased after on that song I don't perceive many people we win and won over by this new track over here we have kero kero bonito who have come out with a new track as well when the fires come it's got a bit of dance beat to it so it again another change of pace this is not the quirky j-pop electro-pop sound that they kind of broke out of the scene with this is not the noise pop twee pop indie rock sound that they transitioned into on their last album now they're coming out with some dance music that has some sunny shimmering island vibes to it I don't know if that's gonna be the entirety of their their new thing on the next project maybe it will maybe it won't but I think it has some admirable qualities to it but I found the tune a little boring and I wish that the dance beat just went maybe a little bit harder or something you know there's something about this track that just really fell flat for me but you know I'm interested I'm intrigued whatever kerokero bonito is bringing a new sound of the table so let's see where this one goes I guess we have Alex Cameron stepdad intro track to his new record which I'm going to be reviewing very soon and I'm not going to spoil my thoughts on this track or anything right now but check it out you know I know I'm not super crazy about it obviously it landed in the math section but I have had some changes of heart on some tracks on this record and I am impressed with a quite a few songs off the album and you'll hear my opinions on this one soon so check it out check it out we also have holy fuck they're back with this new track Lux and it has Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip Fame and doing vocals the dance beyond this track is OK Taylor's vocals underwhelmed me severely I'm not sure what else to add truly and honestly it doesn't really seem to bring forth that creative left-field indeed dance sound that holy fuck that holy fuck was was once amazing at and and again I think if Taylor was gonna appear on this track that the vocals could have been a bit more impassioned or something I mean there are some cool elements of the song specifically some of the scents and some of the beats it does have a hard-driving groove but it does tend to get a little repetitive or it feels very repetitive given that other than the beat there's not really a whole lot about the track that's all that ear grabbing let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the ones that impress me the most I have quite a bit of tracks to get through actually actually a lot of tracks in the best section so let's go let's go let's go Van Weiser I have a track review for this on the Fantana Channel loved it explosive track it pretty much feels like classic Weezer with soaring anthemic guitars the van Halen reference is not lost on me nor should it be on you and it is very very very intentional we have Vivian girls their new record memories coming out very soon sludge is the name of this new track and it's absolutely one of the heaviest noisiest most depressing tracks the girls I've ever come out with I don't know what to say it's it's an incredible change of pace obviously not every song on their new record sounds like this but I don't know for a stylistic switch up at least for one track it goes over incredibly incredibly well this track is so so freakin weird and dark and it really embodies its title it's quite sludgy in a way we have underworld the electronic music duo have come out with this track STAAR that's actually kind of left-field weird and mind-blowing it's got some very odd disjointed lyrics a hard hard hard grooving beat that's some pretty techno inspired I guess I could say it's austere like many underworld tracks are but I think the visceral grooves and the abstract lyricism of the track do a lot to push what the duo does forward and I don't know I'm gonna be keeping an ear out for more for more material that goes in this direction for sure we have our friend richard dawson singer/songwriter coming through new record very soon obviously i've talked about his music in this new album cycle recently before and dawson very much sounds like he's not in the I guess archaic what's the word I'm looking for medieval folk style that he did so well on his last full length record he's doing more of an electric lo-fi kind of noise Fulke thing on this latest batch of tracks and I'm loving the weird grooves the weird vocals the creative songwriting ideas richard dawson continues to prove himself to be a one-of-a-kind artist and you know just excited to cover his new when it does drop here we have 10 out of 10 a new track from Rex Orange County cute little poppy soulish type of tune it's very straightforward it's very simple but there's some heartfelt lyrics and a very cheery almost inspiring instrumental behind this one which there was a bit more detail and nuance to it but it's still very pretty and very fun and very catchy as is here we have Colorado new track from a neil young and crazy crazy horse or rather Colorado was the name of the new record the name of this new track over here that I've been enjoying his rainbow colors and excuse me rainbow of colors and it's some look if you know Neil Young's catalog you know that his stuff with Crazy Horse tends to be some of his boldest and most wild material and he doesn't he lives up to that reputation with this new track over here basically on a song that addresses discrimination anti-immigration sentiments things that you shouldn't be surprised about hearing at this point and given our current political landscape and even though Neil's voice is not quite what it used to be it's still a very powerful song very powerful ballad and performance it's really immense it's tattered it is emotionally stirring and I guess I will leave it at that we have liturgy experimental black metal band transcendental black metal band liturgy they are back God of love brand-new song and they are once again chasing after that Mathi intense black metal sound that they were foraging on what in my opinion is one of the most underrated metal albums of the decade Aesthetica and I was very unhappy when the the group and Hunter pretty much abandoned that sound for four reasons that I that I get but still abandoned that sound for the most part and and went on to do other things after the band shifted members and and everything and really amazing to hear them just back on that horse and coming out with some great trance Dental powerful amazing work no band is right now putting out guitars and drums and compositions that sound like this and it is insane it's an amazing in my opinion actually so moving out from there we have lil nas ex and a baby basically coming through with a a remix of panini which I've always felt like that track could use another verse another something it's a little brief it's a little short de baby has been proving himself be a really good feature artist and it's just great that he comes through and kills it on this track add some extra character add some extra beef and just comes out sounding fun and good we also have Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth Fame who has been dropping track after track after track on her new full-length album this one titled Airbnb is one of the noisiest and freakiest yet I think the lyrics are a little out there kind of funny in a way not in a bad way I just like you know the very harsh I think I don't know bold and bright and weird critique that the track tries to a to bring forward here and I'm loving just how gnarly the guitars are it's just a really gutsy fucking song so shout out to Kim Gordon for coming through with some more solo material as of late that she just continues to kill it with we have JPEG mafia beta male strategies give a track review of this track over on the Fantana channel loved it gonna review this album very soon this week not gonna spoil any more thoughts on this one okay but still damn Peggy we have Jenny who vol who's come through with a new track new album it is a kind of weird little synth Odyssey with some strange strange strange vocals attached the track here is titled accident if I remember correctly and it's just another track I'm not gonna get too deep into because I hope to cover this new record in some way shape or form this week so just look for my thoughts then and there we also have a new ghost single the track that I am talking about here because there is a b-side to it but I'm talking about the a side kiss the gogoat given that title if you know your kind of 60s rock and stuff like that you get the reference going on there and yeah it does kind of sound like a 60s go-go dancer type of rock tune but ghosts kind of pulls it off in their own weird little occult way and I like it a lot it's a very fun tongue-in-cheek blasphemous kind of song that I think is pretty amazing you know yeah it's it's not anywhere near as metal as some of the stuff the band used to come out with but I think it's a pretty fun how creative they're getting with with this song and really just having fun with it I guess we also had this brand-new banger banger single between slow ty and Denzel Currie psycho goes absolutely insane so ty and Denzel certainly bring the best out in each other on this one hopefully this is not the last time these two cross over and we have a new track from clipping the instrumental sounds like I don't know like if I guess black moth super rainbow made a rat banger like an alternative rat ban here it's very kind of fuzzy and psychedelic and strange but also dahveed's lyrics over the top of it just like he's just a top-notch lyricist and there's really nothing else that you can say about the guys talent at this point so Charli XCX has another track with a Troye Sivan out I guess in a way spiritually I guess you could say it's a follow-up to a 1999 this one is 2099 but I'm not going to talk about this track too much as Charlie's new record is out listen to it stream it I'm going to review it talked about it myself very soon we have cattle decapitation death metal band to cattle the capitation they are back with a brand new tract one day closer to the end of the world is absolutely fucking brutal riffs are amazing vocal transitions are great tight as hell heavy as hell just loving that this band is staying nimble creative and engaging as they continue to drop record after record after record also Bonnie Prince Billy has come through with a another ballad he's been on kind of a weird Factory as of late and I'm very interested in his new record I have made a place as a result of that this one is called at the back of the pit and it's got a very theatrical music video attached to it and yeah a lot like that blueberry's track it's it's it's very odd it's very odd a little funny but also incredibly serious in its weird attitude I cannot fully explain it hopefully I will have you know more apt descriptions of what is so off-putting about this recent material if I get a review for it together at some point and we also have shout out to Angel Olsen she has a new track out a lot like her last track that she dropped her last single it's kind of huge it's an epic it's titled lark it's just like soaring powerful immense loving that she's really trying to get super ambitious with her latest material over here you know there were some elements of it that I wasn't completely interpreting I think fully yet because it is so heavy and it does feel so layered but I'm pretty blown away by the very large presentation and in the vocal performance on these tracks so far so lark angel all said give it a shot give it a try and that has been the weekly track round of everybody thank you very much for watching remember all the songs that I talked about in this video are linked down below so you can check them out for yourself and we will see you in the next one in the next weekly track roundup in the next review in the next something anthony Fantana weekly tracks

D95K29ZTxpo,"Oh Oh a b c d e f g tan oh here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new IDK album is he real this is the newest full-length album from Maryland native idk aka J idk he has been making quite the buzz over the past couple of years turning quite a few heads in 2017 with his thoughtful lyricism and versatile flows on his I was very bad record he then expanded his profile with a 2018 collaborative EP that saw him working with names like Rico nasty Q to fool wale Mac so cream demo Genesis he is now making his Warner Records debut with a bit of a miniature concept album here is he real now if you're familiar with Jays back catalogue you know that he is no stranger to the concept album even one of the guys earliest projects 2015 sub trap saw him rapping and writing from the perspective of I think 10 or so different people about drug dealing the mentality of someone doing such a thing the effects of it the culture surrounding it yes a lot of tracks off of this project were heavily influenced by the likes of Kendrick Lamar I think from the flows to the instrumentals to the storytelling but there was still an incredible amount of raw talent and potential in what Jay was doing on this project potential I think that's yet to be fully capitalized on so I went into this newest project here hoping that he would now is he real gives us 36 minutes of runtime about 14 tracks much of the project focuses on morality religion having faith humanity being flawed contradictions in religious Scripture and just spirituality at large which is a very tall conceptual order to fill especially on a project with this short of a runtime and the truth is while I think a lot of the intentions and ideas behind is he real are admirable there isn't really enough length or depth or focus throughout this thing to really scratch beyond the surface of these topics and that's not to say there aren't good songs on here there are but as a narrative as a progression as an artistic statement is he real is not as fulfilling as I think it could have been especially as idk is packing the tracklist on this thing with all these shortcuts all of these interludes all of these spoken word bits many of which are nice and are fine and bring a greater context to a lot of what he's rapping about here but nothing is going to sell this album better than great songs and there just aren't enough of those here we have the edgy intro track on this thing which tells a bit of a story of going to heaven and waiting to go through the pearly gates and ends with the narrator shouting cuz god is it fucking real or which even as an atheist myself seemed just like a little bit too overboard we have 4,200 choices which featured a great beat a great flow the title is in reference to I think the variety of different religions one could choose to follow but you wouldn't know it from the lyrics as a lot of what jay is spitting about on this track doesn't really relate directly to that Jay pretty consistently though drops these violent grim bars making reference to that while also talking about being young bored at church bored with religion not really buying into God and spirituality as a concept I guess after that calling out I'm drowning I'm drowning maybe sort of portraying himself in a dark place as a result of that lack of faith and it's a good moment it's a good start to the record the first half of the song is amazing but why is there not a second or third verse on this thing why does Jay not seem to have more to say on this juxtaposition there is so much potential in this track but it's really just a third of a song padded out a bit and then extending into a spoken word but that sounds like DMX giving a sermon which is kind of a cool addition to the tracklist but I would find it much more satisfying as an interlude if it came right after a song where I felt like I needed a break give the audience a more fulfilling musical experience before you drop them off into this bit of audio cinema where again DMX is giving this sermon you have what sounds like our protagonist being baptized dropped in the water coming up having to take a breath and so far all of this flows together very seamlessly another thing that I like about the record but it's not really until the fourth track that you really get your first well-structured built out song and that's the track alone which is very groovy very laid-back pretty melodic the song is all about being alone and not just in the literal sense but also in the sense that Jay doesn't have guidance or a rudder as he coasts through these really difficult decisions and and rough patches in life talking about people not liking him being paranoid being jealous also I'm rejecting traditional education in a somewhat immature way telling his teachers to a suck his penis I think there are other smarter ways to write off such things unfortunately Jay just does not really get that across after this we have the song 24 which is one of my favorite tracks on the record but the song pretty much sounds like as I listen to it more a heavier version of Kendrick Lamar's humble it's pretty much idk dropping this one nutty braggadocious bar after another over this trap beat that has a lot of piano woven into it the flow switch ups on this track are pretty nice too but again why is it taking us till track five to get a real fire cut and when we get it it kind of sounds like a hit song we're already well aware of the song lily is another semi highlight in the tracklist for me Jays delivery on this track reminds me of some of the more aggressive material Kanye's been releasing as of late a lot of attitude being shown I also think there's a bit of an emo trap twist to the song too with the moody lyrical monologues and the singing the song essentially being about two people using each other in a relationship for sex for money the track is just under two minutes though and it just kind of coasts right into the next cut at a moment where I feel like it could be saying and it could be doing more the song porno was a track that I loved quite a bit I loved the message or the theme of blind sex hunger throughout the song with some really really lewd lyrics push a t it has a feature on the back end of the track that is absolutely fantastic the first verse is a great start I love the gang chorus vocal break like right as we go into the second phase of the song where we have all of these girls chanting you don't need no job when your pussy is the bell I love the rumbling bass the tongue clicks in the beat definitely one of the better tracks on here that doesn't sound like a carbon copy of just another track somewhere else on somebody else's album the reason I say that is because December with burna boy while it is a great track I think burna boys singing on this song is impeccable goes over really nicely and pleasantly the beat and even I DK's half rapping half singing on this thing sounds like it could have come from the last goldlink album yes it just sounds like a goldlink song meanwhile the track digital which I do admit is another highlight on here some of the flows and especially the instrumental just sounds like a carbon copy of Magnolia yes piers production from Magnolia that playboy cardi track it just sounds like he's doing a Magnolia flip there are some other tracks that do leave the ending of this record relatively strong though I think that no cable is a highlight i think that julia is a stunning finisher where lyrically jay goes over some really traumatic events that painted his youth painted his childhood years that i will not spoil in the record because they are quite intense and again quite dark so there are tracks on this record that I liked verses that I liked instrumentals I liked ideas that I thought were great but it rarely aligned and came together in a way where it felt like I was listening to fireworks or something supremely gratifying Jay has a lot of fundamentals and ideas going on that are really worthwhile but a lot of gaps need to be filled in order for this project to feel complete feel at a satisfying length and on top of it feel like he is in a lane of his own on top of all of that because there are so many moments here that feel very obviously inspired by his contemporaries in that sense he suffers from a little bit of logic itis as logic can't really seem to make any project without making some kind of track or to that's an over ripoff of one other rapper existing today that he has great admiration for J suffers from that same problem though he's nowhere near as corny or as intolerable as logic don't take that the wrong way but I feel like J needs to start like really defining himself in his own way in marching to the beat of his own drum if he's going to continue forward and truly stand out as an original artist in the current rap landscape I'm feeling a light too decent six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

-YlaJuowR1w,hi everyone nice a nice tandem here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I hope you're doing well it's time for a review of the new earth gang album mirror land buzzing Atlanta hip hop duo earth gang they are here with a new record for J Cole's dreamville records featuring dr. dot and Johnny Venus I first heard of these guys when they were coming out with a run of EPS and 2017 and 2018 rags robots and royalty and while there were some eccentric vibes on these records there was nothing on them going quite far enough in my view to leave a great impression on me early on earth gang weren't really living up to the weirdo reputation that they seemed to gain so easily I mean don't get me wrong dot and Venus definitely stand out in the current rap landscape with their consistently nasal animated and expressive deliveries and rap flows they're also not shy about breaking into with no warning whatsoever these kind of cartoony and somewhat zany vocal passages - so I get that these guys are respectively versatile but still looking at previous tracks like red light and artificial and cocktail while these songs are good they're not necessarily out there not really as left-field of some of their other contemporaries in the psychedelic experimental or industrial hip-hop fray I wouldn't even say I've heard anything as bold or as imaginative as to warrant the plethora of Outkast comparisons I've seen - these guys on the internet and even though it would be nice to have another Outkast or another duo out there as great as Outkast listening to earth gangs music I'm not even sure if that's the sound that they're really shooting for meanwhile Big KRIT drops banger after banger after banger directly citing the Outkast playbook and crickets but that's a that's a sidebar I guess the point is I think the influences going into this new earth gang record are more contemporary than they are classic for one the loose bits of jazzy bass and keys and percussion all over the opening track are pretty much just like a Flying Lotus instrumental meanwhile the insane vocal work the duo throws on top of this is I guess a little reminiscent of some of the cartoonish stuff CeeLo used to do on his solo work back in the day I guess there's a classic Atlanta music heavy weight comparison for you but honestly I don't think earth gang are doing anything outside of the creative scope of in underachievers or a Flatbush zombies or a Kendrick Lamar or a Danny Brown or a jid or even a chance the rapper he'll young thug fits really snugly into the duo's already established style on the track proud of you I would say it's actually a pretty incredible team-up even the track Bank is a pretty standard low-key trap banger by contemporary standards sure there's some kind of weird samples or keys laced into the track but the flows and the delivery on this thing aren't too far outside of what you might hear on a baby track I mean the song is good and many other tracks on this album are but I think over selling the oddity of Earth gang is doing more to hurt them than help them I do think we're earth gang does take it a step further than a lot of their contemporaries is with the somewhat freaky singing and vocal work all over this record especially on this new album where these singing and the instrumental switch ups are so much better than they were on their previous EPS I think if Earth gang should be celebrated for or defined by anything it's that as well as the knack they show occasionally for some really hooky songwriting to the songs up top-down proud of you all attached to these incredible choruses one time seared into your mind some of the best rap singles of this year but the group's shortcomings grow more apparent as they tone the intensity down and deliver tracks like this side swivel Avenue not only total snoozers but when the vocals and the rapping are delivered at a more mild pace and there's inherently more of a focus on the lyricism as a result of that I would expect the lyrics to be a bit better more substantive focused thoughtful but they just aren't I think a lot of the ideas themes and opinions earth gang express in their music are pretty basic frankly and there's not a whole lot in terms of like pen game or wordplay or double entendre z' I mean occasionally it's there but it's it's it's not anything I guess I widening or surprising and while I do appreciate that lyrically earth gang do seem to be on the woked spectrum with references to Sandra bland and racism they don't really dive into these topics all that deeply a lot of the time we're getting these verses from the duo that on the surface might sound really strange whether you're talking about torpedoes and tornadoes and placebos and blah I mean it's all cool it's a little bit like left-field hip hop ear candy but I wish it was just more than that I think the track tequila is yet another song on the back end of this record that is pretty decent I think these sexy horn samples on this track are great tunefully it's one of the better tracks here but after this there are more underwhelming songs to come the track tripping featuring Kalani her verse leaves a lot to be desired even with the B switch up that occurs just before it and even if she did pop on to the song and killed it it still wouldn't make up for the very boring somewhat flirty verses that come before it meanwhile the song stuck is the least likeable track on the entire record with its incredibly messy singing that seems way more interested in sounding weird than sounding on pitch fields it's one of the most underwhelming cuts on the entire record it's kind of a bland hip-hop neo-soul blend that ends in a very I guess anti climactic fashion but then after this we get the song wings now Fields felt like a pretty appropriate low-key closer and we get quite a bit of dead air after the song and then we get this wings cut which maybe as a bonus track or something I'm not entirely sure what does seem clear is that it's kind of tacked on to the finish of the record and as far as mixing and mastering goes it sounds a lot muddier and messier than any other song on this project it just feels like a shot of your version of much of what occurred prior to this point in that's all I'm not really sure if I have much else to say about this record I think there are some really great tracks on here yes and I think that Earth gang are close to honing in on a very unique soulful very oddball rap style but I wish the lyricism was better I wish the distinctions stylistically between Venus and dot were greater I wish the songwriting were more memorable across the entire record and look and that's not to say the vast majority of tracks on this album are trash or garbage or anything like that not the case there was really only one song I truly disliked meanwhile the rest of them I thought were either great or just kind of tolerable or Pleasant or decent but still wanting a bit more out of them mostly in terms of concept or lyrical depth because that's the thing on the surface it sounds like this record really works in layers and it's gonna present all of these ideas and sounds to you that you're really going to be able to peel back over and over and over but no in fact mirror land is actually quite obvious I wish there was more to it feeling a light to decent six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

Za6s9zOntCE,hi everyone then the tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new post Malone album Hollywood's bleeding this is the newest full-length LP from singer-songwriter post Malone aka Austin Richard post since blowing up in 2015 with the surprise hit single white Iverson postie has been one of the largest musical phenomena of this decade I personally could not stand his music until recently either as I think much of his breakthrough material is just bland mellow Trapp crooning and that's it the August 26th mixtape as well as stony I really got nothing from either of them however I would argue that post Malone really began to come into his own as a songwriter on his last full-length LP last year beer bongs and Bentley's and yes it is a flawed album it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it's on this project that post really begins to hone his talents for penning these moody braggadocious soaring pop anthems over trap instrumentals also showing a knack for being able to pull off low key bangers such as rock star as well as powerful ballads like on better now now I guess post would end up giving us a taste or an idea as to where he would be headed next with some tracks he'd be sprinkling out there over the next year we have the very soso sunflower featuring sway Lee off of the into the spider-verse soundtrack that yeah it's it's just a very high gloss pop rap blend it's it's not mind-blowing by any means there's also the very brief and mild party cut Wow which I'm also surprised made it onto this record considering how underwhelming it is as a party song though I do like the very slick snap beat attached to the song the first teaser I love going into this record was actually goodbyes featuring young thug a track that once again showed posts talent for transferring classic pop songwriting fundamentals over some trap aesthetics chorus on this track is stellar verses are tragic young thug's feature goes way harder than it needed to but I will take it the song that got me really truly worried going into this record though was circles which sees post attempting to revive some really bad dead indie pop vibes a la Foster the People or Peter Bjorn and John you've got a danceable beat some hollow bass jangly guitar it's just so cheap and formulaic and dead for a reason and I don't know what's worse is that the the the lyrics which are trash and and lame on this track or is it the vocal processing which makes post's voice sound fake as hell as there is this violent vibrato on his voice that just makes it sound so ridiculously shaky and you hate to see it because the tune of the core of it is actually pretty solid but the execution leaves a lot to be desired so given all these tracks I had no idea where this album was going to be what shape it was going to take the feature list made things even more confusing future house II Meek Mill little baby Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath Fame Travis Scott - baby scissor what's happening but after finally listening to the entire album it's difficult to sum up I'll say that in one breath it's a good thing that post Malone seems like he no longer has any limitations to the kind of art he wants to make the kinds of songs he wants to put on his record artistic freedom on this one people artistic freedom but also Hollywood's bleeding lacks vision severely I like that post seems like he is taking some risks on this one that is cool but it leads to as many triumphs as it does messes like the title track the intro track which has this horrendous breakdown toward the end that is totally unnecessary does not complement the track at all a failed attempt at really opening this record up with some heavy and thick drama we also have the horrendously uninspired Saint Tropez where it's pretty much a post Malone song by the numbers this track would have easily been a total dud off of his life record especially with the forgettable beat in the completely substance list lyrics the only likable quality about this track in my view were the silly ad-libs the song I know in my view is also painfully average for post similarly underwhelmed by hearing him team up with scissor on the song staring at the Sun not that I thought that sis's inclusion into the track was all that bad it's not but the track is so sweet melodramatic and pristine aesthetically I get the sensation that this track was also produced and intended to land on a soundtrack of some sort but it didn't actually make the cut not a bad song by any stretch of the imagination but it is another average track we didn't need and contributes to the records overall lack of cohesion most of the questionable spots on this record though aren't because of a lack of imagination or just sheer boredom mostly it is bad ideas and unnecessary risks like the track a thousand bad times which is another indie inspired nightmare with some of the worst lyrics on the album said you needed a ride but you wanted my car without that face girl you wouldn't get far I really like you despite who you are you see me on TV you know I'm a star you say you don't know me but I know that's false I'll pay the price girl whatever it costs you've made my life so hard but that's what gets me off the little baby feature on the back end of on the road sticks out like a sore thumb barely complements the narrative of the track lyrically it sounds awful melodically and once again little baby totally boring young thug clone unnecessary thank you it's sad because this track is actually one of the better songs on the entire record the Meek Mill verse adds so much I was also loving the themes on this track of being a lone wolf and not having people around you that you can trust we also have the very weird internet which is a track all about not wanting to use the Internet essentially being fine with missing out on all the stuff happening over social media which is cool and I think give us a few years time and normalized we are going to see tracks where artists are singing or making statements about the over stimulation of the information age but post isn't exactly addressing the issue the song is mostly about IG models and insta love and privacy and Internet drama I slightly admire the track for being as extravagant as it is with its strings and its soaring vocals but it's it's much to do about nothing but bu donated you could quote that so I do have some pretty major criticisms of this record yes but it's not all bad there are some great highlights packed into this thing too at various points we have these sweet and bouncy banger enemies featuring - baby it's smooth it's catchy as hell the beat is colorful its melodic post also has one of his best choruses here the baby is a great pic even though he's very trendy as a feature spot right now I think his inclusion into this track was really good the song alergic is one of the few overtly rock inspired tracks on this thing that I actually think came out stupendous I know jack we have these grimy bass lines and rapping drum beats a lot of reverb it almost sounds a little inspired by the first drums record but with a bit more darkness and sadness an edge that you typically get out of a head of a post Malone song the song die for me featuring future and Halsey managed to be one of the best on the record despite me not anticipating much coming out of it but both future and Halsey on this track are punching over their weight not only with Halsey going kind of psycho finding out about women and her man's phone on her verse but also future who hits every note that post sets for him in his performance not only in the hook which he decides to sing but in his dynamic verse and this little falsetto breakdown moment - that's really entertaining you definitely yes the chorus on this thing is a bit much but I read the song mostly like a pop trap equivalent to a soap opera with post singing about getting sent to jail and being betrayed the most amazing feature on this record though in my opinion actually goes to Ozzy it goes to Ozzy where the Prince of Darkness can be heard singing some real post Malone vocal riffs as it is clear that post Malone had written at least some of this chorus out Dave will you Papa be dead will you nip a bee I love these snappy dirty trap drums on this track the arpeggios coming out of that acoustic guitar the trippy Travis Scott feature toward the back end is nice and the guitar shredding on the bridge is incredible it's a grand statement an amazing crossover that only an artist like post Malone could have conjured another weirdly standout song on the record is myself which actually features a co songwriting credit from none other than Josh Tillman aka father John misty and it's a very glamorous vintage piano back ballad with the instrumentation sounding a little muddy kind of washed out it's dark it's distant it's like much of everything else in post Malone's world aesthetically it's still a great tune though and I think shows a lot of heart from post Malone on the vocal performance end of things but still is as much as I can pick certain tracks of this record out and say hey this is great this is great this is great this is great this thing is still very much a mixed bag at this point I still consider post Malone to be a unique voice with considerable talent but that talent is not being put to good use it's being ineffectively applied across this very inconsistent project of course I would love to see him branch out more into the future the Ozzy and Travis Scott track on here is one of many examples here of him really experimenting in a way that no other artists in the hip-hop or pop landscape is an in succeeding at it but in the future I just hope all of this occurs on a project that isn't such a hodgepodge I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana post Malone forever 
mAZbBjdI9HY,ha ha ha ha hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I go over a series of Records that I did not get a chance to do a formal review on over the past month or so I talk about them all in brief in a gauntlet here you know what it is it's what we do I've just explained it to you so let's get into it ba-bam I was hoping I would like this new sure record more than I actually did and there are there are actually some slaps on here there are some slaps but the deeper cuts to me mostly felt like very Airy somewhat underwhelming since pop music but hey if that's your thing if you like something that's light on the ears you want to hear something that's really Pleasant really pleasant to listen to really pillowy very pretty give it a shot cuz there's some pretty elegant tracks on here many of them again didn't really stick with me but you know for those who like their music a little softer on the ears give it a try and give it a give it and give it a shot st. John is an artist who I've been getting quite a few requests to cover his music I do love the edgy album art over here I do love that for a pop rap singer more of a trap balladeer I guess you could say he does have a pretty decent voice but but a very obvious obvious Kid Cudi influence there were some real duds on this album too that I didn't care for all that much but I will say after listening to this he's definitely an artist I'm more curious about than I was before so I guess we'll see st. John new reckon reference LP this one I found to be one of the most intriguing they've ever put out but also simultaneously one of the most difficult to really get into I mean I like a lot of the dark weird experimental textures some of the spoken-word here some of the poetry I mean it's a very odd and out there atmosphere that this record brings but then again a lot of the songs are barely even songs but just really weird left-field meditations that are a little goth down a little industrial always strange slightly unsettling and and even though I I recognize that it seems like quite a bit of detail and effort went into this record I wasn't really getting much of an itch to return to it at any point no matter how many times I listened to it you know it just kind of sat there sounded kind of strange but it wasn't really a voguing anything out of me emotionally and I don't know I just had a difficult time appreciating this one honestly which is why it's taking me so long to comment on it because I thought that if I just returned to it again or if I just returned to it again it'll it'll finally click but I'm just not really having that moment unfortunately so I don't know not sure I get the excitement behind this one it it mostly just reminds me of Frank jab see it mostly just reminds me of Frank Jeff see if he were making music for like car commercials or something you know uniform in the body team up for one of the nastiest records of the year the body and uniform both respectively in their own right makes them pretty abrasive music I would say the body's music sometimes is even difficult for me to get into mostly the air vocals I have a difficult time like really really liking however I do think uniform does take the edge off of that a little bit by providing their own style and own vocal passages to yeah is still what's what's typically holding me back with a body project is also holding me back with this but I can say that you know if you do like the body and you do like the vocals and you do like abrasive experimental supremely dark nasty nasty nasty music you're probably going to love the hell out of this because I think that uniform in the body definitely creates something greater than the sum of their parts I think they complement each other stylistically really well more than you would assume given the kind of eighties abrasive electric body music post-punk II aesthetic of uniform versus the sludgy screamed ghoulish noise metal that the body does but still it actually all kind of works out really well so kudos to these guys for collaborating and doing it in such an effective way little brother they are back sans ninth wonder obviously sadly it's certainly better than their last full length album I'll say that much but the songwriting ability the wit the level of humor I mean there's still humor on this record like on the minstrel show and everything in their debut too but the humor does not it's it's not as snappy on this one you know little brother unfortunately have lost their luster a bit even if for the most part I think they have put out an acceptable record free runway is one of the coolest artists from the UK right now her approach to pop music is multi-genre and futuristic if you're heavy into people like let's say Charli XCX for example you do want to check out this new EP there are a few duds on here yes but it's mostly really good in some respects this ASAP ferg EP does feel like a little bit of a return to form it is banger after banger after banger after banger no real crummy singsong II totally whacked out songs that just are not appealing at all but you know honestly that was kind of the the appeal of Ferg with trap Lord you know when he really faltered was when he was trying to make music that was so obviously commercially friendly and just falling flat on his face in the process and while I do like the raised energy level of a lot of the songs that he's presenting on this EP I still think much of what he's doing here is just too Orthodox there's nothing all that freaky or out there like Shaba or like hood Pope on this thing nothing that's so aggressive that it's just like totally blowing you away as much as I do think some of the songs on here are catchy it all kind of hangs in the yellow you know it's not as spectacular in terms of performance and energy and just once very uniquely weird delivery persona whatever you want to call it and boil it down to that still seems missing on these tracks even if I do think that it's it's it's certainly an improvement over his last major record I got to give it to Sir this record over here is leagues better in terms of execution than the last one was on Top Dawg entertainment which in my opinion was very rough around the edges difficult to listen to it points even the recording here is much better the production is much better features are more impressive still though sir has not progressed beyond the point of just making a very so-so R&B in neo-soul record like in a grander scheme of both of these genres there's not a whole lot that makes this record stick out in my opinion outside of some pretty decent songwriting here and there some of the features on this thing are actually pretty weak to the little wayne one is almost just like worthless so I guess if you're enough for this style and you're just dying to hear another record in it or if you heard the last sur record and thought that there's potential here that's not fully being capitalized on give this one a shot because it's it's definitely better it's definitely an improvement and I hope to see more improvements from here the new ugly god project it's not as good as I wanted it to be you hate to see it but I don't quite get is that this thing was being angled as him doing a more serious project and and I guess in tone it's a bit more serious than the booty tape it's certainly not trying to be as jokey or as meme centric as water or anything like that but still I I feel like he's not really executing in a way on this project that to me feels all that serious I mean there's not really a whole lot in terms of song structure memorable hooks the recording is not good at all it's very rough the way that the vocals are placed on top of these beats it sounds pretty much demo quality a lot of the verses seem really thrown together a lot of the one-liners not incredibly funny or smart or witty I feel like much of what is here could have been brought back to the mixing board back to the drawing board this thing seems rushed it just seems rushed you know when you have a record and no matter how many times you listen to it you just don't really feel anything for it just don't really feel anything for it at all yeah that's this one uh this new loo the human album I really wanted to love it I really didn't want to like it and there are some elements to it that I think are very good I think Lou's rapping is literally as good as it's ever been if not a little bit better but the more melodic atmospheric instrumentals the singing he does all over this record at various points I cannot stand at all to me it either sounds way too trendy or just again off completely because this the singing is not very good at all don't mind the topical change that he's brought to the table I think it's good that he's drifting a little bit away from a lot of the edgy or subject matters that he was diving into on his last major project but I do not get his attraction to the whole singing thing I mean I understand that it's trendy but I don't think he does it particularly well and if he is to continue pursuing it I hope that those vocals improve greatly because it's that they're going to need to in order for them to really kind of hit oh what's that oh it's it's a new Rick Ross a bow I'm telling you guys if you want to hear some underground hip-hop with some real fiery fast aggressive flows some LGBTQ themes as well give this Big Mama Project a shot there are some tracks in the middle and on the back end that I don't think are as gratifying as a lot of the songs the record kicks off with but god damn there are some great flows on this thing god damn there was some great rapping on this project - Big Mama has certainly gotten a lot more ambitious and a lot bolder since their last full-length project I will just kind of be keeping my ear to the ground in the future and again highly recommend this to anybody who is vaguely interested in it based on the recommendations I have made and descriptions I've thrown out there so far channel trace is an artist who I'm gaining more and more interest in over time as I hear more singles and more tracks that impressed me because he brings together elements of hip-hop house some experimental music - and a wild sense of humor on some tracks and on this new EP that is in full form on some of the songs here others are sort of snoozers the sexy black timberlake track is killer the song featuring jpg mafia is killer I think I will just kind of be sitting here waiting for a more substantial project down the road but as of right now I can say that this this is pretty cool it's not bad you know Iggy Pop at this point he's he's too old for a not good so what's uh what's uh [Music] let's let's just let's just let's just say this never happened new Frankie cosmos record has gotten a lot of people buzzing and I understand why but for the most part this album just reads to me is like another instance of overly praised indie underachievement there's not really much to the the incredibly short and boring songs all over this record and yeah tallest man on earth is a slight return to form the incorporation of extra instrumentation on Matson's last record led to a lot of terrible tracks on that project or just very subpar tracks and on this new one we do see a little bit of that again but it goes over much better on the other cuts that are just more based on his vocals and guitar we see some decent balladry some decent songwriting but nothing so exciting that it's a screaming for me to return to it I would say this one is just kind of average you know it's a very average tallest man on earth record not a disappointment by any stretch of the imagination but nowhere near as good as like the first leg of records in this projects existence so if you like your emo and screamo aggressive sometimes super aggressive to the point where it's noisy and violent like like a Loma Prieta song and sometimes only so much so it's it's a little all over the place I guess try the new state false record it's okay it's alright this new blue face yeah it's it's got some bangers on it it has a couple of bangers on it but for the most part the the features are not all that great and I feel like in this very short run of tracks blue face is sort of exposing just how limited his skillset is because I don't know if there that many more kinds of instrumentals he wants to rap over other than like these classic Bay Area grooves nor do I see him as super consistent songwriter either over a lot of these instrumentals and you know what that his his trademark sort of not on the tempo all that much style not here as much on on this short set of tracks and that's that's always been part of his selling point that that he is a bit of an outsider when it comes to flow and when it comes to being on tempo you know that made him such an interesting unorthodox figure and I feel like that's melting away a little bit on this project as it sounds like he's trying a little bit harder to stay on beat new ty Segall record unfortunately this record panned out to be my worst nightmare based on the teaser tracks and the one thread that carried throughout all of those songs teasing toward this record is that I thought for whatever reason I don't know why this is sort of a special case with this project but I thought that the vocal performances and the vocal production on all of those tracks were really bad and yeah they're pretty bad throughout this entire record so I don't know exactly why Ty's vocal stink so much throughout this entire thing I hope for a project in the future where that's better I mean he puts out a lot of stuff so there will be a ty record somewhere down the road undoubtedly that I enjoy much more than this one The Lost Tapes they should have stayed lost yes this new Prairie and album may be a small-scale mostly fan geared type project but it is the first full-length noise concept record that I have ever heard of that has tried to sonically embody the experience of World War era paratroopers yes that's literally what Dominic is trying to create on this record and if you give it a listen you'll you'll hear sounds that are harsh abrasive really blowing your ears out but mixed in there is like the sound of someone's screaming through a radio and like it sounds like guns and and airplane machinery whirring and going at a very loud volume I think a lot of the shorter tracks on here kind of fleeting and that is disappointing that is upsetting I wish there was a bit more meat on some of the bones of these songs but still I think the concept is incredibly creative I think a lot of the noise pallets here are grading a widening and freakish and I am certainly looking forward to hearing more material from Dominic in the future new pharmacon record and yes much like every album to come out of this project you know it is noisy it is abrasive but it does get tedious because I just find there's not enough progression on a lot of these tracks again noisy heavy hellish sounds completely evil during its best moments I just wish it changed up a bit more yeah and that's gonna be it for this latest edition of the why you know review thank you very much for watching you're the best I love you over here next to my head is another video that you guys can check out hit that up or

kicked back from it supports the segment supports the show and let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst ones the ones that i thought were the worst we have a couple let's go first one a new Tegan and Sara new Tegan and Sara they just cannot seem to drop a decent single this new one is ham just like you and aesthetically I thought it was gonna like it a lot more than the last one because it has a bit of a synth pop power pop type of feel some lightly rowdy guitars it's got a little bit of an attitude to it it's got a bit of an attitude to it but the more that I listen to it the more I realized I really do not care for the tune of this song at all nor do I care for the lyrics all that much either so while I do like the instrumental palette the duo are bringing to the table I'm not really digging on this this new song sadly moving on from there corn has a new pretty bad track not really much standing out to me about this song at all it's like corn gets bland or and bland or with each new song but one thing that did seem weird to me about this track very weird to me about this track is that the very thick sludgy guitar riffs on this one sounded like something off of an old torch record torch a torch record it was like something off of harmonic raft or even their previous album I have no idea how this specific sound is landing on a corne record but yeah it pretty much just sounds like that they just pretty much sound like a cut-rate sludge metal band during the more riffey and instrumental bits of the song for some reason and moving on from there we have a new Camilo caballo Cabello track lyre and thought this one was a little odd in that there were numerous parts of the song and the hook as well I mean it's it's nearly an interpolation I imagine the similarities here are intentional but it just pretty much sounds like a really bad Ace of Base ripoff it's um it's it's quite distracting it's quite bad I have no idea why pop artists and labels continue to do these songs that are just like blatant ripoffs of old hits it's pretty much the pop equivalent of like a movie reboot we're gonna take some very clear trademark instrumental bits and like a bit of the vocals a bit of the flow of the original song and just like try to slightly like little itty bitty retool it just a smidge to make it just another pop song that we also hope ends up being a hit and yeah it just ends up sounding very cheap and trashy let's go to the tracks that I thought were kind of met let's go to the ones I thought we're okay not blown me away but certainly worth pointing out and shouting out one new track from spoon it's a b-side it's got a raunchy rock-and-roll almost bluesy type of feel to it shake it off it's it's not bad give it a try also metronomy wedding bells I thought this one was a little underwhelming but still some sweet synth pop with a new wavy vibe to it but of course being Metronomy there's there's always a some modern vibes going on and their music no matter how throwback it is now we also have the new m83 song this new one over here titled temple of sorrow sees the project going into an oddly lengthy prog synth direction I'm not sure if the old fans or even any new fans are really going to take to what's going on here it just seems like way too out there and and honestly in the grander scheme of things when it comes to this particular style of like very 70s again very progressive synth Odyssey type of track this isn't even like one of the best I've ever heard this isn't even really all out there as far as the the gold standards of this style of music go so for somebody like me who likes some tangerine dream for example this is quite drab so um you know I appreciate that he tried I do think there are some cool progressions to the track and I think it comes to a pretty neat climactic finish but if this is if this is the new style it's it's it's got to get better than this it's got to get better than this we also had this new collaborative cut from none other than injury reserve featuring Code Orange and JPEG mafia excuse me I imagine code orange most likely had a hand in the instrumental here I can't quite tell where exactly they fit in but I do think it is pretty neat that they had some kind of impact on this track injury reserve seems to bring a lot of indescribable absurd almost nonsensical bits during the first portion of the track something I would have to read into a bit more but it just seems like a little bit too all over the place to grasp anything out of it on a first couple of impressions of the song however I still again I do like the instrumental vibe of the track and the JPEG mafia feature on the back end is amazing like easily one of his best features hand down totally murdered this track and I would say the biggest reason to listen to it I mean the PEGI feature is amazing it's absolutely brutal so you know give it a shot give it a try if not only for that there elements of the song I wish were better and more interesting but the PEGI feature alone is fantastic we also have this new track over here from mr. homeboy Sandman a rap artist who I'm not usually a gigantic fan of far out is the name of the song usually his delivery is a bit too subdued for me but I thought that his lyrics and his relentless flow on this track were more impressive than usual so give it a shot give it a try be anticipating his new full-length album if if in fact you are a fan of his sound and style he reminds me quite a bit of I I guess other rappers that have a very subdued delivery a rock Marciano but he's you know not like some cold blooded New York rapper or anything like that that's not a style it's not his uh that's not his aesthetic alright moving on from there we have a new song from Grimes and IO violence is the name of this new one and it's a kind of shimmery Spacey dance pop anthem I I wish the hook went harder I wish the beat went hard er I wish the production was a bit more colorful and creative to me it sounds like somewhat watered-down Crystal Castles but nowhere near as bad as Crystal Castles is now that Alice glass is gone it just reminds me of just some okay Crystal Castles some okay Crystal Castles listen it's not terrible it's not bad and I'm still definitely looking forward to this new Grimes album but this one wasn't hitting quite as much you know it's okay maybe it'll grow on me more in the context of the record but it's okay there's a new track over here from Francis and the lights take me to the light Bon Iver and Kanye West on this track it's not bad it's pretty good instrumentals decent Justin Vernon and Kanye West on the song add quite a bit of character the the lead vocals mostly sound like something out of a Peter Gabriel song though it just pretty much sounds like Bon Iver and Kanye West testing on a Peter Gabriel song oddly enough so if you're down with some Peter Gabriel and there's some good Peter Gabriel out there don't get me wrong if you're down with some Peter Gabriel give this one a shot I've listened to Francis and the lights before this is really in an honestly the first track of his that has struck me as having such an overtly like clear as a goddamn Bell Peter Gabriel influence but but here it is but here it is and we also Danny Brown brand-new song dirty laundry gave it a full-length review over on the Fantana channel it's not bad instrumentals great the lyrics and lyrical concept throughout the song are pretty cool with dirty laundry and past experiences so on and so forth I just wish the flow is better wish there was more song structure to the whole thing but uh still at this point I would say I'm incredibly excited to listen to this new Danny Brown record you know what I'm saying very soon all right best tracks the ones that left the biggest impression on me this week the ones I enjoyed the most the new comet is coming it's a new extra track the jazz fusion group is back with a song that's kind of an extension off their last full length record which is one of my favorite albums of the year mind you this one over here that you should be checking out his life force part two it goes if you like your jazz sounding futuristic and a little funky give it a shot give it a try give it a listen we also have swans leaving meaning new album on the way it's coming it's reals then even the new track and it is pretty I guess brooding tune showing the band going back to a style that they haven't toyed with for quite a while now not since I think it was the 90s that they were putting out records and more that acoustic gothic country style and then of course also you have a lot of that michael gira solo stuff after swans pretty much fell apart with angels of light and so on and so forth in that era of his career so gothic country is is nothing new to swans nothing new to michael gira it's just interesting to hear them go back to that sound in this era of the bay career where it seems like they were on something new they were kind of taking off from where they left off and getting more gargantuan not to say that that's not going to happen on this new record and not to say that this new song isn't linear and hypnotic in its own way it certainly is but a more acoustics more balladry more vocal harmonies more space and again that country twang it's coming back and that gothic twist it's a pretty good track I liked it a lot so excited to hear the band head back into that sound and you know I'm looking forward to seeing what they're gonna bring up going forward all right we also have a a track that hit me off of a suggestion from some of the fans off of social media mr. Roy Blair who stuff previously has been pretty underwhelming to me but this new track of his over here I don't know about him is a really sweet combination of some light dance pop some R&B a little bit of pop rap and it's all seamlessly mixed to the point where it's it's difficult to tell where one influence or genre ends and one begins but the vocals are solid the tune is good I liked it quite a bit shout out to Roy Blair definitely gonna be looking a hour for more tracks from him and given how sharp as hell this new single was and we also have one of my favorite tracks this week love love love love love the shit out of this track lunch money Louis who's a rapper i've heard of here and there he has this new single out make that cake featuring doja kat ridiculous hook ridiculous music video doges or doshas guest verse on this track is amazing hilarious lots of attitude lots of personality it's very funny it's very playful this track should be one of the biggest songs of the year it's just too ridiculous not to be celebrated on every corner of the Internet and that's all I have to say it's amazing it's amazing it's amazing if you try one goddamn track out of all these tracks I'm suggesting to you make it this one it's it'll put a smile on your face I guarantee it'll put a smile on your face it's silly it's silly all right liking this also new track over your fat Joe Carr DB and well eh eh you know fat Joe comes out every once in a while with a total banger you know I mean he's he is the Leanback guy you know that is some some of y'all are probably too young to remember that shit but I do and you know I would say on this track over here he's really trying to come back in that way we have to write a club anthem over here and I'm not so much sure if this is gonna play all that well with the the the Zoomers I'm not sure if this is gonna play all that well on the Internet it may not but as somebody who remembers like flattened excuse me Fat Joe bring in some of these great club jams during the bling era in the 2000s and obviously is his career in hip-hop trends even further back than that but what I'm saying is uh this new song seems to pretty much be in that vein and I think it's really good it's got a very odd instrumental Joe's verses fun cardi B's verses fun and well at the end is fine I mean given I don't speak Spanish I really couldn't get a whole lot out of what he was saying but still I think given the current landscape of contemporary music I think having an artist like him on this track is absolutely essential and yeah like a lot hit hard fun song we also have earth gang mirror land new record a track from I would love for you guys to try top down I'm not gonna say a lot about it because I do plan on reviewing this album pretty soon but this track sounds like if chance the rapper's hot shower we're good I'll say that I'll leave it at that we also Chelsea Wolfe with what in my opinion is the best teaser from her new full-length album so far this new song of hers is not only a show of her love and devotion to music but out of all these teaser cuts so far it has some of the grandest instrumentation that is that has been getting again teased and is pretty epic pretty powerful pretty immense deranged for rock and roll as the name of this new track and I love it we also have another track from Charli XCX Charlie stop you're you're you're ruining the whole album you're letting everybody hear the entire record before it's even out and and I know I know most of the songs are really really good they are they really truly are but goddamn Charlie we're here the whole record Charlie I'm sure that your intention but still Charlie still leave something up to the imagination leave something please charlie blaze blaze this new one over here featuring Clary oh and we also have eg who I hope I'm saying that name correctly I believe I am okay who had a an EP release lately that a lot of people are making a big deal of didn't get a lot out of it myself but I thought that both of their contributions to this new single over here were great instrumentals wild and off-the-wall Charlie brings a great hook too and I don't know man she's just consistently on this wave where she is just sounding like the future of pop music you know or at least presenting a futuristic view of what pop music could be you know and I just commend her for that I commend her for continuing to go down that road you know she's been on that style for a while you know and there have been moments where I've celebrated there have been moments where I've been a little underwhelmed and I felt like this could you know turn into something more interesting down the road and it seems like that is finally coming to fruition we're seeing the full potential here with this new crop of singles potentially with this new album loving it so far so alright and we also have a handful of tracks that I want to point out to you guys they're remixes so basically here it is fever ray and the knife because obviously they share membership fever ran the knife Choza Bjork song to remix and they each remix that song in their own way and then we have Bjork who picked a fever a song to remix and then she remixed that song so we have kind of like a trade of weary mixing each other songs and it's it's a bit of a mix I think the knife remix came out the funkiest I think the fever ray Raymond remix came out the draba stand then the Bjork remix came out the most insane but generally it across all of them I thought they were pretty great so um give it a try give them all a try they're absolutely nuts it's really cool that they you know extended a bit of an olive branch and said hey let's go let's do this it'll be a neat little crisscross and absolutely it was as somebody who was a fan of both artists so you know if you like yourself some Bjork if you like yourself some strange freaky Scandinavian electronic pop music and sometimes not so pop music give it a try it's it's pretty good and that has been the weekly track roundup everyone that has been the weekly track roundup again everything I've talked about is linked down below so

hItRO3zBdcw,hi everyone Anthony music Pantano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tropical fuck storm album brain drops one of Australia's most promising bands right now tropical fuck storm they are back with their sophomore full-length record I first covered this band in a review of their last full length album their debut album to come out last year a laughing death in mute space that is such a weird title and I cannot believe I remembered it just off the top of my head well I caught on to the band early because there are some members of this band that overlap with a much more celebrated Aussie band the drones yes Gareth lyddiard as well as Fiona kitchen also lend their bass and guitars and vocals to tropical fuck storm as well and like with the last TFS record Lauren Hamill as well as Erika Dunn are in the mix - so the whole gang is back to serve up another helping of what I don't know as tropical fuck storm continues to have one of the most complicated and difficult to define sounds in rock music right now it's incredibly dark and forlorn without being too atmospheric or got out the more I listen to them I have a hard time definitively labeling them as post-punk it's also noisy and dissonant without being too abrasive not strictly a noise rock release either it's sometimes psychedelic and surreal and very thick and layered but it's also well defined it's not hazy it's not washed out sometimes the music on a tropical fuck storm record is angular groovy intense and sometimes it's loose and melodic and glum and on the verge of breaking down and falling apart maybe you could call what tropical fuck storm does dystopian post post post art Punk maybe all I know is the band's latest effort here does sound a lot like the first one so if you did enjoy that first record or if you are intrigued by anything I have described this record to be so far this this might be for you so yes on the second record the band are essentially sticking to their guns with these chilling vocal harmonies grimy bass and guitars and a young punk attitude aged into a fine old punk depression the opening track paradise sounds like the opposite of its title with all of these creeping demented guitar passages that sound detuned and twisted and sloppy and stumbling over themselves Gareth's vocals cut through all of that though with this authoritative Lee downtrodden tone I love the way the track eventually explodes into this horrendously ugly wall of sound that somehow every member of the band is able to sing through it maintaining a pretty solidly sad vocal melody the song also does not operate with these clean transitions from one section to another there is usually a bit of space or some time where the band sort of falls down just going down the hill like a roller coaster and building up and up and up and up before they hit you with another drop the planet of the straw men though has much more of a pulse much more of a direct track and not too much unlike previous songs Gareth and and Fiona have been connected to through either tropical fuck storm or the drones like the future of history off of the band's last record or even some tracks from the last drones record feeling kind of free where you have a groovy bassline some freaky guitars thrown on top of it then there's Gareth delivering these maddening rants about what sounds like a peek into the future of the worst case scenario of current day world politics Kremlin wiretap and picking Chinese cotton on the moon given the title of the song and the first few verses on the track though the song mostly seems to be an attempt at lampooning the arguments of people who serve straw men out to make a point or make themselves seem like they're more correct than they actually are which i suppose could be viewed as a depiction of how far people will go to stand in the way of progress the happiest guy around has a similar focus on people not being able to live peacefully and let go the lyrics depicting monkeys going tit for tat as a metaphor for violence and war and paranoia the song features more noisy groovy instrumentation in the typical tropical fuck storm style it is also enjoyable II obnoxious and a bit of a tease as we get these consistent chants of when you haven't gotta learn to let things go when you let things go I also love that Erica Dunn takes up lead vocal duties on the track who's my Eugenia certainly brings more variety to the tracklist than the last tropical fuck storm album did the instrumental on this one is funky like an old 80's dance pop tune but much weirder kind of subverted I love the vocals I love the vibe I wish I could say more about the song though because the meaning of the track is a little elusive to me and I'm not so surprised about that given how esoteric some of the song ideas have been on last TFS record on the last drones record but the imagery throughout the track is pretty evocative though we have a clean-cut figure drowning a beach being depicted as a cage looking further into it online which I had to do even though I rarely enjoy doing this because I typically hated when an artist gives away everything about a track when they explain the meaning behind the song but still Erika done talking about the song said I had a dream that I was served Brian Wilson's face at a restaurant and it tasted good and I woke thinking that I had to write a song about the doomed facade of the American dream because the famous beach boy couldn't swim and Dennis drowned says the band's Eric had done about the track but that idea has been so over cooked by acid casualty hippies that I decided to write about my fear of falling in love with anybody because of the anxiety that they could either help me express myself or keep me locked in psychological torment Halle Eugene Landry and Brian which obviously Eugene is the Eugene constantly being referenced in the song and yeah that sounds like sensible inspiration for a tropical fuck storm track equally weird are these songs Maria 62 at the halfway point of the record and Maria 63 at the end of the record from what I understand both are inspired by media maria orsic who you should absolutely google if you want to see a place online where conspiracy theories of aliens UFOs and Nazi space travel meet both of these songs serve as two of the most mellow tracks on the entire record but that doesn't mean they don't have a depressive bite they do 62 features a supremely sad sad song mostly oriented around saying goodbye the melody is delivered at this lullaby volume but it's orbited by these sinister nightmarish bits of strings and guitar 63 is a lot more climactic by comparison it being the closer it has a crushingly heavy distorted finish it reaches that point through more nuanced sloppy stumbling instrumentation the title track of the record isn't bad and maybe outside of the context of the album I would say it's pretty good but through the tracklist it just feels like the band are kind of painting themselves in a corner at this point between this record and the last record what tropical fuck storm are doing here is almost becoming a formula and and I would hate to see that especially since they do have one of the most unique sounds in the underground right now not to mention one of the most underrated - and I feel like that oddity and that creativity is only going to be maintained with progress and evolution aspirin is yet another moment on the record I am not completely sold on I love love love the uniquely dark and kind of cynical yet poetic way with which Gareth on this song depicts someone who he misses severely describing them as a dead fern an old Toyota van also a house that got torn down and now there's just a vacant lot there and it hurts to drive by it every time obviously the characteristics and qualities of these objects and things that Gareth is making the comparisons to paint the quality and in his connections to the relationship and that's what makes the song creative but the instrumental is just so tedious though it is incredibly rigid wish there was more flow to it which there was more contrast to it as well honestly desert sands of Venus is yet another instrumental cut on the record if you remember from the last TFS album there was also an instrumental cut toward the end of that record - that one was shellfish toxin and I have to admit I prefer this new one over here quite a bit more aesthetically it feels more in line with the rest of the album so it doesn't quite come off like a random detour that doesn't really fit in plus the twisted layers of guitar on this track sound evil as hell and over I loved this one I thought it was really good not quite as heavy or as atmospheric as the last one but I think a good trade-off for that for me was that the instrumentation felt a bit more vivid clear raw yeah the recording is a bit noisy and rough but for a tropical fuck storm album I wouldn't have it any other way I thought the songwriting for the most part was great I loved the performances all over this record going forward I guess I'm looking for TFS to keep it coming keep it weird and keep taking some risks too you know don't just fall into this one sound I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this one transition have

9fewwAkSrCw,haha hi everyone Mike the neon tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Lana Del Rey album Norman fucking rock well this is the newest full-length LP from pop starlet Lana Del Rey aka Elizabeth Grant I have been covering Lana's music for close to a decade at this point and over this very lengthy period of time I feel like I've grown this really weird familiarity with something that I'm not even standing for no matter how much I listen to Lana's early stuff I just could not bring myself to enjoy the music of the gangster Nancy Sinatra never really got the nostalgic old soul obsession with the culture and aesthetics of mid-century America also the cheap and trendy ways in which Lana would fuse these aesthetics with hip hop the washed-out production the mone singing the very subpar lyricism not to mention all the bad girl narratives that typically resulted in Lana succumbing to the desires of some chud if that's how you want to live your life then live it but don't Gaslight me into thinking that it's badass or tragic or even enviable but that was the old Lana I think over the years her music has been getting more and more interesting embracing more tangible organic instrumentation portraying herself in a more empowered role in the lyrics of her songs in my opinion all of these things have resulted in Lana's last couple of records being her most enjoyable to date especially lust for life which I actually liked despite the handful of features on this record that did not really complement the album absolutely this thing is not a perfect record however it is indicative to my ears of a direction of an evolution that I hope Lana continues in or would continue in on her new record here it was exciting to see super producer Jack Antonoff taking part in the songwriting as well as the production on this new record - he seems to be everywhere these days and what set my expectations for this record even higher were that pretty much all of the teaser tracks were incredibly good mariner's apartment complex one of Lana's best songs ever fuck it I love you I love the impassioned vote coal's that lana laces into the chorus of this song as well as the greatest I love the grand instrumentation on this track and the tune is one of the most solid on the record too I'm still not entirely sold on the lengthy instrumental passage that comes a few minutes after the start of Venice bitch which extends the song out to nearly ten minutes in length especially once we reach the point where Lana's killing time with these ooo whatever's and Jack Antonoff scat arse clucking like an ugly electric chicken if you were gonna draw the song out for this long what you draw it out with should at least be like you know really good still the first leg of the track is great and I'll say that most of this lengthy instrumental passage is pleasant to the ears but there just are still some eyebrow-raising moments there's also a lot as cover of doing time which I didn't think would make it on to this record but it did although I shouldn't be surprised it's not her first cover and as I've said about this track before it's okay it's a very faithful rendition of the original copying over many of that songs fine details the biggest changes really come in the shape of the more hazy production and pillowy instrumentation I think I mostly appreciate the song for the way its themes play into Ladas typical style some are California a lot of rocky relationship bars on this track too and let's not also forget that sublimes Bradley Nowell he checks a lot of those bad boy boxes that have long been a source of inspiration for a Lana's music in the past so yes I was actually excited to listen to a new Lana Del Rey record and I anticipated that it was going to be good which is amazing which is fantastic because listen is as much as it may seem like it's the contrary to some people out there it's not like I gear up for these reviews thinking AHA ha ha yes another album I can give a negative review to okay what about when you said this their album I can give a negative review - that was me saying that out of context just now you still said it though you still said it look I like it when my life is easy and it's a lot easier when the album that I have to listen to for review four - five - six - seven times is likable is enjoyable that's that that's that's that's very nice because who wants to hear an album that's bad over and over and over and over so right from the start it's very apparent that Norman fucking Rockwell is going to be a very different lonna album the elegant strings the bare piano Lana's first words on the record being God and manchild you fucked me so good I almost said I love you calling the dude a man-child the turn down the way she takes down this self-absorbed clown throughout the lyrics in the track that's the TSYS I want to die I want to die now I can't believe I said that also all of this is attached to one of the best courses of her entire career we also had the gorgeous Mariners apartment complex that I complimented earlier the first whole verse on this track what you took my sadness out of context at the Mariners apartment complex I ain't no candle in the wind I'm the board the lightning the Thunder kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder who you are and who you been you lose your way just take my hand you're lost to see then I'll command your boat to me again don't look too far right where you are that's where I am I'm your man I'm your man I'm sorry but this is not the sad high schooler poetry that lana was trying to build her name on in the first leg of her career this is this is some romantic adult type of stuff this is caring this is loving this is concerned this is emotionally evolved it's at this point on the album here and with the song Venice bitch where the pianos the artistic indulgence the poetry the super sad mood throughout this record it is reminding me of another album and that's father John misty here comedy now listen it's a great record I don't think trying to make an album that is in any way like that record is inherently a bad thing and I think there are a lot of vast vast differences between these two albums politics being the most obvious one but if a lot of were to craft an album that was a pure comedy delray a record that went as in-depth on the feelings and the issues that drive her to make the art that she makes this would be it we have the track love song shortly after where I wish Lana did a bit more vocally to sell this song but it's still a really good tune and the lyrics of the song do a great job of conveying this idea of neediness and the tragedy attached to it all these references to I'd like you to stick around starving to make you proud talking about love or basically these shows of affection taking place in the back seat of a car usually a young lover stereotyped throughout the lyrics of the song Lana seems very deeply invested in the potential of this relationship or this connection working out but she's also throwing us all of these hints that this relationship is clearly not at a very stable point right now in a way it's like we're seeing the next chapter of this scenario on the track how to disappear where Lana seems to be remembering somebody who's a bit of a Fairweather boyfriend he's here and he's not he doesn't really stick around all that much also someone who seems to be suffering from some very deep emotional problems kind of dysfunctional overly aggressive too and all of this seems to result in disappearance disappearance of the person of the connection of the romance of the feeling of Lana as in the last verse of the song she depicts herself being at home in a solitary state two cats chillin nobody's going anywhere she's reached a point of stability just on her own the track California reads like yet another incredible loving caring step in the emotional evolution of Lana Del Ray where she seems to have an incredible amount of love for this person but also there's some regret there too like she wasn't there for them or supportive enough of them when they needed her to be she is telling this person come back to come back to America when you're here I'll throw you a party we'll do this we'll do that we'll do the other thing and when you're in my arms you don't have to be cooler than you are you don't have to be tougher stronger than you are because Lana's made the connection in her lyrics that love of a person can be equated to acceptance of that person it's also worth mentioning that at this point on the album the lovely and tasteful pianos and strings are keeping up the vocals are sounding pretty good very mature very smoky the sound across this record generally is pretty captivating the album does start dishing out some weaker moments here and there though past this point we have the next best American record which is a song that from Lana has been a demo floating around for some time now we're hearing it in a final form and it just sounds like a song that she would have written like five or six years ago it's not terrible but it's not doing a whole lot for me I'm bartender some of the lyrics take a bit of a quality dip the poetry inside of me is warm like a gun okay but still I do like the songs a narrative about Lana buying a truck to discreetly travel out escape the prying eyes of the media and basically hit up a bar hit up a bartender where where she can you know just drink the night away cherry coke though cherry coke I think the record ends on a somewhat strong note though with happiness as a butterfly as well as hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have happiness is a pretty chilling ballad about the difficulty of obtaining happiness but the track is also about Lana being caught up in this devastated state she feels hurt she's making irrational decisions nothing matters anymore she's spiraling downward and crying in the backseat and musing about whether or not this guy she's meeting up with is maybe a serial killer and if he was she's already hurt so that doesn't matter the closing track here is an understated but powerful finale that I think sums up a lot of the emotions the personality traits the flaws that fuel Lana Del Rey's art her poetry her music her storytelling but what truly ends up making the song a stunner to me is how emotionally Lana sells this track with some spotlit vocals over those bare pianos really working through the emotions of the song in a way where the listener feels it I really like this Lana record I actually it's kind of a long record though there are some tracks that I certainly think could have been cut doing time that Venice bitch instrumental Extension Cinnamon Girl as a song is just okay but most of the material on this thing is actually Lana's best stuff I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best watch an IRB the like if you like please

CDzYqHFilZU,hi everyone ruff any night tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new album from blank mass animated violence mild that is an example of how quickly my brain is moving right now let's see how this review goes as I said album from blank mass the latest one if you did not know blank mass is the musical project of electronic music producer Benjamin John Power a name I never get tired of saying he is also known as one half of the electronic and experimental music duo fuck buttons but over the past decade or so he's been doing a great job of building more interest in the blank mass name now with multiple quality albums being released through sacred bones records 2017 s world leader was not only a very good album but blank masses best so far and I essentially went into animated violence mild hoping he'd craft an even better project because there's something about his fusions of rave centric electronic dance music noise and industrial aesthetics that are not only good in and of themselves but feel like they're on the verge of something groundbreaking the record starts off well enough with a short intro and the absolute rager death drop as expected it sounds like the dystopian soundtrack to an all-out slugfest happening at an underground dance club run by a bunch of Goths who own an abandoned Factory the pounding percussion the thick heavy walls of screaming burning bright synthesizers and leads it's all pretty thrilling and I love that power is taking the time to add little rhythmic nuances throughout the track so the progressions don't turn stale which is an issue I've had with past blank mass works past fuck buttons works the added builds and rhythmic change ups and also scream vocals at a few points on the track are greatly appreciated the track also goes on for a very generous seven minutes and yet it doesn't really feel like it as once this thing's and I felt like I was just locked into this very intense firework show the song house vs. house starts off in a somewhat more lighthearted fashion with these jittery beats and vocal samples that are just hip driving it kind of feels like the start of a Diplo type banger but power drives this track into a very different direction with these grand epic chord progressions swelling in the background suddenly this incredibly bright burning simply just slices through all the sonic chaos that power has drummed up so far the melody has this really righteous tone to it that feels like it's straight out of this anime about a young protagonist who lives in a world of fantastical creatures and one day discovers that they have magic powers I also love the ghostly lead vocals that pop up at a few points on this track too next we have the song hush money which - sounds like an abrasive blend of noise and glistening electronic dance music but the way it's paced it sounds like the opening theme to an obscure 2d Japanese space shooter for the SNES where all these enemy ships and lasers are flying at you from every direction the track mostly functions off of two major parts though and I wish it just had a bit more variation across its length love is a parasite though I had a difficult time getting into it was slightly a disappointment given this is one of the bigger tracks on the entire record but the song features this awful chord progression that just feels like a migraine left over from the post grunge era of all things and hearing it in this slightly different aesthetic and context doesn't really make it any more appealing thankfully there's a much better second half where Benjamin breaks into a totally different musical passage but then brings it back to that original chord progression at the finish where it doesn't sound too awful but just generally not too crazy about the composition of this one dun dun dun dun dun dun dun duh I can't quite tell which it is but no dice grooves like either an old-school hip-hop song or an old-school synth pop song either way the bright rush of synths that pop up all over this track are fantastic some of the best on the record and even though aesthetically it's not too different from a lot of the other songs here this switch up in rhythmic delivery is enough to make this track feel refreshing the final cut on the record wings of hate is another screaming bricked out synth wall of distortion and noise it's just so heavy it's so blaring it's in your face it feels a lot like the opening track and I think it's pretty fitting that we have an ending and the beginning to this record that are both equally gargantuan I just wish the final moments didn't just fade out into oblivion so abruptly not a bad album once again from blank mass it didn't blow me away because there were a few lulls at the midpoint of the record a few songs that I felt like could have done more and there are so few tracks on the album to begin with it's a sizable record in terms of length but there are too few songs here for not every track to be amazing but I would say this one is at least as good as the last blank mass record if you loved that record you're most likely gonna love this one I thought that last one was pretty good and I think this one too is pretty good maybe the next one will kind of push it over that edge and I'll really love it and I'll be blown away but for now I'm pretty satisfied with how enjoyable this is I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Blanc mass of forever 
K7xhuqw4DgE,"hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tool album fear inoculum this is the latest album from alternative metal band tool a record that comes 13 years after the release of their last album in 2006 10,000 days tools incredibly short but flawless discography has aged to be the envy of metal bands across the genre it's inventive it's progressive its unique it's cutting edge what's even more miraculous as the band was able to achieve some pretty great commercial success with it during a time when most mainstream metal was being dominated with these really tacky fusions of groove metal and hip-hop and funk not a great time for metal music but I do remember it pretty vividly because I lived through it and loved most of it but even as I slowly over the years fell out of love with this era of mainstream metal tool continued to age much better than their less substantive contemporaries with psychedelic effects and intriguing song concepts meditative grooves odd time signatures enchanting visual art also this uniquely hypnotic and dark sound on key tracks like sober stink fist forty six and two schism and lateralis let's also not forget about the band's incredibly dynamic songwriting as well as frontman Maynard James Keenan 'he's beckoning impassioned lead vocals yes at times they do lose pretension but they are still some of the most compelling in modern metal being a big fan of tools music when I was younger I could go on listing the band's important musical characteristics and I feel obligated to because so much has occurred in the 13-year gap between this and the band's last record most importantly the shift of music consumers from music stores to streaming platforms for their auditory entertainment needs which tool has only adapted to recently now of course this exciting adaptation to the Information Age comes along with the release of this new album tool fans have waited a long time for this moment I have always found two sad the Bandon keep it up after 10,000 days but assumed that hey maybe they just didn't feel like it was the right time they didn't have the right music there was something else going on they will come back to a new record to a new project when they feel like they have something to say and as far as statements go fear inoculum is tools largest so far at ninety minutes in length which is mostly spread out amongst these six massive tracks and broken up by a handful of different interludes I'm not going to beat around the bush though this is tools worst album now you can rationalize that if you want and say hey Anthony tools back catalogue is mostly perfect if not near-perfect just because this album doesn't reach those impossibly high standards it doesn't mean that it's bad and yeah I guess that's true but there are legitimate reasons as to why fear inoculum doesn't really live up to the standard of past tool records and isn't even really that great to begin with the biggest issues with this LP were already forecast by the title track that was teased weeks before the release of this thing there were some pretty impressive characteristics to make note of though the performance across the entirety of the track was engaging maynard's vocals switch ups across the song were pretty cool but the production was maybe just a little too clean and the worst thing about this track is that the writing was absolutely flavorless so by the numbers for a tool song so basic not nearly as intricate or as direct or as exciting as I typically would like a tool song to be I mean the bass and guitar lines on this track sound like something the band's written at least a few times already and sadly as we go deeper into the album the writing continues to be an issue a glaring issue to the point where it's blatantly uninspired and even leads to some really lackluster songwriting do you remember a time when tool used to write these distinct catchy and complex guitar and bass parts and attach them to stunning choruses and haunting lyrical mantras yeah not so much the case or for fear knock ulam on the very next song here Numa as well as with other tracks on this record it sounds as if tool are just writing these Morse code messages in 7/8 time using metal guitars and that's it the meditative grooves are there but they are delivered so flatly and there are so little in terms of distinct melodic color across many of them even on one of the better tracks here invincible around the midway point the band transitions into what could only be categorized as mindless chugging it just happens to occur over an odd time signature and that's it which is a gimmick you're only going to get so much mileage out of for the love of God this is not a gent record but despite the lack of interesting anything going on here Toole drags these passages out as if they just discovered fire or something this is so rudimentary you are above this and aesthetically what's going on is so plain and bare to the surprise drum solo in the second half of this track is drier than a desert in the phased-out synth leads that come not too long after sound horrendous not really a reflection of a band that over a decade ago had a pretty fantastic approach to sound play I just wish around the five minute and 44 second mark on this song we just transitioned into maybe the last two minutes of the track and then that was it that would have been great I have similar feelings about the track descending whose guitar work in its initial moments is kind of average for tool again but Maynard's vocal work on the song definitely saves it a bit it's pretty compelling the harmonies that he delivers are great but you see this is just the first section of the song we have to span it out for 10 minutes why I don't know but we have to and at around the seven-minute mark we suddenly get into these very punctuated staccato throbbing bass lines and slide electric guitar it sounds like a horrendous combination of progressive alternative metal and just a cheap blues rock but there's still loads of time left past this point so why not throw in some soaring guitar solos and also some weird awkward analog synth leads that sound like there's something out of a John Carpenter soundtrack you know all stuff that goes together and makes sense the only two tracks on the record that I thought were actual good were the song culling all is it which I I don't think has the boldest writing on the entire record or the most explosive performance but it is one of the most legitimately meditative songs on the entire record and for the length of the song from front to back there is no tomfoolery going on or no ridiculous experiments or ideas that the band just tries their hand at and utterly fails and then we have the song tempest which is the most explosive cut on the entire record the riffs the van builds up to on this track are pretty exciting they hit hard even the more low-key moments are very hypnotic and very enchanting I don't even mind the jammy or sections of the song given what the band is jamming over is pretty good but that noodley riff on this song that pops up around 743 and then again at 11 minutes or so that the drums sync up with very nicely that and almost that alone is the most unique and interesting and complex and flashy bit of guitar work across this entire album I wish I could say there were more moments on this thing that really stood out to me in that way but there weren't as far as the ambient interludes that I haven't really gone into detail with yet across the record they're all bad they're all terrible they're not good at all again not a reflection of a band that had a really great approach to sound play and sound experimentation over a decade ago the interludes do not add anything to the flow of this album they don't segue into or out of any of the songs on this thing creatively they're just all awful filler even the track chocolate chip trip which I will now proceed to try to say five times fast chocolate chip trip chocolate chip trip chocolate chip trip chocolate chip chocolate chip trip damn I got it this tracks not really an interlude it's more like an elongated drum solo and I mean the rhythms on this track are great but the synthesizer thrown in is horrendous another bad synth part on this album that didn't really need to be there yes this tool record I found to be patients testing not very enjoyable not really up to snuff with anything the band is put out up until this point writing is not very good and unfortunately even though I think the band is is performing pretty well they're playing real tight on this thing it's it's it's affected the quality of these songs greatly unfortunately I think tool has really fallen off here I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

right also got a shout out our Amazon and turntable lab links down there if you want to get yourself a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kicked back from it and let's head into the worst tracks of the week there were just a few just a couple just a few first one oh this new post Malone track I did a full-length review of it over on the Fantana channel did not like it I think it's one of post Malone's worst songs and not really for being the kind of generic sing song eat rap music that he rode in on rather what's terrible about this song is that it's a very lame-ass ballad with super weak instrumental that sounds like a foster the people less left over didn't really care for the folks the the forced manipulated vibrato can't speak today for some reason on the on his voice either it was a super big turn-off kind of grossed out by this track don't know what to make of this new upcoming album not sure if I'm a too psyched for it but I guess we'll see moving on from there oh this one hurts new song from have a nice life a project that I liked their last record quite a bit and everyone on the internet and their mom will tell you that death consciousness is one of the best shoegaze post-punk experimental this that and the other because it's a million different things kind of record of so many years into the past but not really digging this new track over here see of worry a sounds like a bad goth doubt surf rock like indie type of surf rock song with super washed out vocals don't like the tune don't like the production but it is have a nice life I'm not anticipating every single song on the new record is gonna be like this so maybe the other tracks will please me more but as of right now I am NOT digging this new song moving out from their cigarettes after sex continue to be one of the blandest and most forgettable bands out there in the music scene right now it's new song over here heavenly totally dime-a-dozen vocals dime-a-dozen guitars dime-a-dozen production dime-a-dozen drums very forgettable tune I I like that there's maybe a bit more clarity and tangibility to the instrumentation than there was on the last record generally but yeah this is just some very forgettable washed out in deep kind kind of pop it sounds like if the XX had no soul whatsoever and and they and they have very little soul to speak of as it is so yeah those are my thoughts alright let's move on to the tracks that were kind of met wasn't really blown away by these tracks but still thought they were worth mentioning first off white Reaper never been a big white reaper guys stylistically they never really truly stood out to me in their respective genre but I still think that this tune over here is is a hell of a power pop track it's got some good energy to it it's got a good hook to it check it out check it out if you're out some power pop vibes vetiver in the folk band vetiver they are back with a brand new track that's pretty sweet and breezy not too much impact but still a sweet little tune it's cute it's rustic it's endearing we also have vagabond who is an indie artist up until this point whose work has always underwhelmed me and didn't really stand out to me aesthetically however she seems to be branching out quite a bit with her new material including this new track over here that is a lot groovier than her past material it's kind of like a if you mixed indie pop with a bit of alternative dance music through some weird vibes in there got some slightly left field production tricks in there and yeah just kind of like let it ride out in a linear fashion at some point so you really kind of feel that groove so I don't know to me this is an improvement to me this is getting more interesting so vagabond interest piqued ears are perked looking forward to the future we have Pusha T who came out with this new track sociopath with cash doll did a full-length review of this over on the Fantana channel thought it was just okay production from Kanye West was mildly interesting push a tee not a whole lot in terms of interesting wordplay at lid just just not a very above-average track from Pusha T very very by-the-numbers track from Pusha T frankly and I and I feel like cash at all could have been utilized more interestingly honestly we also have this new track over here from Pine Grove and never been a big Pine Grove guy but some of the guitar work on this new track over here it's pretty sweet is pretty nice don't care too much for the tune or the vocals but it does have a nice jangly sort of intricate vibe to it that is pretty cool the name of the track is moment we also have comic gain with the track mid 80s over here comic gain has been in in my view one of the most consistently enjoyable sort of indie and twee pop bands out there when I'm talking about indie pop in indie rock I mean like an old-school like uk-based style of the genre like way way way back in the day like again back to the tweet pop days back to the cat6 days there's nothing very nostalgic about what they do but the songwriting is so good that it's it's not really the nostalgia that sells it the lyrics on this new track over here are particularly weird as well in in my view nothing to stand out for comic gain but still a very enjoyable track we also have a neutral song from Charlie XCX this new one featuring high the hi and sisters and yeah I wish there was more contrast along the song I mean there's some great vocal harmonies there's a great vibe there's a great groove there's a great energy but it is a little one-dimensional in terms of its energy across the track I do think it gets progressively a bit more lush as it moves along but I wish that progression were greater moving on from there we have a new track from Bombay Bicycle Club who I've never been a super big fan of but this track was pretty sweet had a solid hook to it if you like some sweet indie pop with a bold loud chorus give it a shot give it a try and black belt Eagle Scout new record on the way thought this washed out dreamy guitar backed tune that has been delivered on this one was pretty sweet again nothing are really blowing me away run it to you was the name of this one nothing really blowing me away but it was sweet on the ears was pleasant to listen to and we have this new song over here from Big Sean and ASAP ferg with a hit boy on production berserk is the name of it and I mean it's okay i I wish it kind of lived up to the name though it doesn't quite go berserk I think ASAP ferg is trying to push it there the beats a little generic but definitely has some rumbling bass to it there's definitely meat on the bones of this beat but Big Sean flows average a few lines sticking out here and there from both Ferg and Sean that are kind of funny but I don't know as a banger it's it's very like C+ level you know this is not an A+ banger it's a so-so banger and we also have AG Cooke of PC Music Fame coming through with the very odd futuristic take on art pop some of the vocals I thought were really difficult to listen to very out of place very awkward could have been retooled but instrumental still sounds futuristic is how strange inventive you know as as always people you know related to and sort of orbiting around PC music always coming through with a creative stuff even if it does fall short of greatness and let's get into the track so I thought were the best of the week the ones that really stood out to me the ones that really left an impression on me first we have once again the span that I'm talking up for the second time in this segment with a new project on the way they go by the name of squid and they are writing some really great post-punk musica throws it back to the old days but there are some interesting instrumental dynamics that they're presenting today excuse me that makes it stand out match bet is the name of this new one I thought the horns that pop up suddenly in this song we're unexpected and wonderful and yeah just a great energy on this track great snobby just uh I don't know what else to say just a badass energy to it that I think is really great all right we also have a Sami so Sami so Sami an artist who I'm just now hearing up takecare is the name of this new one aesthetically I won't say that this song is much more than just like in an average kind of low down somewhat depressed indie pop ballad but the songwriting is impeccably good impeccably good songwriting and the vocals are so damn earnest just couldn't get over it it was beautiful it was moving it was touching from the word go this track cut me cut me emotionally and not not not too proud of a person to say that I can admit that all right push a tee another song he dropped two tracks within days of each other this new one over here also production from Kanye West Lauryn Hill coming home this one is much better not that lyrically it was like in another galaxy or anything but the use of Lauryn Hill was great the instrumental was fantastic pushed he had an amazing energy it felt it a little bit like a bling era throwback with a really hopeful positive instrumental again great positive almost like inspirational type of energy coming off of this track that I thought was wonderful definitely much better than the sociopath as much as I do again like the instrumental off of that record alright well as to have Miles Davis rubberband this track has been or rather this project has been getting promoted as the lost Miles Davis album it's coming out soon you-you-you haven't heard it yet we haven't heard it before it's lost album it's coming out it's gonna be the first time you've heard this record now if you couldn't already tell from the cover and also from the era that most likely we wouldn't have heard Miles Davis album yet if you know anything about Miles Davis yes this this record came from the fusion era so it's a little funky there's a lot of slap bass there are a lot of strange solo passages that are pretty unorthodox this is a somewhat controversial time for Miles career there were some bad records during this time yes that's undeniable however however however there were some really forward-thinking experiments that also came out during this point in his career excuse me forward-thinking experiments that came out during the section of his career and I think that there are a lot of jazz purists who are unnecessarily dismissive of the stuff he was coming out with in in this section of his career this track isn't some weird spacey pointless meditation or anything too indulgent to my ears is a great straightforward groove to it there's some great horn and flute syncopation on this track there is a an intense energy running throughout almost all of it I think it's a worthwhile track I think it's worthwhile listen again with it being somewhat dated in aesthetic and very specific to a certain time of jazz it's not going to appeal to everybody but for those who do tend to favor some more sounds out of the world of jazz fusion that came along in the 70s or in the 80s I think you I think you'll get into this this is pretty nice this is pretty nice the playing is impressive at many points of the song I'll say that much alright let's go to the next one over here we have the good people over at gorilla toss coming through new EP on the way and this new one over here plants is one of their weirdest songs and that's saying quite a bit because they are a very freaky band this new track over here seem like the modus operandi of this one was to essentially come through with like these thick lush bright buzzing layers of sound that basically drowned out the song but then clear it out every once in a while to sort of like bring bring some clarity to the track and hit the listener with something that's just like very bare and very snappy and then just like go right back into that insanity you know not not exactly the same kind of freakish danceable post-punk vibe that the band usually brings to the table but I still thought it was really weird left-field and an interesting and fun you know above all things because I do think what gorillas toss is great at is making music that is enjoyably weird and fun so gorillas toss hell yes come through plants and we have a floating points an electronic music project that I've been kind of touch and go with for a little while now this new one over here I thought was a really great thoughtful piece of IDM with these plucky bent lead melodies that were really stimulating and and felt almost alien in a way cool sputtering backing beat as well it had a lot of interesting little subtleties to a shifting around always so a cool little cut over here floating points last bloom and up earth gang enjoyed the single quite a bit the duo comes through the song that is equal parts zany and soulful some of the verses I think are maybe a little muddy and chaotic to the point where the I think they needed to be more intelligible but still the singing and the choruses are fantastic and the the instrumental is pretty great too and generally enjoyed it enjoyed a lot movin out from their death Drive is the name excuse me of the latest project excuse me two times geez I'm just a mess right now death Drive is the name of the new project from Debbie Friday shout out to death bomb Ark I've heard quite a bit of the record there's some tracks I'm crazy about some tracks not but the song over here fatal is certainly one of those tracks that I think is great it is currently attached to a music video that is pretty freaky as well and what I like that Debbie Friday does on this track is brings together a excuse me what I like that Debbie Friday does on this track is that she brings together elements of what sounds like dance music experimental music art pop maybe you touch a light touch of industrial as well mmm with some very strange lead vocals and I don't know just just creates a very a widening Li strange vibe that I'm very very very much into this is gonna be an artist that I'm probably gonna be you know just look it out for here and there going forward and we have ASAP Rocky babushka boy did a full-length review this track over on the fan tanto channel liked it quite a bit and I thought that this track boiled down to a lot of the aspects that made Rocky such an interesting hip-hop artist to begin with and that is that you know has a solid hook catchy flows kind of freaky left-field quality instrumental choice on this one not like the greatest thing I've ever heard lyrically but that is not really my expectation from rocky or where he tends to I think thrive or succeed the most yeah I just thought it was a solid ASAP rocky song very enjoyable and looking forward to hopefully a return to form on this one because I think his last couple of Records have been incredibly lackluster and I am hoping that this is him just uh you know making a more positive turn on this one and oh and I want to give a shout out to Animal Collective who we are going to link you to down below who did a cool little acoustic and odd silver juice cover obviously in celebration of a David Berman who recently had passed away so rest in peace to him amazing to see various artists around the indie sphere including Animal Collective and also Bill Callahan too and and others being so great and just celebrating you know David Berman's music silver Jews music so on and so forth you know doing some good quality covers and whether it be in the studio or live so again great thing rest in peace to David once more and I think that's uh that's gonna be it for the weekly track round up everybody oh one more one more Oh a couple more geez I'm having a brain fart here couple more on amount of gucci Anamanaguchi they are back it's been a while since we have heard from the the 8-bit rock outfit known as Anamanaguchi lorem ipsum is the name of this new cut over here it's an amazingly thrilling melodic mix of what sounds like drum and bass some pop punk music a little bit of I don't know your average highly melodic rich and lush anime soundtrack intro theme it's it's great it's great it's really a fantastic listen and very very fun very very bright very very colorful you know it's again it's been a while since we've heard something from the studio of substance from Anamanaguchi and I'm hoping the fans pick pick back up on this you know I know back in the day there were some people who were super heavy on Anamanaguchi and it would it would be great to hear that kind of passion come back for this new material because it is actually worthwhile and I think it bests a lot of the stuff they were coming out with before they took as you know as long of a break as they did in between studio projects so looking forward to out of my goat cheese is doing now that they're back on the map and we have Algiers they're back can the sub-base speak is the name of this new cut over here and it's unlike anything Algiers have ever done and yet I enjoy it quite a bit it's a mix of experimental almost avant-garde jazz and spoken word the tracks lyrics read almost like an indignant hater just like I I guess speaking down on their music almost like over the internet or to their faces and just saying all this completely ignorant and uninformed totally clueless shit about music art politics race what the band Algiers does it's it's like you know truly a satire to display of ignorance over this very frantic and jagged and and very out-there jazz instrumental and again totally unlike anything Algiers has done up until this point and yet it's pretty bold it's very bold and very cool for what it is you know it's not to say that Algiers like stepped in is doing some weird spoken word jazz and like it just came mediocre because it was their first time trying it like it's actually pretty cool by those standards you know for spoken word song for freaky left-field jazz song I would say they actually succeeded pretty well and kind of recreating that's putting you know putting their foot through the door in that and you know I guess putting their best foot forward making a bold first impression I don't anticipate this will be the tone of the Bands next record from front to back but it'll be interesting to see how this song links up with what the band is trying to communicate on the rest of the record because certainly the song is going to stand out narrative Lee and instrumentally how will it I guess kind of reinforce everything else happening on the band's new project that's the question and that's what's a gonna be intriguing so can the sub-base speak like to quite a bit and that has been the weekly track roundup everyone again all those tracks all of ID all of what I just talked to us linked down there below in the description sorry for the few hiccups you know but above I

xlpqeREimKg,hi everyone snack the new snack tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new 93 punks and and vic mensa album 93 punks goddess that is too many punks chicago rapper singer-songwriter vic mensa he's back there was a time earlier in this decade when you could look at vic Mensa's career how it was starting and see internet tape and and see the work he had put into kids these days and say hey there is a guy with potential there's a guy you got to keep your your eye on but multiple singles EPS and a commercial debut album later and Vic seems no closer to putting out a memorable project but now after a quick stylistic shift with 93 punks his new new new project new band new thing he has made something memorable I would not say it's for the right reasons though Vic just started promoting this new venture earlier this year with the release of a cover a 93 punks and vic mensa cover of the legendary cranberries track zombies and the cover was horrendous honestly after that the whole 93 punks thing just fell off my radar I don't I don't want to hear it but it came back into frame when I saw the Def Con cringe music video for the song three years sober where Vic can be seen wearing his best Punk costume and screaming about sobriety as well as saying that he fucks himself and calls it masturbation also the sequence beats on this track the very wide slightly grunge tinged Punk guitar chords that bands like The Offspring were just slinging back in the day I can appreciate that on this track Vic is railing on about some serious addiction issues that he has had but it makes it hard to take everything he's saying seriously when he couches it in this really edgy fashion punk aesthetic that is so tired so inauthentic and so played out not to mention lyrical gems on this thing like I played myself like an accordion yeah so this song this music video could have merely been a case of a bad single a bad teaser and maybe the rest of the record is pretty good but no really when you pull back the floorboard you see that everything underneath is just rotten and falling apart you have definition of a fuck-boy which basically sounds like some of the worst rock trends of the 2000s lining up with some of the worst musical trends of today you have these plane trap high hats coming together with these whiny blink-182 vocals these jump the fuck up some 41 type riffs some Pixies ish guitar arpeggios at one point - it's a total mess especially when you get to the point where you just have vic shouting bring it on plus you have all these ugly horrendous preachy verses about this current generation of rappers that vic obviously does not care for his attitude is is very rough it's very rough but now with with a mohawk there's also a point where he makes light of rappers or fuckboys that he doesn't like ending up in prison you'll be in witness protection if they let you back out now your mumble rapping cuz it's a dick in your mouth wow I'm deep I'm deeply moved I'm deeply moved by that one I get there's a lot of toxicity in trap music right now that's that's a given that's undeniable but that is not a reason to wipe away your concern for those who find themselves trapped in the prison industrial complex which I'm sure Vic is woke enough that he that he knows that he understands that it's just really inconsistent that in this context in this scenario he doesn't seem to care so Vic will do a track like this and then an ironic Lee down the road do the song fistfight which is literally just about fighting in a parking lot and hey listen I don't mind a song about fighting a fight song that that's totally cool that's fine it just feels out of place given the messages of some of these other songs compiled with the fact that it just sounds like an unfunny ripoff of Zack Foxx and Kenny beats square up camp America is an admirable attempt at trying to take a stand on the whole detention camp at the border situation the family separation situation essentially criminalizing the fact that many of these people are fleeing their home country trying to escape danger death truly and honestly I think the hook does have some compelling aspects to it I think the vocal melody is nice but the ultra glossy instrumentation to my ears is just gross and kind of goes totally against the punk aesthetic of this record to begin with and it sounds like Vic is trying to satirize the whole situation making light of there being a camp in America that you can't escape and we're gonna have fun there and this then the other thing but the satire is not good enough to make lines like take your clothes off baby let me see what you got we can have a good time if you're legal or not it does not make lines like that read the way they're supposed to because I would imagine Vic is referencing this person's legal status as a citizen their immigration status not whether or not they're underaged and sleeping with an underaged person that's what it reads like Vic continues to up his punk cred with a good charlotte feature of all things on a track hear the song it's a bad dream it just sounds like yet another emo trap variation a bit little Aussie vert inspired the melody on the hook is pretty sweet I think I would like this track more if it were another artist and had a different feature it's it's not terrible but it's just more emo trap nonsense truly and honestly and given that this record is trying to sell itself as something deep something substantive something alternative for it to do a track like this that is so trendy and so stereotypical so the opposite of anything truly Punk it just makes it feel cheaper than it actually is miraculously the album somehow goes downhill from here it actually gets worse like it or not all of the songs nearly all of the tracks up until this point have been pretty sensibly and well structured can't really hate on the builds of these songs as much as I hate the lyrics and I don't like the tunes and I think the instrumentals are trash and and anything else bad that I could think of at least the songs are written pretty coherently however after this point that mostly seems to go out of the window the song I cry to is a weird emotional motif that is annoying as hell and should have just been left on the cutting room floor I cry three is even worse and again should have just been thrown into the recycling bin the song bad brain sounds like a weird interlude featuring HR of the band Bad Brains I heard that before this album came out that Vic was working on a collaboration with him but stylistically it didn't seem to come out anything like he described in a previous interview essentially what we have here is HR just vocally meandering through this sea of low fight trash it's easily one of the worst tracks on the entire record totally pointless we have the track fine which is not really a sketch as it's labeled to be it's just another bad song the only way this track would be a sketch is if Vic were doing it ironically and basically came out and said hey this whole album is a joke oh man you got me so good with this one dude you got me good there's also the track united states of evil featuring Tom Morello which does have some interesting characteristics to it we have Vic vocally just throwing so much distortion and so much auto-tune on his voice it sounds like a totally different effect it's very freaky it's glitchy it's strange his vocals are completely destroyed on this track but honestly that's the only compelling thing about it for the most part it just sounds like some very bad Death Grips cosplay the whole thing ends off with the hilariously bad goodbye to heartbreak in which Vic just lists out all of these good riddance 'as all of these things I'm rejecting and saying goodbye to and you get the sense that he's saying goodbye to these things as if he's just sending them off and casting them down to hell in the whole world will never have to deal with any of them ever again goodbye violence goodbye suicide goodbye racism goodbye Catholic priests the weirdest one is when he just suddenly says with an extreme amount of snark goodbye rape sayonara arrivederci she catch you on the flipside rape this is bad this is really bad this was excruciating ly bad this album I feel like the concept of this record is truly and honestly I I think I think vic mensa heard Kid Cudi's speeding bullet to heaven and he heard logic supermarket and he was like no way no no way no way I am not letting these guys go down in history with the worst hip-hop rock crossovers of the decade and and damn if Vince didn't didn't honestly come close to taking taking the gold uh I am feeling a light too decent one on this one a light too decent one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you should check out at that upworthy link to subscribe

PqgUthlbpuE,well hi hi how you do everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new knocked loose album a different shade of blue this is the sophomore full-length album of Louisville metalcore act knocked loose I first heard of the group back in 2016 through their debut record laughs tracks and for me it was a pretty interesting release given that it was celebrating an era of metalcore music that I was very very familiar with given that I have grown up in New England the scene was going full throttle at the time with Hatebreed making waves and converged touring through the area periodically as well as the New York scene going absolutely insane it was quite the time for heavy visceral music and laugh tracks rages like the trend never died out so while I did enjoy that this project was taking me back to a time that was like comfort food for me I didn't really find it all that memorable or all that distinct from what it was so obviously inspired by it just didn't stick out to me even though I could see people enjoying this band enjoying this record because it scratches a certain kind of emotional itch I guess overall with laughs tracks I was more intrigued than I was impressed but with a different shade of blue I went into this thing hoping for something more risky creative less of a celebration of the straight metal core blueprint I feel like it didn't really go far enough though while there are some improvements on this LP that I liked quite a bit it's only nominally more dynamic and varied than its predecessor I guess it's partially a matter of perspective I could see hardcore fans of the last album listening to this and saying whoa they're trying so many more things and bringing so many more new sounds into the fold this is like such an improvement if you were blown away by the knocked loose debut you are going to be blown away by this too because this time around the band does weave more death metal yes death metal into their usual metalcore savagery chugging chromatic riffs growled guttural background vocals lyricism that is more sadistic and morbid sinister leads and sour harmonies that trademark buzzsaw guitar distortion it's just enough death-metal influence to categorize a lot of tracks on this record as deathcore but it doesn't stray so far from the metalcore form that a metalcore purist wouldn't enjoy it like on the track by the grave which has a very slow atmospheric brooding death metal intro but as soon as that's over the band kicks into high gear into some really throttling metalcore and the riffs are very chunky chunky chunky riffs there's also the occasional passage on here where the guitars are a bit more harmonious not as distorted or as aggressive the vocals get very shouty and dramatic it is definitely a play right out of the screamo playbook so knock loose is definitely breaking their metalcore sound up a bit this time around and the production is noticeably heavier on this one too so while I do like that the band is bringing more variety to this LP some more atmospheric or melodic passages like the start of misguided son or the ethereal ambient ish drone at the finish of end still under South I still have a major issue on here with the writing which most of the time is painfully basic and almost uninspired now often that is the prerogative of this style of music simplicity being no-frills seems to sell best but as I'm listening through this album I feel like I'm just being toured through one nondescript breakdown after another sometimes the breakdowns on this thing are paired with a supremely sinister refrain about being betrayed by the promise of death or having a bone to pick with death sometimes there are some pretty demented guitar parts that they throw over these breakdowns too that makes them somewhat stand out like the final moments of the song trapped in the grasp of a memory the guitar feedback or very high-pitched guitars over the break down in those spots it sounds like a Xerox machine going haywire so yes I am noticing the extra detail and the extra effort the band is putting in on this record is appreciated it surely elevates this album above just being meat and potatoes metalcore but for me it only brought this record to a somewhat mild state of enjoyability it didn't really put it over the edge for me because again the writing I do like some of the death metal woven into this record but a lot of these riffs a lot of these breakdowns are monotonous are tedious are one-dimensional are very basic and plain and average for the genre some of them are so savage and enraged and loud that they do manage to stand out yes but it is rarely the shape or the composition of the riffs that actually makes them memorable while I don't mind the rage and I don't mind the aggression obviously those are positive aspects to a metalcore record I wish that the the writing here was more interesting I wish it gave you more to chew over or I wish it was distinct in so that every breakdown didn't almost feel the same now don't get me wrong there's not really anything on this record outside of some very mind-numbing engines that's actually that bad there's nothing here that is truly awful and there are some legitimately standout tracks to the energy generally on this album is exciting the production is great the execution is nearly flawless I just wish what the band was executing was more interesting I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit

uqOiWhlOny4,hi everyone paintin a job tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Taylor Swift record lover this is the latest polling kelpy from pop song stris Taylor Swift it's her seventh album and follows the incredibly moody and mostly awful reputation which dropped in 2017 this album was a dark and image-obsessed change of pace for Taylor essentially her wearing her bad rep like an edgy badge of honor but it mostly turned into a petty nightmare that even her most generous critics had a hard time defending thankfully lover seems to be Taylor's return to upbeat bold and bright pop and you know where else would she go after the incredible success of read and of course 1989 after a record like 89 you are a pop artist for life the chances of Taylor making that sudden pivot to French house or black and death metal it's dwindled down to almost nothing but even though lover is yet another notch in Taylor's pop belt it is much different stylistically from any pop record she has released so far and I would imagine a great deal of that comes down to the inclusion of multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter of bleachers Fame Jack Antonoff coming into the fold here having his hands in the production of nearly every track on this album so Jax and I imagine Taylor's love of groovy synth pop and peppy pop rock and grand indie anthems it floods nearly every song on this record now honestly going into this record I was not expecting all that much of lover mostly because I very much disliked the singles leading up to this album with the exception of the title track the song me featuring Brendon Urie is a totally overblown overproduced just up in the clouds pop tune with some of Taylor's worst lyrics to date I still cannot stand it and I'm sorry but the Humpty Dumpty bars on the archer No thank you and the track you need to calm down has been torn apart across the internet as being some very very weak LGBTQ Ally ship not to mention it all happens over an instrumental that sounds like some gussied up and watered-down LCD Soundsystem but again the title track is actually a pretty great song and elegantly arranged acoustic ballad with a subtle country twang to it I love the progressively lush instrumentation the intimate lyrics but despite not expecting much of lover on the whole I actually ended up enjoying the album a little bit because the deep cuts are quite good yes yes they are Taylor does drum up quite a few highlights across these 18 songs despite finding the message of the song funny because nothing says I've forgotten about you than a song about you the opening track I forgot that you existed is actually pretty good I love the playful piano chords I love the pumping beats I love Taylor's very expressive voice on this track it feels like a pop take on a musical portion of a high school play and let's face it that's because Taylor forgetting about her haters and not keeping a tally of every time she's been crossed that's an act however it's one I am willing to suspend disbelief for if the song is this sweet I think the track boils down the attitude of the overall album pretty nicely because it is a very positive euphoric lovey-dovey kinda record to get to that point Taylor needs to shake off the hay and that's how we arrived at the track cruel summer which is one of a few tracks on this album that presents us with this very triumphant synth pop that's kind of an 80s throwback but it's mostly a result of modern production aesthetics it's got a powerful chorus that I love quite a bit but it also rides a little on the coattails of what Carly Rae Jepsen has been doing on her past couple of albums I feel roughly the same way about the instrumental on the Archer also the track the man though this track I will say does stand on the merits of its own melodies its concept where Taylor essentially imagines herself as a man and posing that her public image would be softened we're not as controversial or the things that people dislike about her would be reasoned away if she were just male which is absolutely reductive though I do not deny that Taylor has faced sexism in the music industry that is like going outside and facing the Sun but to imply that Taylor's womanhood throughout her career has not also been a source of empowerment an artistic inspiration would be a lie the super lovesick and catchy pop anthems continue on to the songs I think he knows also Cornelius Street and a song that I loved loved level of love paper rings which may actually be my favorite Taylor Swift song ever it is a somewhat rowdy piece of pop rock with some subtly punky guitar embellishments here and there in the verse in the intro but really it's all about how the chorus blossoms into the sparkling euphoric amazing wall of sound it reminds me of classic 80s pop hits like the go-go's vacation or maybe even a little 99 red balloons there are a few head scratchers in the second leg of this album though like with miss Americana and the heartbreak Prince this song sounds like Taylor's best attempt at doing a Lana Del Rey ripoff it's like she wants to perform the act but she can only go so far with it the monie and breathy singing is there at a few points but the atmosphere the space the drama is missing with only a few duds the first two thirds of lover are actually pretty great but it's the last leg of the album where things begin to get spotty you have redundancies like the track London boy where the glitzy uplifting pop instrumentation and crush centric lyrics it's like I'm just getting another taste of this one more time but now it's with a side of tea and crumpets soon you get better was an exciting prospect for the record though going into it because it features none other than the Dixie Chicks who were essentially blackballed out of the country industry a long time ago for saying the truth that George Bush was a garbage president it's interesting that Taylor kind of loops back around gives then that co-sign lets them out of track because she was once a part of the section of the music industry they were booted from and the chicks contributions to this track are actually quite nice the lovely vocal harmonies the fiddle the plucky acoustics but what stuns ultimately about this track are Taylor's lyrics on the song which are introduced to her mother battling cancer she doesn't give a whole lot in terms of personal details on this struggle that her and her mother her family are going through and I understand that but she does in a very relatable way go over the extreme uncertainty and the fear of losing someone so important to her the track false God sort of succeeds where the song the archer miserably failed in that it's trying to create a somewhat Spacey linear synth backed meditation of a song this one featuring a bit of saxophone that's quite tasteful really what ruins the track for me is that it fails to stick the landing on the very fizzled out ending after this point though is when things really begin to go downhill we have the track afterglow which stylistically is everything we have heard up until this point to some degree or another but now it's attached to a much less memorable song the track it's nice to have a friend is a total throw away at best it is a song that should have been on a bonus deluxe version of the album as an extra track an example of one of a few songs here that could have been cut from the record entirely especially given that the instrumental sounds unfinished this is like a rough idea for a song you would bring to the studio to retool into something bigger then there's the barely passable closer which should have been a much bigger and a more exciting finish but it wasn't I will say lover certainly exceeded my expectations and I think there are more enjoyable tracks than there are bad ones here but this album really is its own worst enemy because if you expelled the worst had most underwhelming songs on this entire album you would potentially have Taylor's best record to date but as it currently stands lover is a powerful and a righteous feminine that is wearing a way too bulky the suit of armour that prevents her from moving as gracefully as she could I'm feeling a light 6 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did

NSCQQpdLg3E,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week I know this one's a little late like 12 hours late than it usually is but I had a late night just got back from the mini tour that I did that's all said and done with went really well thank you to everyone for coming out first of course I want to give a shout out before we get too deep into this video to our sponsor the good people over at the ridge as always they make

down there especially that turntable lab link use it get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kick back from it supports the channel supports the segment and yeah as long as a that's a that's understood and I've said everything that I need to say which I did we can just get into the tracks which are also linked down below so if you have a curiosity of any of the songs that I've talked about in this segment again it's all down there if you want to see it hear it anything alright worst tracks of the week we have a couple not too many much more many more good tracks this week that left a positive impression on me but first let's let's get through these first off of course we have the new Tom MacDonald song I'm sorry the white boy is back and he is cringe Lee wrapping through what's essentially is his own anime villain arc continuing to couch himself is like this guy who people don't like because he's just telling it like it is man that's just his opinion bro he's just telling it like it is bro and yeah essentially coming out here saying I'm sorry for this I'm sorry for that I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not sorry for anything that's that's essentially the the gist of the song not one of his better tracks that weird line about breaking like pottery was a kind of out of nowhere and a little cringe moving out from there Liam Gallagher is latest ballad one of us is super bland easily the most boring of his forthcoming record didn't really get much out of it just thought I could have used a bit more oomph I guess and also the new the new I'll say track so if you're heavy into this projects particular brand of very bland atmospheric ultra clean black metal which it's it's progressively gotten there there's a lot of earlier stuff from this project that I think is quite good and and easily some of the most notable work in the atmospheric black metal genre but the newest stuff over here is just sounding bland bland bland protection is the name of this new track and I am just not into it whatsoever alright let's get into the track so I thought where meThe not blown me away but certainly worth mentioning worth shouting out we have this new track from vince staples which is attached to the start of what i imagine is going to be an ongoing video series the vince staples show in this first episode he gets into a brawl into a battle violent back and forth in a barbershop and it's got some funny parts in it the track is a banger but pretty short not a whole lot about it that's anchoring me to it or anything like that it's kind of cool while it's on we also have tonari when they are back the Touareg rock band the the desert blues the desert rock outfit they are back the algerian group they're back with another record with another song they've been plugging away for a long time for a long long time my problem personally is that a lot of their records do tend to kind of run the same course but you know I thought this song was was pretty interesting music video is super compelling almost like a documentary style in a way and figured the song would be worth pointing out and shouting out for anybody who's unfamiliar with the band and their work because certainly there's some people will be wowed by this you know who have never heard of this group before and I know I know I certainly was when I was first introduced to their work I having been familiar with their stuff a while this particular song isn't blowing me away or anything but you know if you're looking to kind of step outside of your comfort zone you get get out of the the the doldrums of pop music from the West and you know just basically English music and that sort of thing give it a try give it a shot it's really cool it's really a mysterious and meditative and it's got a great vibe to it as the band's tracks typically do alright moving out from there that dog just heard this track from this band that I guess I've been unfamiliar with just I guess not aware of up until this point if you just didn't do it it's a pretty badass 90s rock throwback with some some what yeah like sassy vocals with a lot of attitude that I liked quite a bit decent production too and solid tune at the core of all of it give it a shot we also have sob RBE with a new banger with that classic Bay Area sound and those really really ain't great vocals that they do a lot of their tracks it's not bad it's not bad just nothing you know new for the group or anything like that but if you really fuck with this sound if you really mess with this sound give it a shot we also have Missy Elliott with a brand new single iconology EP I believe is out now the name of this new track over here which is attached to an amazing music video is throw it back I was a little weirded out by the production and the vocals on this song in some respects it feels like stereotypical trap and Missy Elliott's vocals do seem a little out of character and subdued usually she's a lot more kind of animated in her songs but but but but but but there is something very weird and subversive about the space and the atmosphere around everything on the song like it's very minimal in a weird way and I appreciate that about it and I thought some of her lyrics were a kind of funny and clever too I loved that Missy is continuing you to put out you know that unique energy that she typically has across her entire career moving on from there we have Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth Fame and this new track over here sketch artist intrigued me quite a bit it was a weird crossroads between like noise and industrial and art pop music with very strange breathy vocals I can't say that it like blooby blew me away but it's it's definitely a change of pace for stuff I've heard from Kim in the past and I don't know it could be an interesting direction to head down so Kim Gordon if you're looking for something that has a bit of a rough edge to it and is a little out there give it a shot give it a try we also have this new song from George's Smith featuring burna boy which I thought you know it's it's certainly better than some of the stuff off her last LP there the instrumental is more of a pulse to it vocals more animated but but Smith just still does not really stand out to me as a vocalist I mean undoubtedly she is talented on the songwriting front but her voice just does not really stick out to me all that much in a lineup unfortunately you know maybe another song in the future will end up being what was me but this this one was not bad and certainly to me felt more engaging than a lot of her stuff off of her last record also what we have over here is this new song from the singing songwriting duo known as first aid kit if you like their vocally doubled tight acoustic somewhat dramatic balladry you will undoubtedly like this song as well not one of my favorite tracks they ever come out with but certainly doing well enough in that typical first aid first aid kit style we also have this new cut over here from dive I believe it is taker and unfortunately not really stunned by this one to the degree that I would have liked to have been it's also a kind of a stylistic change for the band as well because the music's not feeling as as dream pop influenced it feels like it's a bit more shoegaze E with an alternative rock edge to it a bit more into the performance but I thought the songwriting and the vocals were a little bland but if you like your rock music and your indie chand generally washed out with a lot of effects a lot of layers a lot of space give it a shot you know I mean when for that kind of thing the sounds have really got to be on point the songwriting has got to be really really be on point for me that wasn't really the case here but you know it wasn't bad it wasn't bad also what we have over here is a song from the 13 reasons why soundtrack the Netflix original series it's a track from none other than Charli XCX it is a solo subdued ballad that doesn't blow me away as much as her recent singles with star-studded collaborations laced into them but it's not a bad one it's not a bad one still delivers Charlie's typically futuristic brand of pop music and for some people that's gonna be enough and we also have a trio of artists here Alvarado coy this joinin and to Marilla Marilla or Maria I'm sorry uh I'm not pronouncing that correctly I suck I'm not good at pronouncing names this has been well-established at this point but these guys have come together as a trio of pretty talented musicians that we're talking a pianist a saxophone player and a singer who is most well known in the world of tango music and it's it's a very interesting mix of jazz music of Latin music of a avant-garde as well it's it's quite beautiful I recommend that you give it a shot it's a pretty interesting track with a winding progression and a lot of interesting interplay between these three incredibly talented musicians it's very elegant it's very refined and sweet on the ears so give it a shot give it a try all right let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the best best best best best ones which one's really left an impression on me let's go first off we have this new track Tampa Bay bust down featuring chief key from mr. young gravy and also y2k is on the track too it is a country rap banger since that is now the thing with Old Town Road kind of crawling down the charts slowly now it's it's sorry guys it happened it was number one and now it's gone now it's down but still I think we are seeing the lasting effects of that popping out in songs like these and it's it's not bad it's a fun song it's definitely one of the recent tracks from young gravy that I could kind of take seriously and the chief keef performance isn't too bad on here either all right we also have the 1975 over here the 1975 and the band is coming through with a brand new single and it is a rager title people it is super aggressive it's explosive in fact I would say it's it's pretty much like a post hardcore song from the 2000s if you're heavy into refused bands like that III think you're gonna be heavy into this I think you're gonna be heavy into this there are some elements of the songwriting that I thought felt a little deja vu or generic considering that I'm already very much familiar with some of the artists and the style that they're pulling from in this track but again goddamn is this performance and everything explosive it's really just insane and off-the-wall definitely one of the gutsiest songs the 1975 has ever come out with and uh kudos to them for doing so and it'll it'll be interesting to to see because I have not tracked it exactly yet what some of the most hardcore fans are thinking about this very aggressive change in sound I'm not anticipating this is going to be like the future of the band or anything like that most likely this track is going to be a one-off much like many of the other genres and styles that the band will kind of embark on or give a try here and there but it's a really interesting to see that bands like the 1975 feel the freedom and also the acceptance amongst their fans to be able to jump outside so far outside of their comfort zone and do something that people just really do not expect whatsoever so 1975 people here we also have a brand new song from none other than country artist Sturgill Simpson who is also changing pace a little bit on this one too I mean Sturgill Simpson has always been a country artist who has been outside of the typically mainstream country industry doing his own thing fusing the genre with soul and blues and rock music going really old-school with his last full length record on this track over here he's kind of given to some lowdown dirty riffs some really heavy production it's it's it's certainly not a metal song it's certainly not like an alternative rock song but it's it's really on that edge it's really badass in that way I mean the guitars are crushing the drum beats are hitting hard and his vocals are in your face their distorted there's a lot of attitude it's it's pretty cool it's pretty cool change of pace I mean I anticipate this will be just a bit of a one-off in his very diverse catalogue of songs and he'll embark on other musical adventures but it's cool that he can attempt something of this style and really come out ahead on it so shout out to Sturgill good man good man screaming females have a new project coming out yeah this thing is titled singles - it's essentially gonna be early 7 inches and digital b-sides and extras and that sort of thing and the song Let Me In has been out and about it's nothing brand-new from the band but it does kick ass and it's a good track and it's really fun and screen females are one of the best underground rock bands out there so give them your support give them your ears they're really quality band with great playing one of the most unique singers and guitarists in the underground and it's awesome that they've been able to do what they've been doing for so many years it's a you know really kind of veterans at this point I'll say moving on from there we have a brand new track as well from Muramasa collaborating with none other than Claro on this banger of a track with a Claro delivering some pretty above-average vocals on here some of the vocals really underwhelmed me on her last full-length LP but her singing was it was quite good on this new one and I thought that the instrumental really kind of lit up the whole energy of the song because there are some parts of it that are they're quite explosive liked it quite a bit we have a new lizzo remix over here with the baby so it's essentially a de baby remix so if you're a big fan of the baby is a rapper or a lyricist and you love Liz OHS truth hurts give it a shot give it a listen you will love it we also have Lana Del Rey who is back with two brand new spankin brand new tracks that she has sort of like compiled into the same music video we have the song where where are we here here we go fuck it I love you and the greatest fuck and I love you is pretty enchanting it's very spacious it's very pretty Lana's vocals are a bit more expressive and I like that I like that a lot the greatest instrumentally is a bit more grand in comparison not sure what else to say other than that I'm actually legitimately excited for this Lana record I have been enjoying enjoying a majority of these songs leading up to this album Norman fucking Rockwell which the only thing I don't like about it so far is how goofy the album cover is but you know I will I will totally swap that for some songs that I enjoy so I don't know I think I think I think I'm gonna like this Lana record it's possible it's possible I'm gonna be shocked I will be I will be effing shocked if that's how it goes down but if if that's where we that's where we end up that's where we end up that's where we end up we have a couple of tracks but one that really stood out to me from an upcoming compilation of singers and songwriters covering Tom Waits songs women sing Waits if anybody has been watching this channel for a while by now you should know that Tom Waits is easily one of my favorite songwriters I love and own a great majority of the man's catalogue used to own if not all of his albums at one point and when I was like in college a Tom Waits superfan and usually am pretty unimpressed and bored by a majority of Tom Waits covers that have been out there so far I do find a lot of these song choices on some of these projects to be really disappointing too as they tend to favor more the earlier portion of his discography where it's not so kooky it's not so animated it's not so wild however I'm happy to hear that that has changed a little bit on this nuke on this new compilation we have courtney marie andrews again a couple of tracks will come out from this thing so far but this is the one that stood out to me as as be pretty fantastic she's covering downtown train track off of rain dogs and yeah I love the way that the her voice and the piano rolls off the beat on this one love the way the groove builds up on the chorus it's a really fantastic energy and really I guess captures the magic of the song while bringing some more organic instrumentation that doesn't sound as dated and as 80s because frankly as much as I do love Tom Waits the production on that track does ruin it for me a little bit because it is so stereotypical for the time that it came out of and and what I love so much about Tom Waits is how how anachronistic and how unique his music sounds in the time period in which he was recording it sounds completely like from another world and another time you know you're you'd be surprised that a lot of his records are coming out of the 80s and out of the 70s it's it's quite crazy but still having said that really loving again the instrumental take on this track loving Andrews voice on this track so you know it's again it's rare that I do love a Tom Waits cover and this one just happened to be very very good can't guarantee I'm working on a review for this or anything but I can say that I will definitely be anticipating this compilation I will be giving it a try certainly as a as a Tom Waits fan all right here we have also poppy coming through with a brand new track singer songwriter collaborator with Titanic Sinclair also visual artists and Internet icon maybe cult leader too maybe not even real poppy may in fact not even be real she could just be a hologram she could just be a simulation we have no idea we have no clue nope no proof of Poppy's existence up until this point truly and honestly but but still she has come through with a brand new track and it would seem that she is continuing down this road where she is bringing her particularly bright and futuristic and snappy brand of pop music together with heavier styles of rock music and metal music in this new song over here concrete doesn't so much see her going the hardcore or the new metal route like she was on her past couple of tracks that were in this vein to me the the meld of pop in the meld of metal on this track read more like a like a fusion of j-pop and and metal from Japan as well it's kind of like a babymetal type thing and it's not bad it's a great energy I like the transition from the sweeter to the heavier push portions of the track Papi's voice sounds fantastic on the song to really love the production and the music video is immaculate and super creative as well so really liking this really liking it quite a bit shout out to poppy for uh for continuing to innovate in this in this weird cross-section of sounds and styles continuing forward no halo new track from Brock Hampton that I gave a full length track of u2 on the Fantana channel we will link you to that down below so you can check it out for yourself it's not bad it's not bad I'm not gonna go too deep into it as I'm going to review ginger very soon but I like it quite a bit like quite a bit we also have the biggest banger off of the new Bat For Lashes LP nearly every song from this album has underwhelmed me to a degree but if you do like electro pop that is a little dark is a little moody give this one a shot this new track over here is titled Jasmine okay and that has been the weekly track roundup everyone that has been the weekly track roundup you are the best we will make sure to keep doing these every week more on time now that I don't have a tour coming up or anything nothing to distract me from doing what I gotta do to pump out that content and yeah we will see you guys in the next review in the next video love you love you love you remember all the songs and everything that we just talked about are linked down below so you can check them out for yourself and the ridge of the ridge of the ridge okay okay Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
QDGMikSzoHE,hi everyone big DT 10 of your the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the news sleater-kinney album the center won't hold this is the newest full-length LP from legendary punk and indie rock outfit sleater-kinney who made a pretty commendable comeback about five years ago with the release of their last full length LP no cities to love a record that celebrated the band's tradition of no-frills rock and roll and visceral performances may be pulled back just a little bit on the aggression because you know you you you you got to get the CDs and those NPR tote bags but still overall it was not a bad album but even though I liked this record I was a little surprised to see the band succumb to expectations on this one because easily my favorite sleater-kinney record is their most unorthodox their 2005 album the woods and I'm well aware how around that time in the band's career that record and other things to essentially brought them to the brink the record had essentially been their sudden swan song until they followed it up with that 2014 album years down the road so considering the dark and experimental high point the band left us on with the woods I've always been curious as to what the results would be if they went even further into that direction and it seemed like the possibility of that was becoming a reality with some of the weird promotional imagery being released around this record along with Annie Clark abstain Vincente Fame having her hands in the production on this one and it's been a tumultuous lead-up to the release of this album to say the least some of the teaser tracks have been good some of the teaser tracks have been bad and we also saw the complete departure of longtime drummer Janet Weiss one of the most celebrated drummers in indie rock history she's gone and wants no part of the band's new direction damn my guy damn and honestly that just made me more intrigued because I was sitting here thinking man this albums either got to be really out there or really bad for Janet not to want to have anything to do with it and hearing the final results of this album myself it's it's made okay maybe I guess the worst part of it is there's little to no rhyme or reason or consistency to the record the aesthetics are all over the place the songwriting quality is a crapshoot many of the attempts to step outside of the Bands stylistic comfort zone don't pan out there are moments on this thing that are disappointingly basic the hollow plucky bass notes and shimmery scents and measure drumbeat on the song reach out what what is this is this a Foster the People song you just consciously pulled from one of the stylists and deadest trends in indie rock and I don't know why granted the hook is much better than the verses and very sinister in tone but the squawky wailing difficult to corral in guitar leads that play underneath the chorus just seemed really beneath a band that is typically so methodical and tight the band sounds even more inspired on the song Restless with these very twangy clean guitar chords a hint of reverb to make the chord progression sound a bit more somber and it's not a bad ballad the songwriting actually makes up for how plain the instrumental sounds but sonically the song isn't really up to the standards that made sleater-kinney such an important band to begin with especially when the track just gives up out of nowhere and ends into this awkward tumble just after a very small wash of strings enter into the picture the song ruins is probably the most brooding slow burner on the entire record if there's any song on this album that has Annie Clark's fingerprints all over it it's this one Carrie Brownstein vocals are shouty and dramatic as usual but the leave a light on for you refrains are a bit of a tough sell it gets even tougher as we are introduced to these very drumbeats and constantly growling distorted glitchy bass right I can't even tell what they are they're just constantly going in the background and then on top of this we have all of this ghoulish singing and Halloween sense that just sound like a joke the song love is an interesting change of pace in that I think the writing on this track is just classic Kinney with its their youthful vocals its angular guitar lead but that's changed up a bit as it's matched with these poppy scents and a very upbeat rhythm a set of vocal harmonies as well that seem like something out of an old slits record it's actually one of the few unlikely genre combos on this thing that really work also love the track can I go on despite how poppy the backing instrumentation is the beat and bass line sounded like something out of an old 60s girl group song but the band consciously subverts that style in a very post punky way with these very squawky and grading guitar leads and carrie brownstein voices all contorted and shouty kind of beating on your ear drums for Slater Kenney bad dance sounds uncharacteristically edgy it's got this super dark and dramatic tone it's like they're trying to stick to their indie rock roots but pull off their own version of I don't know an imagined dragon the song like believer the future is here is sadly one of the few moments in the sleater-kinney discography where i can not stand the lyrics at all it's basically a Luddite Schley meant about feeling lonely in the information age which granted is an issue but boiling it all down to little glowing screens for sleater-kinney is kind of reductive as a great deal of this record is sad to say from the trying to hard to sound tortured intro on this thing to the very very very tedious piano ballad that it finishes with yes there are a few bright spots on this record here and there the track hurry on home is another moment that sounds like classic Kenny but with some added atmosphere and epic vocal harmonies it sounds bigger tougher stronger we also have the chorus to the dog the body which kicks quite a bit of ass too but generally this thing is a very unfocused ungroomed and unfulfilled project the band puts out some of their worst material yet I do get the genuine feeling that they were trying to do something different and we're really reaching out there taking a risk and I appreciate that that's not always a bad thing but sadly a majority of what the band was attempting here didn't quite work out in my view I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

Puf8WJjnS4I,hi everyone sweaty wet tan I'm here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album in best the rat's nest hi this is the latest full-length album from Australian rock band king gizzard and the lizard wizard and at this point I am afraid to call them anything but a rock band I mean maybe even that at this point because with each new album the band's sound becomes increasingly more difficult to pin down from modernized blends of psychedelic rock and garage to electro boogie woogie blues the band has covered more musical bases in 10 years than most groups do in 30 and King gizzard continues to expand their repertoire with the release of infest the rat's nest as this is their first foray into thrash metal yes thrash metal and even though King gizzard is not formally a metal band they have somehow come up with one of the better and more pleasing metal releases of the year because rat's nest isn't just some nerdy parody of thrash metal slapped together by a band who has no clue what they're doing king gizzard appears to not only have an appreciation for the stuff but also a lot of reverence too and I would say even by the more stringent standards of thrash metal this record does pass the smell test it's got those technical solos speedy chugging riffs wild pentatonic bass licks some gruff lead vocals too however this album is not a top-down transition of king gizzard sound entirely there are quite a few gizzard isms if you've been listening to the band's records up until this point that make their way into this record that gives it at least a bit of a similarity to much of what they've been doing up until this point the vocals are a little campy and the way you might expect on a gizzard album the recording has this brittle rough vintage aesthetic to it indicative of a time even before thrash metal its anachronistic in that sense but in a way a continued appreciation for the era of hard rock and psychedelic rock and garage that obviously inspires much of what king gizzard does there are also some very trippy and freakish delays and sound effects worked into various parts of the song - it would not be a king gizzard album without some zaniness and studio trickery and of course it wouldn't be a Ghiz album without at least some kind of concept to it as yes the concept of this project runs much deeper than it's simply being an embrace of thrash metal infest the rat's nest is somewhat of an environmentalists sci-fi epic in a way not entirely surprising considering some of the conservationist themes that turned up on their last full length LP fishing for fishies but what infest the rat's nest is trying to achieve as much grandeur in scope and comes along with a legit narrative the tone of the lyrics generally on this thing are a lot more dystopian - as indicated by the opening track planet be open your eyes and light the fluid get into the petrol siphon low on meals browning fields bury children urbanization scarification population Exodus there is no planet be open your eyes and see so the world is dying there is this need for people to leave but there is no planet B as this is the only planet that we have now if this were reality our planet dying and us dying with it would be the end of the story but because this album is somewhat of a fantastical adventure it goes on as the story on this thing develops into a futuristic disaster piece of greed and disease as well as space travel the song Mars for the rich is essentially about the rich leaving Earth going to Mars to live a better life for themselves leaving all the poor people to toil back on the blue planet the lengthiest track on this LP is seven minutes which is pretty huge for this album because it's just 35 is the song superbug a track that's essentially about a horrible disease that is unstoppable by medicine or antibiotics just ravaging the people of Earth all of this hell on earth leads a ton of people to leave the planet those who have the ability to anyway so they're exploring space looking for a new place to exist and they eventually find themselves burning up in space and then they end up down in hell as you would in that scenario so while the narrative of this thing is pretty short it is dark it is bold it is brutal it is unforgiving and in many respects the sound is 2 again with the track planet be the demonic growls all over that song there is no planet baby the searing distorted guitar riffs the warm bass that really pops in the mix I wish the drums did have more presence but the balance of instrumentation isn't too much unlike classic thrash album from the 80s though the drum solo at the start of self-immolate is pretty insane but even though King gizzard does a great job of sticking to traditional thrash aesthetics there is a grime eNOS a slime eNOS to it that you get on most King gizzard albums that does make it feel familiar does make it feel specific to them as a band it's also worth noting that compositionally the band comes up with some pretty interesting and creative phases to work through each track here even the shorter tracks on this thing are pumped with ideas and incredibly fulfilling they sound good too like with the track oregon farmer the way the song pumps through these very crunchy fast riffs it's almost reminiscent of the time the misfits the misfits tried their hand at a thrash metal a little bit on their earth ad record I also love the way the band built out longer moments on this thing like super bug which has a lot of very slow do me at least for the 70s riffs that have a bluesy overtone to them some Tony Iommi esque hammer-ons and pull-offs coming out of the guitars too it's very very Black Sabbath I also love the sped up classic rock and roll riffs on Mars for the rich - the way that the track grooves at very fast pace it's almost Motorhead inspired the song perihelion is tasked with one of the catchiest choruses and melodic choruses on the entire record and riffs that are some of the most oddly grooved out on the entire album even weirder though is the song self Emily which on the surface might sound like a very typical thrash metal song but listen to how the riffs are counted out on the track because they're always shifting with each bar as the drums that are pretty constant seem to be hitting a different groove pocket again with each bar shifting over as this riff is changing ever so subtly and generally this is the world of king gizzard the band always makes sure to work in these weird little ideas experiments in Easter eggs and record almost into each track to make every experience listening to them special in some way so there are a lot of great songs there are a lot of fantastic ideas packed into this album and it is explosively tight at 35 minutes I think my biggest issue with the album as it currently is like with many stories is the ending it just feels like so much loss potential for the album to end in this way in such a non detailed way but from what is here it's not much of a stretch to realize that the band may be referencing the rich living on Mars and they're being sent to attack them because if these people are going to hell and then coming back to exact revenge against the elites who ruined their planet in the first place why shouldn't that part be as gruesome as every other part on the record let's see some heads rolling and to bring the point home even further the band released a video game in tandem with their newest record over here it's online it's on a website it is a first-person shooter you can access it at Mars for the rich calm and the gameplay is pretty much shooting a swarm of rats so yeah the rich are rats and sure some of the riffs on this thing are a tad bit generic but I see this album as more of an artistic homage to thrash not really the band trying to reinvent the wheel and for what few moments on this record that there are where I think the band could have shot for more originality generally the concept the production and the sheer songwriting talent shown throughout the entire LP that is enough to make up for that and then some there are times when I do wish that rat's nest was a bit more robust narrative Lee and adventurous sonically but god damn this thing is still a really great record and easily one of the most fun and throttling projects the band has drawn up so far I'm feeling a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video for you to check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana King gizzard forever

1T3nfsE3CcU,uh-uh it is hot it is it is a humid day everyone it's a humid day here at needle drop HQ I hope all y'all are doing well it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week I'm doing it moist so what's let's get into it all right all right all right all right first of course I want to shout out the the sponsors for this video good people over at the ridge they make these nifty metal plated wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket join the minimalist wallet revolution today with the greatest minimalist wallet salesman in the world use the link down below promo code Mellon 10% off also we have our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there too if you want to use those and let's get straight into the worst tracks of the week we have a few and we actually have we have a lot more tracks that I thought were in the best category this is a very big week a lot of a lot of tracks dropped and there are a lot of songs I loved this week and I'm gonna highly recommend a lot of tracks to you so pay attention and remember all of these tracks are linked down below so you can try them for yourselves okay so first song and the worst category ended up being oh this new Miley Cyrus track slide away the beat on this track is trash garbage garbage percussion on this track it sounds really cheap sounds thrown together it came off as if Miley had written a ballad and came up with all this really glamorous lavish instrumentation to accompany it and then after the fact it was like okay we need to add a beat there needs to be some kind of pulse to this thing so let's just throw a few drums behind it that sound like ish and we'll just leave it at that did not care for it did not care for it at all not looking forward to her new EP to say the least also thought a lot of the lyrics on this track just the way that Miley addresses addiction to me is just very shallow there are much more compelling songs out there about such things and partying and substance abuse that I would much rather listen to we also have this new track from lightning bolt one of my favorite noise rock acts of all time they have a new album on the way wasn't super crazy about their last record but thought they might bounce back with a brand new project the teaser song over here air conditioning is super plain for a lightning bolt song compositionally the vocals are way more clean than I would have liked them to be and on top of it the worst thing about this track truly and honestly is and I assume this will be different when I actually hear the entire record and it hits streaming services but what is the sound quality of this song on Bandcamp it's on Bandcamp I can't really find it anywhere else right now I'm not hearing it anywhere else other than VanCamp and it sounds like the nastiest most disgusting lowest resolution mp3 that they could muster just uploaded onto band camp the cymbals and the guitar distortion a rather the bass distortion because lightning bolt is drums and bass the the bass distortion sound awful they'd kind of melt into each other in a really wishy-washy way that you would get out of like a 96 K and p3 it sounds like garbage let's let's hear a higher quality version of this please girl band a lot of people have been hyping this record in a few of the teaser tracks from it up I myself have enjoyed some of the Bands earlier material this new one over here shoulder blades does have elements of genres that I enjoy there are some elements of industrial some elements of noise rock you could say that it moves slowly in broods and throbs in the way maybe even a daughter's song might however I feel like girl band really just like what their last record does not push the intensity of their performances far enough so that what they're doing is actually thrilling it's it's like they're just always setting a tone and it never really reaches that climax point and that truly makes all of these darker spots the track kicks off with worth it so yeah just not really that deeply into it girl band in my view just has this common problem of coming up with some interesting ideas and there's letting them stagnate in the song to the point where they become uninteresting where they really shouldn't be because I do think they do draw up some some compelling sounds and do go into some dark spaces with their music but it's like they just don't go far enough it's like they dip their toes and turn back moving out from there also we have the song from Boris over here love this will be the last song in here and yes this is this is a Boris track the Japanese everything band we've done everything from drone doom to pop music at this point this new one over here does see the band going into doom ear and droney or territory though but however the vocals they laid all over this track are terrible I cannot even stand to listen to it for more than a few minutes I mean I love the guitar sound and I love what maybe conceptually the band is trying to pull off here but the way they work the vocals into this track is absolutely unbearable I could not get through it and I don't know I am curious to see where exactly the band goes with their newest effort here maybe there will be other songs along these lines that end up panning out but I cannot say I was a fan of this one truly and honestly alright moving on to the tracks that I thought we're a little underwhelming but still worth pointing out still worth shouting out you might dig them a little bit more than me we have this new collaborative cut over here between girl talk and young new D no problem it is a trap banger if you like young nudies rapping which I'm not typically a big fan of I'm usually more of a fan of girl talks work and the beat does go hard on this one you'll most likely like it you know again beat bangs and if you're a young nudie fan you will dig it we also have some thrash some crossover thrash from toxic Holocaust who have not come out with a record in a while primal future 2019 is the name of this new one and this track over here chemical warlords is a dystopian badass riff heavy fast-paced thrash rager with a bit of an old-school sheen on it Slater Kenny have come out with a new track there their new album is officially out you know I'm not going to talk too much about it because I'm gonna try to review their latest LP here produced by st. Vincent of all people gonna try to give this album a review this week and I'm not gonna go too deeply into my thoughts on this as you'll be hearing my full opinions on this new record very soon also chicheng latest single from pop artist Slater it is a little goofy some of the lyrics are ridiculous and worth an eyebrow razor too but the beat does go hard and obviously it's it's trying to be playful I mean if you want to hear a colorful banger about money that's not trying to take itself too seriously give it a try give it a shot moving on from there shura for EV her is the name of her new record it is out now this week I haven't been super head over heels for a lot of the dreamy synth pop sounds coming out of this record but I know there are some people in my audience who kind of go for that sort of thing this latest song over here skyline be mine is an incredibly lavish cut with lots and lots and lots of lush lush lush layers of instrumentation if you love your ballots to be slow burners and kind of grow in a very slow progression and reach a pretty in Bella ping euphoric climax give this track a try I mean I didn't find a lot of the synth tones or the vocals to be all that distinct but I have to admit the progression and the final moments of the track are pretty pillowy and beautiful moving on from there we have a new cut from Rosalia and Ozuna and collaborative song oops will hit the desk over there that's a pretty glossy sensual reggaeton with some tasteful instrumentation on it I didn't think the hook hit all that hard but still vocals instrumental incredibly tasteful and if you want to vary up your listening this week with a bit of again a reggaeton worldly pop then give it a shot moving on from there legendary shoegaze the outfit ride they are back with a new song this one over here is a very light piece of dreamy rock music that passes by it a pretty breezy pace nothing all too gripping in this room is the name of the song you know give it a shot if you're nostalgic for this era if you're just looking to keep up with groups that are still putting out music from that time and we also have Nikki of 88 rising fame who has a new collaborative cut out with 88 rising the name of this new one over here is indigo and it's a cool little blend of pop music and R&B music with a banger bead attached to it her vocals over this instrumental are pretty sweet and elegant I would say that the track really does lack a bit of an edge though you know I think it could have had a stronger instrumental I think there her vocal performance at some points could have been a bit stronger too I think the beat is a bit samey without doing too much in terms of really taking a risk it's busy it's very busy it hits hard it's bass it's very percussive but um I don't there's something about it that just felt like it was holding back a little bit you know and I did tend to enjoy a lot more of the intimate songs that did land on Nikki's last EP however she does transition into more rhythmic and and more pop influenced sounds like she's pursuing on this new single over here it could be good it could be a good change of pace for her and exhumed a famed death metal gore grind crossover thrash that they've done a lot of things over the course of their career which has been very long they have a new record on the way track out another dose of thrash essentially on this new track over here is this is a one of their songs one of the records that seem like they're in more of a nostalgic thrash tone the name of this one over here is ravenous cadavers so kind of like that b-movie thrash music here you're gonna dig on this one and Chelsea Wolfe has come through with another music video and ballad from her forthcoming LP and yeah yeah at this point I would say it's pretty much been confirmed this is going to be an acoustic record this is going to be a ballad based acoustic album which is again not necessarily a bad thing Chelsea has made acoustic music before that I have enjoyed and reviewed positively however I would say what kept back on this track though is that I thought this song at the core of it was really underwhelming not really a track I found myself humming or entranced or enticed by in any sort of way I did love some of the grand swells of instrumentation that hit it pivotal points of the song that certainly sounded awesome that felt great but as far as Chelsea's vocals and the guitar chord progression it just fell very flat for me just fell very flat and we also have another single from the new upcoming Charli XCX record she's been dropping a lot of singles with collaborators to kind of bring forward the buzz raise the profile get more people interested this latest one over here features sky ferreira it's a bit of a clunky tune maybe a song that in the context of the record could grow on me a lot more you know it's it's definitely not as powerful or as immense as the Christine and the Queen's track that was amazing that was a showstopper that was like a religious fucking experience this one over here not quite as much but again even if there were some elements of it that did underwhelm me I think that it's it's a track I could see myself liking a little bit more once a once the records finally out potentially and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best tracks of the week there are quite a few there are quite a few kicking off over here with this song from Zack fluids featuring Sylvan look you two rappers that are kind of coming together on a futuristic jazz rap vibe they are spitting fast melodic flows the performances are incredible I've been looking for like you to drop a new record but his feature here is very awesome and I don't know I guess through this I'm going to be keeping track of a Zack fluids as well because I enjoy this quite a bit it was a tasteful song with great vocal chemistry and we also have this guy's a bit of a new find here someone online turned me on to his music he goes by the name excuse me here but this is his name this is a stage name okay excuse me this is the man's stage name this is his artist moniker but he goes by the name of wetback Manny and he has a song out by the name of fuck ice and I I really don't know what to tell you it's a banger it's a banger man it's a banger it's got those awesome violins work there you know fiddles worked into the instrumental it's got that uh that Houston beat it's it's it's real tex-mex mix you know what I mean and and Manny's lyrics are hilarious you know he's just like bringing that fuck ice energy which is exactly what I think we need right now frankly all right moving from there Vivian girls the noise rock noise pop trio Vivian girls they are back a new record on the way memory you guys should know by now they've been broken up or disbanded for a little while but it seems like they're they're back at it musically and this is not the first song they've dropped from this forthcoming record but I've enjoyed this one as well something to do is the name of it and yeah you know this is this to me is pretty much along the same lines as the last song and what I liked so much about the last track is that it pretty much embodied the sweet noisy somewhat abrasive and I guess I guess kind of lacks a day's achill vibe that that made the band's debut album so cool so enjoyable so fun so so just making you want to get up and bounce around digging this one quite a bit digging it quite a bit here we go we also have uh-oh TK meizu meizu meizu open pronouncing that - that name correctly TK might say she is an Australian rapper who I've been conscious of for quite some time like some songs off her last LP which actually I think killer Mike was on that record she has a new single out featuring JPG mafia and this song over here is essentially about I I identify with it very deeply and not not being all that good at sleeping being up late being a bit of a night owl maybe even insomniac I don't know but it's it's a banger man the beat is awesome TK has won for best vocal performances heard so far having jpg mafia on this track was a genius move I love that Peggy is doing so many collaborations he's finding himself in so many different contexts these days he's in high demand and I love that I love that he's answering the call I love that he's giving great performances here I love that he's bringing his energy to this track and I love the Tk herself seems to be leveling her music because this is a crazy-ass song but I think more people need to hear you know this is this this should be everybody's you know you if you're on the internet if you're on social media and like midnight or 1 a.m. hits you should see people posting this song in every fuckin direction here's my jam its toots to AM it's 3:00 a.m. it's 4:00 a.m. I'm not I haven't gone to sleep yet here's my gin this is what this is my jam I'm awake that's that's what I'm saying it's it's the awake anthem it's the awake anthem Taylor Swift has dropped the title track to her new full-length album lover I did a full-length review of it over on the Fantana channel and I actually enjoyed it I liked it it was a sweet ballad it was a tasteful instrumental with a beautiful climactic finish there were some underwhelming parts at the start sure but you know it was a nice mix of guitar and piano and drums and vocals and Taylor just kind of you know flexing those flexing those singer/songwriter muscles one more time you know I don't anticipate too many more tracks like this on her new full-length album but I can at least tell you that I enjoyed this one we also have a few new tracks two more tracks from the forthcoming sandy Alex G albums southern sky and near one's a great ballad the other goes into more of an electronic and expand and an experimental direction embodying some of the weirder sounds and ideas that Alex G fans have been enjoying on his records up until this point it's kind of interesting because I thought that he would avoid ideas like this now that his music seems to be a bit cleaner and more conventional but I'm glad that he's not entirely abandoning some of these more abstract ideas working them into his particular brand of lo-fi pop and singer-songwriter music so yeah liking that digging it definitely anticipating the new Alex G I know people were kind of mad that I didn't dig isn't last full-length LP but Frank I didn't think the record went far enough I think what he's delivering here is much better all right we also have a Michael Kiwanuka who is back who is back I did enjoy some of the songs from his last full-length LP I think the guy's a talented singer and a talented songwriter and this new song over here kind of throws it back it feels like a classic 70s ol tune but the instrumentation is far too odd you know it's it's got an old school production sheen on it you know sounds very vintage but the lyrics the vocal melody and some of the instrumental passages an idea sound very modern and sound very out-there and I don't know I think I think it's an unconventional tune but still has a chance for a pretty wide appeal because it is so unique and it is pretty beautiful and it is pretty stunning shout out to Michael for continuing to do his thing we also have mr. mark kozilek who is out with another track he is essentially in this new song of his reflecting upon the recent string of mass shootings that have rocked America have been all over the news mark as you guys may know up until this point is not shy when it comes to addressing current events and going on about them in these lengthy and lists diatribe like diatribes just set to song and I thought that this latest track over here a where's Gilroy is one of his better as of late in this very rambly long-winded style it's a 15-minute track he goes over a lot of different passages thematic passages musical passages it's a long multifaceted song not catchy in any respect more of a meditation than anything but in my view if you are a kozilek fan if you've been following his stuff up until this point still very compelling still very compelling alright we also have this new song over here from kitten Memphis brand new single and yeah this is one of the more I guess sweet and catchy tracks the band is dropped in awhile it's a bit of an oddball song for them it's sort of dreamy a little nostalgic feels like some alternative rock mixed with pop with some pretty pillowy instrumentation and production a lot of vocals that are spoken very subdued I would say there's something about the track and maybe this is a bit of a mark against it that feels like it's trying really hard it's pandering to an audience as it's trying to be as relatable as possible and really hit audiences with this like sense of nostalgia for an era that many of them may have not really lived through even been that conscious through as a very young child but still I mean despite the weird Averell references and the geographical placements that try to give the song a sense of place that just seemed like a little too obvious or on the nose I still thought it was a smart play 'fl catchy track that definitely shows the band kind of veering outside of their comfort zone a little bit so I did like that thought it was a good song it's down below with every other track give it a try give it a shot we also have over here this brand new song for mr. jpeg mafia Peggy is back damn Peggy you think you know me yes I did a full length through Eve that I did a full length review of this one as well excuse me over on the Fantana channel too and beyond this one is insane Peggy's sung vocals on this track as I H my nose because I am just I'm a sweaty mess I'm a sweaty disgusting mess right now sweaty sweaty sweaty Peggy's some vocals on this track are insane his bars are hard as hell that I already said the beat stuck out but it is weird AF I'm definitely digging what Peggy is starting to deliver I'm I look I I'm determined not to be disappointed with this new full-length album and I say that because Peggy's been kind of teasing to it by saying it disappointed disappointment gonna be disappointed it's it's a it's a clever it's a clever marketing scheme I like it alright we also have Jenny who vol whose latest material has been impressing me more and more and more and more new record on the way and this track over here is is a wonderful robbing electronic driving meditative forward forward forward moving piece of art pop with some vocals that are just otherworldly in my opinion a great atmosphere a great groove hypnotic mystical and I don't know it just just seems like there's some kind of special magic about it that I can't quite explain I like it quite a bit I like it quite a bit we also had this new Adult Swim single from Fetty get Freddie grid Freddie Gibbs and Madlib featuring Ono with some guest production on this thing from professionals it's a great little track obviously not a song that made the latest Freddie Gibbs and mad lib project but still but still I thought it was good give it a try if you liked bandana you're gonna like this also what we have over here is a brand new song from the experimental hip-hop outfit known as clipping the latest song over here is titled nothing is safe and from the promotional material along with the song and from the release date of the album in October it sounds it sounds like a Halloween song it's a Halloween scary story rap song it's are you afraid of the dark sort of experimental hip-hop style Davi digs comes through with some pretty creative flows in order to fit the entire story into the song I will say that I think the tune of the track suffers a little bit because he does try to pack a lot into the song it's really the story that's driving everything and this instrumental is not nearly as experimental as one may expect a clipping instrumental to be because in a lot of respects it's a pretty straightforward trap progression however there are some old-school synths worked in there was a great swell of those on the choruses there is something about the instrumental that to me sounds very very John Carpenter so a bit of a trap vibe bit of a John Carpenter vibe topped with a horrifying story involving death and a lot of blood and guts and I'm not gonna spoil the whole thing because you can read into it as you listen to the track yourself but it is relatively riveting and I'm wondering if if the ideas here are going to expand into a whole new album will the entire album be horror based or inspired I don't entirely know but I do know that the the prospect of that I think the prospect of that would be would be interesting next we have boi by brand new track from Brock Hampton and like this one quite a bit as well not gonna get too deeply into it as the new Brock Hampton record is coming out very soon but I thought that the instrumental was creative vocal and lyrical chemistry they're definitely enjoying what I'm hearing and glad to see that the band are hitting a bit more of a stride with these promotional tracks here we also have a new track from Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes Fame new solo album on the way he loves me if I remember correctly is the name of this new track over here and what struck me the most about this new song over here is that the beat is absolutely huge Basie gigantic I would say a lot of the mixing placements in the song or odd but it doesn't ruin the track it just kind of makes it a bit of a unique experience and even though there is like lots of heavy percussion lots of heavy bass it's an odd sound Brittany's vocals still shined through and it's still a really great little really great song at the end of the day so Brittany Howard proving herself continuing to prove herself as a phenomenal talent here we also have big thief not two hands latest record they are dropping a new album sooner rather than later you guys may still be burned over the last big thief review that I did and that is totally fine you don't have to agree however I did like this new single from them quite a bit I thought that the lead vocals had a lot more kind of frustration to them and a lot more bite to them than some of the stuff that was on the last fourth LP I thought that the raw performance between the drums and the guitars on this track were really enjoyable too so I don't know I mean I'm not expecting a new leaf being turned here or anything but if it's a different album most likely have a different take on it so you know it's still not counting out big thief or anything you know I think they have some good stuff here and there and then this song is certainly impressing me so nah I think it's a great ballad a lot of angular guitars and and very odd vocals on it which just kind of draws attention to how unique the song is yeah not really anything negative to say about this track liking it a lot we also have Alex Cameron who's dropped another new single and this is the first track rooms from his latest full-length album that I'm actually enjoying and it's mostly because the production is not trash the production is not trash there's not like a weird out of place badly produced and mixed and sequence beat hanging in the background pointlessly this one has a good classy classic soft pop rock instrumental that alex has kind of built his name off of not that I think the guy should be doing the same thing forever but it's like some of those more electronic elements he was working into those other tracks not that that couldn't be done well they could but they were executed and inserted in a very ham-fisted way that just made the tracks difficult to listen to this one over here not only comes along with a better instrumental but it's actually a pretty cool concept as Alex is telling a story about a woman I guess who is in control of her own sexuality sexual destiny use uses sex as I guess her profession you know he's talking about her doing porn again and this that and the other thing but he's he's kind of framing it in a very empowering way and you know it's it's it's it's all it's all about love and respecting a workers of all types at the end of the day even sex workers and I dug the song quite a bit you know if I had a good theme thought lyrically it was as clever as usual as you can typically expect from Cameron even when the song or the instrumental is not so hot and and on this one it just happened to be that the instrumental was hot too so and I think that is gonna be the weekly track roundup for this week everybody thank you very much for watching I know it was a lot of songs and it was a lot of tracks a lot of recommendations but still we did have a lot of songs this week that were worth talking about worth mentioning and all of them once more a link down below along with the link to our sponsor good people over at the ridge you already know all right you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best I will talk you in the next video next review next weekly track roundup

CUNeMprEkDA,
Yw86LVY5Ayo,hi everyone why the white Ana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Drake compilation care package Toronto rapper Drake you know him you love him or maybe you don't love him depends on your taste I suppose new compilation of Lucy's that for the most part had not made it onto his core albums quite a bit material here well over an hour extra tracks nah no single songs that have just been floating around on his youtube for years all that stuff presumably we are getting this batch of tracks until Drizzy hands over something that is a bit more substantial hopefully that is sooner rather than later because there is absolutely nothing that is satisfying about him putting out all of these tracks that for the most part have already been circulating around the internet very readily available it seems like the only reason this thing exists is to just put these songs on streaming platforms and that's it I thought it might still be cool though to take a dive into the Drake archives and I'm most mostly I was wrong because god this thing is boring and occasionally even slightly embarrassing there a good chunk of songs here that mostly seem to be very formless where Drake is singing into the abyss over a very blobby atmospheric instrumental tracks that could have either come from the takecare era or the if you're reading this era trust issues my side can i days in the East and Drake does compound a lot of tracks like V's on this comp which essentially causes the listener to tune it out faster than his half-hearted playlist that he dropped in 2017 then again there are tracks on this thing that defer Drake I would imagine at this point would be kind of embarrassing should have really been forgotten with time like the song heat of the moment which features some more very drab Drake escalations over in atmospheric instrumental that features bubble samples why this is easily one of the worst beats Drake has ever son over I would not want to recall it will remind anyone of it ever the song draft day which does feature a pretty lazy Lauren Hill sample that I don't know it I just feel like personally it ruins the song girls love Beyonce which is easily one of Drake's worst tracks ever which is why I figured it didn't really make it on to an album officially the track is absolutely ham-fisted in its interpolation of a classic Destiny's Child hit that it should have not been allowed to repurpose in the first place and then there's the Jodeci freestyle featuring a pre woke Jay Cole where he drops a very insensitive line referencing autism and yes it is censored on this record but still that is a line and this is a track that caused both Drake and Cole to drop public apologies again this is a moment that you would think hey let's let's just let this one just fade away into the ether no one needs to think about it again also in this very subpar collection of tracks are some amazing amazing lyrical Drake isms like on the track Parris Morton music having lunch in debating Ferrari prices 23 and going through a midlife crisis but trust me I'd still deliver like a midwife I still deliver like a midwife that is a Drake line if I have ever heard one of course given that there are so many tracks here there are at least some highlights like 4:00 p.m. in Calabasas 5 a.m. in Toronto but those are probably the best examples of songs on this project that essentially run like the Drake Diaries where he's just going on these stream-of-consciousness Creed's about everything he gets emotional over aka literally everything and there are so many tracks on this project that hit that exact tone to the point where listening to them in a succession just turns them into a near meaningless drone all of the woe is me sadness over extravagance truly does numb the mind it would be another thing if these tracks were balanced out with songs that were maybe more upbeat bangers I don't know but that's just not the case there are some more passable cuts in the tracklist like with Club Paradise as well as free spirit featuring Rick Ross I personally loved the motion a Sam 50 R&B rap fusion from 2013 that is so sweet and catchy I'm actually surprised it hadn't made it onto a Drake record officially in the standard edition I mean there's also the intro track on this thing dreams money can buy which is a big big big Drake throwback where he can be heard rapping over a Jay Paul instrumental a time when Drake was less shy about rapping / beats that were a bit more indie friendly but yeah overall though care package more like that I don't really care all that much package whoo that was funny that was very funny that was very funny that was funny joke that was very funny I like how funny that was that was funny thank you thank you you go boy I'm feeling a decent two strong three on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

UW4pAuwer3o,hi everyone Tannen here the Internet's busiest music bird and it's time for a review of the new Slipknot album we are not your kind this is the sixth studio album from Iowa alternative and new metal showman Slipknot a band that in their prime were easily one of my favorites back when I was in the high school it's been over 20 years since they formed and five since the release of their last full-length record point five the great chapter a record that was quickly dismissed as the worst batch of songs the band has ever pulled together so if Slipknot were to maintain any semblance of a fanbase past this point they need a comeback they need a bounce back they need a record that is a return to form and I think we are not your kind is kind of that a little bit while also pushing the band's sound into new territory on multiple tracks here anybody who grew up listening to Slipknot and didn't fully transition out of their new metal phase it's not a phase mom it's not a phase they know the band's grand opus is 2001 Iowa yes the self-titled record is fantastic but it's all about Iowa which is an absolutely enraged record with relentless riffs demented antisocial lyrics flashy drumming incredible hooks head banging grooves yes while Slipknot does have a very gimmicky look and they don't exactly reflect the complexity of a nine-person band I still think this record has aged much better than most albums in this genre that came out around this time so it's been pretty encouraging to hear the band bring back that classic Iowa intensity a little bit on their newest material on the lead single to this thing unsane to the riffs the drums here even Corey's screamed manic vocals sound like a classic Slipknot rager but the chilling and angelic choral vocals that play throughout the track elevate the song to a new level of drama quarry transitions seamlessly from his usual screams to these clean and thymic choruses I love the descending guitar lines at this point in the track also the subtle touches of industrial metallic percussion that played throughout the song the band is back in full force on this song and the track is way more gratifying than I thought it was on first listen the song Nero Forte also brings thumping pummeling drums all over the track a speedy thrash inspired guitar riff to some devilish vocal harmonies that slip into the song seamlessly I love that this track is a well-oiled machine methodical composition but be steel execution so truly there are some tracks on this record that live up to classic Slipknot standards and even exceed them just a little bit if you like these tracks you'll also get a lot out of red flag critical darling even though the former of those two tracks I see is slipknot painting themselves into a corner a little bit on this one but Slipknot actually spends a fair amount of this record doing things that you would not expect them to do firstly we have the song birth of the cruel which frankly sounds like a corn song just a copy of a late 90s early 2000s corn song from the rhythms to the sour guitar harmonies an even Cory's voice at the start of the song it sounds very Jonathan Davis inspired there's even a point where we have these chugging riffs and Corey is just singing through these clenched teeth again very Cornish don't know what exactly drove the band to want to copy their sound so blatantly sure it's listenable but it's also sort of a head-scratcher there's also some very manic scatting at the end of the track not long for this world but to my ears the corn parallels on this album stop there we've also got the acoustic passages and clean vocals on a liar's funeral which sound very stone sour esque if you've ever heard that Corey Taylor side project you know exactly what I'm talking about it's not that I think this sound is outside of Slipknot's wheelhouse but I would just like it to be because I don't think they pull it off very well it's not my cup of tea however I do love the crushingly heavy choruses on this track and the way that Corey just screams for these moments in the song it is spine tingle I also love the way the band builds up the second half of the track with all these chugging riffs rising and falling guitar tones righteous vocal harmonies it's pretty awesome I could also go on about the tremolo Pickett ours to the soaring solos just know that this is easily one of the most dynamic songs Slipknot has ever recorded and the second half easily makes up for some of the moments in the first that I don't care for the record gets even weirder from here with the band embarking on some of the boldest experiments they ever have in the last leg we have the song spiders which feels like a weird combination of tool Marilyn Manson and a repeating blinky piano phrase that seems inspired by the theme to John Carpenter's Halloween soundtrack maybe the cartoonishly ghoulish synths in the second half are a bit much and the chorus lyrics are trying a little bit too hard to sound spooky but for a song that's so far outside of what Slipknot typically does it's pretty good and could have gone over a lot worse the song orphan kicks off with a pretty epic intro a lot of atmosphere pounding drums before this song even kicked off I was getting this feeling of you know this this sounds kind of Slayer a little rain and blood sounds a little rain in blood ish and of course suddenly the band just busts into the most stereotypically thrash riff I've ever heard in my life a little heavier a little chunkier yes the band also throws some pretty insane wailing guitar noise over various parts of the riff too but yeah it pretty much sounds like Slayer and I would actually like to say it's one of the better tracks on the entire record but it's it's nearly ruined by these god-awful vocal harmonies on the chorus I am not the same you never had a clue knew my name they're not very good at all and why do so many Slipknot songs boil down to the sentiment of oh you don't know me you know fucking know me I guess that's just the way it is sometimes it's okay to feel that way the song might pain is another very low-key moment on the record with lots of subdued sparse sequence beats some Chinese synthesizers - it sounds like something out of a child music box but with Corey of course throwing some very dark brooding lyrics and singing on top it's a little patience testing at 7 minutes though I don't know if the track needed to be this long with as little progression as it has I think the track would have served much better as a shorter interlude and now that I've mentioned interludes I should mention my least favorite thing about this record the interludes truly and honestly they are not very good they are horrible at setting the tone for what's to come and most of them just sound like noisy lo-fi droney baby's first ambient pieces they ruin the flow of the album when they are devoted to an entire track and then there are songs out here where Slipknot is killing off an entire thirty Seconds to a minute of time before or after a song with a flavorless drone with pointless noise there's padding the album or a track out needlessly and look it's not like I would say no to these moments if they were actually great I would not say no to great ambient interludes but they're not Slipknot does save some of the weirdest ideas for last on this record especially on the closer solway firth which is named after an estuary which partially separates and and runs along the border between Scotland and England yes I had to google that and there is a moment on this track for whatever reason quarry just breaks into an English accent he's just screaming in an English accent is he engaging in a bit of roleplay here I'm not sure it's not like the track has a super clear logical flowing storyline not to say that there isn't a focus or a concept to this song there is but there's nothing in the lyrics that would hint to me that I'm about to play a character or change my accent he just does it I don't I do it all day generally though it's a pretty massive closer the guitars and drums maybe a bit stereotypical for Slipknot but it is heavy as hell I also love the dissonant shots of noise throughout the track also these couple of passages that sound like they're submerged underwater it's a bit of ear candy all in all though I think this album is a pretty solid effort Slipknot there are some experiments and weird ideas that don't quite pan out a few tracks the feel very run-of-the-mill for them but there are tons of highlights throughout this hour Plus album I think generally it would have fared a bit better if the interludes were of a higher quality but I seriously have to commend the band on this one this came out much better than I thought it was going to I'm feeling a strong six to a lay seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

uo6oJFhvW3s,hi everyone rock that he ban Chado here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Swain album negative space this is the second full-length album from Netherlands rock band Swain at least their second album since changing their name to Swain they were at one time a heavy-ass hardcore band that went by the name of this routine as hell their 2013 record Howell absolutely floored me was one of my favorite LPS of that year but I also like the grungy ER and more mature direction the band was taking their music in with the name change and the release of their follow-up record the long dark blue so I've been waiting ever since that album which was also one of my favorites of the year to hear where the band would take their music next because as much as I do like the long dark blue it does feel like a transition point of sorts there was also something about the band's particular brand of 90s or revivalism that was really clicking with me I know I am a child of that era and I do hear a lot of that stuff in the current music landscape and a vast majority of it does not click with me at all but at least with Swain's last album it did hit me as hey this is bringing back everything that was great about that era with some really quality songwriting - it's not just this painfully boring old-school alt rock or grunge pastiche presented with little in terms of artistic or songwriting substance so I was looking forward to hearing where the band was gonna go next and this album actually did catch me off guard a little bit didn't know it was coming out some fans said hey have you heard the new Swain gave it a try like the teaser tracks I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready and I definitely hear some progress in the band's sound on negative space it is easily their most moody album so far the aggressive and punky er elements of the band's sound seemed to have mostly melted away on this new release and this isn't a bad thing necessarily especially since the softest and most depressed songs on the group's last record made for some of the best songs on that record still though with the more easygoing Direction negative space heads and I do think what's presented here ends up as a more one-dimensional experience and with the band changing their sound even further and throwing a lot of those Punk elements away they almost transition on some tracks here and to just making very tepid alternative rock so in a way I am a little torn on this album in one breath it's got some great songs and performances the song but then what sounds like it honestly would have raged across every radio market in America in 1993 so while those moments on this album impress there are elements of it as well that are just painfully unoriginal my critical mind if you'll allow me to say something so cringy is like I don't know about this but my 90s kid heart is very much like yeah yeah yeah but honestly for your average younger music listener trying this record out that's been following Swain maybe up until this point I think the biggest blockade in front of this album success may be fans not quite taking to the new change in sound still I do commend the record for having an incredibly tight block of songs to kick the entire thing off the title track is fantastic I love the way the verses are so despondent and so under state it's very nirvana it's very Pixies there is an explosive lush wall of guitars and everything on the hook the track gets even better as the band starts to weave in these chilling vocal harmonies these songs same things brings another helping of heavy grungy guitars the aesthetic is mostly the same but the drumming and the vocals are a lot more impassioned across the track there's also a bit of swagger to the song that I like a lot I also like the messaging in the lyrics of the song about just things being mundane repetitive uninteresting could be a comment on art could be a comment on life existence itself the song but then what that I mentioned earlier is an excellent ballad with this haunting lullaby ish melody playing throughout a very well composed string arrangement more Pixies esque elements and this beckoning refrain of all of these vocals singing in unison but then what the song skin-on-skin is a sinister change of pace it really does show the band's dark side the lead vocals on the intro of the song are very cold-blooded and chilling like something out of an old tool track there is also this almost psychopathic infatuation with closeness going on in the lyrics that I thought was a little unsettling the band comes off surprisingly brooding on this track the heavier parts of the track almost have an all metal feel to them with a slightly gothic twist so after this point in the tracklist there is a short interlude cut and post this I think is when the band starts to work in a lot of the weaker tracks on this record the song Fistful of hair the most defining characteristic of this track are its incredibly kinky lyrics but this is easily the blandest instrumental on the entire album the song big dumb boy sounds like it's a attempt partially at writing a power pop song with its heavy catchy crunchy guitar chords but then it suddenly coasts into these odd groovy somewhat artsy verses that feel like something out of a wild beast song but way to tone down to be distinct or memorable this is also one of several moments in the second half of this record where the vocals are pretty underwhelming as they just are buried in the mix they don't really have a lot of oomph or fire to the delivery one more moment that was pretty unexpected in the tracklist here was the intro to uncomfortably aware which sounds almost like it could be the very dramatic atmospheric start to a Coldplay song the instrumental doesn't exactly gain all that much in terms of bite past this point either the song self feels like a wintry and modern take on a 60s folk rock - not in a bad way I think it's actually one of the best songs in the second half of this record with its vocal harmonies its woodwind melodies unfortunate this tracks its shoulder to shoulder with hit me till I break my bones which has this intro that is maybe the most unapologetically Pixies moment on the entire it sounds just like something that could have been on Doolittle which is not entirely a bad thing if you attach a compelling tune to it but sadly this more mature direction the band is going in here just leads to more lifeless kroons coming out of the vocals I do not get why the band is playing it's so subdued during multiple key points of this record but they are thankfully strange light is a pretty powerful closer the closest thing this album has to a religious experience with its thick glistening layers of guitars and synths and strings I love the way the track becomes progressively distorted and smudgy and ugly toward the end it sort of just disintegrates before your ears the track's repeated mantras of light coming out of a dark verge it's pretty surreal I know overall I think this album is good but I still can't help but walk away from this record a little disappointed because this is the first time Swain is hitting me with a record that I think is not not great not amazing it's fine it's enjoyable there are a lot of good highlights here I'm definitely looking forward to what the band is gonna be doing in the future but there were just way too many moments on this record where the ideas the vocals the songwriting was just so faint to the point where it was not registering on my radar and that's not to say the band needs to start going aggressive again in order to do that but if you're going to sort of jettison that sound jettison that idea that concept that emotive vehicle you need to replace it with something else and there are some points on this record where it feels like it's not being replaced with something else I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Swain forever

UUGId_y9bAs,hi everyone deepen the breath Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tomb mold album planetary clairvoyance the newest and third full-length album from this toronto-based metal 4-piece 2 mold it's here they've been making waves in the underground metal scene since the release of their debut in 2017 interest in the band reached a fever pitch with the release of their sophomore record manner of infinite forms a record that didn't really resonate with me as much as I would have wanted it to now granted two molds music sits on the filthier heavier more gruesome side of the death metal genre with the autopsies and cannibal corpses of the world maybe pushing it a little further in that direction they're not trying to be too melodic they're not trying to be too technical they're not trying to fuse the genre with anything else gimmicky or weird or just outside of the usual death metal purview it's good if all you're looking for is a band that is carrying the torch for a classic strain of extreme metal it's not so good if you're looking for something new refreshing cutting edge or even all that distinct so I do admit that manners complete lack of novelty did cause me to tune it out a little bit even if I can't acknowledge that the band does what they do incredibly well the performances are tight the production is heavy there seems to be a lot of attention to detail in terms of recapturing this sound so I saw the band put out another record it was getting even more praised and I figured I had to sit down and figure out if this was finally going to click with me but no this album still very much came off to me as a basic but still incredibly hideous and nasty death metal experience I do appreciate the band attempting to vary their sound up a little bit though like with the ominous intro and acoustic guitar break and harmonized guitar solos toward the end of beg for life or the pummeling drums and zany guitar harmonies on accelerative phenomena to mold also manages to work in this three-minute somewhat glitchy droney ambient interlude that's a tad bit eerie I guess it might be a tones for the next track but it comes at a weird point in the tracklist still it's an unexpected detour for the band there's also the incredibly slow and sinister and melodic finish of the closing track heat death that I thought was one of the most powerful moments on the record - so all of this variety across the tracklist shows the band is definitely paying more attention to the flow of this album its progression on the whole still though I would argue that the production on the group's last record was actually better than what is being presented here the sound on Manor generally in comparison with planetary is a lot heavier a lot wider more presence feels like a more enveloping sound by comparison this new record over here is a lot noisier a lot more chaotic it just doesn't have as much punch as its predecessor even if it is a bit harsher because there are some passages on this album where it is super satisfying with how the vocals in a very ugly way to swallow up a majority of the mix but still the trade-off with that is there is a lot of sonic and compositional detail that is lost and buried in the drums and the guitars still despite this the band manages to drop quite a few highlights on this thing the track beg for life I mentioned earlier moves through multiple interesting phases their riffs on this thing that are tension building their riffs on this thing that are incredibly chunky and heavy riffs that are very groovy and everything gets dramatic around that acoustic breakdown I mentioned earlier if I had to guess the goal of the title track on this thing it would be that it is attempting to just sound as relentless as possible with the drums hitting a nice speedy click on a kick drum snare pattern the equally fast riffs had a disgusting guitar tone on them there's also a pretty neat transition into a new riff tour the end of the track that has a thrashy quality to it but it is crushingly heavy there are elements of infinite resurrection that feel as heavy feel as brutal and punishing but it's like the full brunt of the band's sound and their performances are held back by the recording which makes the entire record feel very one-dimensional feel very collapsed this thing is a beast it's an animal but it's it's chained down it's not able to just like get out there and rip out your throat it can't reach you past this point I think the last true stunner on this album is the closing cut heat death I do like the dreary atmosphere presented in the final moments of that song yeah I guess I feel like I'm in the midst of a weird trade-off between this record and the band's last one I mean while I do enjoy the compositional versatility the group is starting to incorporate on this new record their last album did feel heavier if only that clarity and monstrous presence could have carried over onto this new record that has more interesting compositional detours maybe the next to mold record will click with me a bit more this one was not bad though I think it's a decent record I think it's likable I think there are a lot of people out there who will enjoy this a lot more than me especially if you are a death metal purist I am feeling personally a decent two strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it digit it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should I review next if the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana to mold forever

your overall price you get something we get something supports the channel supports the segment now let's start with the worst tracks of the week no ifs or ands or buts about them first starting off with the newest cut from Noel Gallagher's high flying birds it sort of sounds like a bad fusion of bland psychedelic rock with electronic music as well it's it's a bad combo it's it's like if tame impala had no finesse and very little in the way of songwriting power and and also uh just had a really big boner for like a Britpop don't care for it at all this new track over here this is the place also in the worst tracks we have seasick by ice JJ fish this is his new project but this doesn't make sense ice JJ fish I want you this is in the worst songs category but it's um this doesn't make sense because ice JJ fish is the king of R&B so why would his music be in the worst track section that is that is confusing I don't know how that I don't know how that happened I don't know what what managed to cause that but it is what it is I guess ice JJ fish new song and music video out I want you give it a listen if you want to hear the king of R&B alright the mess section tracks that I didn't think were amazing but still worth shouting out still decent still worth pointing at first off we had this new track from sporting life of Rat King Fame it is a new song featuring none other than Bheem Spencer on vocals it's a very moody combination of abstract hip-hop and R&B song structure wise it's a little one-dimensional but it's it's a vibe it's got a vibe we also have a new track from Dean Blunt and DJ escrow coming through on the track pattern VIP it's another moody abstract strange and experimental bit of hip hop from the UK artist who I'm hoping to hear more music from very soon hopefully something a bit more complete as this was just a little all over the place and there was a really weird interlude break point in the midst of it and then a trail off into something else but I would expect nothing less from Dean blunt the master of diversion I do love the man I do love his music and it has been a too long since we've heard a new strange sonic excursion for mr. blunt and we also had this new track over here from none other than trippy red and he has a new record out as well this week this one over here continues to trail down the emo rap trend that trippy red has partially defined himself by as a trap rapper I see him as kind of versatile there are points where he's not exactly coming out with tracks of this style but this does happen to be one of the moodier more ballad like tracks that he's a drop featuring some very Barkley's sad guitars hanging in the background a pretty emotive lead vocal not his best song in this style but certainly not one of his worst snakeskin is the name of this new one over here we also have the new tool single new tool track intro to their latest full-length album I believe fear inoculum and I gave a full-length track review of this over on the Fantana channel you can check it out over there if you want to hear more in depth views because it is a long track with a lot of characteristics to it to sum it up a little bit though I thought that the production on it was a little too clean I thought that the writing was a little too average and by the numbers for tool like the there wasn't really a whole lot in terms of anything new or risky in terms of the drums or guitar work I did like some of the strange chants that man had brought into the fold I did like some of the lyrics I thought that some of the hand percussion brought in on the mystical intro was kind of cool and I thought that maybe the best characteristic of the track is that the band's chemistry together still to this day sounds fantastic it is a 10-minute song and it is engaging for the duration of the those 10 minutes because they play together so well they build up such a nice intensity along the progression of the track so they're playing together really well performance is great production I think could be better writing could be more interesting hoping for something a bit more fiery with the next tracks on this record and I'm hoping for an album that isn't just simply like we're gonna do exactly what tool fans want us to do no tool has challenged their fan base with each new album I would not like for tool to just just play to expectations on this new LP I want to hear something refreshing from one of the most unique bands in alternative metal moving on from there we had this new track from sir an experimental R&B artist through the Top Dawg entertainment label I'm not super crazy about I thought that his last album was pretty mediocre however in terms of song structure I thought this new track over here hair down featuring Kendrick Lamar I was one of the best that he's put out so far still I think the vocals are pretty underwhelming and the kendrick feature is not one of the best i've ever heard but again i would argue this is a noticeable improvement upon what sirs last album offered rico nasty has come through with a remix of the track welcome to the party she is absolutely brutal on this track those growled disgusting and aggressive in-your-face screams that rico is known for make a return on this track on a pretty i don't know a dark party song I do like the hook and I do like the instrumental on this track quite a bit it was kind of a wise for her to pull this song out of the ether and then remix it in my view moving on from there we have a new track from Pixies yes the they are still plugging away still making new music even though much of it has not been very well received as of late but this is actually one of the more pleasurable songs catfish Kate that I think I've heard from this new collection of pixie songs I thought that the guitar sounded great I thought that the band sounded super tight I thought that the tune of the song was really good too a few of the lyrics I thought raised some eyebrows but still this is not sound as rickety or as just weakly put together as a lot of the band's more recent materials so I don't know I'm welcoming this as an improvement so catfish Kate Pixies latest stuff might be on a bit of an uptick possibly oh excuse me skip too fast we have a new track from pharmacon as well in death industrial experimental music noise artist pharmacon this one has some very cartoonish strange freaky vocals on top and abrasive instrumental as you would expect from pharmacon it's edited down for a single format pretty much give it a shot give it a try spit it out is the title of if you like your music strange and left-field on the fringe try it try it we also have this new track from OCS as well who are gearing up for a new album release a lot of you guys might know this band as a group that fuses elements sike rock and punk and garage rock but this song over here captain loosely is a several minute somewhat noisy strange ambient peace unlikely for the band wasn't super crazy about it but i imagine it could sound really interesting shoulder to shoulder with other tracks in their forthcoming album we also have this track Mercedes Marxist by the UK punk band known as idols the song has been out a while I've known about this track for quite a while it's been out since May I think but I wanted to shout it out again here because it is attached to an absolutely genius music video that I think you guys should absolutely check out you should absolutely check it out alright moving on from there gate creeper the death metal band known as gate creeper new album on the way boiled over is the name of the track buzz saw heavy death metal guitars pounding drums growled vocals it's nasty as hell straight forward and beats you in the face like a metalcore song but it's still very much a death metal track give it a shot if you like your death metal pretty straightforward and gruesome and hard-hitting brutal moving on from there we have this track from Cody Co shout out to Cody Co watermelon party watermelon party it's it's a sad trap song about a watermelon party alright we also have this new track from the band known as battles who I've covered on the channel quite a few times before titanium 2-step featuring Sal Prince Apollo is the name of this track and the artist on it it has a very odd groove to it I think Sal's vocal contributions to the track are kind of freaky but there is a point where I do think the groove and sells vocals do get a little repetitive there isn't enough variation across the length of the song but I don't know I'm still holding out hope for this new battles album even though I thought their last full length record was a little underwhelming still looking forward to hearing one of the most creative bands in rock music come through with something colorful angular groovy and off-the-wall so shout out to battles new album on the way also we have a another song from Bat For Lashes new record on the way also if you love electro pop make sure that you're listening to bafreux lashes The Hunger is the name of this new track it's very moody Spacey ballad with a pretty consistent groove Bat For Lashes always bringing those moody electro pop vibes and let's get into the tracks I thought were the best tracks this week the best tracks this week let's go oh okay this one was a surprise uniform and the body not good enough so uniform in the body two of the harsher music acts out there currently have a new collaborative album on the way and this new song over here fuses elements of noise and industrial and dark wave and I like the vocals quite a bit it's a very nasty brutal track that is catchy yet unforgiving give it a shot it's lovely but also hideous from there singer/songwriter richard Dawson came out with the track last week new record on the way I praised his music on that peasant album that I reviewed not too long ago I missed this song talking about it now and I actually love this track brings together elements of rock music and low fine music very distorted low-five music with his typical folk song writing the lyrics are much more a product of modernity than the lyrics on his last album which very much were a reflection of I don't know more medieval era I guess so if richard Dawson is still a relatively new artist to you and you know you got turned on to him through that peasant album don't allow the change in pace on this new track over here to shock you or anything Richard Dawson has been coming out with music for a long time and that peasant record is just one chapter in his ongoing career and seems like he's taking off and doing something different while still staying in those experimental lo-fi and fulk music camps give this track shot loved it jogging alright we also have this track over here pollen ator moth ball deities is the name of the record just now finding out about this band got turned on to them through a suggestion in my inbox ICU is the name of it there is a huge I want to say grunge influence going on with this track alternative rock influence going on in this track but the writing is kind of ambitious there are elements of that remind me of Nirvana there are elements of the other that remind me of radio like early Radiohead nineties Radiohead a little bit not like debut album Radiohead maybe some bends okay computer era Radiohead a little bit so fusing those together adding some other extra creative elements and voila think I heard one of the best rock songs of the week frankly so shout out to a pollinator gonna be looking forward to what the band is doing in the future also we have the new Megan the stallion single that we have been waiting for for quite a while Megan the stallion has been riding this hot girl summer branding for a while now and it's only gonna be a matter of time er only was a matter of time until we were going to get a hot girl summer single her Nicki Minaj connected not too long ago and now nicki has pretty much come on to this track with Megan with ty dolla sign and I don't know it's a summary pop trap banger I like it it's good it's fun cuz I'm gonna hit a lick ty dolla sign hook is snappy Meghan's good Nicki's good they both have a similar rap style that just complements one another so uh yeah just a win-win-win all-around good single catchy song I'm sure it will be playing out loud for the rest of the summer of what there is left of the summer we have this new track over here looking for America from Miss Lana Del Rey thought this one was a very moody enjoyable ballad like the chord progression I thought Lana's vocals were a little more expressive than usual I have been enjoying a bit more of Lana's recent work then I was her past stuff like her first couple of albums so uh you know pleased to hear a lot of continuing in a direction where I don't know she's dropping more compelling material in my view of course it's a very dreamy slow dreary downtrodden song we would expect no less from Lana looking for America enjoying it we have a new track from Katy Perry which is it's weird that I've enjoyed quite a bit the pass to Katy Perry singles the last one with that EDM style instrumental with a bit of an 80s throwback woven in was was great I think one of her best tunes in a long time this new one over here small talk I thought that the the lyrics of this track the idea the framing of it was really refreshing and cool the idea of being in this relationship for so long that you love each other you've gone through that puppy love phase and now you've in a way become strangers again you've once again hit this point where you're just making small talk and it's like you don't really know each other anymore which is in in era of relationships that a lot of pop music doesn't exactly cover and and not in a way that is as compelling as it is covered in this new Katy Perry track I thought that her vocals and the instrumental we're relatively solid to hook was good music video was flirty and fun and a little tongue-in-cheek if that counts for anything so yeah Doug Luke Katy Perry single Katy with her new singles is two for two in my view so hell yeah do that we have this also new track from igloo ghost collaborating with Kai wisp Whiston Kai Whiston who I've covered on the channel before and also baby an artist who I'm just now I think getting familiar with baby lucky is the name of this new track over here it is a strange electronic otherworldly from another planet banger we would expect no less from igloo ghost that is what he does and I think that having two other collaborators in the mix on this track does add a lot of elements that you wouldn't typically expect from one of his songs and this track is is quite clear I think as well quite well organized for a for an igloo ghost song so yeah digging this track quite a bit liking this collaborative would love to hear a igloo continue to cross paths with other artists and producers into the future we also have this new track from none other than EEPROM Angie Jones demon veil and is a freaky mix of dubstep of drum and bass of I would say various forms of abstract electronic music it is absolutely nuts it is unapologetically a banger yes of course but it is loaded with completely indescribable changes it is difficult to get a hold of and yet has a very consistent groove and lots of logical progression and flow to it it's a really impressive track for as short as it is it packs a lot of punch and it packs a lot of ideas into a very short amount of time so digging this quite a bit we also have this amazing immaculate news song from none other than DRAM featuring watt and also heard this is a gorgeous amazing ballad this is a powerhouse of a song guys this is a powerhouse of a song instrumental immaculate hers appearance is great watts guitar is great the songwriting is top-notch DRAM is more impressive vocally than ever and yeah I'm just absolutely loving this ballad I'm just loving this tune it is so sensual it is so lovely I just can't say enough nice things about it so I will move on to the next track because this is this is great do not miss out on this song if you listen to one goddamn song in this whole series of songs that mark I'm recommending to you make it this song because that good it is that sexy give it a shot we also have an artist from a track who I'm just recently becoming acquainted with the name of this track is Chiquita cassia screws is the name of the artist now I'm not very familiar with cruises discography so I can't confirm if the rest of cruises music sounds this way but what I can say is that this new song over here is like a strange combination of I don't know what like abstract left-field pop rap and Latin music but it's also kind of lo-fi and the the vocals are very odd however it's incredibly compelling and enjoyably weird and and sweet to the ear in a way once you've kind of gotten past the weirder elements of it I think I'm just gonna be looking forward to more tracks from this artist because I thought this was pretty cool and not much attention on it so far so you know if you're looking for something totally different something that not a lot of people are on right now give this to give this a shot give it a try because for as obscure as it is it certainly was stand out to me alright also ooh Brock Hampton are back with a new new new single if you pray right this one is so much better than their last single oh god is it so much better I'm loving the sort of marching band horn samples instrumentation woven into the beat everyone's flow everyone's verse was fantastic the hook was poppin Kevin was good Matt was good Merlyn was good Joe but was good Dom was good everyone was good on the track production was great song structure solid it sounded quirky it sounded playful it sounded fun it sounded a little emotional it sounded catchy this is everything I enjoy in Brock Hamptons music distilled into a new track that's doing something a little different angled a little different so shout out to Brock Hampton for coming through with another solid song and just keeping anticipation and excitement high for the new record when that does end up dropping so if you pray right diggin it Lebanon knew good track we have this new track from blue faced disrespectful it's somewhat offbeat banger with of course those glistening pianos that West Coast groove that blue face usually brings to the table and you know nasty disrespectful tone and lyrics it's that's blue face for you that's booth bass totally unforgiving individual blue face getting real disrespectful on this new track on this news also we have an aerial pink coming out with a few unreleased tracks he has a new archival project on the way the name of this one over here is stray here with you which is incredibly fun if you love a lot of aerials earlier more playful more loath I pop works then you're going to dig on this track quite a bit because it's a you know in that classic kind of style heavily and obviously influenced by the likes of our Stevie Moore give it a shot give it a try give it a give it a go it's very good and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best I love you and yeah we'll catch you in the next one remember all of the tracks that I talked about in this video linked down below for you to try along with the

7kJNJCzFeFM,yeah hey everyone clear to the O Tana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Claro record immunity the highly anticipated brand new album from singer/songwriter Claro aka Clare Cottrill an artist who busted into the music industry a few years ago off the back of her YouTube hit pretty girl a seemingly low-budget song and music video that made Claro an overnight indie sensation but that praise has also come with a heaping helping of skepticism as internet sleuths have kind of exposed her as an industry plant with familial connections to the entertainment world and while I don't really care for those that fake the DIY funk I think the efforts to delegitimize Clare as an artist are a bit ridiculous especially considering she had been releasing music for years before a pretty girl even blew up the only thing that's going to matter at the end of the day is whether or not this album resonates with listeners whether or not it's good I know I was certainly pleased with a few pleasant sounding singles going into this thing and I was sort of surprised to hear that rostam of Vampire Weekend Fame he's now out of Vampire Weekend co-produced pretty much every track here considering all of this I was looking forward to trying this thing out and I guess overall it's a somewhat enjoyable hodgepodge of pop and R&B a bit of indie rock I guess you could say it's reflective of the playlist if occation of modern music it runs almost like a very warm friendly familiar mixtape a friend made you years and years ago the whole record kicks off with the song alewife a very breezy and somewhat dramatic opener it features a gentle drone some pensive pianos also a bittersweet vocal the instrumentation the song both are so faint they don't really leave that strong event impression on me it also does not help that Clare singing gives off this mix of indifference and malaise but what's actually haunting about this track though are the lyrics where Clare seems to have someone in mind who has essentially pulled her back from the edge of suicide or self-harm whether that be through just being there or like literally doing everything in their power to prevent it from happening the next track impossible does have a bit more beef to it instrumentally which I like we have a chunky drum B that could have fit behind an old school hip-hop song but thrown on top of that are these regal keyboard passages and slinky bass lines and guitar bits that would sound at home in a beach house song vocally Claire does come off a bit bolder than she did on the intro but to my ears she still fails to leave a lasting impression though I got to say there were some stunning vocal harmonies over the piano breakdown on the hook don't care for how awkwardly these course is transitioned back into the main theme of the song and then fizzled out very badly at the end of the track sort of seemed like one of many moments on this record where the songwriting or the song structures feel a bit half-baked worth a lot of thought wasn't put into them the first song that really stops me in my tracks though is the track closer to you which is odd because it's easily one of the quietest songs on this record it doesn't really present much at first with a very dry simple sequence drumbeat a very gentle and polite synth bassline not to mention Claire's vocals are understated and processed with autotune there is an impeccably gorgeous explosion of auto-tune vocal harmonies on the hook though that is it's it's delish and also genuinely heartbreaking especially once you look into the lyrics the self-doubt it's so defeated it's so soul-crushing after this point on the album where something is really starting to click with me I figure Claire is trying to consciously find power in simplicity and subtlety in lower volumes and sometimes she does later into the tracklist and sometimes not as much I am equally impressed with the track north though it has a totally different vibe to it it's pursuing more of a ghostly indie rock aesthetic with faint grungy guitars of booming beat vocals that sound like the way you would sing quietly along to your favorites in your car and not in a bad way the chorus on this track is fantastic with its nimble jumpy chord progression the vocal melody is incredibly unique in angular2 I also love how subtly psychedelic the sound of this track too is as it progresses the following track bags though is an utterly generic boilerplate indie rock song through and through with absolutely no instrumental flavor to it whatsoever the basic drum beat and mostly untreated raw twangy acoustic guitars on this track sound the way unseasoned tofu tastes even if we do get some piercing loaf eyed pianos that eventually introduce themselves into the mix that sound like something out of an old microphones record the song softly is this album's inevitable dip into some pop and R&B fusions the hook sounds like a summery throwback to 90's pop radio but maybe the songs most defining characteristic is this odd stumbling descending guitar line that feels like it's ripped straight out of a Dirty Projectors album it is a neat contrast to the impeccably smooth instrumentation grooving underneath it strangely enough these songs Sofia sounds like a track from The Strokes album comedown machine it's almost as if Clare is just doing some karaoke over a leftover instrumental from that album it's not terrible but I don't find it that appealing but even though I'm not crazy about that track the next few I am even more perplexed by white flag is the only track on the album I may categorize as a do-nothing song the tune is drab the beat is so mind-numbing I can't wait for it to be over meanwhile feel something feels like an attempt at writing a moody top 40 ballad but it doesn't really have the vocal presence or the high gloss production or even the instrumental presence to make it happen the song sinking is essentially more star and be that you could sip expensive coffee too which given the current musical paradigm is not a bad direction to go in but when you don't have the vocal chops to sell a song when you spotlight your voice in the way that you do on this track it's going to fall short I wouldn't ask you is basically the stereotypical attempt at trying to drum up a lengthy mellow closer at the end of an album but generally immunity is a pretty soft album so where does Clair go from here well she sets her voice to some pretty distant pianos and what sounds like a chorus of kids singing or maybe a few kids singing and then there multi-tracked the chords and the simplicity of the tune read almost like an old gospel song but interpreted in a way where it would appeal to some bedroom pop fans there's a really interesting transition at the mid point where a beat is introduced the melody changes though the lyrics are are mostly repeated after this point though the track does grow a little tedious I got to say the song doesn't exactly justify it's six plus minutes of runtime still it does successfully send the album off in a very gentle way overall I thought this record was just very okay I'm mostly indifferent to it my thoughts on it are mixed some tracks are great some tracks completely utterly unmemorable but it's Claire's first album outing into the limelight it does show promise but not a lot in the way of focus or execution sometimes I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over

n6wpOWd92kc,ooh hi everyone ear they popped Anna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new rich Brian album the Sailor this is a new LP from Indonesian rapper singer-songwriter major artist on the 88 rising label mr. rich Brian at this point in 2019 it's only been a few years since the drop of rich Brian's big breakout single dat stick but it still feels like an eternity since then Brian has undergone a name change he has treated us to one single after another he dropped his full-length debut album and also played a huge role in crafting his labels inaugural collective compilation summer album head in the clouds so Brian has kept pretty busy and I did go into this new album of his with some high expectations not only because his debut showed so much promise but the teaser tracks to this new LP were actually very good certainly more ambitious than anything he's dropped so far you have kids which is this grand piano back pop rap track with soaring strings and personal verses about Brian's work ethic his will to strive it's a powerful cut in the vein of jay-z or Drake on one of those like mental check-ins on an extravagant instrumental where he just kind of pens a little diary verse about everything that's been going on with him all of his successes all of his struggles meanwhile the track yellow presents a completely unexpected shift in stylistic direction in that this song mostly shows Brian's singing and I don't mean like Auto crooning over at rap beat he is like literally singing his ass off over this grand string back instrumental it's an orchestral blend of psychedelic pop of a little R&B - it's like if you forced Kanye West and Mercury red to collaborate and it came out pretty good Brian's singing is certainly more expressive and on-pitch than I would have imagined given just how monotone and cold a lot of his flows tend to be there are various bits of instrumentation in the second half this track that are quite cinematic and the song really made me wonder if rich Brian was going to be that next rap artist to kind of transcend the genre in a way and make some huge musical waves outside of it and if he is going to be that artist I'm not sure if it's going to be on this album though because while I do appreciate the wide variety of sounds and styles that he's trying to bring under one roof on this record the way it's all organized to my ears comes off very surface level a little disheveled while there are high points on this LP the whole thing ends up sounding like an album that doesn't really know what it is or what it wants to achieve case in point the tracks slow down turbo a song that transitions so many times across its four-minute runtime it just doesn't really have much in the way of a focused idea or progression to it granted I do like individual bits of this track especially when Brian is rapping it at a decent click and then all of a sudden the audio have it start speeding up and it gets more and more weird and intense it's sort of a psychedelic moment on the record again cool individual idea on this track but nothing before it were after it really reinforces or builds there are points on this record where I'm reminded of the Beatles White Album in that we have some strange and unlikely genre clashes a few weird song structures but in that regard nothing the Sailor presents is nearly as groundbreaking or exciting or well-executed there are certainly moments that come off quite eclectic like the opening track that transitions us from this quirky rat banger to a weird spoken word passage about going outside Brian noting that he forgot to brush his teeth goes to the corner store gets some iced tea some bubble gum imagine taking the spoken word intro to Kendrick Lamar's damn and making it so that it wasn't symbolic or representative of anything it wasn't messaging anything that's nearly what you're getting here just sort of a ran observational moment that is framed in a way where it's dramatic but it's not actually I do like the extra bit of Psych pop vocal harmonies toward the end of the track though that is quite nice but most of this record doesn't come together as masterfully as the intro track here or yellow you do get some trap bangers with slightly left-field instrumentals a bit of personality like the track confetti or the song repertoire both of which bring a lot of bass a lot of Rumble some good grooves but very little on the quotable front the hooks are just okay also not some of the best similes like the blow me like confetti line off of confetti I mean confetti is more often thrown than blown I mean sure I've seen it before but when I think confetti blowing it is not the first thing I think and look I get it in rap music we we all want to be blown you know we all want to be blown and we're looking for things to compare getting blown too but I think we can do better than confetti the real shocker in this tracklist though is the increase of mellow tracks of ballads here like the track drive safe which is an OK attempt at penning a hooky mix of R&B and acoustic ballad ree there is a cutesy hook on the song that's sticky on first listen the production is pretty cinematic on this track and even though I am slightly turned off by the cliched lyrics it does sound like I don't know an epic kissing scene out of a great rom-com but a track that shoots for a somewhat similar appeal but completely misses the mark is 100 degrees a song that features these cheap acoustic chord samples very corny rapping it's like a bad McLemore tune the hook is sickening the verses are overly sentimental it's a masterclass on bad pop rap for you and your Bros to listen to near the bonfire at the beach this summer we also have the song curious which is another moment on this album where Brian finds himself spitting over acoustic guitars on the lyrical front the song is a mix there are moments that are kind of reflective conceded or even tongue-in-cheek for the most part Brian seems to be strolling down memory lane on this track going over mistakes that he made as youth and a host of other things as well all I know at the end of the day is that even though Brian is really laying down his his story in his background and what has brought him to this point in a way it's just not all that compelling which is sad because as far as his background and who he is and how he got here he's easily one of the most unique rappers out there today but his execution on that front of presenting himself presenting his story presenting what makes them unique is just really lacking for example even though I find a figure like rich Brian much more interesting than Drake Drake's ability to tell his story and make it resonate is so much greater than that of Brian's if you compare it to a track like let's say 6:00 p.m. in New York as long as I'm mentioning the mellower or even darker cuts on this record I should also shout out the song vacant a very moody rap track where Brian is essentially rifling through the goings-on in this very toxic relationship stylistically it's a strange cross between a few different things one some haunting vocal melodies that feel like they could have been lifted out of Travis Scott's 9:02 a know some confessional love on the rocks Drake type verses and then finally an instrumental and a curious chord progression that feels derivative of gautier somebody that I used to know did not anticipate hearing all of these things under one song but here we are The Beatles esque vocal harmonies and vibes return on the closing track featuring Joe G in my review it's actually one of the better songs on the entire record especially with its pillowy instrumentation and lavish strings Brian's cold ass rap flows make for a good contrast all of this just very harmonious harmonious tonal orgasmic wonderful wall of beauty I guess I just wish more songs on this record where as grand or as gratifying but sadly that's just not the case so you do have this incredible degree of separation between multiple tracks on this album in terms of instrumental quality and depth songwriting quality lyrical quality emotional tone so I do like some of what Brian is doing on this record but going forward I guess I would just like to hear more consistency there were just too many songs on this album that to my ears felt underwhelming throwaway a disorganized or just a lot lighter I'm feeling a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best true the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my

BAZ_Z8tCkfU,hi everyone anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd you know who it is and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst

episode of the weekly track roundup so go down there and hit up the tracks if any of my descriptions or the songs interest to you our Amazon and turntable lab links are down there too but I have spoken enough let's get into the tracks and shoutouts one we have Denzel curry here coming through with a few of Spotify exclusive tracks where he's a on the record with Bad Brains on the record with Canadian punk rock outfit fucked up and they are recording more loud music it's a pretty incredible wouldwould I guess love to continue hearing Denzel go down this road at least you know on the side with tracks like this every once in a while I mean his Rage Against the Machine cover was amazing and to hear him kind of dip back into this sound into the style is is pretty cool you know don't know how or if he will actually work this sort of thing into his new upcoming album but I don't know it sounds pretty good when he's kind of detouring into this every once in a while and let's get into the worst tracks of the week ooh I skipped ahead too far but you've already seen the first one we already have this one up we have Maggie Lindemann who is a new pop artist that is out on 300 entertainment yes that 300 entertainment that you typically affiliate with loads of different rap artists out there but they seem to be branching out with this new single called friends go featuring none other than Travis Barker a blink-182 Fame but to my ears it just sounds like a completely boring neutered pop punk track hella over produced boring song boring vocals the instrumental is a kind of a mess Travis's drums I don't think are all that well complemented by the mix and I just feel like every Lavigne already happened like I don't know why we need this this fake punk pop rock edginess it's yeah I really don't know it's a bland boring song and I'll leave it at that we also have this new track from Iggy Pop who has a new record on the way James Bond is the name of this new cut over here that is hella stale stiff and awkward I know Iggy solo stuff does tend especially on records like the idiot which I do enjoy tend to be a little I don't know I guess a little obtuse but I I just don't really get the appeal on this particular record it just sounds deflated it just sounds deflated on this record on this track I guess I'll reserve my full critique for when the album comes out and I don't know I'll see if it vibes with me in any way shape or form I doubt I'm gonna get that many asks to cover this so I guess going into it I'm not really that excited despite the fact that I love a lot of classic Stooges records I do love a few solo Iggy efforts as well he is in my view one of the greatest rock artists of all time but not really seeing the genius of his latest output over here and we also had this new track from the trio known as Higham can't say I'm digging this new song titled summer girl all that much I think it's a bit of a breath of fresh air from those past singles that were maybe a little over produced yes but to me the lack of a compelling song at the core of this track combined with the instrumentation that just sounds like a ripoff of Lou Reed's walk on the wild side just resulted in it feeling like a throwaway to my ears honestly all right let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of meh weren't really blowing me away but certainly were worth a shout out when we have refused their back post-hardcore outfit refused they made their comeback several years ago with a record that I didn't really care for all that much but they have a new project on the way and this new song over here that they have out titled blood red is it's kind of punky it's got a little rock and roll in it as well it's it's it's kind of like the last album in that they've kind of captured the vibe of their old stuff but it's nowhere near as exciting or as intense and I'm just kind of waiting for it to do something more interesting than it's currently doing yeah we also have a new track from the New Pornographers new album on the way as well if you love yourself some power pop then you will most likely like this track quite a bit falling down these stairs of your smile is the title of this one it's got a cute hook it's got some cute lyrics on it give it a shot again if you're hardcore into power pop corn cold I thought this one was a lot more interesting than their last single which to me just read as a very bland alternative metal track this one at least had wilder vocals from Jonathan Davis some crazier slap bass playing the riffs were a bit more herky and jerky the drums I thought were a bit more aggressive this to me read a bit more like classic Korn than their last single from their forthcoming record but still it didn't really go far enough to put this one over the edge it still came off especially on the hook a little bland in my view we also have this new track from Griffin and carly Rae Jepson Carly hops on top of a very glitzy and very digital pop beat with some EDM al it's uh it's okay it's not blowing my mind or anything I find the production a little bland but still do enjoy Carly's vocals and vocal melodies so it's not all bad if you're a hardcore fan we also have divine sweater two times two which is a group that I recently came across they actually popped I think the song in my email inbox and I came away with it kind of impressed I mean if you love very breezy happy-go-lucky indie with a tweet twist and a lot of horns and some very catchy I guess reverb so lead vocals then I think you'll get into this quite a bit it's a sweet tune I wish the performance was a bit more gutsy but still I thought this was very nicely instrumentally layered and composed for a indie pop song of this style and I guess looking forward to more of what the band is doing down the road we also had this new track from the band car-bomb who I actually get a lot of requests to review and talk about I'm not a huge fan of car-bombs stuff their new song over here scattered sprites I kind of see as a track in typical car-bomb fashion it is a metal track its technical it's got some weird grooves to it and the guitars are a bit gentie and sound like a piece of machinery breaking down or just on the verge of exploding it's not my vibe it's not my aesthetic it's it's not really my sound but I will admit for a band in this style in this vein I do find what car-bomb does pretty tolerable or at least a bit more interesting than a lot of the more commercial acts in Ghent it seems like a bit more grating and hardcore and a bit more risky but still not super crazy about it but just letting the the metal fans out there know the car-bomb fans out there now there's new car bomb and you'll probably like it more than me we also had this new track from Brock Hampton that I thought was a somewhat interesting effort from the group it does have some standout moments but as a composition as a song it's not that well composed or organized not a strong hook on it you have little appearances from dom and from merlin that in my view this sound a bit like wasted potential the Matt champion outro at the end of the track sounds like something I would have made for a great hook on the song but it's not a hook again structurally I think it's a bit of a mess even if there are some good vocal performances and in lyrical bits from Jabba from Kevin from Bear face but what are you gonna do I just hope the next single is a bit better but I've been bored again I have a full-length track review for this song over on the Fantana channel check it out over there if you like we have a new track from ariana grande and also a duo that I'm now just hearing of thanks to the song social house boyfriend is the name of the track it's a cute tune it's got an OK beat but I found the vocals social house brought to the table to be kind of bland didn't quite get it felt like I don't know a collaboration without much chemistry I guess though I still enjoyed much of the instrumental and Ariana's vocal contributions to the song I can say at least that much and now we're on to what I felt were the best tracks of the week this week number one we have a new single from blank Mass this track over here is is really everything that I would want out of a blank mass song it is insanely dark it is bright it is grating it is throbbing it is exciting there are a lot of songs from this project that fuse elements of dance music of industrial music of Noise music of a minimalist composition that fall flat for me but this track was definitely not a case of that this one really knocked it out of the park the name of this one over here is love is a parasite highly highly recommended there's at least a few songs on every blank mass record that blow me away and this is definitely an example of one next one that really left a mark on me was this track from a band that I'm now just hearing up named star crawler to me the track felt like if you took a Marilyn Manson song and then tried to feed it through the instrumentation of like a 70s somewhat bluesy hard rock band with a female lead singer and and and that that's that's exactly that's exactly what you're getting there are points vocally and I think maybe it's it's trying a little too hard but it still rocks pretty frickin hard and I like the dark somewhat edgy attitude of the song I think the band and the production sound really tight and together I'm gonna be looking more into star crawler as I guess they release new music I thought it was pretty cool moving out from their sleater-kinney another single from their forthcoming album this one I also thought was pretty good so I think the band has put out more pleasurable singles than not for this forthcoming album this new one over here is can I go on and it has um it's it's it seems like in one breath it's a pop rock track but then in another breath it seems like a post-punk track and a noise rock song it seems like a lot of those more experimental music elements are used to sour up and Dement the poppier elements of the songwriting and the composition which i think is pretty cool definitely subversive and a little left-field and tongue in cheek definitely dark but with also a sense of humor to it give it a shot give it a shot sleater-kinney has still got it and i like that they are experimenting and breaking a little new ground for the band I suppose moving on from there we have a new single from Rhapsody featuring a beat that is pretty much an instrumental from jizzes liquids Ward's GZA is on the track and D'Angelo is on the song as well on the hook providing some very wacky vocal harmonies it's a banger it's amazing I think it proves how great Rhapsody is lyrically I love the input from GZA on the track as well definitely live ins the track up along with D'Angelo's contributions to the song - it's fantastic I love that Rhapsody is continuing to kill it and looking forward to a new project from her very very soon alright we have a new song from idols as well uk-based punk outfit idols a non-album song and single which could have easily slipped into their last full-length album which is amazing joy as an act of resistance which I gave a very positive to review the year that it came out was when I favored rock records of that year I dreamed guillotine is a completely unabashed song in its revolutionary tones I guess if you don't want to chop the heads off of the rich if that's something you are strongly averse to avoid this track avoid this track by all means we also have a new song from foals from their forthcoming album which is the sequel to their last full-length record this one over here in my view rocked pretty hard was very aggressive sort of showed a lot of chutzpah on the part of the band Black Bull is the title of this one now of course I was impressed by at least a few tracks or at least one track in the lead up to their last full-length album ended up being disappointed by quite a few of the deep cuts I'm assuming this is also going to be the case with this new full-length album but I can still say that I like this new track a lot I thought it was really good and sort of showed the more frantic side of the band which I do tend to enjoy we also have this new track over here from none other than cross record I release you which is a very um it's it's new to me anyway this project and this song I release you is a beautiful serene somewhat dejected and downtrodden and very sparse ballad that finds a lot of power and subtlety and I'll leave it at that it's a beautiful tune it's gorgeous and it's linked down below along with everything else we're talking about here black Moses is the name of this project or rather this song from channel Trace who we've talked about on this channel before the last time I hyped up a song from this artist it was that amazingly hilarious track sexy black timberlake this new one over here is equally fantastic and features none other than jpeg mafia on the song so if you're a huge PEGI fan and you love your hip-hop left-field you love your hip-hop odd give it a shot and get deeper into the music of channel trace as well because I think there's a an incredible amount of potential here going forward especially getting to that sexy black Timberlake track it's amazing and we have one last song that I'm going to mention in this video it is the newest track from none other than singer/songwriter angel Olsen she has a new record on the way via jag Jaguar and this new song of hers is sort of a departure it's titled all mirrors it sees angel embracing some elements of sin pop and art pop is well it's a little synthetic it is kind of gargantuan in its instrumental presentation it is very loud her vocals are a little buried in the mix too there are some elements to it that remind me of the knife but not in a bad way it's a Hulk of a song it is a Hulk of a song and while I do have to say there is part of me that does at this point still prefer the wild emotionally raw Garage aesthetic of her past singles I am excited for what the future holds for Olson given the amount of ambition she's showing on this track so I think it came out great I think it's a powerful anthemic tune with with just lots of pop to it and I think I'll leave it at that you know it's a huge song probably the biggest in scope song in the whole best track section so give it a shot especially if you loved Angels last length album or if female singer-songwriters are kind of your your bag especially if they're of the indie set though I think what angel is doing here kind of transcends out of that a little bit so I'm gonna leave it at that that has been the weekly track

yWHHr0EFWWw,uh hi everyone break that a nice wet tan here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ybn chord a record The Lost Boy this is the full-length debut album of rapper and songwriter ybn Corday he is a Maryland native and an artist who originally made waves as a member of the ybn collective early on he stood out to me and many others as a lyrical whiz kid against ybn Namir and almighty J he continued to define himself further with standout singles like kung fu and location ships also his stellar response to J Cole's 1985 but going into his debut album over here I honestly didn't know what to expect for one the ybn mixtape that dropped a little while ago was a total mess and stylistically all over the place plus the jazz rap and conscious hip hop of Corday's early mixtapes seemed like such a distant memory at this point will he continue down that road I don't know the feature list on this thing is also pretty impressive to push Atty Anderson Pak Meek Mill chance the rapper and even Jay Cole provides an instrumental on this thing too the album also runs at a pretty tight 15 songs in 45 minutes and the way it turned out it is a pretty good album definitely chordae putting his best foot forward essentially proving he's gonna be an artist to watch over the next few years but he's gonna need to do something to come into his own a little bit more going forward because there are multiple points on this album where he is really really really wearing his influences on his sleeve many of which sound to be very very contemporary there are moments on this project record a doesn't sound too far off stylistically from some very early Kendrick the track bad idea featuring chance the rapper sounds pretty much just like a chance the rapper song featuring ybn Corday and on the track way back home it is eerie how close this song sounds - just a Jay Cole song right down to Corday's vocal melody and even his Cadence's and in a weird twist of events the flows the somewhat chilling beat and the overdub sung vocals on the chorus of nightmares are real sound kind of like an old old Eminem song and that is not a discs because Korda is pulling from an era where mmm was still making some sick music the push a tea feature on this track is also fire so truth be told Cordia is not coming into this record with the freshest or most original sound stylistically this album is an amalgamation of a lot of different things that you will hear in the current rap field but I do think Cordy makes up for a lot of those gaps by just being a solid rapper a good lyricist a good songwriter coming through with some smart personal or focused song topics as well as long as Cordia is showcasing talent on these fronts I think he's going to have growth potential I should also mention he's not a bad singer either and write some pretty quality hooks on this record - whether he's injecting some soul and some gospel into the chorus of that idea or when he brings these hooky little rap refrains on the track have mercy sweet lord please have mercy baby Jesus please save us I know I used up my three favors okay I will I will stop now I will stop so the dude knows his way around a song song structure which is a good thing is a good thing and of course this generates a lot of highlights across the tracklist you have Thanksgiving a track all about bringing his girlfriend around the family during a holiday and he juxtaposes these images of family and home cooking and just love and togetherness with these fears of his relationship either falling apart just not going too well there seems to be this hope that having this event and bringing her there will create a good day but there's still this looming sense of dread about what the future may hold the themes of family and Corday's personal life also continue on to the song Family Matters where he essentially goes over all these positive and negative experiences and lessons that he's learned from people connected to him and his family over the years and how it's essentially informed his worldview RNP featuring Anderson PAC does sound a lot like a track that could have been off of Anderson's Oxnard yes but it's still great Anderson kills the hook and the chemistry the lyrical chemistry between Anderson and Corday in the back end of the song trading line for line is really impressive definitely one of the best moments on the record broke as fuck is a basic track banger in some respects but it is elevated a few lyrical elements of you instrumental elements it sounds a bit soundcloud sounds a bit kenny beats but Cordys hike delivery over the verses and choruses is great plus there are some points when he really stuns lyrically where the beat smooths out into this soul trap fusion where he dropped some lines like you know lost boy no coordinates remember Christmas we was gift list three foot tree no ornaments we get a bit of a surprise on the track we gonne make it with Meek Mill where meek just literally sings his ass off on the hook I don't think I've heard him sing to this degree on a song before or at least when or if I did I didn't like it this much in a weird way he sounds like a cross between young thug and maybe an old soul singer with a really funny delivery his verse is good Cordys opening verse is pretty good and tasteful as well though in the back end of the track Cordy switches up his delivery and his flow into this more I don't know um husky authoritative demeanor he is really laying on the vowels at the end of his words toward the ends of his bars and it it sounds pretty common influence to sounds very common there's an okay closer on this thing it's a dope verse but not much of a song I guess it's sort of like a lyrical afterthought to end the record and tie up some of its themes the only other major complaint I have about the album is that there is kind of a big lull in the tracklist from song eight to about song eleven still though I think this thing is a pretty solid debut from Corte I liked it quite a bit it has a lot of very good things going for it and in a way at this point in his career Corde does remind me of the promise and the talent that logic was showing this early on in his versatility in his lyrical ability as well however I would put money on chordae going down not nearly as corny or as disappointing a path as logic has over the course of his career in fact I would hope and I think Corday is only going to get better from here I'm feeling a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a nother video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana ybn Corday the lost boy forever 
Vw-Hh4kg9q4,hi everyone Brittany back Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new self-titled purple mountains album this is a new debut full-length album from a recently formed band featuring Jeremy Earl and Steven Jay of woods Fame also Kyle Forester of Krystal stilts we also have Aaron DeVoe and Anna st. Lewis in the mix too but the most notable name coming out of this album has to be its frontman singer and songwriter mr. David Berman whose claim to fame as having once fronted the legendary lo-fi indie outfit silver Jews the band came to an uneventful end in the late 2000s which is kind of sad considering it would have been nice to have David Berman's poetic satirical and very witty brand of songwriting with us in over the past 10 years it's just so frank and self-deprecating and cathartic surprisingly though David's songwriting after about ten years of not putting out any records is back in peak form which again is kind of surprising especially considering that the last couple of silver Jews records were not exactly their best now I don't know what's happened between now and the last silver Jews album to create this change maybe David needed the time to kind of chill out and think things over and you know just find more stuff to be depressed about maybe it's also the new backing band that's revitalizing things in a way I don't know what's for sure is they do sound pretty good embodying the perfect mix of all country and Americana and folk rock that Berman's songwriting shines over the recording occasionally does have a sweet shimmer to it the mix perfectly balances the guitars the bass the drums the vocals the complimentary keys and strings it's a little rustic it's occasionally slightly low Phi and just rough around the edges in a very nice way some instrumental palates do sound eerily similar to something you would find on a woods album and considering the connections to the band woods that's not surprising but as good as the instrumentals on this album tend to be the selling point is ultimately David Berman's very sad Jack songwriting which only seems to have gotten more tragic with age whether he's singing about falling short with a love interest or his significant other like on the track darkness and cold where he writes the light of my life is going out tonight as the Sun sinks in the West the light of my life is going out tonight with someone she just met that's pretty much the entire story of the song right there but there are moments where David implies that this person is not just a crush but someone who he is already romantically linked to as they're going out without a flicker of regret they're essentially cheating on him with with whether there's a I guess an acknowledgment of that or not I feel like many of these same sentiments are echoed on the track she's making friends I'm turning stranger as well where David literally depicts himself turning into the antisocial weirdo in a relationship while his significant other is a bubbly woman about town who everyone seems to like and of course David views this as like a growing gap between them as proof that like things are not functioning and he is not worthy of anything other than loneliness in pure silver Jews fashion David does bring some alt-country ballads that are so sad they hurt and his his lyricism allows you though to I guess laugh through the pain like on the song maybe I'm the only one for me instrumentally it sounds like something a bar band from I don't know down south or just in the middle of the desert might be rocking on on a weekend night meanwhile the lyrics show David really taking himself down a peg or two I'll put my dreams high on a shelf I'll have to learn to like myself and in maybe one of the wittiest lines of the year if no one's fond of fucking me maybe no one's fucking fond of me some of it is so good you will wish that you wrote it however you will not wish to be brought to the emotional place that drives you to think and feel this way and of course I don't say that to downplay David's unhappiness but just to acknowledge that a lot of people take songs like these as entertainment and just strictly entertainment without really analyzing or acknowledging the painfully sad emotion that may go into tracks and thoughts and feelings like these the song that's just the way I feel is more jaunty all country where David essentially opens the track up lyrically with a bit of an update that has brought him to this point where he is making a new record well I don't like talking to myself but someone's got to say he'll I mean things have not been going well this time I think I really fucked myself you see the life I live is sickening I spent a decade playing chicken with oblivion day-to-day I'm neck and neck with giving in I'm the same old wreck I've always been the refrain the thematic sentiment of the song to the end of all wanting is all that I've been wanting is kind of chilling and haunting as well not only in its desire for some kind of sweet serenity but when you analyze that line deeper it's pretty morbid to there are some points on this record where I think the lyrics are a bit too on-the-nose like on the track all my happiness is gone or on I loved being my mother's son which does have a very deeply moving sentiment to it but the lyrics of the song are so frank and so loose that it might as well be David just kind of saying these words off the top of his head like just stream-of-consciousness which for me personally is not as desirable as some of the more tightly written poetry he features on other points of the record on the song snow is falling in Manhattan the production in my view is a little off it's kind of washed out a little too reverb II I think a lot of the guts of David's songwriting and just again the instrumental generally is kind of lost in haze there are some other highlights on the record though like margaritas at the mall the very dark and a little dramatic horns on the course of this track are amazing the driving beat and colourful pedal steel in the instrumental as well are nice the lyrics of the song are essentially about living this sad absurd reality and just opposing that against the I guess inaction or non-existence of God these song nights that won't happen is the lengthiest track on the entire record it is absolutely haunting in its dissection of death and how the suffering is mainly done by the people that pass on loved ones leave behind I've been listening to David's music for a long time that and the music of many artists who he's inspired over the years like Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes but this is one of the most profoundly sad songs I think David has ever written or even inspired over the course of his career his steady vocals on the track make him feel like a trusty narrator across this meditation on death but simultaneously there are points in his singing where he gets a bit shaky like he's just on the verge of breaking down overall I think this is a very solid and enjoyable effort from purple mountains I hope that David doesn't disappear into the ether for a long time once again Andy continues to stay engaged with music because this was a really great return a tree I would say for any David Berman or silver juice fan up until this point what this album brings is yes kind of predictable nothing too risky or outside of the norm but it is done well the songs for the most part are very good the instrumentals have a very lovely and tasteful country folk flair there are a couple of songs I do think are semi duds in the tracklist yes but I am still feeling a light too decent eight on this thing loved it transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a nother video that you can check out hit that up or the

pjJY53aXvuE,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for another edition of the why you know review where I go over a series of Records gauntlet style that I didn't necessarily get a chance to review in full formally over the past month or so so we are just kind of boxing them all in and bringing it all together here in this video segment so you know what it is here we are let's go ba-bam after listening to this new Black Keys record I wouldn't say I would not tell you I would not utter the words that rock music is dead but I think you could certainly use this album to make the case that it really needs a vacation right now it needs to take a break reconnect with some friends and just take a little bit of me time because while yes I would say this album as far as some of the guitar licks some of the drum beat some of the production it does have a bit more bite than their last full-length album which was bland as hell forgettable as hell and their worst record yet yes this one does have a little bit more bite to it but the songwriting is just as uninspired as it was on the last album Dan our backs vocals have somehow gotten more solace on this one and I don't know why so yeah I was I was I wasn't really into this one [Music] the new Charlie bliss record is one that I was looking forward to quite a bit when I was initially enjoying some of the singles leading up to the release of this album but I was disappointed to hear that the rest of the record didn't really pan out in my opinion I mean it's not a bad album but I wouldn't say there was anything about it that really stuck out to me is special either I would say this thing kind of brought the band out of the mud of this throwback 90s rock nostalgia and now they're embracing a bit more indie and synth pop and that's fine on the tracks where the songwriting is a lot punchier and more solid but for the most part I just see this as a solid pop rock record nothing more nothing less not a whole lot of bells and whistles or distinct qualities about it I would even say the vocals seem a bit more toned down on this one than they were on the last record it's okay I just thought it was okay the latest LP from the bad pile indie and post hardcore outfit pile I was somewhat underwhelmed by the group's last full-length album I thought it didn't quite have as much teeth or as memorable songs as their album dripping which was the first record of theirs that I covered this latest one over here I am liking the more aggressive tone I'm liking the more explosive performances on this one I'm also liking some of the more political undertones and overtones of the lyrics on this one as well the issue with this album though in my opinion is that the production isn't all that great the recording is very very very rough and I don't think it's complimented at all by the more aggressive performances on this thing because it leads to a lot of sound bleed a lot of noise a lot of competing bits of instrumentation that just don't translate all that well which is kind of sad which is kind of unfortunate because merely from a standpoint of again just the performances and some of the writing on here this could have potentially been one of the group's most exciting records yet but I feel like a lot of the wind gets taken out of those sales by just how rough the sound is this new EP from coffee is shaping up to be one of my favorites of the year and she is essentially a reggae artist but of course she feeds this genre through more modern production meaning yeah there's like some trap influences on this record but even with that it still sounds very much like a reggae album you know it's it sounds like a reggae record it's a little darker a little Moody err more digital than a lot of the classic stuff but she's a good singer a good songwriter and I feel like she updates the genre in a way where it doesn't really lose touch with its roots but it sounds fresh it sounds like it could appeal to people who might not be that familiar with the genre or want to hear something that is a lot closer in style or tone to all the other music they listen to [Music] why is Sugar Ray coming out with a record titled little yachty what the hell is wrong with them [Music] the new gold link album is one that I'm a bit torn on for one I do appreciate that it is gold links most versatile album yet not only are you getting those elements of hip house but also pop rap also dance hall also afro beat music and that's all cool some of the production on this album is actually awesome to the Tyler the Creator feature is cool they push a T feature on this thing is fantastic as well generally the guests are impressive but continually goldlink is the least interesting thing about his own music I love that he continues to bring together these sounds and bringing together these voices that that really at this point no other artist is but as a singer and as a rapper I think he's just merely okay so I don't know I guess I'll continue to try to keep tabs in hopes that eventually his vocals and his songwriting really resonate with me but in the meantime there are only some elements of gold links music that I think are all that interesting [Music] don't make me do it I don't what to do it don't make me do it I don't what to do it the new Holy Ghost album certainly I guess my least favorite Holy Ghost album so far I mean it's a passable cent pop album not a bad record by any means but the production in comparison with their other work is so washed out so reverb heavy a lot blander I much prefer the instrumentation that they used to employ when they were affiliated with DFA records but not so much these days I guess the latest LP over here from Earth is a kind of interesting change of pace from the legendary drone outfit spearheaded by none other than Dylan Carlson he essentially strips the sound of the band back to simply his guitar and drummer Adrian Davies it's so skeletal and it's so basic it's it's difficult to really understand I mean from the standpoint of someone who's who's enjoyed a lot of the band's records in this aesthetic records that came post hex I guess this album provides a bit of a peek under the hood you're hearing what Dylan Carlson's compositional process is like at its most simple and basic and and route elements the approach taken here to my ears just seems too reductive Oh another album from Houston rapper Maxo cream that I have been getting a lot of requests to cover and talked about and I did enjoy a few of the songs leading into this album but once again a Maxo cream project does not really click with me at all and I can't really explain why outside of saying yes occasionally he does drop a good tune picks and interesting or a creative beat but I just think his talent level and his style is incredibly averaged there's not a whole lot about Maxo cream that feels defining not a lot about what he does that says to me yes that is a Maxo cream song or that is a maxima cream flow or that is a Maxo cream kind of delivery it just seems like he's very so-so I'm not saying he's like your average Trapp rapper who's making just like really trendy crap that's totally flavorless and and dime-a-dozen I don't think that I think Maxo cream is trying to make something that is more substantive something deeper on a more artistic level but I feel like he's just falling short of actually achieving that at this point [Music] Orvil peck is an artist that I have been getting a lot of questions about and I've been returning to his new album over and over to try to hear in it what so many of his fans are hyping up but I'm just not I'm just not getting it and it's sad because I do think on a conceptual level what Peck is doing is pretty cool he is effectively a country artist he's on Sub Pop Records and he is a little artsy with it he is mysterious it is country music but with a weird eerie theatrical veneer and all of that is amazing however I just think the songs are bland and the vocals kind of stink as far as singing on a country album goes what Peck delivers here is incredibly mediocre and the fact that this record is kind of artsy or a little abstract with the country genre does not make up for it if you are heavy into or a die-hard for stoner metal stoner rock you are most likely going to want to check out this torch album it's pretty heavy the riffs are gargantuan the vocals do hit a few meditative states here and there their songwriting for a while has not been as catchy as it used to be and their creative peak in the 2000s again if this is a genre of music that you just have to hear every record in every band in I would give it a shot but in my opinion it's one of the Bands weaker moments and not exactly a shining example of how good this genre can be [Music] new drab majesty record is one that I've been getting a lot of questions about and it's not bad if you are heavy into goth revivalism you want to hear a goth record that brings in elements of synth pop and new wave and and frankly sounds incredibly anachronistic like it could have come from the 1980s then this is what you want to listen to the issue though is that I feel like drab Majesty is kind of like a dog that ends up catching the car when they're chasing it like he's grabbed on to the aesthetic he's grabbed on to the style he has it the goth synth-pop pastiche is there but then once that's achieved the songwriting is just okay the vocals are bland as hell and it just doesn't really stand out and as much as I appreciate that drab Majesty is bringing that back carrying that torch for a new generation comparing it to the classics that obviously inspire it it just doesn't really I don't know measure up I'm not really sure what you can say about the new banks album other than that it's the worst banks album so far [Music] new mr. motherfucking ex choir project it's one of his shortest yet the the beats are noisy and freakiest hell I will give it to the instrumentals on this one if you want to hear some totally whacked-out distorted wacky ass hip-hop beats like you you want to listen to this project it's insane sadly though on the lyrical front on the flow front on the songwriting front ex choirs either falling short of what would make this a great project or just kind of phoning in at about the quality level that he typically does which at times is pretty good I don't know in some respects an average project but again on the instrumental side this thing is batshit insane new fuming mouth record it's a pretty brutal and heavy and pummeling combination of death metal a bit of metalcore in there too I I would say even though this album is 34 minutes and it thrashes it bashes it is just like a total mosh fest once you've heard like maybe five tracks off of it you you've you've really heard nearly every track off of it you've heard everything you need to hear from this album there's not much to be gleaned from hearing the rest of the record because it is so one-dimensional so I don't know as much as I think the band does have again a very brutal a very fun very muscular and badass take on this combination of sounds I wish they were a bit more versatile with it where that their songs or riffs were a bit catchy er to make the experience of sitting through an album that's so OneNote more enjoyable I could certainly understand the temptation to take Marissa Nadler very eerie nasally voice throw tons of reverb on it and then pair that with these droning heavy noisy guitars it's certainly a very cool prospect but I'm not sure if it's gripping for more than a track or two really new petha scene mixtape bosky 3.5 which is confusing to me because usually the the point 5 version of something comes after the the original sort of hole number that was never a bosky 3.0 or 3 and yeah for the most part that seems like another very one-dimensional angry short mm banger filled soundcloud record with absolutely no lyrical substance no songwriting talent is just like you know her generally I'm just kind of shocked at how little commits the scene has actually evolved or progressed since his last project and just how stale he is making this aggressive breed of soundcloud rap sound at this point [Music] new LP from black metal legends Darkthrone yes they are back with another album the sort of continues in their recent succession of records that bring together elements of classic black metal with heavy metal it's not bad I just wouldn't say it stands out all that much amongst their last several albums that do mostly the same thing some of the lengthier songs do get a little monotonous but still if you want to hear some heavy metal type riffs and songwriting applied with a grim black metal aesthetic give it a shot [Music] rapper to baby has been turning quite a few heads as of late and I can't deny that I was kind of hyped to see him on the double XL freshman cover recently that I have enjoyed a majority of the features that I've heard him appear on on a few records so because of that I went into this album expecting something that was a little bold a little brash a little fun kind of your standard meat-and-potatoes somewhat flashy somewhat badass trap record and I guess he achieves that in a sense on here he's certainly capable rapper but I think a lot of the instrumentals he picks on this thing are very dime a dozen very run-of-the-mill his hooks are a little weak on this thing generally and for track after track after track after track he doesn't really switch it up all that much or paint much in the way of a character portrait of himself across this album so to simplify it what really held me back from loving this record was that it was just incredibly one-dimensional and that's a [Music] 
RjriHA-MLPg,hi everyone so that you sad tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new chance to rap or album the big day this is the new album from Chicago singer-songwriter rapper and also kick cat sales rep chance the rapper aka Chancellor Jonathan Bennett here it is the big day the day that one of modern hip hop's most beloved figures finally comes out with their debut full-length commercial album because believe it or not up until this point chance has sustained this incredibly high profile in the hip hop community just off of free albums and mixtapes tenday coloring book acid rap and even now chance still seems to be doing it without a label as the big day is self released now look I've never been a huge chance the rapper fan a chance the rapper Stan but I did enjoy coloring book quite a bit I thought chance put out a lot of good singles in 2018 generally I think the guy is one of the more standout exciting and one-of-a-kind rappers in the current field the way he fuses elements of hip-hop and jazz and soul and gospel are pretty cool when he's doing it on a quality track generally the man's verses are pretty poetic his pen game is good so going into this album chance has style he has personality he has flow he has lyrical ability he most likely has a budget and a mountain of producers stumbling over each other to work with him so going into this I had no reason to expect anything other than just a quality album but God sweet Lord baby Jesus that is not that is not what we got the big day is essentially a 22 track torture chamber with 77 minutes of runtime lots and lots of features some of which are kind of bad corny skits offensive vocal performances and honestly chances worst bars to date the worst ones on nearly every track here I can give this album some light praise on some of the features being pretty good too baby meagan the stallion nicki manaj all of whom brings some decent guests versus there were also some instrumentals here that I thought were pretty cool but what chance offers vocally and lyrically on these tracks is so off the mark so obnoxious so excruciating that it completely just cancels out any positive aspects this album has going for it it's not merely that we have good features and good beats and chants himself is underwhelming or not really standing out or he's just you know a little boring this time around no that is not what is happening here I wish that is what was happening here I was dreading doing this review because it means having to go over most if not all of the terrible ideas that chance has to offer on this thing but I think this album's biggest problems can be boiled down to two major issues one we have these weird genre and guest fusions that don't really come together all that well that mostly sound like a mess it seems like chances trying to prove himself as a kanye protege who can essentially bridge these musical and cultural gaps between hip hop and indie and about a dozen different other genres and orchestrate it in a way where it all comes together harmoniously but instead what we get on this record are tracks like roux which sound like chance is trying to incorporate these same cold electronic flat aesthetics that Lupe was trying to apply to his infamous album lasers I thought the small cocoa rosy appearance on the track was kind of cool though there's also the opener all day long which sounds like a very peppy mix of synth funk in electro and rap and gospel it's like a kid that just won't stop jumping around stop stop calm down please instrumentally the title track sounds like a bad acoustic trippy b-side from The Flaming Lips discography and the song found a good one is likely the worst hip house song ever recorded ever it's also one of a few moments on this record where chance is actively trying to throw back to a more nostalgic time embracing hip house embracing older shades of R&B there's even an instrumental here that suddenly breaks into a Juke breakdown but even when he switches his musical backdrop chants lyrically and vocally still manages to fall flat on his face the other major issue I have with this record if I didn't already make it clear its chances singing his rapping his lyrics explaining how god-awful a vast majority of the writing on this album is is difficult because chance isn't just throwing out one or two or even four bad bars in a song or in a verse essentially he dish gallops or overwhelms whoever's listening with all these painfully mediocre bars the opening verse on the first track alone is filled with landmines if you blink you might miss it you got a click it or ticket life is short as a midget but mine's a little LeBron I'm about to book a show at the dimmsdale dimmadome and shout out to miss Sylvia Rhone we get along but that boy advance got to be bigger than Diddy Kong he knows Diddy is the small one right Donkey Kong is the big one or is he saying the advance was small and he wants it big and he's he's insulted by it I really don't know it's not a very good simile I need stock and it got to be pipi long are we serious my next tour it got eight legs like daddy long what the hell are these similes the Charlie's Cologne line in this opening verse just sounds like straight-up product placement and it's not just bad writing on this record which there is a lot of obviously but there are also plenty of tracks where chance goes just disgustingly sentimental like on the track do you remember with none other than Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie Fame instrumentally the track just sounds like a mclemore song thematically it sounds like a Macklemore song with just lots and lots of bars that feel underneath chances Penn the song eternal is even worse it's a track essentially about how side chicks and side dudes aren't as good as what you have at home they can't cook this good they can't take out splinters and not that I'm advocating for infidelity or cheating here but who is this track trying to fool it doesn't feel like a genuine expression of love but more like a an attempt to stamp out this nagging temptation and I feel like those suspicions are confirmed as chance seems to go into some lies and some transgressions that he addresses on the track we go high but sticking with eternal there's also a completely comatose feature from Smee no on the track that just doesn't go over that well then we have the track hot shower more like hot garbage this song features some of the worst bars chances ever recorded point-blank period and look there are some rappers that would sound amazing going this ridiculous yes no denying that but nothing chance says on this track is even remotely funny most of the time it's like he's just trying too hard to be weird I don't want to sit and argue good burger should have taught you we all dudes I'm all professional and proper but my baby mom has stopped me in a meeting skirt skirt just to air drop me some nudes not only is this a track we're chance essentially just BS is his way through a track bead but this is one of many moments here where a guest rapper handily outdoes him and there's also the track slide around featuring Nicki Minaj where I would much rather listen to Nicki rap on this beat than chance though I do find it kind of weird that both of them at one point sort of rip off the drake kiki do you love me flow lyrically there's just no relief at any point on this album i think the the longest-running lyrical oasis was maybe the first few minutes of five-year-plan but outside of that nearly nothing nearly nothing the track we go high which in that songs defense it does have some pretty musical passages on it but then we get we give the glory to you God one living true God he make us booyah pretty sure I need you in the season like a flu shot my wife nanny like Fran Drescher three damn Grammys my granny like no pressure fuck going straight to the pros I'm Pro fessor and there are moments on this thing we're just the sound of chances voice is unbearable and look there are songs in the past where I felt that way like on 10 day or acid rap which I noted in my review of that tape however I did think that he was on the mend with that sort of thing when it came to coloring book but now it's like it's it's gotten worse than ever like on the track I got you always and forever which is sad because I do love the shimmering glamour R&B throw back the instrumental provides but when chance pops in on this track he's got this squeaky ass voice this terrible flow that seems just like a ripoff of shaggy or Bone Thugs it just makes me cringe so hard I feel like my teeth are gonna grind down to nothing the most aggravating moments on this record of which there are many are the tracks that sound like hey this has a pretty good start this could go somewhere this has potential this almost sounds good but then at some point chance does something to just rip that away whether it be with terrible singing terrible bars flat production a bad guest the bucket freaked out on the title track which is cringe as hell sounds like a bad Death Grips impression on that same title track Francis and the lights has a guest vocal appearance which is pretty awful too it's like he's in a competition with chance to see who can do the worst vocal and the worst impression on this track he sounds like boney bears less talented cousin Don Ivor there's also the sudden peanut butter jelly time references on the track Balin flossin the totally sucky flat vocal production on the track let's go on the run not to mention the opening lines hey there lovely sister won't you come home to your mister I've got plants do oh good guess yeah I've got plants do hug and hug you oh good I just feel like I'm non-stop ranting about how trash the lyrics are on this record but that's literally like all I can do they're really bad the songs and ease and fools is an attempt at trying to create this epic gargantuan closer with lots of group vocal samples with West African drums some smooth and moody synths as well the whole thing sounds like what you would get if you forced at gunpoint tune-yards and Kanye to collaborate on a beat and it just came out really crummy which is not the only point on this record where chances obviously copying Kanye mind.you chances bars are weak on this track as well and he allows Nicki Minaj to tie the last verse of the song and the end of this album up I do appreciate that she tries to address the album's themes of love and marriage and family but I don't know man it just kind of seems like he's letting her have the last word when it really should be his chance I think should be making some kind of attempt at summing this record up this mess of a record up in some way shape or form and he just doesn't because there isn't a way to because this album is a pile of slop I now see why the album on here I now see why it's clear because I see right through this BS there are other points I guess I could go over like the weird licensing bars on the track Sun come down or the lifeless singing and super bland production and non song that is delivered on the track town on the hill but really what's the point at this point there are so many terrible ideas written and employed on this record it's either falling short because the the bass concept is terrible or it's just been carried out in an awful way I did not love a single song from this album not one single track there were moments where I caught a breath of like oh that's maybe could be could be decent but it just did not pan out and considering how long this record is and how consistently unbearable a lot of it is I just don't know what to say I am genuinely feeling like a strong zero on this record it's like a strong zero to a light one the strong zero to a light one boom boom boom boom boom boom hey you did a lot say negative reviews and you unlocked a super special reviewer challenge item no no none I'm not interested in that behold I give to you the Infinity flannel it's got how the flannel colors that Reds in the greens and the whites and then

xg9JtJJ11nc,hi everyone no Hannah here and it's time for a review of the new Dorian Elektra album flamboyant this is the new debut album from up-and-coming pop artist Dorian Elektra I first heard of Dorian back in 2017 when they made a little vocal appearance on one of Charli xcx's recent mixtapes her pop to tape but that performance would not prepare me for what I was going to hear down the road on this album I really had no expectations going into this LP because I didn't really listen to any of the the teaser tracks to it trying this thing was really just a shot in the dark after I had seen some musicians who I follow on social media giving it some praise and saying hey this is amazing this is awesome oh my god it was mostly Slater though shout out to Slater I was also pulled in by the artwork on this one I mean it's a kind of beautifully strange alluring image the stare the peculiar makeup the spiked collar and the rough is this a BDSM anime taking place in the 16th century plus there are also some producers affiliated with the album whose work I've enjoyed before Robo kid boomer ooh also Dylan Brady of 100 x fame so given the cast of characters involved with this record so far it should be no surprise that Dorian's music fits pretty snugly into this trend of bright fast hyper neon-colored futuristic bubblegum bass enhanced pop music with some touches of electro and dance pop as well I should also note that Dorian's voice which was a little off-putting for me at first does have an androgynous quality to it almost reminding me of planning to rock in that respect it took some adjusting too and obviously it is an intentional sound that is adding to the character portrait that Dorian is building on this record now I'm not exactly sure how it's achieved listening back to Dorian's past 2016-2017 singles the vocals did to come off kind of girly especially on tracks like Latakia who's instrumental is pretty straightforward synth-pop in comparison the tracks on flamboyant are like on another planet dorian electro might as well be an entirely different artist at this point there are a few examples of vocalizations and inflections that i think maybe just sound too goofy mostly on the track daddy like daddy love the lyrics on this tracker also amongst the most repetitive on the album - I guess the vocals also get pretty freaky and out there on the track musical genius as well with its yelling its straining its incessant auto-tune on this track Dorian ends up sounding like a glitch in the matrix screaming for help but I do actually love how over the top the vocals on this track are especially since it does play into the creative concept of the song itself as it's pretty much a statement on Fame Museum ago once I got adjusted to Dorian's voice on this record though the true appeal of this album revealed itself pretty quickly we have lots of tight detailed colorful production super sharp songwriting incredible melodies and hooks and some pretty interesting and consistent lyrical themes on this record revolving around masculinity gender politics Dorian is so thorough in their explanation of these ideas you could almost say it's a concept album whether you're talking about mr. to you which is pretty much a statement on gender identity or the track career boy which is a future present anthem about the stereotype of men essentially being tied to their careers their jobs their success at their job essentially becomes that their their self-worth should also mention this track has one of the best courses on the entire record career die song man to man is a genius track about man on man aggression violence but it's also a track about vulnerability - and the lyrics I just can't get enough of you know I ain't straight but i'ma say it straight to you man to man hand-to-hand one-on-one friend to friend so in this song the phrase man to man can be interpreted as the fight about but it could also be a heart-to-heart which is cute the song topics on this thing are so creatively funny and and clever the song guyliner is a hilarious track about women finding this male figure mysterious interesting attractive merely because he wears eyeliner I'm a guy don't be surprised if I take my time to clam arise also there's this amazing quality to the track like many songs coming out of the PC music camp where it just feels like it's doing a bit of a satirical interpretation of 2000's electro pop or dance pop it's gussied up to the point where it almost becomes a super flamboyant parody and as silly as that seems on the surface on a deeper level it's actually incredibly serious because it's so well crafted it's so well done and it's so sharp in the ideas is trying to put forward in terms of just its messaging its humor what it's trying to explain topically Dorian also lays the LGBTQ themes on pretty heavily with the track Adam and Steve the rumbling growling beat on this one feels slightly industrial at points the breathy dramatic vocals that dorian brings into the fold feel like something off of an old goth record but of course the very digital bubblegum bass aesthetics keep the track feeling five years ahead of the curve the lyrics deal pretty directly in stigma surrounding queer sexual orientations feeding that through a religious lens with the adam and steve title obviously then there's the closer freaky for life which I do enjoy for its sentiment of being yourself flying your freak flag hi essentially being unashamed of who you are to me is an idea that sums up most of this album's concepts I hear what they call me I hear what they say I'm not very cool yeah but I'll never change I'll stick to my guns then throw them away I'm a freak forever from my cradle to my grave and there are points where yeah maybe the messaging and the attitude of this record isn't very cool cuz it's too busy being so freaking random but again a track like this makes sense given that it truly does live up to the descriptor of freaky I will loop it back to the instrumentals at this point as they are consistently groovy and sound rich and incredible and fun I love the pounding Morse code kicks and the glassy synths on the track mr2 you there are also some tension building filters on this track too it just feels like a great piece of weirdo dance pop the songs career boy and man to man in many respects are just classic synth pop anthems but they are elevated with super punchy soaring high velocity dance pop choruses the song musical genius is an absolute freak show with these very regal piano passages and just abrasive bits of distortion and auto-tune it's like I'm listening to many genres at once just collapsing on top of each other in a very absurd ugly but also hilarious way a lot of the beats here not only work from a pop perspective but occasionally from an experimental music perspective - like the bridge to the song emasculate it's like the track has suddenly turned itself inside out and it is now this cyberpunk Noise Pop banger I also turn to the title track of this album - which by comparison with other cuts here is a lot more sensual it's pretty much a self affirming song about not wanting to be told what to do and essentially having no taste for subtlety hence being flamboyant this album is pretty short and sweet at 30 minutes and change it's pretty much just one pot banger with a weirdo Flair after another that is not only forward-thinking but also I think distills and solidifies a lot of what has been making bubblegum base so interesting over the past few years but now it's just been condensed into a very front to back entertaining album with a lot of apt gender politics inserted into the lyrics so I'm absolutely loving this easily one of my favorite pop records of the year I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana during Elektra forever

you get something we get something everyone's happy all right let's move into the worst tracks of the week the worst tracks of the week the least the least favorites first one is this new one from trippy red mac-10 featuring little baby and little Duke yeah there's not really much to this one it's kind of structurally a mess the features are weak trippy red I don't think brings enough to the track and it just doesn't really have much flavor or direction there's not really a tune or a song to or a flow to it that's all that memorable or catchy it's just like a quick thrown together two minute song that doesn't really have much substance or memorability or anything the only saving grace of the track is the weirdly woozy and kind of experimental beat but it's it's not enough to carry the song and is not enough alright moving on from their Third Eye Blind they are back I mean they're back their new single over here isn't all that good they're just kind of making stereotypically epic millennial rock music at this point with Alexis Krauss of sleighbells fame god I've reviewed them enough times Thank You Anthony Slade little exes crowds of sleigh bells and her vocals actually aren't bad on the track I like her inclusion in the song it does add some dynamics to the track generally but I don't know this is not really the kind of I guess I guess rock music that Third Eye Blind plays all that well you know I don't really think they're all that good at doing this I mean I maybe could be a little biased because I don't typically care for this very bland overblown overly dramatic style of rock that again sort of pervades a lot of popular music circles in the millennial era but yeah I'm not not into hearing Third Eye Blind to it either all right moving on from there Tegan and Sara have come through with a very bad pop rock tune on their newest single I'll be back someday it's uh it's not very good so yeah all right moving on there we have a new track from chance the rapper here get a bag it's uh easily one of the most popular tracks off of his new record I'm not gonna go too deep into it honestly because I'm going to be reviewing this album very soon but it's it's not looking too good so far I will say that that's all I will say all right dark side brand new single from none blink-182 and it's yeah the band's really kind of watering their pop punk sound down to the point where it's just very bland super cleanly produced alternative rock with absolutely no soul to whatsoever so what else is new and we had Big Sean who has released two singles this week we have overtime single again and both are unbelievably boring a little sad to hear him go backwards a little bit on these new tracks as it felt like he was kind of on a creative uptick a little bit on his last full-length album but yeah I think we might be in for a very bland Big Sean album though most of his records are kind of bland so I didn't really know what else I expected all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of meh wasn't really blown away by these songs but they are worth mentioning they are worth shouting out they are linked down below along with all these other tracks so if you want to hear them for yourselves give them a try we have the archer brand-new track from Taylor Swift was not as cringy as her other singles so far a bit of a washed out 80 synth pop flare to the instrumental Jack Antonoff of a bleachers Fame had a hand in the production it's it's not bad it's not bad I guess you could say it's the best single so far we also have a new single from Ross from friends electronic music producer who has come together with a bit of a house single here that is slightly glitchy and experimental it's a little off the wall there are some elements of I guess the sampling that to me feel a little redundant by the time the track has ended but it's not bad it's cool it's groovy Rick Ross new single with Drake that is trying to be super reflective and pensive but just ends up slightly slightly boring we also have a new track from portico quintet jazz outfit new jazz outfit jazz fusion outfit Portico quintet they have come through with a pretty linear Jam this time around it's dramatic it has some nice high points some low points that are a very tension building it's smooth it's futuristic and has a lot of atmosphere on it it's not bad we also have Matata me who has come through with a brand new single over here walking in the dark can't say I care too much for how quiet the song is it sounds like it's in this perpetual state of in trowing something bigger but yet it doesn't really I wish it was a I don't know it kind of pumped up the volume a little bit at some point I don't quite get the extreme subtlety of the song not that that is always a bad thing but I don't think it plays out too well on this particular track and we also have a little skies who came through with somewhat generic but kind of catchy little trap ballad over here with going off what I will say is that the flow is good the flow is good I do think he beats the flow like a dead horse by the time the track is over it's it's really just been kind of running to the ground a little bit but I will say the flow is stand out and it does make this track instantly catchy and we also have Liam Gallagher who has come through with a solid ballad that's maybe a little overly sentimental over here which he is titled once that's it's kind of nostalgic it's a trip down memory lane of sorts but it's not too bad it's not too bad we also have jakey of the nakey jakey youtube-channel who has dropped his a new big single not dead yet I did a full-length review for this track over on the Fantana channel you could check it out there if you want my in-depth thoughts on it but yeah if you kind of like Moody washed out pop music with a big beat and somewhat dramatic vocals you know if you're a Joe G fan I think you will get into this quite a bit it's not too bad you know I didn't I didn't know Jake had it in him you know and and he's been coming out with music for a while on Bandcamp and stuff so you know not to act like the guys just like ah now that he's popular on YouTube he's doing music now he's been making music for quite a while so alright tendo we have high on fire with this track bat salad which they have but they have released it digitally it's been around if you picked it up as a Record Store Day single it's kind of like a a very heavy powerful sludge metal AM you know instrumental it's okay it's alright it's not bad we also have this new track over here from DJ shadow featuring none other than De La Soul it's titled rocket fuel it's pretty fun I mean I don't think De La Soul or DJ shadow on this track you know do they really sound like spring chickens are they on the cutting edge not really but I will say compared to many of their contemporaries they they still got a strong pulse going you know you check them for that blood pressure it's looking good you must be eating your Cheerios in the morning you got you guys our fight and fit so it's a fun track it's fun track give it a try if you want to hear kind of a zani creative chemistry chemically engineered beat with some fun De La Soul flows on top give it a shot and we also have this new track over here from dive yes the kind of dream rocky shoegaze ii rock band that was once one of the biggest indie darlings on the scene dive they are back with a new new record on the way skin games the name of this brand new track personally I thought it was kind of bland I mean it did bring forth some light elements of sonic experimentation and kind of a shoegaze e-wallet sound for the most part it just sounds like a very strung out very run-of-the-mill indie rock track you know run-of-the-mill for this decade anyway I'm not liking it too much and we also have Denzel curry here with a brand new single Shawshank with one mr. Tate ko bang featured on the track um can't say I was super into this one I mean it sort of goes it's got a lot of attitude but in comparison with tracks off of his recent zoo record the songwriting is not really there I feel like the structures not really there a few of denzel's flows are good the beat is kind of zany but it's it's really really really a short track that I think could have used a bit more building out and some more memorable ideas packed into it we also have Bat For Lashes who has been gearing up a new album release with yet another single this new one over here has a bit more of a pulse than her last track it's a kind of a straightforward electro pop song that's a little moody a little atmospheric it's not blowing me away but it's not doing a whole lot for me either the track is titled feel for you give it a try if you're a bit of a an electro pop fiend and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the ones that really left an impression on me we have a brand new track and single from the dance music project known as yacht and they are bringing together more awesome amazing danceable weirdness with some I don't know left-field vocals and a great groove this track is keidel is titled scatter head I highly recommend it loved it quite a bit also loved this new track from the 1975 which is a bit of an unorthodox track and single release as it's mostly just a soundscape set to a speech about climate change that's literally what it is you know I make no if ifs ands or buts about it that is what it is but it's still it's still a moving moment and a bold move from one of the more popular bands out there right now and honestly I would love to see more artists kind of you know taking the initiative and speaking out on more social issues in this way obviously it's it's not artists job to do this it's it's really the job of our politicians to be addressing these issues and I feel like listeners and viewers of this segment should be doing what they can and what they feel they should do to voice their opinions to their elected officials so that they address issues that people actually have an issue with but yeah I mean it it's nice to see a group like 1975 every once in a while address a problem that is a real problem that we really do need some action on globally at this point all right we have Rico nasty with the track time flies which sort of throws it back to the glossy er more auto-tune infused tracks that some fans might remember if they listened back to her sugar trap days it's a pretty good single I think it's one of her better tracks in this style it's got a smooth flow the auto-tune enhances Rico's voice quite a bit the beat is is sweet I did a full-length review of this over on the Fantana channel so if you want full thoughts on that more thoughts check them out over there we had this brand-new track from the OCS the band has been building up to another album release this one over here is titled heartworm and it is I don't know it's insane it's just kind of I admire the band's gutsiness on this track it is one of the noisiest tracks I think the band is put out in quite a while so if you want to hear that psych garage punk blend they typically bring to the table but with a very abrasive and freaky I guess a veneer on it then give this track a shot we also have Sol Town Road yes little nods ex did it again he remix this song one more time with a rap monster with that BTS connection on this track and it's not bad I like the remix quite a bit I actually prefer it to the the Billy Ray Cyrus remix in all honesty I don't know how many more times this dude is going to remix the song but I will say I welcome it I welcome it you know a rap monster I think did his thing on the track sounds pretty solid and just looking forward to seeing this song really just kind of let just tiptoe over that of that mark where it is now tied with the other longest-running number-one songs of all time in pop music history this track is gonna be the longest-running single of all time longest-running number-one single of all time this track is gonna be it this song is gonna be it the song is gonna be gonna be doing it this is gonna be the one so let's go all right and we also have idk who is back AKA jay IDK with a brand new track 24 it is a banger it is a banger his lyrics on this track are funny and clever and witty it's also attached to a very weird music video loving this dude's creativity as of late so idk keep it up also we have a dykes to watch out for dump him if you want to try out some radical fun and pumped up pop punk with some fun vocals and a lot of attitude give this one a shot liking this one quite a bit liking it quite a bit we also have this new track over here from none other than Caroline pull a check of chairlift Fame we have another single from her new album ocean of Tears is the name of this new track and I'm liking how Caroline is taking a pretty creative approach to art pop so far on these new tracks so I don't know man just truly and honestly album I am looking out for I am really looking out for this record I'm really looking for this one because track so far have been good tracks so far have been very good so if you are an art pop fiend you want to hear something that's kind of dramatic kind of powerful with a lot of space and I don't know just kind of a Jenna sequa this track it should give this track a try alright we have a couple more we have this track sunglasses from a band that I am just now learning about this week Black Country new road and it is a cross between indie rock experimental rock spoken word it's got numerous passages to it it's very tense I don't know guys I kind of felt I kind of feel like this is um this is a band to watch out for I got a few suggestions to try this out in my Twitter acts and I was like okay sounds really weird let me give it a try and was not disappointed was not disappointed by by what the band had brought forward with this track so sunglasses hell yeah sunglasses alright let's move on from there we also have this track from Alex Wyllie rapper Alex Wyllie who maybe some of you haven't heard from in a while he's got a brand new single out with none other than Mick jenkins it's titled FYI it's got a great beat it's got some awesome lyrics from Alex who proves himself to have aged pretty well I know he came into the game sort of young but he's whittier than ever I promise you and the mick jenkins feature on this track is quality as well so you know all around great things about this new cut and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching one more time I will remind you since you are at the end hit up these live shows if you are on the East Coast this August it's gonna be a good time and shout out once more to the good people over at little Ridge and yeah yeah you're the best you're the best you're the best you're the best

QOwE58DvVQ8,ah hi everyone Santana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new lingua egg not a record Caligula this is the newest full-length album from composer multi-instrumentalist singer noise Nick Kristen hater aka linguae egg not a hater first started turning heads back in 2017 with the originally self release all bitches die one of the most abrasive and unforgiving albums of the year and even though I didn't do a formal review of this record I did give it a nod as one of the more underrated albums of 2017 and even though I wasn't crazy about this record from front to back I was very intrigued by língua ignacio's of noise and industrial and classical music I think the most obvious parallel that one could draw between linguae egg Nauta and another notable artists is diamanda galas who's insane vocal performances and groundbreaking contributions to the world of neoclassical darkwave certainly paved the way for Caligula but still this record feels like more of a spiritual successor of galas than it does a direct musical one aesthetically hater I would argue has more in common with many of her contemporaries on the darker and more experimental side of things pharmacon Chelsea Wolfe and of on house Wolfe but still manages to be on a wholly different wave than all of them there are moments on this album that feel one riff away from being a harsh brittle black metal song there are moments that make me feel like I'm listening to an industrially tinged goth opera I should also know this thing is very much not a metal album and somehow it is one of the most metal things I've heard all year this thing is uncompromising ly dark caustic tortured it is certainly more unsavory than your average brutal death metal album there is also a narrative concept behind the album - that I will get into later we have the song faithful servant friend of Christ which is an incredible tone setter for the album with its sweeping strings and droning vocal harmonies that sound like an ancient religious chant it somehow breezes by to by being just short of five minutes after this intro cut we get the incredibly powerful almost 10-minute do you doubt me traitor which starts off very subtly very quietly with a moody piano phrase supporting haters beckoning moans the low end of her vocal range is absolutely haunting on this track there's something almost androgynous about it at points too it's like I'm listening to a beast singing its way through the intro suddenly she introduces one of the most chilling refrains of the entire album say in say in said get beside me there is then another phase where it transforms into this disturbing wall of industrial base hits and shuffling creaking noise sinister pianos and animalistic screams that just give me goosebumps the angelic but cultish vocal harmonies at the very finish of the song or a bold way to end the piece to now nearly every track that runs past this one functions in a similar way presenting multiple phases smothering noise dramatic singing and pianos plus it all feels like it's playing out in a blood-red stage sitting at the base of the altar of Satan the song butcher of the world with its hellish screams and organs what also sounds like rumbling timpani x' of course these sounds come together in a very low five way to the point where all of the sounds just like crushing itself and bleeding into itself and just creating this brittle white noise landscape it's like the song is so noisy it's just caving in on itself the track eventually gained some beautiful clarity in the second half which is a nice change of pace you get more showy theatrical singing it's a beautiful and gorgeous way to end the track off may failure be your news presents a kind of interesting contrast and that we get these very regal piano arpeggios that are topped with some of the nastier and more bitter refrains across the entire record who will love you if I won't who will fuck you if I don't as the lyrics of the track draw on they get more morbid and disturbing may failure be a garment to wrap round you may failure be a belt with which to gird you may failure be a noose with which to hang you this portion is eventually complemented with these Roaring brittle bass tones that are not super crazy about but I absolutely love the transition that is made in the second half with these canyon sized bass tones just swallowing the entirety of the track crashing cymbals all these cascading vocal harmonies as well it's absolutely stunning especially as haters start singing everything burns down around me everything burns down easily one of the most harrowing moments I've had with an album this year this album also creatively incorporates throat singing on the track my fragrant mini flowered crown it's a bit of a cool down moment on the album one of the more compelling ballets here comparing it to the harsher moments on the record it's certainly prettier but what I want to point to on this track are some of the lyrics which I think tie in with the rest of the concept of the album what will you say of the bond we had tender comrade for I have learned that all men are brothers and brothers only love each other Brothers in Arms brothers in each other's arms all the love God would allow but all God's love means nothing now if you're reading into this and many of the other lyrics I guess in the same way that I am it seems pretty obvious that a bulk of this record is lamenting over the loss of I don't know a love romance some kind of personal connection which is nothing entirely new as far as album concepts go but really it's all in the execution because hatred presents all of this as if it is of biblical proportions with loads of religious imagery God Satan Christ the song if the poison won't take you my dog's wail kicks off with calls of Kyrie Ellison which translates from Greek as lord have mercy so again the religious iconography of this record runs pretty deep as do the feelings of suffering as a result of this very toxic experience that inspired this record to the point where hater on this song my dogs will is speaking directly to in her own mind convicted killer Aileen Wuornos in a way relating to the dark path that she took as a result of the physical and mental abuse that she suffered over the course of her lifetime saying eileen i only say this once i am the best friend you'll ever have all this all this is meaningless without me will you join me will you join me lay your life down so no man can take it the album truly does take you to hell and back during moments like these in the second half of the album i will say there are some hits and misses I do love the powerful noise funeral march on the track day of tears and mourning that's a pretty amazing spot on the record it's like something off of a the body album but much more melodic and easier on the ears in a way the track sorrow sorrow sorrow I do think could use a bit more direction the first leg is a little aimless there are some compelling vocals at the midpoint but afterwards it trails off a bit I also get the significance of the incorporation of these vocal snippets into the song they definitely add to the narrative of the track but their inclusion is a little awkward clashes with the instrumentation that is surrounding it and ruins what little momentum the song has going effing death-dealer is a so-so interlude not super crazy about it but I guess it does set the stage for the incredibly immense closing cut the song I am the Beast which conceptually seems to be hater accepting this label of a beast post this toxic situation and she's just embodying it at this point beast he named me beast I am I am grief her calls have come claiming in the first leg of this track cut deep they are sorrowful they also have I think a note of self-pity to them to all I want is boundless love all I know is violence instrumentally in vocally a lot of what we're hearing in the first portion of this song is pretty soaked with reverb it's pretty distant but that only intensifies the eventual climax in the latter half of the song which is aided by these heavy soul-crushing bass tones that are just uh so powerful also loving the despondent lead melodies and harsh screams it's a dirge that will bring all the Visigoths to the yard if there's one major con that isn't even really that much of a con I could say about the record generally it is the production which I wish was a bit more upfront occasionally not as hollowed out not as reverb heavy but I will say the way the aesthetics of this album run it does feel like I'm listening to something live in the moment organic something be at Racal something happening on a stage so in that respect it does create kind of a unique vibe for the album and when it does get noisy God does it get deliciously noisy outside of that and maybe a few tracks that I thought were a little underwhelming everything else about this record is a plus plus plus amazing edge-of-your-seat and deeply moving vocal performances the screams the cleans all incredibly impressive if you don't mind your singing with a bit of drama a bit of camp powerful beautiful crushing abrasive instrumentation hater certainly does a lot with a little on this record because it's not that heavily arranged it's not that lavish a bulk of the record is handled by her voice and her piano I also love the intriguing lyrics the concept is great the religious tie-ins are really cool it's definitely a lot to digest I'm not going to deny that and I think most listeners will be turned away right away but if you don't mind visiting the darkest corners of somebody else's mind through their music then what why not if maybe that's your thing you are going to want to listen to this because in my opinion this was pretty incredible I'm feeling a strong 82 a light 9 on this one

s_alotsHliA,hi everyone ha ha tanum here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new blood orange album angels pulse blood orange the music project founded by multi-instrumentalist producer singer and songwriter Devante Hinds there used to be a time when I was not really all that crazy about blood oranges music honestly and I really did truly dread the prospect of a new release but these days I do actually admire the intoxicating blends of art pop and R&B that he drops into his most recent records freetown sound and what I think is his best project to date Negro Swan and of course I'm excited to hear another helping of all of that but I still did go into this new project skeptically because it has been earmarked as not a proper album but a mixtape which does kind of communicate to the listener these days that they are in for something that is going to be rougher around the edges then what would normally be considered an album for a particular artist and how exactly that was going to work going into this record I wasn't entirely sure because as is Deb's music is already pretty loosely structured and impressionist but the saving grace of Deb's last couple of records especially Negro Swan is that even though each track isn't super well developed individually they all come together and reinforce each other to create a pretty awesome vibe yeah a great majority of the tracks on Angel's pulse aren't really all that well developed either there are a lot of shorties on here sudden endings basic structures v song Birmingham is a stunningly beautiful vocal and key interlude that would have been amazing if it were I don't know the intro or the start of something else but instead it just kind of feels like a loose idea that doesn't really progress anywhere so like on other recent blood orange releases dev does deliver some really interesting concepts and ideas and motifs but as an entire project they fail completely to come together cohesively in any sort of way as good as some moments on this mixtape are I do feel like I'm just listening to a random batch of loose ends which isn't a terrible idea when the ideas going into them are pretty decent the track I want to see you is a super killer piece of sensual low-key guitar pop with an amazing refrain the vibe of the song is you're being coddled lovingly by your biggest crush it's a vibe it's a sound it's a song that I wish lasted for ever honestly then we have dark and handsome featuring Toro y Moi which is actually a really cool crossover Chaz delivers a quirky little rap verse at about 233 that goes over relatively well structurally it's one of the meteor songs on the entire record and has a pretty sweet tune to it it's really just a glassy synth ballad with some very quality hooky vocal melodies I do think from here though the album does tend to get blander and blander on the song good for you the instrumental here is absolutely throwaway boring redo it it has no soul to it whatsoever even though Justine Skye does prove to be one of the best guest singers on the project these song baby Florence features this jittery forgettable be paired with vocals that are mixed way too low it leaves no impression on me whatsoever it just has a pretty vibe and that's about it I do commend ed though for occasionally on this mixtape using this as an opportunity to embark on some sounds that maybe you wouldn't find on your average blood orange album though like with the song gold teeth featuring project pat & gangsta boo of three 6 mafia fame which I don't think I need to explain is a really weird pairing dev places both of them on top of these dreamy keys and pianos and it actually ends up pretty amazing it's a solid beat we get a lot of gritty southern flows and lyrics guest singer touch comes in and offers some space vocal passages that kind of just bookend the verses and provide a nice bit of structure again this combination of voices is pretty weird and I didn't expect it to come together as well as it actually did I wish dev took more opportunities on this project to experiment this wildly I should also mention that ARCA Joba of Brock Hampton Fame as well as Justine Skye appear on the track take it back but the combination of voices and ideas isn't exactly fireworks it's actually one of the more boring and drawn-out songs of the entire record the Joba verse on the song is okay but it turns up at the very end maybe when it really means the least the instrumental on this thing mostly put me to sleep the vocals for a vast majority of the song just felt very detuned very comatose soulless it was like listening to your average blood orange song but it was just woozy to the point where it lost its direction lost its pulse what's even stranger is that even though there are so many short songs on this mixtape for whatever reason dev commits this song to like four minutes and change totally dwarfing a ton of much better but also much shorter songs in the tracklist happiness and Tuesday feeling are also not bad moments on the album either but it's not like they're fleshed out and developed to the point where they really warrant a listen outside of the context of the mixtape in many respects angel's pulse does feel like blood oranges most recent work but again that cohesion and that consistent pillowy dreamy enveloping aesthetic that made the magic work in the way that it did on Negro Swan it's just not here and it's been replaced by virtually nothing by comparison everything just seems so disconnected seems so half-baked seems like there's not really a whole lot of intention behind a lot of it dev is just throwing this out there to see what sticks quite a bit of it does but also a lot doesn't still I wouldn't say it's a terrible listen and I enjoyed it more than I didn't but honestly what I really wish at the end of the day is that dev took the best moments on this tape of which there are quite a few and just incorporated them into a proper album down the road instead of just like patting out time with this mediocre mixtape overall it's fine it's passable as a tape but I just from here looking forward to the future for when there is another more ambitious blood orange album and that's it I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this mixtape a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please

N_j3OPCpRvA,hahaha hi everyone career boy Hannah here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big KRIT album crit is here this is the newest full-length album from songwriter rapper singer producer mr. Big KRIT he is a Mississippi native and over the past decade he has proven himself to be one of the most talented and consistent voices out of the south and I feel like he's moving into this next project with an acknowledgement of the progression that he's made over the past 10 years or so with the title of this album being crit is here as opposed to the title of the breakout mixtape that put him on the map originally crit was here to me that says an artist is attempting to make a career-defining statement I went into this project hoping for that I would love crit to end this decade off on a very strong note especially considering some of the low points in his discography that brought him to this point where his attempts at a mainstream crossover didn't quite pan out even with the full force of Def Jam Records behind his work with live from the underground Cadillac tikka in 2017 crit dropped what was arguably his best album so far an ambitious double LP of songs that were his grandest and most dynamic yet so I'm curious to hear where he would go from this album especially since the teaser tracks to this new record I didn't really find to be all that exciting it mostly sounded like Kurt was going to make yet another commercial run with a couple of songs that were just bland as hell and didn't really showcase what made him significant as an artist the song crit here the intro of the record is a pretty amped start up to the album with its very excited rapping with its chipmunk soul samples with its pummeling beat but the skittering high hats and steady scent bass as well as the forgettable hook leave a lot to be desired and then we have the song addiction featuring sweetie as well as little Wayne and I imagine it's a pretty huge moment for crit to get a Wayne feature on a record but I mean this track is about as formulaic or as by-the-numbers as modern pop rap gets gotta say there are a couple other tracks on this album that were actually previewed before the release of this record on the EPS that Kurt had released in 2018 these songs energy and live from Texas in that EP series yeah they're on this record which is a little surprising to me because generally on those EPS that he dropped those three EPS he put out in 2018 I found the material on them to be very basic very plain not as layered not as dynamic not as interesting not as topical as a lot of the stuff that he has been releasing previous to that so I I thought that they were just leftovers and we weren't gonna hear from those songs ever again and yet they are appearing on this new record it's not like these tracks take up too much real estate on the overall album though because like usual crit does hand fans a lot of material there are 19 tracks on this thing 19 but the number of songs on this thing overall and the number of songs I came into this thing already familiar with are not the prime issues I have with this record really what makes me upset about this album and I am NOT enjoying it is just how bland it is and not only am I getting this from the rapping but from the songwriting and the instrumentals as well and you can usually count on the instrumentals on a crit record to be fantastic even if he is not the one producing them but God are the beats on this thing glossy average smooth to the point of being forgettable like on the tracks obvious every time the j.cole featured cut on here as well I mean I guess a lot of the material on this thing blends into the current trend a very sanitized very inoffensive trap that you find getting a lot of hits in numerous corners of the internet the kind of stuff you can see populating one spotify playlist after another but that sound and that style doesn't really play to crit strengths it just seems like he's doing everything he can to not make this album stand out the verses are forgettable the hooks don't really pop the features are boring as hell some of his weakest bars to date land on this thing to family matters more to me than the Winslow dark night no joke I'm just hanging out the window there are even some spots here where it feels like crit is not really putting his all in his well back to the track Family Matters the structure of the song is so weak it's so repetitive crit didn't really flesh this one out at all not only that but the beat sounds like it was just assembled out of random junk from a drawer thrown into a blender and chopped up in a really jerky sporadic way the song blue flame ballet this is a joke right is this a joke is the song a joke it's got this god-awful fusion of old-school synth funk but modern hip hop going on in the instrumental the person singing on the hook is not very good at all this track sounds like if Dame funk we're trying to make fun of himself like this is this is what Dame funk would produce to make a parody of Dame funk the only singing on this LP that's almost as bad as this is the weird washed-out riffing on the track high beams you can barely make out a lot of it because it's so soaked in reverb then there's outer space which is a bit of a surprise because crit really comes forward with these expressions these desires of space travel I guess he's felt strongly about this for a while it seems like a cool bit of escapism but it's not really all that captivating of a tune we have a surprise jazzy closer for the finishing track as well I do like the slinky upright bass I like the rhythm on this track but I feel like this moment would be more appropriate if the ride up until this point had been more engaging more fun more exciting a slightly out of character cooldown moment like this would have been great it would have been a cool way to tie up the album but with the record being so underwhelming all the way up to here it just leaves me really unfulfilled I'm not really sure what to say about this record other than all of that it's just a very mediocre LP from crit I just don't get why he pivoted the way that he did on this album a few verses and topics on this thing did stand out for sure but generally the beats didn't really go as hard as they typically you on a crit album they didn't really bring his trademark sound there was very little in the way of a celebration of the tradition of southern hip hop on this record and not that kritis to make good music but he's always been so great at taking that sound and modernizing it a little bit so that it feels current feels fresh feels interesting ironically some of the best tracks on this thing were the teasers and the songs that landed on those previously released EPS I thought the deep cuts would actually provide a bit more promise but in fact they didn't they may be disappointed the most yeah sadly I'm not into this LP I think it's crits most disappointing yet and that's it I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

XU-Zl23I7D4,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it is a hot one I am sweaty as heck do not do not mind me do not mind me in my occasional dab cuz this melon is dewy right now we're gonna go over what I thought were the best and worst tracks of the week yeah that's that's what we're gonna do that's we're gonna do first I want to give a quick shout out to the live dates that I have coming up in August New York Massachusetts and CT be their 23rd 24th 25th link to tickets down below also down below are our Amazon and turntable lab associate links treat yourselves treat yourselves especially that turntable lab link we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the segment let's get into the worst tracks of the week worst tracks a handful of tracks handful of songs ba-bam first one Oh Tom McDonald he is back with the track called if I was black and it was wack I wasn't really trying to run the whole time oh damn I can't stop I can't stop I'm on a roll anyway I I will give it to Tom that he did try to to see outside of his narrow world view on this track and it is one of his less trash tracks but still it ended up pretty cringe and I s a a b-minus for effort b-minus for effort obviously b-minus moving on from there we have a new quality control project which I believe is is hitting the streets pretty soon we have a track from it featuring lil baby and uh baby titled baby and yeah these two absolutely have no chemistry together whatsoever it's got a generic beat no real interesting structure or anything like that little baby to the stay still sounds like a boring comatose thug and yeah this is probably the kind of quality that we can expect from the new quality control project moving on from there Mac so cream a rapper has a new project out Travis Scott is featured on this song over here excuse me the relays and yeah I just thought it was kind of underwhelming vocals and lyrics were really tedious the beat was just so-so Travis's appearances on the song we're completely forgettable didn't really quite get the appeal of this one frankly moving on from there also Beyonce and Kendrick on the song Nile on this new sort of Beyonce heavy Lion King inspired project and yeah I'm not really digging a whole lot of the music from it so far it just seems like really over budget really under written and you know just like a really gimmicky music tie-in for a bunch of music that sounds really epic but most likely didn't take that long to write or as you know just kind of thrown together and you hope that the glamorous and immense production kind of fills in the gaps and makes it all sound artful and worth the time that everyone put into it so um I don't know not not so interesting to my ears Kendricks delivery on this track was really monotone and flat and totally uninspired one of his worst appearances on a song I think I've heard in the past few years Beyonce doesn't exactly save the track either so I mean I'm sure a lot of fans will be excited to try this one because of the names involved in everything but geez I mean do you do yourself a favor and just just skip it's not worth it and Killswitch Engage they are back Killswitch Engage atonement and they've come up with a brand new track this sounds exactly like if Nickelback tried to write an alt metal song that's that's essentially what this sounds like Nickelback go in alt metal and and that's it that's it it's it's pretty terrible alright let's move out oh geez and one more ceremony the band monie they keep going they just cannot stop trying to make subpar post-punk but that is exactly what they are doing again on this new track of theirs I will admit that the groove on this one is not too bad but still at the end of the day the band just cannot get away from this incredibly subpar mediocre vintage post-punk sound that they just do nothing with I just don't get the band's pivot and this is again another record that they're doing in this vein and it is shaping up to be another disappointment so um yeah I guess I just missed the hardcore punk stuff and apparently that they're most likely not going to go back to that but I mean if you're gonna leave at least do something a bit more gripping than than this I suppose all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of met weren't terrible weren't awful but but didn't blow me away either first off the new Wilco which to me sounded like an Elliott Smith track but a lot more underwhelming fizzled out toward the end too but it had a nice low-key indie folk vibe to it it's not a bad track it's not a bad track love is everywhere beware is the title of it Twin Peaks a band that I have I have not really been all that interested in since I think their 2014 album but this new song they've put out over here which I believe is titled dance through it yes dance through it the vocals are a little subpar but the groove is great the instrumental is good the tune is fantastic as well so I don't know Twin Peaks I feel like they're a little bit on the come-up here it seems like they're kind of getting a bit more of a pulse doing something more interesting than just some standard forgettable indie rock type stuff so digging it digging it quite a bit moving on from there oh oops oops we have a TFS tropical F storm they're back with a new track didn't really dig how indirect this one was the beat the vocals none of it really coalesced in a way where it all felt like it was reinforcing each other but there's a weird quality to it that I do typically like in in most of the Bands music this one over here is titled who is my Eugene who is my Eugene moving on from there we also have a a new track from Shura who's been teasing toward her new full-length album for F her this new one over here I think has one of the groovier and and peppier instrumentals that I think she's come out with but I did not dig the vocal performance on this one I felt very nasal felt very nondescript there are a lot of very washed out indie bands and singers that sort of sing in a similar tone with a similar amount of effects on their voice and it just sort of makes it easy to kind of disconnect from the vocals emotionally because they don't really stand out all that much but still I did dig the groove I did dig the slightly vintage vibe of the instrumental it's a blend of dance pop and synth pop and indie it's got a good vibe to it it's got a good vibe to it moving on from there the men zingers have a new record on the way a new track out which kind of surprised me because the title of the track Anna the song kind of sounded like if men singers we're trying to write like a really good 90s radio rock tune or if they were like trying to write a Foo Fighter song not one of my favourite men zingers tracks in general but I guess they mostly came out ahead trying to write a song in this style wasn't bad it wasn't bad moving on from there we have this new track over here from little scream Dear Leader the instrumental and the tune of the track is OK it kind of suffers at the hand of the message of the song because the track is so wordly and it excuse me the track is so wordy and it is a weirdly paced but if you want a deeply an a and a hard and an unapologetically political message coming out of your track kind of acknowledging the insanity of current day I feel like this is a track that you're you're not gonna want to miss moving on from there Hobson is back with the track that I reviewed on the Fantana channel it's a song where he's um essentially leaving leaving saying he's getting out of the music game to get nine right he's dealing with a lot of issues a lot of problems he's unhappy I don't want it as the title of the song I actually think it's one of his better tracks in a while even if there are some elements of it that I do think hold it back a bit hopefully when he does eventually end up making a return he's putting out stuff this good or better felt like the track was really personal really compelling interesting to see Hopson self-analyze and I guess give give a true assessment of his situation without I guess making himself a victim or kind of blaming other people for all the problems and everything that he's dealing with seems like he himself acknowledges that he could have made some better decisions in terms of where he is right now and I don't know just hope he's on the road to recovery and that he eventually reaches a better place whether he's releasing music or not alright next want to give a shout out to Frankie cosmos who has a record coming out on September 9th I believe it is a new track out many tracks have been dropping from Frankie as of late this this new one over here that stopped me in my tracks a little bit Rings is kind of a quaint short indie rock tune with a very awkward but lovely melody to it that that I thought was kind of funny and yeah I guess I'm just kind of waiting to see if all these songs come together into something that really Wow's me on this new full-length album I do love the color scheme of this cover too so it's quite nice alright moving on from their four tet brand new song i felt like some very serene lightweight techno with with some pretty some some very pretty sound play going on within it not one of my favorite progressions he's ever developed or anything like that but but still a lot of good things going for this track not bad just looking for that new four tet album when whenever whenever it's coming man whenever whatever it's coming I alway time waiting for it I'm waiting to hear it and also flip tricks flip tricks UK rapper flip tricks has a new track out thriller featuring skinny man which is a pretty smooth bit of UK hip hop that's that's quite dab dab it up alright and uh Conway the machine of Griselda Records or just aka Conway Griselda records which many people have been hyping up as of late they have a deal coming or rather they inked a deal where they have a project on the way via Shady Records so this this East Coast rap labels I guess I want to say roster has his copy year of none other than Slim Shady himself and now we're starting to hear material featuring the artists on this label Conway being one of them with Eminem on it and bang is the title of this new track and in Conway previously I've never been a big fan of the man's music but to be honest the instrumental his very gritty grimy just mean cold-blooded delivery on this song for the first leg of it is actually pretty great one of the better you know minute or so of Conway music that I think I've ever heard but then Eminem comes on he literally ruins the track Conway and Eminem are like freaking oil and water like mmm I I think during the early point of his career could have hopped on this track and done something awesome could have complimented the song would have sounded good but at this point he's just so zany he's trying too hard like dude match the vibe of the song for the love of God like just just do something that fits in the track do something that complements the artists style I know you're mm I know you're larger than life I know you have this gigantic ego and this amazing track record and you sold tens of millions of albums but please for the love of God if you're going to appear on track like this just try to find it within yourself to serve the song don't just do some zany crazy shit and rap bar after bar about ja Rule which like is is a beef that no one even cares about anymore no one cares about it no one's no one even thinks about it unless you bring it up yeah yeah I'm done I'm done it's look there's some great aspects to this song and I am definitely looking forward to seeing what the Grizelda crew does on on their forthcoming shady release and and I've been trying to catch up with some of the more recent stuff like the new Benny the butcher EP but um this this was not very good and I hope that Eminem refrains from showing up on more of their tracks unless he is again going to try to do his best to fit into the track and do something that just sort of works with the label style I mean I think it's great and I think it's flattering that someone like Eminem has taken interest in what they're doing you know that's that's fantastic that's amazing but when you do something like bring these guys into the shady fold and then you appear on a track to do something like this that to me makes me wonder like are are you actually appreciating what makes them different because if you did would you not want to do something else other than the Annoying stuff that people don't already like on your current records whatever all right Chelsea wolf has come through with a another track from her forthcoming album American darkness is the name of this new song over here and a lot like the last song she released this one's kind of low-key it's pretty acoustic Chelsea may be hitting us with her most low-key record yet and yeah I mean it's it's an acoustic ballad it's got a bit of a I don't know maybe a slight goth country vibe to it in a way but just generally I thought it was kind of underwhelming I just thought it was kind of underwhelming I mean when she does eventually come out with this album if it does end up being an acoustic record that certainly will be an interesting change of pace and maybe hearing all of the songs in context they will grow on me but as of right now they don't really have that same sinister bite nor are they so tuneful that I'm wowed by them you know the the the typical appeals I would I would enjoy out of a Chelsea wolf record no matter what she ends up going for because every Chelsea wolf record up until this point has been different you know she's shot for some new sound new style new something but I cannot say that I'm all that excited for what she's doing so far on this new record but hey I will reserve full criticisms for when I hear the entire album alright a new Alex sandy or rather Alex G sandy track that has come out this one is on the shorter and more I don't know sort of low-key side hope it's it's a decent ballot you know if you like Alex Gees loaf I sort of bedroom balladeer style I think you'll dig this track quite a bit the the instrumentals pretty lush I do love hearing Alex G get a bit more clear you know in and an ambitious in his instrumental layering on his on his reason stuff it's definitely got me psyched for this a new house of sugar project alright let's talk about the best tracks of the week have a handful of tracks that have really wowed me this week one new Whitney which is previously an indie folk project I didn't really think about all that much ever however their last single for this forthcoming album seemed to hit it out of the park a lot of people were going crazy for that single I thought it was pretty decent this new one I'm actually enjoying quite a bit my love valleys I think is a beautiful ballets a beautiful love tune and I think it's got some great some attic melodies throughout it good clear rich production some decent vocals as well so I don't know it's just a very beautiful tune just very beautiful tune all around I'm moving on from there vidiian girls yes Vivian girls the noise rock act Vivian girls are back they have a new album on the way memories sick is the name or rather memory sick is the name of this new track and it's very washed out it's very reverb II it's very noisy it's very droning it's very bricked and wall of sound but yet there is a cute heavenly little tune at the center of all this chaos that to me is what Vivian girls were at their best you know around like their first album in that sort of error of their career everything else after that sort of seemed like they were trying to make their music appeal to a wider audience seems like with what they're doing here they're going back to basics they are going back to essentially what worked for them when they initially broke onto the scene and I'm liking it I'm liking now I think it's a cool fun approach to tuneful pretty twee esque noise rock moving on from there the band Swain the northern European Punk outfit or rather now kind of grunge alternative rock outfit Swain they are back new album on the way their last full-length album was one of my favorite rock albums of that year when it dropped they have come out with two new songs two new music videos but then what a negative space and and once again I feel like the band gets closer to the sounds of just like grunge and alternative rock of the 90s and they do it in a way where it doesn't cure Lee feel like a throwback and yet they simultaneously remind me of all the great things about that era without pulling up all the terrible stuff that makes me happy that it's gone and on top of that the songs are just incredibly solid and and furthermore the music videos are pretty creatively shot and edited too so I feel like they're kind of killing it on all fronts right now so dig these tracks good solid songs with a bit of a 90s Flair and yeah I don't really think I have anything else to say other than I'm just looking forward to the record hell yeah Swain and check out my last two reviews of their work or rather you know Swain and this is hell because they switched they switched names you know they have the Swain album and the Swain they had like a little EP where they did the name switch and then full of hell before that but you know check out all those reviews because they're a good solid band alright next I want to give a shout out to this group that I'm just now learning about squid they have a new EP on the way and this song over here the cleaner is fantastic definitely satisfies my desire for more post-punk which is insatiable by the way you know I am picky with the genre but if it's good I can always do with more and these guys definitely fit into that trend of post-punk that is just dance e'er more freakish more jagged more zany a little XTC inspired just very strange and freaky vocals I would say maybe it's maybe even its little pop group influence and it's a seven-minute song too so it moves through multiple phases some of which are very noisy some of which are very low-key and it's a pretty creative track I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more from this band they're now my sort of band to look out for essentially alright moving on from their sleater-kinney is back with a brand new song if you guys didn't catch a little while ago shortly after the release of their last track that I was pretty disappointed by made into my least favorite songs of the week their drummer their longtime drummer had announced that she is quitting the band so new album on the way produced by st. Vincent a couple singles out drummer gone but the album is still the album is still set to be released they're still going to be a tour you know it's it's still sleater-kinney so you know a lot of weird changes going on and I am pretty surprised to hear what they're shooting for on this track I mean for sleater-kinney the vocals still sound very consistent you know they're very shouty there's a lot of a broto they're very overstated they're very in-your-face they're very punkish I mean it's that electrifying energy vocal energy that you typically get out of a sleater-kinney track but the production on the song is heavy and it's some slightly industrial ish I would say in some regards it's very noisy it's very cold it's very jagged and metallic and mean and it doesn't really kind of have that um that human touch in a way but it's it's not a bad thing because still very explosive and it's still very hard-hitting so I've been all over the place with enjoying these new sleater-kinney tracks I can say that I do enjoy though that it seems like the band are taking some serious risks so I think that's great I think that's fantast and I don't know hopefully the new record comes out just really off the wall and just from the future or something because this this is a I don't know what they're what they're delivering so far is kind of insane alright moving on from their red hearse which is a new musical project that features a Jack Antonoff and a few others so Jack Antonoff of the bleachers Fame so obviously there's gonna be a huge pop element to this project the new music video this song is attached to features st. Vincent to bring up st. Vincent once again half love is the name of this song and it's actually just a wonderful tune it's a wonderful ballad and great vocals as well fantastic vocal performance on this track so yeah just loving it just absolutely loving it oh what a shout-out this artists home just now finding out about who had a new song and music video drop this week that's are pretty fantastic if anything just check this track out for the music video because the choreography is insane and the whole seance concept going on throughout the song is really cool the name of this new track over here is I wish it's from Hayley kiyoko and I don't know given this tracks fusion of pop rap and R&B and indie pop I'm just gonna have to keep tabs on what Hayley is doing because this track is really cool music video is hella creative and the tune is sweet too so yeah loving it moving on from there Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes Fame you already know I have talked about the previous song she released from her forthcoming record she has an album on the way that last song I thought was pretty repetitive wasn't really that into it was kind of worried like oh man I know she can write songs but why is this long feels so one-dimensional like what the hell is going on but this new track over here which has a music video attached to it featuring Terry Crews of all people which is not a bad thing Terry Crews is a great actor it's amazing whenever Terry Crews shows up for anything but stay high is the name of this track and it's actually a beautiful beautiful beautiful soul song that is absolutely wonderful Howard absolutely kills it on the vocal performance and the instrumental has that kind of rustic feel to it that vintage feel to it that you like out of an Alabama Shakes song but you you can tell with her doing a bit of a solo thing here it's it's got a different characteristic to it it's got a different characteristic to it alright the high women which is a new sort of all female country supergroup featuring none other than Brandi Carlile and and some other artists as well have a new track out titled redesigning women which is actually a pretty compelling cute song obviously dealing in gender politics but all in all it's a good tasteful country tune with a sweet message and some great group vocals to you know the the vocal layering on on this track is pretty nice it's pretty sweet fever ray shout out to fever ray Karen is back with this track I'm not done still not done mix and and I'm glad that she's not done I'm glad that she's still not done I'm glad that she's putting out more material because this track is like a wild combination of some of her weirdest vocals yet and this very zany house beat that that I think is pretty cool so I don't know I was kind of disappointed when she came back with that last full-length album I think it could have been a lot better and I'm glad that we're not having to wait too long to hear her put out more stuff under the fever ray name because that debut record is fantastic I feel like she has so much more great music in her and and I want to hear it I want to hear in this song is certainly a an example of that alright ASAP ferg floor seats he's coming with a few tracks as of late he has this song again floor seats he has another track Wham with made in Tokyo and both these tracks are bangers not only are the instrumentals weird ASAP ferg sounds way more in his element in terms of his vocal performance and I don't know it's it's honestly reminding me of the trap Lorde days a little bit and not exactly like he's going back and doing the same thing but it's like wow it seems like he's almost on the cutting of just making traps sound freaky and alternative again it's sort of sad that the genre has hit a point where it's become so homogenous so formulaic you have so many artists that are basically trying to sound like the frontrunner while trying to chase after a formula to me these two Ferg tracks just sound really left field and just sound like they're full of character you know what what made Ferg so interesting when he when he initially came on the scene was that his personality was so goofy and his bars were so out there and his humor was just so much at the forefront of what he was doing and I feel like all of that's returning but with a slightly fresher sound on these two new tracks and it's pretty cool so dig these songs that are linked down below along with every other track that I've talked about so far moving on from there Ezra Furman who is a singer and a songwriter whose music I've only paid attention to a little bit here and there at this point he's got a new record on the way 12news is the title of it and the amongst the songs that have come out so far I know I've teased one or I've talked about one in a weekly track roundup this other one over here I'm actually even more impressed with I want to be your girlfriend it's got some great lyrics it's a cool ballad and 3/4 it's got a vintage vibe to the instrumental sounds like you know very heartbroken sad tearing your beer type sixties ballad excuse me but it's got a bit of a distorted low fie quality to it as well I like it a lot I think it's great Charli XCX Christine and the Queen's gone is the title of this new collaborative single and music video that they have worked on together and I don't know man it's a pop anthem it is a pop epic it is of immense proportions Charli XCX has done a lot of crossovers over the past few years and this is easily one of the better ones and I'm surprised because I'm not even really a huge Christina in the Queen's fan I mean there are a few songs here and there that that I think are pretty dramatic and and and hit hard but outside of that you know I am generally underwhelmed um a lot of a lot of that projects material but now with with this charlie song it's like whoa knocked it out of the park holy crap you guys are going so hard and yeah man it's it's it's it's definitely one of the better pop anthems of the decade it's it's uh I don't know I don't know what else to say it's beautiful it's gorgeous its immense and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody that has been the weekly track roundup and I got through it without without sweating too much again all the tracks that I talked about they're linked down below okay they're linked down below along with once more our turntable lab and Amazon associate links and of course a link to the tickets for the upcoming shows and I think that's gonna be it guys you're the best you the best

tIo6MOswfY8,hi everyone ha anyboy tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the you boa album the origin of my depression you boa is not just a name I hope I'm pronouncing correctly it's also a musical project spearheaded by multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter producer Xandra Metcalf who to my knowledge has been dropping music under the pseudonym since the earlier part of this decade and now 9 years later we have kind of a breakthrough in the underground with the origin of my depression now even though you boa has been in existence for the entirety of this decade so far it's had a lot of time to evolve as a project the stylistic influences for the most part have continually orbited around experimental music noise industrial music drone dark ambient even sludge metal and post rock the more abrasive and abstract elements of you boa sound seemed to have taken more precedent as the discography has gotten deeper and deeper and now all of that culminates into this disturbing heavy beautiful and sobering album the origin of my depression this album is more than just an album it's an experience it is really something it's a piece a holistic piece it is a supremely deep and cerebral dive into Xander's most negative and intense feelings surrounding depression and a host of other things her experience as a transgender woman and also what I read as severe feelings of abandonment she essentially expresses all these emotions through chilling sound scapes crushing walls of rumbling distortion and industrial percussion there's quite a bit of variety across the tracklist in terms of sound palettes and mood the reason for that being as we listen deeper into the album it's like we're progressing into darker and darker territory in a pretty cinematic fashion and the whole record runs at a very trim 40 minutes spread out along seven songs all of which segue into each other and connect very holistically and it all becomes a somewhat traumatizing ordeal there are despond Loes on this record there are violent thrashing and explosive highs no questions and Rihan an excellent job at translating what she's been dealing with into this record now even though I find the emotional experience of this album to be pretty unique that's not to say there aren't very clear stylistic influences I'm picking up on or at least creative parallels I'm picking up on as I listen through the album there are at least a few moments where I feel like I'm listening to more recent noise or power electronic artists like Prairie ant or dark ambient and drone projects like son or lust morgue I think pharmacon fans need to make note of this album I think lingua Ignasi fans need to make note of this album I think the body fans need to make note of this album and there are even some acoustic elements of this record with lots of cascading notes and organic bits of instrumentation that just remind me of a Mount Erie record a microphones record just fill albums work in general to go through the tracks on this project because there aren't that many the opener D transitioning sees Andra finding her vocal footing over these stuttering kind of sparse piano notes it doesn't sound like much at first a little confused not sure where to go it's a little standoffish it's kind of unkempt more impatient listeners might go into this thinking what is going on here this sounds so awkward but very quickly the instrumental ascends and fills out with all these droning almost cultish vocal layers it just instantly turns into this strange alien wall of sound then some weird sound effects popping up in the background that sounds like a poltergeist slamming something trying to communicate with people from beyond the grave the wall of sound eventually turns noisy harsh industrial we have gone from strange euphoria too abrasive dystopia in a pretty incredible progression - it's heavy as hell and the sound play is very good so this quickly segues into the title track of the record we kick the track off with it being in a very strange state we are hit with this very low subtle otherworldly drone that while it may be quiet I think it says a lot about the space that it exists in it's like in a great Hall it's like I'm no longer standing on the mortal plane I feel like someone's watching me or I'm in a space where an ancient ritual is being held eventually Xandra introduces these tones that are kind of clumsy but also mystical clanging dull bells or chimes just overlapping and on top of this Xander starts delivering these muttered bits of spoken word that talk about the origins of her depression and it moves through a chilling progression like the opening track these song builds wonderfully and reaches a very abrasive climax the drone gets heavier gets thicker gets more menacing suddenly the vocals are no longer muttered but they are just screaming totally insane screams not going from zero to 60 but zero to 660 and the vocals are not buried in the drone at all they are very very loud and very very in-your-face their eye widening they are freaky they are unsettling they are blood-curdling the track eventually hits a breaking point we instantly transition into lay down and rot where suddenly we are warped into yet another chilling soundscape there are a lot of similarities and parallels between this track and the previous one in my opinion but we kick this one off in a place where it feels like it's starting at an even darker and in a worse point of course it doesn't kick off at its most intense moment but we eventually get there and at this point the album has has certainly crossed over into a territory where it's just consistently horrifying profoundly disturbing more screams more soul sucking noise all these hits of glitchy distortion just compound on top of one another until they're just pressing into me and I'm losing my breath being sensitive to the overall flow of the album Xandra very smartly provides a euphoric spot after this track the song epilation joy and while this song does bring back in some more organic instrumental elements it's a lot easier on the ears there's still something kind of sour about the background drone the vibe of the track eventually sours starts sounding absolutely horrid and then instantly transition into the noisiest and the nastiest spot on the entire record and that is please don't leave me interestingly the song kicks off with like this very quick gasp like Xandra or the protagonist woke up from a nightmare from a sound sleep in a cold sweat or something and right after that gasp we are hit with the most punishing relentless and frankly abusive noise on the entire album this spot on the record is not for the faint of heart not only because of the noise on it but the lair demonic vocals what sounds like even a gun loading or the hammer on a gun clicking if you seriously struggle with depression or suicidal thoughts and you don't find music or art that dabbles in those things cathartic because I know some people do some people don't you may want to avoid this record because essentially this track feels like we are succumbing to another dark episode on the album and this one is just the worst one after this track Xandra eases up a little bit but not really on the track angel of great and terrible light we do kick the track off with these sparkly acoustic guitars an ice-cold but consistent kick drum it's a super duper duper simple progression but the way Xandra builds on it very slowly eventually reaching a point where it gets so heavy and roaring and blaring that it's almost deafening that's pretty much what ends up making this piece so powerful as I mentioned earlier with some of the acoustic elements on this track I am getting a strong fill elrom vibe especially with some of the vocals being so off-putting and misspent youth is a somewhat interesting and somber closer we almost return to where we started on the album the vocals the pianos it's sparse it's open it's meandering doesn't have a strong sense of direction the performance on this track comes off really lost and wounded the pianos eventually fused with these roaring bass tones that feel like they're something out of a son record the ending wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be there's not a strong of resolution to this point on the album though maybe in the concept of it or the emotional reality of the experience this album is based around there's no true sense of resolution I will say the track does drag on a little bit and this song serves again as many moments on the album where the vocals do feel just a little misdirected a little too quiet and I get that in directness on the record is trying to make a point but I feel like by the end of the record that point has been beaten into the ground so the whole thing does go out with more of a whimper than a bang still though there are elements of this track I find captivating in every moment up until this point is pretty convincing enthralling and moving impactful this thing is a powerfully dark record with a lot of great ideas on it not the most original or groundbreaking in these styles but surely an emotional experience I'm going to remember for quite a while I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing transition have you given this album a

h1KpujmB5Q4,hi everyone wrong the knee right tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new poppy EP choke this is the latest EP from the Internet's favorite YouTube content creator cult leader sort of a robot sort of a person sort of a pop star poppy Poppy's entrance into the music world started with a handful of semi successful albums that dabbled in everything from electro pop to ambient music to new metal and keep in mind that poppy is not really a single person but more of a vision or an ongoing multimedia project spearheaded by Mariah Rose Pereira and Titanic Sinclair so yes there is a visual component to it it's not just a music thing and so far between these two mediums the poppy lore has gotten pretty deep and pretty weird it's difficult to sum up the totality of Poppy's video catalog on YouTube some of what's there does feel like a mere expression of absurdity but there are underlying commentaries on narcissism and the world of social media and just the information age in general and more recently the legal drama spilling out between them and former Titanic Sinclair collaborator Mars Argo which to my knowledge has now been settled so thus far aesthetically and philosophically poppy has never really been one thing so why should her music or why should her sound settle into one style while choke isn't an entirely new sound for poppy it does explore further some of the darker and more alternative sounds that she dabbled in on her last album a Maya girl specifically on the tracks play destroy and ex and choke not only gives us one more dose of that but also these moody fusions of pop and industrial music the super-heavy beats and despondent pianos on the tracks choke and holy mountain feel like something off of an old Nine Inch Nails record but updated for a new generation and yeah I do think the to not choke is sort of forgettable but I do like stylistically what poppy is shooting for on that cut holy mountain though is much more memorable from a songwriting standpoint and I love the way the poppy weaves in these vocal passages in-between these absolutely of devastating piano parts on the hooks it's simple but it's effective and speaking of mixing moods together we have the track scary masks featuring the fever 3:33 stylistically it's all over the place it's total madness it's insane who the hell cooked this up but it's done so incredibly well in the same song poppy takes us from euphoric blissful dreamy indie pop - thunderous hardcore and shouts of okay and even though you get all these transitions on the same song it's still a very compelling and fun and entertaining song and the segues are not cheap it's all very well developed and put together I wish you would come out with more tracks like this not only because it's a very bold combination of a variety of different styles but this is easily the most detailed song in the entire EP really the crown jewel of the EP I would say meat comes in at a close second mostly because the song at the core of all of it is really great you get some electro vibes on the instrumental some industrial vibes as well but the driving dance beat and somewhat dreamy production calls back to like an old Crystal Castles album it's very dark goth friendly dance music with a somewhat dystopian edge to the lyrics and overall I like the CP I think it's a solid EP it's a cool mini chapter in the ongoing poppy verse and while I wouldn't want to hear poppy chase after just one sound or one vibe for the rest of her musical career these are ideas I would like to hear at least a little bit more of before she goes off into something else I guess I just really hope this EP is a sign of something even bigger and better to come I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on it transition have you given this EP well listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana poppy choke forever 
ieu3Hp4LcSg,this new Ed Sheeran record it's it's not good ed sheeran UK singer-songwriter number six collaborations project a follow-up to his number five collaborations EP from years and years and years ago in 2011 where he collaborated with a number of artists mostly rappers from his neck of the woods I would say at the time that he made number five it wasn't amazing but it was at least an admirable effort from a dude who isn't typically seen as much more than just an acoustic songwriter a balladeer but as you may have noticed lately the musical landscape has been shifting under mr. Ed Sheeran's feet I think he has been doing his best to try to respond to those changes with his last full-length album which of course I didn't like I wasn't a fan but I could at least admire and appreciate ok he's trying to update his style a little bit to incorporate elements of pop of hip hop to make it seem a bit more current but it would seem ed was not prepared to stop just there know now he has come through with another collaborations project number six and it's actually huge a whole album with one track after another with one feature one collaboration after another and God is it bad and look I don't mean to say that it's bad and that every single track on this thing is just intolerable to the point where I'm violently puking whenever it's on the vast majority of songs on this album are very radio ready very listenable by contemporary pop standards but beyond that and a few R&B crossovers that are actually pretty decent like the LMA track the her track a vast majority of what's here is just totally soulless garbage that also serves as yet another horrible example of how toxic feature culture has become in modern pop music now I would still argue the worst offender on this front is DJ Khaled especially on his last record the do literally assembles almost randos on a bunch of different beats with little in the way of song idea song structure IDI I can at least say is coming together with artists with coherent well fleshed out well structured clearly structured songs but it seems like every track on the record only serves to put edy in a slightly different context where oh he's trying a little dancehall he's doing a little hip-hop he's doing a little bit of that new that new Latin wave that we're all enjoying so much and Ed's attempts at trying his hand at all these different music styles only exposes just how surface-level his appreciation for all of them are because his take on dancehall his take on Latin pop his take on R&B has take on these weird ed sheeran rap fusions it's like I'm listening to the most gentrified version of each of these sounds imaginable there are songs on this thing that again are straight-up trashed like the closing cut featuring Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars which is this like horns out rock and roll song that's pretty cringy and just tough to listen to the guitar riffs throwback to this like hard rock era but it just sounds very sucky cheap boring bland Bruno Mars and Chris Stapleton make absolutely no sense whatsoever over this kind of instrumental there's no vocal chemistry between these three guys on this track and I would say even ed Sheeran sounds very out of place over these kinds of guitars the tune on way to break my heart I thought was OK these Skrillex instrumentals nowhere near as obnoxious as one would assume it would be given it Skrillex it's not like ed is just wailing over dubstep wubs and bass drops the instrumentals actually kind of chill but still pretty one-dimensional and bland young thug and Jay HUS sound awkward lined up with IDI on the track feels but really the worst thing about this song is just how crappy the chorus is baby I got the feels ya say that I'm out of my mind but it's something real something real I got the feels yeah bada boom bada bing you'll knock me right off my feet I've waited most of my life for something real baby I got the feels for you maybe I got the feels for you not exactly the epitome of great pop lyric writing in 2019 on an Ed Sheeran song was about the last place that I wanted to hear Eminem and 50 cent coming together this decade Ed's lyrics about being a misfit and being misunderstood just feel really general like they're pandering like they don't really mean anything like the listeners just supposed to project their experiences and their feelings onto the song and that's it antisocial featuring Travis Scott is a none hole matrimony of EDS typical songwriting style some elements of electro some elements of hip-hop some elements of Travis Scott's trademark psychedelic trap sound with the reverb with the auto-tune you've heard it at this point and while I will say I have heard some worse I have heard some worse Travis Scott features and crossovers in the past year so this one is still not very good structurally the song is sound the instrumental isn't bad and Travis Scott gives a decent vocal performance but really the greatest issue with this song for me ultimately is that it has absolutely no teeth whatsoever what typically makes Travis Scott's music interesting or exciting or evocative just ends up getting neutered before the final song was getting exported I guess I don't care featuring Justin Bieber terrible song not only other lyrics about going to a party and I guess not wanting to be there not interesting at all but vocally Justin and Edie have absolutely no chemistry singing over each other it's like just pouring a glass of water into a glass of water not only that but instrumentally God there's no bump to this track there's no flavor it just feels like it's meant to be a piece of playlist filler you could slip it into any number of playlist on Spotify it's gonna get tons of plays nobody's gonna skip it because it just sounds so background take me back to London featuring storm Z I do like storm Z's feature on the track but Ed's vocals crash into his at a few points that I don't really care for at all the track just feels very jumbled like structurally there's not enough space in it also the very plucky and regal strings playing throughout the song just feel very stereotypical for a track that's supposed to be about London just as the synth pan flutes are on the tracks south of the border which in my opinion is maybe one of the grossest songs on the entire record as the track is essentially about sexualizing and fetishizing latin women and you've named south of the border and then you've invited to women of Latin descent onto the track to perform with you if this is okay why wouldn't it be okay for ED to have like two black R&B singers on a track and named a jungle fever and funnily enough I came to this conclusion before cardi B's verse popped in where she actually says has a little jungle fever on this song beautiful people featuring colleague is just boring as hell very boring bland intro but what what else do you expect I don't think God makes very interesting music generally and I'm not sure what else to say about this album it's just very focused grouped it's very cheap just seems like Edie with his label or trying to maximize profits by bringing in as many popular voices as possible by trying to attempt one genre one popular trendy style after the next doesn't feel like there's a lot of heart or authenticity as he is dabbling in a lot of sounds that are outside of his comfort zone he's just trying to come out of it giving you the most agreeable and plain version of whatever he's attempting as possible artistically this album is pretty cheap it's pretty substance less it feels less like EDD is trying to feel his soul and more like he's trying to feel some green and that's it this Ed Sheeran album it's not good 
qjFfUuPY5Rw,hi everyone one thini to tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Daniel Caesar record case study oh one singer and songwriter Daniel Caesar he is back Canada native he is finally following up his 2017 record freudian which was a pretty big breakout moment for him a record of lightly groovy neo soul and R&B tracks that were sweet to the ear and very easygoing kind of pensive and a salad as I thought this album was I did come away from it wishing that the vocals were a bit more gripping that the production was more bold and maybe a little out there because quite a bit of the beats on this thing did feel very very very sanitary so going into this new record I don't really know what I was hoping for honestly maybe some more risks some more sound play Daniels singing while not bad could certainly be more emotionally captivating so after listening to case study oh one there is one thing that I can say for sure and it's that the production the recording the instrumentals here they're not nearly as pristine they're not as squeaky-clean the instrumentals feel a lot more homespun and blemished which can be endearing on certain tracks and that is kind of funny because nearly every track on this record does have a major producer or a studio attached to it whether that be Jordan Evans or Matthew Burnham between the both of them they've worked with artists like jay-z and little Wayne and Eminem also some of the material on this thing was even recorded at Abbey Road Studios which is one of many locations these songs were track test so if this thing does sound a little all over the place on the whole of the tracklist that can contribute a little bit as to why so I definitely appreciate that Daniel Caesar seemed to have had a lot of industry backing going into this project but the song still came out as unpolished a little impressionistic I think I can generally say the case study oh one is weirder and a bit artsy er than its predecessor but even with that I still feel like Daniel is a far cry away from making a record that has a truly distinct sound or style within the current landscape of R&B and soul I feel like if you've heard a number of songs from the early days of Anderson PAC of Frank Ocean maybe some Solange or D'Angelo some of the internet Steve Lacey - you've already heard a great deal of what Daniel is attempting on this LP without a doubt he's still a capable songwriter on this album there are some decent Tunes to be heard here but sometimes the execution does feel off like there are tracks here that could have used another take the awkward falsetto vocals all over the track open up are a prime example of that to me also Daniel's nearly comatose singing on the end of too deep to turn back popular R&B singer Brandy's appearance on the track love again is uncharacteristically weak as well again many moments on this album that I think could have used a do-over there are a number of instrumentals as well that to my ears just feel very basic very plain kind of lifeless the song restore the feeling is a great example of this I do like the intimate tone of the track the vocals feel so close so upfront like I'm listening to a very tiny powwow of a song but God does this beet field demo ish oh it's so naked dusty colorless and flavorless and absolutely kneecaps the full potential of the song I pretty much feel the same way about the instrumental on the song complexities also the very thin acoustic guitars and cheap springy reverb or delay on the closing track here as well as kind of uninspired and to me definitely beneath production-wise any artists that is releasing a record on a huge platform and absolutely I can understand taking the simple road or taking the simple approach but it's not exactly like any of the beats here are so minimal that their experimental are so simplistic or so sparse that they're making an artistic statement in that regard truly most of the music here just sounds half-baked and that's all and maybe partially the reason for this is that Daniel is trying to catch lightning in a bottle I think that may be why nothing on this album feels like he labored over it too heavily and this isn't necessarily a bad approach if what you end up generating figuratively is pure electricity but if those aren't the results that you're actually getting when you're finally putting these songs together it's time to go back to the drawing board and start assembling your tracks in a more composed and meticulous fashion while generally I wouldn't say the album is terrible or intolerable there were really only a few tracks that stood out to me as being supremely good well written well performed well produced we have the lush and dreamy superposition featuring John Mayer the guitars on this track are great Daniel Caesar's lead vocal melody is pretty fantastic to this song in my opinion actually contains the best vocal performance from Caesar on the entire record yes it is a little sleepy it's a little lullaby like but it's still a very pretty tune I feel like I'm just being cradled in with his voice we also have frontal lobe music featuring Pharrell Williams Pharrell's vocal melodies kind of weird on this track but it's still sweet as honey and adds a nice bit of quark and levity to the song I do have to admit though this is one of those moments on this record while I do like the song it's it's a track that I I kind of wish Anderson Pak was on it I feel like instrumentally and aesthetically this is exactly the kind of track that Pak would kill it on top of because while Caesar singing is good he doesn't quite bring the same amount of swagger and I can feel him trying to turn that up a little bit on this song but he doesn't quite push it far enough I don't know man again I don't think this record is the worst thing I've heard all year there is a lot of potential here and I feel like if Daniel finds a way to make this somewhat artsy or Messier Direction work into the future this could be really cool but for a majority of the time I just feel like the stars aren't aligning on this record sometimes the singing is pretty great but everything else is just okay sometimes the instrumental is captivating or goes in an interesting direction but then the singing or the song is just kind of bland yeah I don't know I'm pretty indifferent to it frankly I'm feeling a light five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit like if you like please subscribe and please cry at the Bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana mm-hmm Daniel Caesar forever

25th in Massachusetts in New York in Hamden Connecticut be there we have a good time catch esta music memes we do a live let's argue it's great fun ok it's great fun alright worst tracks of the week worst tracks of the week got a handful got a handful of them this week ever you wanted to remember every track that I talked about in this series is linked down below in the description box along with all the other stuff I just mentioned so if you're curious about any of these tracks you could find them down there alright first we have a Darren Criss and Steve Aoki teaming up for a cover a remix and EDM revise meant revision of the Dave Matthews Band song crash into me and yeah it's it's exactly how you would never want to ever hear this song it's it's I I never wanted to hear reimagined in this way and yet it's here so thank you steve aoki for that moving on from there ed Sheeran and Travis Scott antisocial what this is such an unholy alliance God Ed Sheeran's just very bland approach to pop music and singer-songwriter music fuse with like some electro and Travis Scott's trademark brand of psychedelic Trap that's no I don't want it I don't I don't want it altogether I really don't I don't think it comes together that well I think the beat is kind of well produced but Edie and Travis vocally just do not complement each other all that well there is little to no chemistry on this track can't can't say can't say I enjoy it my guy next up we have common legendary Chicago MC with a brand new track named Hercules he came out with a song not too long ago which was an amazing update to his classic track I used to love her and I I love the original song loved the update thought he had a lot of poignant things to say and the track however on this other song over here where I feel like he's trying to be as poignant or poignant in a different way with a somewhat overproduced instrumental he is really just kind of losing the narrative a little bit and I feel like it just comes off very preachy comes off very out of touch and there are some really weird flow change ups and vocalizations throughout the track that I thought were kind of worth an eye roll and I just just generally felt very awkward to me didn't really get into it at all and Billy Eilish has come out with a remix of her very popular song bad guy and the revised version here features none other than Justin Bieber it is pretty much the song that you know with some weird ad-libs on the end a Justin Bieber feature and yeah it serves no purpose whatsoever doesn't really improve or enhance the song I get that Billy Eilish for her things might be coming a little full Serco on this because coming into this she was most likely a big Justin Bieber fan as she's clearly trying to signal to us with the cover art of this of this remix but I don't know just as an outside listener with with no real emotional or personal investment in what Billy is doing or what Justin's doing I just thought it came together in a really unflattering way so yeah alright let's move on to the tracks that I thought were kind of myth wasn't really crazy about him but still thought they were worth shouting out you guys might dig them a lot more than me let's see first we have Malaysian popstar Yuna out with a brand new track featuring none other than Tyler the Creator I thought it was okay if you like your pop to be a little low fie and dreamy and somewhat dusty then I think you will like this new track than her and Tyler have together cast away I thought the vocals and the instrumental were kind of bland but Tyler's feature wasn't bad if you like a lot of what Tyler was doing on flower boy but you may be instrumental II would like something with a bit I don't know lighter of a touch then I think you'll get into this quite a bit moving on from there we also have a brand new track over here from the body and they are collaborating with the group uniform of course it's all happening through sacred bones records and this track is noisy and abrasive as hell uniforms weird goth doubt synth punk aesthetics combined somewhat well with the bodies sludgy distorted noise the shadow of vocals that are just really kind of the body's trademark at this point yeah it's it's it's certainly a hell it sounds like hell you know in a good way but also in a way where maybe I'm scared off of kind of revisiting it it it's it's gonna totally blow you out it is abrasive as hell and it is unforgiving and the track is titled penance and it's it certainly feels like I'm I'm going going through going through that so so here we go alright moving on from there pharmacon an artist in the world of Noise music experimental music she has a new record on the way never been a huge huge huge huge huge pharmacon fan but I do like that she continues to be a consistent creative voice in this particular genre of music self-regulating system is the name of this new track over here it's a bit of a slow burner takes a while to get to the point where it is at its climax of noise and ferocity but still it's a pretty interesting track it's a pretty interesting track moving on from there we have an artist that has recently made it on to none other than Stones Throw Records someone who goes by the name of Payton to spare or is the name of this new track this new single over here it's a pretty much a sweet little low-key R&B song with some weird qualities coming out of the instrumental which is very groovy some quirky qualities coming out of the vocals I can't say it's you know one of the best Tunes over this year but it certainly seems like she has more going on than some of the more atmospheric and cookie-cutter all R&B artists going on you know or rather sort of making the rounds right now so you know throw throw some attention on this there are some attention on this you might like it a lot more than me alright also opeth yes Opeth the legendary progressive and death metal band Opeth they are back heart and hand brand new song and I'd done the instrumental on this one quite a bit felt a lot more badass than anything that the band has been developing on their past couple of records the guitar leads are pretty wild and the band plays in a very tight fashion from beginning to end on this one switching from one phase to the next a really impressive way can't say I was super crazy about the vocals as I never usually am on a no path record admittedly I'm not like the biggest opeth guy but I don't know I I have seen some fans a little disappointed in the very bland progressive rock the group has been engaging in on their past few records or so and I can at least say that what they're delivering here in comparison with that stuff it does have a bit more teeth it has more teeth to it so I can at least say that I think fans will be a bit more excited by what Opeth is offering on this one moving on from there Jenny hvala has a brand new record on the way brand new track experimental music artists that I've been kind of enjoying her stuff on and off for a little while now she came out with a pretty solid EP last year ashes to ashes is the name of this new track over here it's got a driving electronic beat somewhat impressionistic vocal leads there are some great parts on the song though I do wish I had a stronger sense of direction that it wasn't as abstract structurally but still I think she brings together a kind of strange beautiful mystical vibe on this one that I like quite a bit moving on from there we have 100 shooters from future featuring Meek Mill and Doughboy yeah it's a it's it's kind of your standard future track future vocally and lyrically is is just kind of doing what he usually does nothing too crazy nothing really to write home about I will say the Meek Mill feature does pick the track up quite a bit and the instrumental is kind of wild like the main theme melody of the track is is actually really cool so if this track does have two good things going for it it's definitely those things all right and we also have a boney vert over here who's who's dropped a couple of tracks this past week the one I'm mentioning here is the one that I didn't care for all that much the next track meant of I'm gonna talk about I liked a lot more about this song over here Gel more is a very low-key glitchy piece of art pop balladry without a strong structure to it I wish it came to a greater climax I wish the instrumental didn't feel so jarring I do appreciate aesthetically what is trying to do the risks that it's taking but I can't say I get a whole lot of gratification out of it and also Beyonce has a track out spirit which of course is attached to the giant Lion King soundtrack and yeah it's it's okay it's dramatic it's overproduced it's kind of powerful vocally I don't really think she does enough to sell the verses on the track I think courses are pretty solid but the verses do feel painfully underwhelming I think that partially has to do with again her performance and her vocals not having that much presence on the track but for whatever reason her voice doesn't really feel all that loud on the track to my ears either so not exactly sure as to why she feels a little a little lost and the mix on this one again to my ears anyway but still even if that wasn't the case I do find the song to be a little drab I don't know all right let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the best this week the best tracks this week the ones that really got me going the ones that excited me the most one portrayal of guilt a screamo outfit that dropped a pretty solid record last year that turned quite a few heads in the screamo scene they have a very noisy I would say even violent approach to the screamo genre and scarcity is the name of this new track over here which is forthcoming on a more miniature project the band has coming out very soon and this is like a very heavy a very noisy a very like furious brand of scream oh I I would say it even like kind of borders on metal in some respects while while still staying pretty true to the screamo form so I don't know I think that makes the band stand out in a pretty unique way that and just the animalistic performances they pack into their tracks especially this one over here scarcity against scarcity it's it's it's solid moving on from there the OCS are back with another teaser track to their forthcoming record if you love that garage Punk if you love that psych rock you will dig on this track poison stones quite a bit I like that this song is a lot more direct than the 20 or so minute damn cut that they dropped not too long ago and and this one over here stands out aesthetically because the band packs in all of these weird glitchy synthesizer bits that are actually pretty cool it's three minutes and change so it's a lot more straightforward and to the point again very sweet very enjoyable had a fun time with it good track and also Old Town Road Billy Ray Cyrus little nas ex remix with young thug and Mason Ramsay it's fun as hell I cannot wait for this song to be the longest number one running song single number one single song running longest-running single song number one ever of all time because if he keeps dropping remixes like this that is most likely what is going to be the case I also love that he keeps dropping hoarse variations of the of the cover ever everytime it's it's it's amazing I'm dying I'm dying and also Brie runway brie runway a pop artist who I highlighted a few weekly track roundups ago she came out with the track last week this lit by me but I am now shouting it out it's a new song featuring Brooke candy big racks is the name of it I will say the main theme melody of it is a little repetitive but the instrumental and the vocalizations are just too weird and too wild like to not appreciate just how out-there this track is I mean this certainly excites me because I feel like in this new pop paradigm where we have people coming up who are taking the pop form and are doing some supremely weird and creative stuff with it people like you know Billy Eilish people like Charli XCX and and a host of other people you know and of course Brooke candy as well is connected to this I I would actually say she's a pretty early adopter to a lot of these weird pop sounds that wasn't really all that well understood when she first kind of came onto the scene I think a lot of people just kind of saw her as too weird and wrote her off and and nowadays I feel like candy is looking more normal than ever as our artists like Brie one runway and you know and not to say that brie runway doesn't stand out she certainly does I think this a big racks track is a really funny postmodern catchy almost like bombastic as far as like the bass and the instrumental on this thing i there were parts of it where I felt like is this like kind of a deconstructed Club thing or is this like an industrial thing I couldn't quite tell but I don't know it just feels very much.now I'll just say that it feels very today and today again I'll say I think there are a lot of artists out there brie runway included who are doing some really creative things with pop music alright bony bear who I have to shout out again in this segment with the track faith which is another track that he's dropped in the past week this song is actually a very rich beautiful gorgeous ballad with some amazing instrumental climaxes solid singing from Justin a really righteous feel-good powerful song that is actually a you know on par with the the last track that he did that was also a powerful ballad with very rich instrumentation attached to it so I don't know Justin I feel like is is kind of surprising me a little bit as of late so um I guess I'm continuing to look forward to what he's dropping what he's putting out right also I want to shout out finally I think this is the last one we're gonna mention in this segment Ash Nikko also a pop artist in this new paradigm that I was just talking about who is pretty wild who's pretty off-the-wall who is sometimes raunchy in her lyrics and has a very bold personality as well I would say that you know there are elements of her style and her sound that very obviously are influenced by people like Lorde I would say but not in a bad way or anything like that this new track over here I think topically is pretty funny it's sort of sin and I think the story of the song is embodied in the music video as well where she can't sort of swear off this really toxic or bad relationship or this addiction she has to this person who it's either over with or it's not really working out with this person and she essentially needs to beat herself up or yell at herself or convince herself or really even like kidnap herself to put her in a position where she's like you know preventing herself from making that bad decision from going back to that person and I think that's um you know it's a pretty pretty entertaining a song idea and in video obviously you know there are a lot of tracks about that moment of weakness where you know we can't say no to that person who we know that we should be avoiding but the way that she sort of portrays it as like an intervention in a way I thought was was pretty funny and pretty entertaining so ash Niko hi it's me the name of this track enjoyed it quite a bit and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody that has been the weekly track roundup I hope you got some good recommendations out of this

fqYJDueP_8g,hmm hi everyone clear that e phlegm tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of Dream VLEs revenge of the dreamers 3 this is a new collective record from rapper J Cole and his label the roster on the label the dream bill crew revenge of the dreamers 3 I don't know if you guys have noticed but the collective hip hop record has made a bit of a comeback in 2019 earlier this year you had pivot gangs you can't sit with us a record that I did not cover mostly because every rapper on it sounded more nondescript than the last and then there was beast Coast's Escape from New York which I also didn't cover mostly because it was weakly produced the songs were forgettable and I think the full potential of the record was kind of watered down by all the competing voices so revenge 3 marks the third major collective project to drop this year and I actually have some stuff to say about it pretty much because it's decent I prefer it to the other Posse projects that drop this year I also think it's a little better than the last dreamville revenge record as well revenge 2 generally I also think the talent gaps in dreamville are also a lot smaller than they are in other collectives that have put out records over the years like Maybach Music Group or Odd Future or beast Coast there are also some very quality features on this thing from inside and outside of the dreamville camp TI vince staples Maxo cream ski mask the slump god a lot of the production choices on this project i think are kind of creative eccentric even if the beats are a little repetitive structurally they do provide a quality foundation for everyone on dreamville to just jump on and do their thing I love the surreal hypno trap with melting synth tones in the second half of the song oh wow swerve the instrumental on 1993 matches this very busy beat with some serene watery pianos it's kind of engaging but also laid-back I also love the bouncy sensual percussion on the track don't hit me right now the metallic synth tones all over the track are a nice touch to the beat is the perfect foundation for the druggie party anthem the lyrics and flows are shooting for one more thing in my view that makes this collective album special is that there seems to be genuine chemistry between J Cole and everyone else involved with dreamville not only on tracks especially the ones where JIT is on them where everyone seems incentivized to better their flows better their lyricism and just compete but they're actually songs where everyone involved just focuses on a topic on a concept in a collaborative fashion the song Lambo truck kind of boils down to greed being stuck in this destitution mindset where no matter how far you go or how much you make you still feel like you need more the track features dreamville rapper cause but also Top Dawg entertainment reason easily two of the smaller artists on both of these rosters and they're on here basically venting about being underdogs and wanting to I guess rob their labels and the other artists that are on it it's clearly meant in jest and to be a little tongue-in-cheek but still it's kind of funny that the two smaller artists on both of these labels would come together and make a track like this there's also 1993 which is a boisterous smoked anthem I got the sense on this track that everyone involved was like in the studio working on it thinking of different ways to just make each other laugh because it's a kind of feel-good celebratory silly song there's also ladies ladies ladies featuring jid and Ti where both of them just reminisce over various romances and a kind of funny and nostalgic way there are a few buttery R&B slow jams on this thing that are alright I wouldn't say tracks in this style are dreamville strengths but I wouldn't tell the label or anyone on it to avoid making this type of music either it's passable meanwhile there are a few tracks on this thing that are legit boring like they just should have not made it on to this project like Cole and young nudie who do absolutely nothing for each other on the song sunset and I could almost tell on this track Cole is trying to tone lyrically and vocally what he typically does down to match nudies very understated energy and the result is just a forgettable pointless track then there's the earth gang song on this thing which is meant to be on the duo's forthcoming record and for some reason it's one of the underwhelming and understated songs on the entire project which is weird because every other track collective track Earth gang appears on on this project it's easily one of the wildest and rowdy and eccentric and nutso songs on this thing but this particular track is like I don't know so out of character for them in just how lifeless it feels maybe it will make more sense as a mellower moment on their forthcoming project but in revenge 3 it just feels like a law passed that there are a few ok jazz rap tracks on this thing like sleep-deprived or the first half of oh wow sure listenable but not one of the more stunning moments on this project and of course we do get a few tracks that have so many voices on it I think it kind of dilutes the power and the potency of the song don't hit me right now to a degree also the song Costa Rica I mean this is just way too many rappers to be just slipping into a track casually for 3 minutes and 37 seconds especially since the performances of each of the artists on this track varies greatly in terms of intensity and quality and memorability I do like the Jay Cole song middle child that turns up toward the end of this project I gave it a very positive review on my Fantana channel but hearing it in the context of this very collective and collaborative group project seems sort of antithetical to the point of the whole thing so not every track on revenge 3 is amazing there are a handful of snoozers quite a few tracks that are just ok and quite a few great songs too it is all over the place but I will say that I think this project does give a better and a greater vision for the future of the label then I think revenge 2 did and even though it is deeply flawed this certainly does make me more interested in what everyone on dreamville is doing in the future as opposed to some of the other collective based projects that I've heard as of late I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this one transition have you given this record a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next

jzqvz1mnjB8,"hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the new rack and tours record help us stranger it has been over 10 years since Jack White Brendan Benson Patrick Euler and Jack Lawrence came together under the Raconteurs name and put out a full-length studio album and I guess you can tell they were sorely missed because their return led to this album hitting number one on the Billboard charts with over 80,000 units in physical album sales physical in 2019 to be honest while I was a huge white stripes fan when they were active and putting out their best stuff I was a listener that never really matriculated over into a lot of Jack's musical extracurriculars even if it is arguable the first two raconteur records are better than the last two White Stripes records but I just never really went crazy for their mature and dramatic presentations of blues and folk and garage rock I will admit Jack was coming up with some pretty awesome guitar wizardry on this record the riffs on store-bought bones absolutely kick ass but a lot of the songwriting on these albums in my view is painfully basic simple to the point of being uninspired I also wasn't that into the direction of their last full-length album either consolers of the lonely multiple tracks on this thing felt like the band were feeding these various forms of rock through this vaudeville lens that was just incredibly corny to me but hey it's been ten years since then I figure at this point all bets are off the the record could be good the sounds probably way different I did hear some pretty great teaser tracks like bored and raised and Sunday driver both of which have great rock-and-roll riffs bombastic production infectious hooks and a wonderfully rowdy energy the magic on both these tracks boils down to focusing on the basics of every great rock song and just making sure they're done well right down to the quarter note cowbells and fist-pumping drumbeats oh boy daddy some cringe yes it's simple but it's also bold and delivered with a heaping helping of attitude and going deeper into this album I guess all I could hope for more tracks that were equally as gratifying and punchy just whip me up into a frenzy but the issue standing in the way of that is the tracklist is not all that consistent because the flow of the album loses steam pretty quickly as numerous songs just head into milder less interesting territory either that or we're getting lyrics that are so plain and vague the song communicates little to nothing the instrumental can feel kind of off - especially in the case of help me stranger the mix of rickety drums and blown out acoustic guitars and multi-tracked jack white vocals on this track just feel awkward it's so bulky I wish the track just had more groove and finesse and breathing room to it for the most part it just feels like it's crumbling under its own weight the bittersweet and kind of curious melodies on the track only child are a nice change of pace I like some of these synth lines that are worked into the track they feel like something out of a prog song the vocals aren't too bad either but the pacing is so fricking tedious on top of that the songwriting is a little predictable - I feel like once you've heard the first half of the song the rest of the track doesn't really have that much more to present to you it's like I'm listening to really uninspired tear in your beer bar band rock but with more eccentricities and teeth in the production I would say the bar band ballads on this thing continue on to these songs some days I think the ascending and descending guitar leads on this track on the chorus are pretty fantastic but the compositional side of the track the foundation the songwriting is so blatantly unoriginal it's like I'm listening to a more boring version of knockin on heaven's door I just can't get over this feeling that the band are just fulfilling this weird nostalgic kick and that's it and don't get me wrong all of these songs so far are fine they're listenable but they're far from refreshing or exciting I would say the record goes from just okay to hard to tolerate on the track hey chip though it's like I'm listening to bubblegum noise blues no no thank you the song live a lie in my view comes in second as far as hey we probably could have put more effort into this track to make it sound like it didn't get thrown together in a few hours but we didn't goes but maybe the craziest moment on the album comes down to the lyrics on now that you're gone it's essentially one of those really patronizing you left and I don't miss you anymore songs but yet I'm thinking about you enough to write a song about you and now I have all these petty things to say about you being lost without me and it's painfully obvious that all of this is coming from a place of insecurity I honestly wouldn't want to hear this kind of person talking in my ear about any of this crap so why I would want to hear someone singing to me about it I don't know even if the track does have a pretty solid chorus there are a few risks and good songs and memorable moments to be had in the tracklist though that stood out to me the song don't bother me instrumentally is one of the zanier moments on the entire record actually reminds me of something that Jack would have done on his recent boarding house reach solo effort all of these don't bother me bother me mantras all over the track play into these themes of selfishness self obsession apathy being in your own little bubble whether that be because of social media obsession with oneself or some kind of hidden political agenda I also love the track shine a light on me quite a bit to the pained lead vocals and saloon style pianos are pretty sharp also the track features some legitimately sad and lonely lyrics that account for some of the best writing on the entire record my hands are colder when you're gone it makes it hard to play the notes I write to warm your mind honestly though there's not a whole lot on this album that's leaving a super positive impression on me it's just a very weak batch of songs and even if there are elements of the loud bombastic production that I like quite a bit it's just not enough to make up for the very shabby writing on this thing and I know I didn't go too deep into this but there are points or the production works against the quality of this album like on these somewhat folky outro like there's no reason the acoustic guitars on this track should sound this blown up it's just so bricked out I see the merits in this album I could see why people are hype for it I could see why raconteur fans are liking it but I don't I don't think a lot of it is for me frankly I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that' for the link to subscribe to the channel anthony Fantana Raconteurs forever "
iG909JYouxY,hi everyone Matheny tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Pierre Bourne record the life of Pierre for this is the new solo effort of in-demand hip hop producer Pierre Bourne who is suddenly at the center of a lot of conversations about who some of the best and most promising producers are in hip hop right now thanks to many of the beats that were placed on one of the more groundbreaking and head-turning trap records at the moment and that is playboy cardi's Dyle it now as I said in my recent review of slime Mayer a collaborative record between Pierre born and Atlanta rapper Yung nudie Dyle it is a minimal and a subtly psychedelic approach to the rattling high hats and the snappy snares and the rubbery sub bass that a lot of modern internet trap has built its foundations on and as I also said in that slime err review I didn't quite get the point of releasing that slime error album because it only really served to water down the appeal of what Pierre is doing revealing his trademark style as a predictable formula that will go stale if he doesn't switch it up and just a month or so later we're already getting another Pierre project and I feel weird doing this review because I feel like I should have more to say about this album but I don't if you just can't get enough of Pierre sound like you just cannot get enough of it yeah I guess you will like a lot of the instrumentals on this thing if you want to hear that same formula again and again you'll like it because just like before I will say Pierre does have a knack for doing a lot with a little creating these very hypnotic and wavy beats out of just a handful of very small easygoing relaxing sounds like the gentle and wringing synth chords on the track try again they're so sweet they're so tiny they're like a little baby owl there's also the very simple but effective synth line on the track how high compounded with the study bass as well as the hypnotic percussion it's a good beat the song ballad aesthetically is bordering almost on like ambient trap but ultimately there's nothing on this project that stands out instrumentally to my ears as being supremely weird or unique in the ongoing catalogue of beats that pierre has released so far sure while Pierre's approach is not hyper aggressive or anything like that generally the beats on this album are about as conventional as trap beats get a few outliers here and there yes like the weepy string the sample all over the track Romeo Must Die which comparatively our highlight but mostly the beats here are just very very basic and this is something I think I could overlook if it weren't for the fact that Pierre is just such a mediocre and an average rapper singer vocalist yes he raps and sings on this record he's not bringing other people on to rap for him or anything like that this is purely a solo effort and even with the quality standards of rapping and singing being at an all-time low right now I would say Pierre barely even approaches that bar nearly everything he does on this album vocally is nondescript it is dime a dozen some of the shouty vocals of oh my gosh on the track horoscopes I mean they're not that good but at this point on the album I am starving for anything that stands out just anything on this record that doesn't have me feeling like I'm running in circles the song juice stood out as just having some very straightforward rapping on it a bit of oomph to it I guess there may be a flow or two on this thing that's kind of catchy but the appeal these moments is mostly ruined by just how repetitive and uninspired many of the songs and beats are racer stood out to me as conceptually being one of the more introspective and nostalgic tracks on the entire record certainly showed a more personal side of Pierre I suppose that alone I guess puts it a step above the vast majority of these songs that are just trying to be wash rinse repeat playlist party filler like with the young nudie record in many respects especially in small doses this album is OK while it's on but there's literally nothing on this album that's going to warrant another listen five years from now even after listening through this project enough times for review I struggled to recall a moment from it that really stuck with me and I mean really stuck with me something I'm gonna remember for like the next year or so the life of Pierre for is so devoid of anything stand out it's just my numbing it's like being trapped in a maze where every turn that I take I feel like I was just at that point just at that moment and that's because this album is just an attempt by Pierre to saturate the music market with more of the same stuff that he sees is currently hitting in his catalog right now I can't deny that this move is most likely a smart one for Pierre's bottom line but artistically once again Pierre is watering his style down with an album that doesn't show how versatile he is but how one-dimensional the forgettable beats and painfully average vocals are just another kick or disappointment I'm feeling a strong three to light four on this one transition have

9EXEarrz5Bs,I see you buddy with that red tap I can't believe you're gonna do my boy Jaden like this - two or three times why you gotta do it easy he's an angel he's just an angel he's just trying to help he's just trying to help he's trying to get you to use your mind with his raps he's got smart raps he's just my rap man you do your you're your jerk your big old jerk yeah I hate you I hate you hi everyone Hugh theny mid tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jaden Smith album iris this is the latest full-length album from actor rapper singer producer hip hop visionary Jaden Smith starting out as a famous actor and the son of rapper and actor Will Smith Jaden Smith started in the rap game with a pretty high profile way higher than I think any artist would have been given the quality of the music he was releasing right off the bat with the cool tapes of Volume one and two but despite the negative reactions to what Jaden was doing at this point in his career he was slowly gaining a very passionate fan base people who seemed enamored with his fame with his image with his naive but ambitious artistic vision we eventually reached a point where Jaden singles EPS and mixtapes built him up into album mode and that is when we got sire in 2017 a record that to this day every once in a while I do get reactions and opinions telling me dude dude you were too harsh on that record but going back I'm still not really seeing what exactly I was missing on that project as it doesn't really feel like I'm listening to a rapper but someone LARPing as a rapper blatantly ripping off tons of ideas from his contemporaries as he jumps from one track to the next now granted some of the instrumentals on sire were pretty great the budget on this record was clearly high it's not a cheap album but it is very misguided and somewhat derivative album going into iris I was hoping that Jaden's writing and his singing his rapping his song Inge would have gotten better but I I that's that's most likely not going to be the case especially since when he dropped the sunset tapes a project he put out last year just a year after sire the songs on this thing were way worse on the production side and the tunes the ideas were even more derivative but now he was borrowing those ideas from other places namely groups such as Brock Hampton the sunset tapes is easily one of the most unflattering projects I've heard this decade so again honestly I would have liked to have gone into iris with higher hopes but I just don't see any reason as to why Jaden would have turned a new leaf artistically in the past few years especially since these two albums seem very obviously related they're structured similarly the title is literally sire backwards it is pretty much sires spiritual successor so clearly there was a lot of stuff on sire that Jaden saw fit to carry over onto iris stuff he thought warranted repeating like the numerous references to his song Lost Boy on this LP also the fact that the album kicks off with another four-part song whose titles spell out a color not blue in this instance but pink and pink is actually a pretty cool moment on the album which is not surprising because in the grander scheme of sires tracklist blue is one of the better moments on the album to the opening track P kicks off at these weepy pianos and female lead vocals that are very theatrical it sounds almost like the intro to an Evanescence song we get some kanye inspired twists toward the back end of the track it's a very weird mix of ideas that I partially think are super corny but also kind of admirable as the production is pretty nice and I can't really think of any artist out there right now that's going for this particular combination of ideas it definitely gets better as it wrasses but my main issue with this song is that it sets this tone of epic extravagance that the rest of the record just doesn't really deliver on both sonically and substantively following after is a straight rap track with a killer instrumental very peppy track percussion complemented with these plinky and deflating synth tones at various points the instrumental goes kind of lush with these very subtle layers of harmony what's less impressive those Jayden's very flat one-dimensional rapping he's also placed a distortion effect on his voice on this one it's like he thinks he's the Genji Kanye but he's executing it with some stale Drake swag and of course a side of woe Candace woven into the lyrics every once in a while the song n is a lot grander instrumentally and stylistically it's actually pretty immense and powerful but I mostly would just like to hear a better rapper on this because all Jaden does over this track is just deliver more nearly monotone bars that just sound convinced of their own genius as Jaden's rapping that people don't get it people don't get these raps people don't get deep raps they just want a flick of the wrist what's also kind of weird is that for a majority of the time Jaden is rapping in this very deep voice we don't actually hear him rapping in his normal register until the back end of the song and whatever he's doing to get his voice to sound this way sounds especially artificial during the second verse where his rapping just sounds really awkward and clunky and a lot of Peng shine when I'm running around and I'm still weighing on the Honjo though I guess the reasoning behind Jaden pitching his voice this way is that he is rapping in character at various points on this album from the standpoint of iris which was also a thing he did on sire as sire was a character too but the plot and the message of that record was so convoluted it was difficult to follow that element of the project I guess in a way that is a bit more focused on iris and I guess this iris person of Jaden's imagination is supposed to be the stereotypical materialistic not deep at all rapper but I guess he's also someone who has these ambitions of becoming a leader in a futuristic world where la lays in partial ruin and while I guess all this is cool in concept there are moments on this record where it is confusing as to whether Jayden is rapping from the standpoint of himself or iris because occasionally the messaging seems mismatched as there's plenty of run-of-the-mill rap shit' Jayden seems to say in his own voice on this album and when Jayden is clearly rapping from the standpoint of iris like in the midst of the track mission he's just spitting a lot of stuff that I think he would have no problem just rapping in his own voice from his own standpoint so the create a barrier between Jayden and this character I don't think is that thick honestly it all just seems like a cringy or take on what J Cole was doing with his deep voiced alter-ego on his last full length album kod the song K in my view is a gorgeous finish to these four parts the song is a very dramatic ballad that mixes elements of rock and hip-hop Jaden's vocal harmonies on the first leg are actually pretty great generally I would say his singing has improved on this LP a bit the track has a good progression a killer refrain suddenly it transitions into a beat switch that the instrumental sounds like it's sampling a pair of hair clippers it goes hard as hell so it's a really fun ending to this four-part moment but once we get past this point once we get past this very epic extravagant larger-than-life intro how quickly do you think Jayden starts to nosedive this thing it's actually right away with the song noise featuring Tyler the Creator now there are elements of the song that I like that I think are decent but Tyler's feature is not very focused at all sounds like something he would have rapped in 2013-2014 but really the worst thing about this song is that it is a blatant a blatant a totally like unashamed a totally unand blatant obvious and just like bold-faced ripoff of Travis Scott it's like Jayden basically heard Astroworld and said this is what I need to do this is what I need to copy I need to pursue the same Basie effect heavy psyche trap that Travis Scott is doing on his last album that is my artistic vision now his artistic vision may be he tosses in a few more instrumental bells and whistles auto-tune vocal harmonies some dystopian effects to get it to sound a little different a little darker a little weird and this is not the only track that blatantly rips off Travis Scott on the album not by a long shot we have the track again which essentially sees Jayden going Smith ou mode with it's trippy transitions and hypnotic synthesizers and washes of reverb also the auto-tuned ad-libs calling out in the background really are you serious there's also a dreamy sad vocal progression toward the end of the track where the instrumental turns super mellow and it sounds like something off of a Joe G record it's like he can't think up a single idea on his own or even change any of the ideas he's taking and turned them into his own the tracklist basically delivers one Travis Scott ripoff after another up to the point where we hit fire department where Jayden treats listeners to this punk-rock detour and ultimately while this is fine it's not like groups such as horror haven't already done this to a degree way better miraculously Jayden pulls off another Travis Scott ripoff with the track mission that actually kind of sounds like a decent Travis got song a song that I would have loved to have heard Travis record I'm on a mission mission I'm on a mission mission the amount of tracks that just basically sound like Astroworld leftovers on this record is astonishing it is mind-blowing I can't believe that an artist of Jaden's profile would blow so much money on just trying to sound like the last Travis Scott record and the ripoffs keep coming but I will try to pass this point focus a bit more on the songs on the record where Jaden switches it up a little bit stylistically we do have the tracks summertime in Paris featuring his sister Willow Smith and the vocals on the course here are light and heartwarming and cute it's mostly a blend of R&B and acoustic ballad jury it sort of sounds like something xxx 10th asean would have done on his last record except it send it out to the point where it becomes stale the song blackout is absolutely a torture chamber another slow burner in the tracklist here where Jayden effectively is just moaning over this hard-hitting beat the percussion on this track is gigantic and just completely Dwarfs everything else in the mix which is just so washed out and reverb it's difficult to make heads or tails of it it's like a horrible fusion of hip-hop alternative R&B and like those really bad Beach indie bands that use effects to distract from the lack of an interesting song idea Jayden breaks into a very similar moment in the second half of the song pain which is worth mentioning not only because Jayden once more uses way too many effects on this track but also this is one of many instances on this album where Jaden will end a track off by D touring into some random moment that seems to think it's deeper more interesting that it actually is the closing track the title track basically presents the same problem as it works in several different parts none of which really connect in a significant or a meaningful way it's like they're all just randomly segwaying into something else we get some rap rock then we get more acoustic all R&B balladry then we get a weird semi ambient spoken word passage at the very end that's actually kind of neat but even these moments on the album do feel like they're slightly derivative like Jayden is borrowing from Brock Hamptons bare face or even Frank ocean's endless the track on my own miraculously is actually a pretty good song even if it is hella derivative of that graduation 808 era Kanye right down to the flow right down to the groove of the instrumental Kid Cudi kills it on the hook though his vocal performance on this one is lame and there's not really much more I can remark on with this record it's not very good I didn't like it very much and I'm not surprised not only because many of the conceptual and compositional flaws of saiyr carried over onto this record and yeah Jaden's lyrics can get pretty corny like that one line about people switching and how he's not playing Nintendo Jesus Christ it's not as bad as the washing dirty dishes lines off of sire but still not all that great and once more Jaden seems convinced he's making music that's deeper then it actually is but I digress my main issue with this record is why would I want to spend an hour listening to some dude who bought his way into the rap game pretend to be Travis Scott for like a dozen or so tracks I can't imagine a bigger waste of time I do admire some of what Jaden was able to achieve here instrumentally I do admire his very clear ambitions to make music that sounds larger-than-life but the likeability of this LP kind of starts and ends there as he's still an average singer a subpar rapper and lyricist for someone who's blatantly ripping off these auteur such as Kanye and Travis Scott he's not much of an ideas guy he's more of a I'll borrow your idea guy and just basically copy and paste it without really doing much to alter it yeah there are a few decent hooks here a couple of decent tracks but that's about it the rest of what's here is either very hard to sit through or it is grossly unimaginative to the point

a great entertainer mark rebbe a is a fine a fine entertainer okay he's a fine entertainer excuse me excuse me alright worst tracks worst tracks just a couple of worst tracks this week really just a couple of tracks in in each category this week because not not too many songs to cover but a couple of worst tracks one edge here whoa with Chris Stapleton of Bruno Mars oh my god this is like the corniest rock song I've heard in a long time and it's not surprising because it's come from Ed Sheeran but God why is Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars on here if you really wanted to do like a true blue rock song two of the last guys you would bring on to a track that's like from the just from the tone of the guitar riffs on this thing again to the last guys you'd invite are like one of the kings of pop in almost like the king of a mini revival of new jack swing here Bruno Mars an in-country artist Chris Stapleton two guys who I have immense respect for I mean I liked some of Chris's music recently reviewed it positively I like Bruno Mars's last record so hey I I like these guys quite a bit but this song blow blows the productions absolutely boring and yeah the tune sucks and I just feel like Ed Sheeran doesn't write good rock songs so I guess we'll just leave it there a blink-182 has a new single out a new track happy days it's tired it there's there's really no gas left in the blink-182 tank I just don't think there's really anything else to say at this point there is no gas left in the tank it sounds stale sounds like you guys aren't as into doing what you're doing as you used to be and this coming from somebody who back in the day loved enema of the state you know loved that early blink sound but this is pop punk having a hard time adjusting is is what it sounds like to me and finally the bird and the bee they have a new record on the way where I guess the do a track 4 track tribute of various songs from the van Halen catalog this one they have seen fit to release is their own rendition which includes a bit of a gender role flip hear of the song hot for teacher and I which I've always thought was kind of a scummy douchey song to begin with even with the role reversal it's still kind of scummy and douchey and I absolutely hate instrumentally how they sort of flipped it not only do they try to stay compositionally as true as possible to the original but they do it with all of this like cutesy somewhat indie inspired instrumentation and it just does not work so I'm really just disgusted and we'll we'll leave it there all right let's move on to the tracks that I was kind of met on this week I was kind of met on them they're not terrible they're not bad they're not awful I wouldn't throw them in the garbage or anything but they're still worth mentioning and I thought that you guys might dig them a little bit more than me first off Oh country artist Tyler Childers all yarn this track has actually been out for a little while now but it is a very heartfelt and in lovely little ballad of love and devotion that's very cute it's very heartwarming it's quite nice he has also put out another single from his forthcoming album that I thought was very bland very boring didn't really dig it at all frankly but just given the quality of this song and you know I'm not saying he's reinventing the wheel the country wheel or anything like that but he does seem to be a very good songwriter he's got some good pipes vocally and I don't know I'm definitely curious to hear what he's he's gonna be offering on this new album of his so I just thought I'd make you guys aware you know country artist who's who's most likely worth your time Tyler Childers moving on from there ty Segall has a new track out titled radio and yeah new record on the way I think the instrumental on this one is fiery it's bold it's a little zany it's very colorful however what kept me from loving this track is that I thought this was easily one of Ty's most unlikable vocal performances in quite a while and yeah I just think vocally he his performance was very weak on this one not much else to say other than that just the the vocals could have used I think a better take rosalia has a brand new track out titled million era it's off her new double single here titled effing money man it's the a side it's the more prominent of these two track so I'm gonna focus on that track and it's a pretty short and punchy single that's very materialistic it sort of seems like a lot of what has made Rosalee a special up until this point is being sold up the river a little bit on this track there are some things about the song that I think are really cool I think the beat is kind of colorful I think the attitude of it is a little tongue-in-cheek frankly but still I guess I guess hearing Rosalia put up a track that is this one-dimensional in terms of its theme in terms of its sentiment in terms of exactly what it's trying to Express is a little disappointing plus the numerous refrains of moody moon just gets kind of stale by the end of the track frankly moving on from there Oh also we have this new song over here with production from none other than Kenny beets we have Dominic fyke here who also has got a bit of a visibility bump due to his ties with Brock Hampton recently I tried his latest project a while ago and I wasn't all that into it it felt kind of low fine it felt a little artsy but the vocals and the songwriting didn't really stand out to me all that much although I was hoping once he gets into a place where he's writing stuff that has higher production value the tunes and just the overall enjoyability of his work will get better I thought this might be the first taste of this here because hey he's working with Kenny beets pretty high profile guy at this point he's not going to put out anything that sounds terrible so he comes out with the song with Dominic and I know feels like a bit of a throwback mm Summer Jam in a way it's okay you know the vocals to me still felt kind of generic the songwriting to me didn't feel all that refreshing or interesting just kind of felt like a very happy-go-lucky summery feel-good a bit of an earworm type of track you know not much else though I'm not sure if this is a track that I'm gonna be wanting to listen to once we're in fall or really once we're in August honestly so yeah it's okay it was sweet to the ear but didn't really leave a strong impression moving on from there we also have cupcake with Aisha a new dancehall singer from a single from her which yeah just features are pretty straightforward modernized dancehall beat you know cupcakes usual a very lewd and rude writing style lots of personality lots of attitude continues to be really you know pretty entertaining pretty entertaining voice in the hip-hop landscape right now and let's move on to the tracks that doe really ended up allowing me of sticking with me left a very positive impression on me first off oh shout out to a Tommy Phoenix Tommy Phoenix Bianca who is a creator of multiple different mediums I have met her before at VidCon because she's been a YouTube creator for awhile and and I guess you know now she's focusing more on making music you know under a different name and everything and this is actually a pretty awesome blend of pop and art pop and R&B the instrumental in the background with all of its on a very fast-moving arpeggios and kind of swirling keyboard notes is pretty stunning vocally I think she does very well on the track which the song had a bit of a stronger beat and groove to it and everything but as is it's gorgeous it's stunning it's beautiful it's inspiring like quite a bit like quite a bit so Bianca check this single out it's sweet to the ear it's beautiful it's gorgeous so check it out alright moving on from there gave this track over here this new post Malone cut featuring young thug a full review over on the Fantana channel check it out over there if you haven't dug this one quite a bit I think this is easily one of post Malone slickest songs yet slickest in terms of production slickest in terms of writing the young thug feature does go like a little hard like a little over the top but it's a really sweet tune it's a great tune and post continues to inhabit and do incredibly well within this lane where he is like literally blending elements of trap with singer-songwriter music and it just works so well so diggin it like in quite a bit moving on from there we have new Kanye West brothers brand new track featuring Charlie Wilson I did a review of this song in full over at the Fantana channel you can find it over there as well if you want to hear more of my thoughts on this but generally this track is a very nice quality throwback to the early days of Kanye's discography feels like late registration era college dropout era very soulful lots of references to friends and family and you know just basically trying to live a more positive of existence in the lyrics even the flow feels like a bit of a throwback to Kanye's earlier days but yeah it's pretty good like to quite a bit moving on from there we have Brooke candy teaming up with Malibu Mitch and Charli XCX for one of the sexiest and most understated singles pop hip-hop blends that you're gonna hear this year it's nasty it's unapologetic and it's it's very um it's it's very graphic and very sexual so you know if that's kind of thing that turns you off or that you like to steer clear from in your music and stay away stay away also a black metal trio at least I think there's still a trio that I have just learned about by the name a cigar em and abominations alter is the name of this cut just feels like some modernized punchy hellish performed aggressively old-school black metal with some pretty rich and and searing somewhat memorable lead melodies in the you know guitar riffs too so a good performance good production on this one and yeah just a solid black metal tune so stream it down below along with all of the other tracks I've talked about in this video and that is gonna be it for the weekly track roundup everybody that is gonna be it for the weekly track roundup so thank you very much for watching thank you very much for listening once more shout out to the live dates that I have coming up in August hope to see you guys there and I will catch you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana the roundup forever 
jV-Ziiole98,hi everyone Tom to New York tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Tom York LP anima this is the newest musical solo effort from Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke it's also attached to a short film not gonna go over that in this video but still this is a bit of a multimedia endeavor if you have been following Tom's exploits you know that he has been keeping himself pretty busy as of late at this point it's only been three years or so since Radiohead released their somber but powerful a moon shaped pool and last year Tom released a massive hour-plus soundtrack attached to the Suspiria homage directed by Luca Guadagnino so recently we've had no shortage of Thom Yorke in our lives and he just keeps it coming with this new album anima honestly there have been quite a few Thom Yorke musical extracurriculars that I found pretty underwhelming Adams for peace as well as tomorrow's modern boxes but 2006 is the eraser though was definitely a respectable debut solo outing it's eerie glitchy IDM inspired brand of art pop has aged fairly well through the years I definitely liked it more than the King of Limbs and it's unquestionably more consistent than hail to the thief it's been well over a decade at this point since Tom has put out some solo stuff that's really left a strong positive impression on me as a result of that I will admit I didn't go into this new LP expecting to be wowed or blown away but I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed it because anima is easily Tom's most immersive and detailed album since the eraser I wouldn't say he changes his style up too much though he's still very much inhabiting these spaces of IDM and Glitch but the instrumental palettes on anima offer more space more ambience surreal or even slightly psychedelic production from traffic to runway away the tracks on this record offers cerebral synthetic soundscapes progressions that move in a very subtle and linear fashion it's like I'm listening to all of these meditative but slightly dark and dystopian musical motifs or sonic mood boards as the appeal of many of these Triax I think comes down to repetition or creating an entrancing vibe plus there are only a few tracks or I would say the lyrics and the vocals are super clear super upfront and actually guide the tone of the song for example the song the axe whose point of view lyrically is coming from a place of paranoia and violence the haunting mantra on this track certainly has stuck with me post listening to this album odd we had a deal as tom is singing in this very open very wet mix like a very very tiny voice two creepy ghosts there's also the stunningly dejected dong chorus whose vocals are very deadpan maybe the most understated that I've ever heard Tom on an album again I think the power of this record comes down to the cycling hypnotic beats and synthesizer tones that are thick rich analogue I wouldn't be surprised if Tom spent hours just twiddling knobs to get the synths to sound in just the way that they do on this project whether he's playing a literal analog synthesizer or just doing it all through an interface or something I'm not sure I will also say a majority of the sounds on this record are mixed immaculately I'm not sure why the projects like tomorrow's modern boxes as well as amok just fell so dry and flat and lifeless to me even though anima is just as minimal if not more minimal instrumentally than those records it feels like it has so much more presence again sounds generally on this record fantastic maybe with the most major exception of the clunky bass line on the cut impossible nots how well engineered this album is becomes overwhelming at points like on the track not the news where the bleeps and bloops that are kind of guiding Tom's voice through the track are eventually enhanced with these lavish wonderful gorgeous string sections on the back end of the cut this track also features one of Tom's most pained vocal performances on the entire album pretty powerful run way away has this unique stillness to it that I know think any other song on this record has as I listened to this one I feel like I am not listening to a progression or a sound piece but I am just existing in a space it's been treating in that sense even if it's not one of my favorite songs on the record the rest of the tracks on the album though in my opinion are kind of uniform in just how apocalyptic how eerie they are the track last I heard as well as traffic where the album ends up faltering is when Tom hands over a composition or a progression that's just a little too repetitive a little too one-dimensional or OneNote I'm a very rude person is most likely the biggest offender on this front also the closer also again impossible Matt's I think the way to put this album simply is that for people who have been aware of Tom York's work for a while now but haven't been convinced artistically of his solo genius as of this moment this record is most likely not going to convert you this project is very much in the same stylistic vein of a majority of Tom's work also I think many of the flaws of Tom's past records have also carried over onto this one I also have a hard time imagining this album just being listened to in a casual sense for as dreary as the eraser is I think that album is probably an easier listen by comparison with anima this is very much a a mood album that I would recommend specifically for like a very solo headphone type of experience and in that context it's very good it's just not an album I imagine many people just throwing on whenever for those who have gotten quite a bit out of Tom's solo work so far I wouldn't be surprised if many of them saw anima as Tom's best work if not at least on par with the eraser having said all of that though I personally am still not blown away by this record to get to that point even though I do love the sounds I love the mixes I love a lot of the meditative progressions I would need some stronger lyrics I would need some stronger melodies but as an album that seems like Tom mostly taking some abstract shots over since progressions and beats he's been developing it sounds really cool I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what

zN-S-2NIYLU,yeah hi everyone vaccinia axe tanto here the antennas busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Freddie Gibbs and Madlib album bandanna this is the new collaborative album of Gary Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs and hip hop production legend Madeline at this point I don't think either really needs that deep of an introduction especially since the last time both of these guys linked up they came through with one of the best hip-hop records of the decade of course I'm talking about 2014's pinata not only was mad lib in rare form on this album dropping some of his best beats since his crossover with MF DOOM in mad villainy but Freddie's work I had been aware of up until this point but on this record it really floored me he was on a level of focus and flow and just conceptual topical writing that he just hadn't been on before so I would say pinata is certainly a case of mad lib and Freddie coming together and bringing out the best in each other so I'm here hoping they can do that once again five years later with the follow-up to pinata bandana now the teaser tracks leading up to this album in my view we're all pretty good so there was no reason not to assume this album was going to live up to my expectations and I mostly think that's what bandana does I think that's the purpose it mostly serves living up to expectations for the most part if you've heard pinata you have a pretty strong idea as to what Madlib and Freddie are going to do on bandana you're getting cold blooded cocaine wraps with clever one-liners interesting cultural references and skilled rhyme schemes and a decent level of topical focus as well the song practice for example is a tense introspective cut about being caught cheating or just not being faithful Freddie on the song essentially fucking up his home life and in the second verse on this track Freddie breaks up with the streets I guess in the same way that he did with his mistress on the first verse generally the track is about just yourself on a better path that is going to benefit you and those who you love those around you we also have the glamorous and smooth crime pays which is pretty self-explanatory though not entirely a glorification of crime a lot of the track is about the risks being taken the costs of existing in the underbelly of society gibbs talks about someone he knows contracting HIV on the track he also goes into his own drug dealing saying that he's slanging but he's still a slave the song fake names deals in a lot of the same issues as well but the tone of the track is so much more fearful and paranoid shit so real gotta use fake names and on the second verse of this track freddie delivers this flawless masterful flow over one of the most unexpected beat switches on the entire record meanwhile the track cataracts is like this blissful inebriation anthem with a somewhat nostalgic kick the song is like him just locked in a hazy dream state it's so fuzzy it's so sleepy meanwhile freestyle shit is an incredibly soulful kickoff to this entire record it's got some vintage horn samples and some very generous vinyl crackle as well Freddie weaves rhymes on this cut about his transition from Street hustling to rap stardom his mantra on the song essentially being when this music shit wasn't moving main I might as well be moving things for the most part Freddie sticks to his guns on this album of drugs and crime and violence but while also acknowledging the dark side of that lifestyle and the way our political system influences the current state of things one of many examples of this on this album are the Obama and incarceration lines on the back end of flat tummy tea also the ongoing drug war in the way aspects of it disproportionately affect the black community and this consistency from Freddie over the years isn't really a bad thing so few rappers are operating at his level and in his lane at the moment lyrically I think the lowest point on the album is the really quick Maxine Waters line on the track Palmolive where Freddie drops a somewhat anti-vaccine and I get why a guy like Freddie would be skeptical of things like the government the powers that be the medical system incredible amounts of medical injustice have been leveled against the black community for generations and it's still going on it's still costing still though in a time where it's routine to see headlines talking about measles outbreaks endorsing anti-vaccination form is kind of irresponsible all that being said though let's try to get to Mad Libs beats on this thing which I think can be a little hit or miss here shortly after the release of bandana Madlib hopped on to social media to proudly proclaim that he produced every beat on this record on his iPad and given the sound and the tone of some of these instrumentals that's not something I'm super surprised to hear not to say the beats on this thing are bad or cheap or super simple in fact most of them are in the same soulful easygoing sample heavy vintage vibe that you are used to most Madol it beats being in but some of the effects he throws on these beats do clearly have a very digital tone to them a lot of the drums the percussion hits feel very clean feel very clear on particular tracks even though things do feel a bit more synthetic this time around on a majority of the songs here it does not stop Madlib from achieving his usual magic it does get a little weird when Madlib tries to push outside of his comfort zone occasionally resulting in interesting moments like massage seats which sounds like a really cool old-school dancehall flip but then we also get the first half of the track half main half cocaine which is an honest to god trap beat yes mad lib is making trap beats you got the high hats you have the kicks you have the sub bass you have those snares you have the kind of eerie minor chords playing back and forth it's a little nocturnal and it's a bit reminiscent of the material off of Freddy's shadow of the doubt and sure it's not bad because I think Freddy mostly makes the track but does mad libs step in and show an incredible amount of prowess in this particular instrumental style not really there's also situations and there's also gat Dan but both tracks as a result of the new interface Madlib is working through feel very very clean especially the first of the two not that gat dam doesn't have its other issues as well because Freddy's mony barely holding on to pitch say that song isn't exactly a hi-point either if he was going to do something like this where he's effectively not that great of a singer I wish he would just kind of ham it up a bit more and just enjoy the flaws of his voice but one more time because I do want to stress this this change of interfaces does not affect the magic of cuts like education as well as Yogi's in some respects I think Mad Libs switching over to the iPad on this record has made some of his instrumentals a bit more dynamic because there are quite a few interesting beat switches on this LP certainly more if I remember correctly than what was on pinata and it's a pretty cool feature to the record and speaking of features there are also quite a few features on this record that are pretty sick we have a stunning soul chorus from the likes of Anderson PAC easily one of Pusha T's best features to date I loved that cold blooded line about him being invited into the White House even though Obama knew he was a criminal yes eBay aka mos def on was great as was black thought the only feature that I really wanted more from was was killer Mike who handled the chorus on Palmolive decently but when killer Mike appears on your record like I mean you want to utilize him to the greatest degree that you can overall though bandana great album even if I don't love it as much as pinata I don't find it to be as immersive there's not as much material year not as many impressive hooks and pinata just contains tracks that you're just not gonna outdo songs like real which are easily one of the most brutal diss tracks of this decade a few of Mad Libs beats in my opinion were just okay but I cannot deny that Freddy I think upped his game a little bit on this LP I think Madlib in my opinion shown a bit brighter on pinata than Freddy did but I think Freddy is who really kind of stood out as the prime voice the prime artistic voice on bandana all that being said though this record is still two of the best right now doing what they do best and that's it I'm feeling a decent - a strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best true the - what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Freddie Gibbs Madlib forever

EbkAfmNLmwM,ah hi everyone or gang here or gang the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new keyring Jake Allen an album returned to Center this is the newest full-length album from singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist Karen J Kalinin one of the most exciting artists from Down Under at the moment in 2017 he released one of my favorite albums of the year that would be bravado it is a great album I love this record it's fantastic but there were a number of occurrences post the release of this album that seemed to distract away from the album or maybe the dreamer attention to care and then he would have had otherwise it's probably a little bit of both there are a number of things I could bring up but to mention a few one the bronze skin and nudity and stream of piss on the front cover of bravado that was one thing there's also singer Jimmy Barnes becoming a huge meme as a result of his appearance in the big enough music video there was also a quick flash of everything that was under Kieran's kill that he was wearing at the Arya's Music Awards ceremony which sent Karen to court he ended up getting off on a good behavior bond toward the start of last year I got to admit Karen's existence and the way people react to it stirs up all kinds of feelings in me what about it two people not get through the lens of Iggy Pop and David Bowie and punk rock and gender bent new wavers isn't everything Karen's doing in his art both musically and visually pretty well established at this point furthermore isn't it clear especially in Karen's early work that his explorations of gender are exposing just how performative some elements of our sexuality are isn't the title track of his 2013 album embraces emul take on violent toxic masculinity and the song big enough which by many is perceived as being like a meme anthem is literally a track about bringing together all people's globally saying we can live in harmony the world is big enough for all of us it just seems like the world is either too socially conservative or normy or hung up on fake woke 'no stew really appreciate what he's doing and i can't decide if he just wasn't made for this era or if his knack for stirring controversy is proof that he's exactly what we need right now maybe for his own mental health the promotional rollout for Karen's new LP was pretty standard I also have a sneaking suspicion that the title of this project which can be interpreted in a number of different ways might also have something to do with his emotional well-being returning to a place of peace and safety and familiarity but that is without me even going into the hilarious concept behind this project return to Center is a covers album but it's not simply just that apparently Karen spent the budget for this project on tons of equipment and instruments from Guitar Center everything played or used on this record allegedly came from Guitar Center the plan was then to record the album within the grace period between the purchase and the end of the return policy so then he would get a full refund for all the instruments he purchased for the record and that's exactly what he did everything on this album was literally returned to center and I think that definitely impacts the sound of this record in a few ways for sure instrumentally this thing is not nearly as lavish as anything off of bravado return to center is certainly not as loud or as dense or as experimental but still this record presents a pretty fun vibrant sound and I think Karen uses the very short amount of time allotted to him for this record to throw out in these performances what comes naturally to him and that is sweet sweet camp the opening track life is life kicks off with these hilariously corny synth horns playing out this fanfare passages Karen gears up for a celebratory and a grand rendition of a totally forgotten pop gem from a group called opus originally Austrian pop act and believe me Kieran's version sounds nothing like the original which is like a pop reggae flip from the 80s which I guess isn't too weird when considering what groups like the police were doing around this time so Kieran does take a lot of wonderful liberties on this track though it's not the case for every song here for example Kieran's renditions of Randy Newman's pretty boy as well as Ultravox is Vienna are pretty faithful to the originals but what's even more significant than the renditions that Kieran brings to the table on these tracks are the songs that he actually chooses it's such a purposeful mix of musical triumphs forgotten by time and deep deep pulls from the worlds of synth pop and new wave not only does the tracklist of this thing provide a very clear and wonderful musical map for a lot of what inspires Kieran sound but it also explains his artistic ethos as well many of the sonic palettes and lyrical themes that have turned up on Karin's past couple of records show up in this tracklist in very bold ways we have songs about love we have songs about celebrating life in the world songs that explore sexuality and gender songs that express a difficulty with fitting in the world and also songs that are like a meta commentary on music itself these songs are not just being chosen because Karen thinks they're good songs that he wants to share with his audience I would say Kieran song choices on return to Center are tantamount to him painting a self-portrait in a way and it's rare that I hear a list of songs chosen on a covers record that feel like they are serving that purpose because given what I know of Karen's character in his past output I would guess he deeply identifies with the narratives and themes of many of these songs we first had the song the homosexual given Karen's outward appearance and the way he presents himself artistically I'm not surprised he would cover a track about being attacked as gay just for being different and not only talking about how that's eating away at your psyche but also pointing out how that at its root is a results of society's insecurities around sexuality and a whole host of other things there's also a very weird sub narrative in this track of our protagonist essentially going on these sexual conquests as revenge against the men who label him and malign him I also like the instrumental on this track it's sleek its sexy the finger picked acoustic guitars are wonderful the song pretty boy is very different in tone instrumentally with very somber pianos and understated vocals but I'm seeing some common narrative themes in terms of being misunderstood being in the midst of very violent surroundings I really was wondering as the album continued just how much does care and see himself and see his own experience in these tracks and I feel like that connection ended up being confirmed in his cover of public image limited drives the UK post-punk outfits biggest single ever and Kieren essentially uses this track to make a statement about the legal fallout past his little flashing endeavor he laces into the track audio from numerous news broadcasts talking about the situation I mean he must see the track's message of conflict and opposing sides as being applicable to the situation I love the way instrumentally this track develops Kieren essentially flips this song which was once a you know pretty melodic raging rock tune into this blissful folk rock anthem with wonderful acoustic guitar is a great drumbeat soulful group vocals these song the whole of the moon isn't too different from the original version of the track but Kieran's vocal performance on this one is a stunner it's such a powerful pop rock anthem that is just grand and showy and larger-than-life the song signed curtain is originally a track from canterbury scene robert wyatt it's a funny track that essentially is taking the piss out of song structure the lyrics are literally this is the first verse this is the second verse this is the chorus you get the idea Kieran takes this track which originally had been imagined a few different ways and he turns it into this loud distorted wall of grunge guitar noise it rocks so hard it rocks so hard and it's very funny I also love Karen's very sinister and low-key rendition of it takes a muscle to fall in love I admit that I didn't read enough about this project before I embarked on my first listen to it and this was the first song that said to me wait a second this is a cover is this a covers album because the first time I remember hearing this track was when am i a covered it on her Maya project and it's kind of funny the original tune from spectral display is solid it's a solid song but the instrumentation is so bare and it's so skeletal and it's so basic nearly any songwriter covering this thing could take it in a myriad of different directions I think Karen takes some incredible liberties on this track with the acoustic guitar licks the you funky drums these subtle synth swells in a strange way it's like listening to two covers in one because while yes this is a spectral display cover the instrumental feels like something that would have been on a classic Depeche Mode song a band that's undoubtedly an influence on what Karen does as well Karen's interpretation of Australian songwriter Billy fields you weren't in love with me isn't as loud or as colorful as the original but the emotional pain he displays on this track really pours through very boldly I think the Ultravox track is great too it's kind of the large finish the album needed and even though these songs are not keyring songs I feel like after listening to his renditions of them and getting a grasp as to how he relates to them I definitely have a better sense of who Karen is as an artist and as a creator I didn't quite get what he saw in the Randy Newman track on this album honestly I think it's a one of his weaker songs and the title track of this thing is the only original on the album which is essentially just a weird guitar pedal effect drone with some added freaky vocals at a few points it's a decent palate cleanser which of course is right in the center of the album but honestly I could take or leave it overall though I think this thing is a great record I loved it I had a lot of fun listening to it even though it is a covers album I see it as artistically valid as anything Karen has come out with up until this point and I think fans coming into this thing with a patient ear and aren't just orbiting around caring for the memes or the drama will get a lot out of this project feeling a decent too strong eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best

HOK54fBv90E,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new posthumous Prince album originals this project is an old but newly released collection of songs from R&B and synth funk legend Prince even though there's probably a huge amount of songs in the now unlocked music vault of Prince the amount of commercial leaks we've heard from it since his passing have been very few in number we had last year's piano in a microphone 1983 which was a very short collection of Barre piano and vocal performances from Prince himself that showcased the man's raw talent a pretty low-risk venture commercially considering how stunning the performances on this thing are and even if people don't care for it most fans will most likely look at this record like it's a live album or something and just move on additionally this project doesn't really leave in artistic language on Prince's legacy which i think is very important to maintain because putting an artist previously unreleased music out there after their death is a lot like making a statement on their behalf one that they may have structured in any number of ways had they been able to do it themselves thankfully as they release originals is a pretty low-risk venture as well as it features songs Prince had already released in other contexts essentially writing these songs for other artists like Sheila E or Kenny Rogers musical ventures such as the family or girl groups that he was connected to at the time like vanity 6 or Apollonia 6 so without a doubt a great deal of hardcore Prince fans are familiar with most of these tracks and even casual listeners will instantly recognize the times jungle love or the bangles Manic Monday and of course the track nothing compares to you which Prince originally wrote for the family but then Sinead O'Connor blew the track up with their own version that was a major hit so I guess you could argue in a way Prince has already ordained the release of these tracks they've already seen varying degrees of success when released under the names of other artists in that respect I can't really deny how smart it is of Warner and npg to come out with a collection of this type now I know what you might be thinking Anthony just because these songs were released by other artists doesn't mean that Prince's versions are good or that the sound quality of them is ready for the public's critical ear but no being the perfectionist that Prince was these demos were fully decked out instrumentally and there are really only a few tracks on this thing I would dare call rough or even vaguely unfinished the song noon rendezvous is pretty bare in its presentation of just vocals and piano but it's still a really solid beautiful song love thy will be done instrumentally is easily one of the more repetitive and basic cuts on here plus the vocal layering on the track is is not all that well placed it sounds like a bad bone Iver mixing job dear Michelangelo has something off about it as well sonically it's like the vocals and the base and the barely audible drums just kind of bleed into each other or just mix in this very odd way it's very very muddy and there's something off-putting about the track wouldn't you love to love me as well when orienting the tracklist on this project the label definitely left some of the Messier tracks toward the end generally though the material on this project sounds very very good it's not the high gloss production of Purple Rain but I think that's a bit of a high bar to set here at the very least the production on this record is on par with a great deal of the R&B and funk and synth pop coming out around this time the original demo of your mile of sounds nearly as good as the Kenny Rogers version just with less reverb Lachine it's just not as dolled up but still every essential musical element in the song is clear as a bell so not only are the writing and the performances on this thing so good but it's interesting as a prince fan to hear him produce tracks and sing in a style that may be around the peak of his relevance he wouldn't have engaged in some of this stuff on his own records because it could have been seen as just being out of character these songs jungle love and 100 miles per hour are fun unapologetic funk party anthems but lyrically and aesthetically they're not really close enough to the vibe that Prince was typically putting out there in his music around that time also the track Holly which was originally released by Sheila E this song is a pretty early adopter of this funk rap blend it's kind of amazing to hear Prince spitting bars over this funk instrumental with a flow that would typically be found on like a Kurtis Blow record I'm here and I'm trying to say everybody should have fun one two three four one two three four one I don't I'm just I'm just riffing we also have a really jerky electro track with incredibly deadpan singing on a song make up this track is not exactly the delivery that Prince was known for ultimately it feels more like an artsy synth Punk meditation than it does a prince song the opening track sex shooter is part of the course for the so raunchy it's almost novelty type songs that Prince would write for some of the girl groups he was working with at the time for example vanity sixes nasty girl I'm kind of sad that's not on here I would absolutely kill I would kill to hear Prince singing those lyrics I have to keep praising sex shooter though because this song is is a beautiful catchy inadvertently hypnagogic banger it's a dusty long forgotten synth funk Jam it's like something Arial pink would do but with with much more humour and sillier vocals I'm not entirely sure what to make of princes intentions and his performance on the track you're my love because when the song originally came out on that Kenny Rogers record he was credited for it with a pseudonym what I can say is that Prince is singing on this track sounds as if he is trying to sing in Kenny Rogers typical voice in his register it certainly allows you to view Prince's songwriting ability his artistry from a different angle through a different lens my biggest critique of this thing is that a handful of tracks toward the very end of this archival release are noticeably rougher in sound when comparing them to the tracks were presented with in the very first half in the very first leg it's not like the album slowly disintegrates in quality or anything it's that you know toward the finish it just gets a little shaky though the landing is definitely stuck by placing the biggest of all of these songs nothing compares to you at the very finish still though I think this project is great it was a great lesson it was a fun lesson I'm very happy it came out as somebody who has loved multiple prints albums thinks he is one of the greatest songwriters and instrumentalists and producers this was a pretty significant release for me it's definitely going to be one of my favorites of the year I am feeling a light too decent 8 on this one transition have you given this release a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i er view next hit the like if you liked please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here

uOUtox0fxXw,this new AJR record it's not good AJR is a pop trio hailing from new york who i have talked about before on this channel though this is the first time i have reviewed a full-length album of theirs you may remember back in 2017 the trios last full-length record made it on to my worst albums of the Year lists as I felt like the clique was just a very cheap unlikable expression of millennial pop music so of course going into this new release my expectations weren't really much higher though I guess I can say after paying more attention to the finer details that AJR presents I have a better appreciation as to why it's not all that great you know on the surface there are a lot of elements about neo theater that are not that bad or you know just could be perceived as this is relatively inoffensive I mean this just sort of sounds like the kind of thing that kids are listening to it's not blatantly offensive or edgy or in terribly bad taste but God is a derivative uninspired and and coming from just just a very odd sentiment for one aesthetically stylistically instrumentally there's not really an idea on this record that doesn't seem like a blatant ripoff of either twenty one pilots or producer rapper songwriter extraordinaire John bel Yin who's very obvious influences coming from the worlds of pop and hip-hop as well as like Disney soundtracks also pour through into a jr's songs as well on this record for some reason I mean if these guys were Owl City like twenty one pilots would be Postal Service essentially and I feel like the matically AJR shoots for a lot of the same emotions on the lyrical side of things it's like the band is obsessed and I kind of remember this from some key tracks off their last record with presenting listeners with this state of Arrested Development it's like mentally and emotionally I know I'm an adult but I'm still like living out my youth right now I'm stuck I feel like this bears out in a lot of tacky and really annoying ways on tracks like birthday party and 100 bad days as well as don't throw out my Legos which is easily one of the most ridiculously titled songs I have heard in a long time and not to say the title is pointless it does relate to the theme of the song a thematic device or concept that comes up again and again and again on this record and that's basically taking adult grown-up difficult or complex emotional situations and trying to present or interpret them through I guess these childlike experiences it's like taking bad things that are happening to you and then trying to write about them from the perspective of a toddler I'm not sure at all like what what the point of that is or what makes doing that so interesting or exciting not to say children don't have valid perspectives and emotions on things but an adult trying to write from the perspective of either a child or right in a way where it would just be easy for a child to understand and again not sure what the source of this is it could be as a result of this state of Arrested Development or it could be them writing with in mind we need this to appeal to younger listeners that maybe wouldn't be able to take the full brunt of these difficult situations so we need to water it down in a way where they can relate to it more easily either way the end result just sounds like a less edgy 21 pilots as if you could be less edgy than twenty one pilots what's worse than the perspective that AJR writes from are the terrible hooks that they work into their songs they're so tacky they're so overblown they're so stereotypically millennial with big horns and bright group vocals and hip hop beats and faux dramatic instrumentation this album is essentially what millennial pop sounds like to people who think that all millennial pop sounds bad this bears out in the head crushingly annoying choruses of tracks like the entertainments here which sounds like a song Eminem would have made if nothing bad had ever happened to him ever there's also the totally unnecessary and sudden incorporation of in heaven from the Eraserhead soundtrack the melody the lyrics to that song if you've seen the film you you know it it's a pretty stunning moment in the film suddenly in the second leg of the cut birthday party on here AG are just kind of breaks into it and I'm disgusted I don't get how the works of David Lynch could possibly speak to your soul and then you would make an album like this unless you're to watch a movie like Eraserhead and just think wow this is a pretty cool crazy movie there's also the track deer winter which is so quaint I want to puke in my mouth every time I hear it or think of it it's an acoustic ballad about one's future kid but you haven't met your kid's mom yet and it's difficult to meet this other person though the once you do have that kid hey here's a bunch of things that I'm trying to tell you beforehand like it's it's a letter to you and God the amount of quirk that is that is being forced into this track it's it it hurts it burns the most unlikable thing about the song though is that you have chosen the name of your kid before you've even met your significant other like naming your kid isn't going to be a collaborative process with that person that person may have their own opinions as to what to name the child and assuming that both of you are just going to arrive at that name because you had just already chosen it or imagined it beforehand is is yeah it's it's it's maybe the reason you're having a hard time finding someone it's a kind of crappy attitude frankly but as annoying is that and many other moments on this album are what takes the cake for me really truly and honestly is the track beats which is I don't know some kind of commentary on the popularity of the band and whether or not they're relevant enough to get a sponsorship from beats by dre that's literally what the song is about and beats by dre is mentioned numerous times in the track it's all over the chorus it's like basically doing an advertisement you're not even being paid for I imagine the audience for this album is going to be pretty young and at this very early point you're going to essentially present them with this image of no artistic integrity no personal integrity me and everything I make is just a bill for you to throw your products on top of we're living in late stage capitalism anyway fuck it yeah I don't know I mean there are a few hip-hop influenced instrumentals on this record that I think are cool I like the barbershop quartet vocals that are presented toward the very start and the very end of the record but outside of that I I just found this project to be a trash heap neo theater it's it's not good 
YAGG3EPzYd8,I just got hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for me to go over what I felt were the best and then maybe not so best tracks of the week in

appearance that she did on that couch chest a song about Trant trying at trying to get a get a girlfriend in the club so she did some vocals on that track and she now has a new a new track out that is that's not too bad I also want to give a shout out to another friend of the show mr. hot dad who has a new Jesus project out it's songs all about Jesus hot dad has done a whole Jesus album over here guys a whole jesus record recommended highly to fans of rock pop electron Allmusic as well as fans of Jesus and maybe people who aren't so much fans of Jesus I think the the non Jesus fans will get into it too I also want to give a shout out to bring me the horizon whose new record I I didn't love but it surprised me I surprised me how many good tracks that were on it and they have a couple of new Spotify singles out where the one of them was a cover of the track a drone bomb me from Innokin II never thought I would hear this kind of crossover before and their rendition of the track is actually kind of beautiful it's actually stunning so uh yeah I don't think I have anything else to say those are the those are the shout outs alright worst tracks the worst tracks of the week the tracks that I thought were the worst my least favorite tracks of the week we have a few we have a few one being the new prophets of rage track yes Public Enemy Rage Against the Machine and more coming together continuing this project and it just is still one of the worst iterations of rap rock woke conscious rap rock that I've ever heard in my life I just do not get it it just sounds so awkward it's it's not even that the message is bad though there's there's very little in the way of tact to the lyrics but the the instrumentals and the grooves and the performances just feel so off I just wish that these guys would I don't know tighten up a little bit more or just focus on other musical projects I do not get what the the appeal of profits of rages at this point moving on from there corn yes another sort of blast from the past here corn has a new single out and the title of this new one is you'll never find me and a new record on the way obviously and this song over here I think some fans are receiving the song pretty well and in some respects it does feel like corn going back to basics I suppose this track doesn't feature any of the weird unnecessary contemporary bells and whistles that the band has been forcing into their repertoire repertoire over the past few records this one to me feels very again back to basics and and back to basics meaning like I don't know kind of like freak on a leash issues era corn however in this new single the drumming isn't nearly as good as it's been in the past with corn Jonathan Davis's vocal performance here is pretty standard it's not really anything stand out you put his vocal performance here against any track on issues and issues isn't even corns best record and pretty much every song on that album will outdo this vocal performance and furthermore the the bass isn't really even as prominent or as groovy as it's been on on corns best work so I don't know I mostly Jonathan Davis's their vocally of course the those heavy you know burn or you know kind of jeroni new metal chords are there but not much else you know I feel like a corn is a shell of their former selves in a way on this track and it's kind of disappointing and a ceremony ceremony is back if you guys remember the once exciting hardcore punk band the the last time I covered their music they had made a very sudden transition into just kind of making straight throwback post-punk music and that was not very well received by a lot of fans and it would seem that the band is continuing in that vein with this new record of theirs and the new single off of it turn away the bad thing and I'm not really sure what to to say it's just kind of like another helping of just very run-of-the-mill very basic very unimaginative old-school post-punk in the in the vein of Joy Division and other groups that came out around that era and ceremony they just brought so much more to to punk music than they do this kind of very stale sub-genre of it so I don't know they're just continuing down this road I yes because I guess they're really just you know had a change of heart and they really passionate about this sound all right let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of met didn't blow me away but we're certainly worth mentioning certainly worth bringing up first off the sludge metal band the yeah I'd suppose you could say sludge metal band alternative rock band torch they have a new record on the way admission and the title of this new track over here from them and it's it's it's not a bad it's it's not a bad cut yeah admission is the title of this one it's um yes I suppose it's got like a kind of hooky alternative rock kind of vibe to it the production doesn't bike quite as hard as some of the band's heaviest and hardest hitting material from back in the day and look this band has never been one of the the like the gnarliest in sludge metal or anything like that in fact when they were a little bit more popular part of their appeal was that hey they were like a little bit sweeter a little bit catchy ER than some of the other groups in their genre and now it seems like they're not really doing either too well you know it's not so heavy that it's menacing or exciting or visceral and it's not quite as catchy as projects like harmonic raft either but still if you've never heard of the band before I very much encourage you guys to check out projects like harmonic raft in return Neanderthal and and maybe this new record won't be so bad either so torch admission give the track a try you might dig it alright next we also have the legendary psych garage punk outfit Leo sees back with a new record on the way back with a new song from it the title of this one over here is hemlock and what's funny and what's interesting about this track is that it is a 20 minute long psych Rock jam with numerous passages to it it gets kind of noisy and intense toward the end but yeah it's still a 20 minute long song it's massive I can't say my attention is held throughout the entire thing in fact there are quite a few passages that for modern psychic and there is very much like a bit of a revival of this sound going on right now as far as a modern psycho out goes it's it's not exactly novel or exciting in fact I would say there are quite a few tracks that the OCS have put out recently that will outdo what the the band is offered here but still I guess it's kind of ambitious to kick off your your new album cycle with a 20 minute long song and for the super passionate fans out there of psychedelic rock who are maybe not so crazy about how picky I am with the genre sometimes maybe maybe you'll get a lot more of out of it than than I did moving on from there we have another track from Lucy Dacus singer-songwriter and she's written a track here for the fourth of July season I guess where it's it's a kind of critical of America its policies the the sort of I suppose rationalizations and the mental gymnastics that come with living in America being an American and heavily heavily heavily disagreeing with the policies that your country in acts that harm people overseas and also here at home instrumentally it's it's pretty generic it's it's very straightforward Americana styled in default but I do appreciate the lyrics quite a bit and I do think that that's a it's it's a admirable thing to to write a track about and just speaking again from a lyrical standpoint I thought a lot of what she said on this track was was thoughtful moving out from there we have Kemba who has a brand new track out formerly known as YC the cynic the students latest track over here if you're a very much into East Coast hip-hop abstract hip hop hip hop with a lyrical edge nobody I can trust is the name of this new cut over here and there are a lot of things I like about this track I think the instrumental is pretty cool I think the chorus is sick but the verses in my opinion are very awkwardly delivered and for whatever reason when Kemba is rapping on these verses the vocals are kind of mixed and distorted in a very weird way where they don't slide into the instrumental all that well they feel like they're just placed into it in a very odd way and it's like he's kind of rapping outside of a like a McDonald's drive-through speaker or something again I don't quite I don't quite get why the vocals were manipulated and and kind of messed with in the way they were on this track I think it's a detriment to the enjoy ability of the song but still again if you're crazy into East Coast and abstract hip-hop I would recommend that you give this one a shot at least but not from there her R&B artist her who was once anonymous but now is kind of you know revealed herself and everything but still kind of maintains a bit of a shadowy demeanor she has a brain to track out featuring ybn chord a it's not bad it's kind of a standard contemporary R&B track with a solid rap verse on it nothing crazy ambitious from either of these two on this track but it sounds it sounds fine while it's on moving on from there we have Phineas Phineas yes Phineas who you guys have heard me talk about before in the Billie Eilish review because Phineas is Billie eyelashes brother and he is putting out some solo material so he has a song and a music video out that has been making the rounds it has almost like a million views at this point and the name of this one is I lost a friend and it's a pretty emotional ballad it's got some nice moments on it so nice instrumental swells and I think some of the creative instrumental aspects that turn up Don Billy that turned up on Billy's album also sort of carry over onto here a little bit although I think Phineas is songwriting style and instrumental Styles a little bit cleaner a little bit less dark and edgy to me a lot of what he was doing here almost read to me is like I don't know this this is sort of like a ballad Coldplay would put together or something of course with the I think I think I'm more tasteful instrumental and not quite as much um I guess corniness generally but maybe just a little too clean and a little melodramatic for my ears but still sound like a decent ballad and was well put together and well structured so and as long as I'm into a Phineas and Billie working together I'm most likely going to be trying to check out what Phineas is doing in a solo capacity so yeah Ben was it been moving out from there we have a Daniel Caesar who has a new album out now loving to get love again excuse me is the name of his new single every year featuring none other than brandy R&B legend brandy whose vocal input I enjoyed quite a bit on the last Andersen Pack albums so it was pretty awesome to hear her pop up once again or see your pop up once again and another feature credit for another contemporary artist however Daniel Caesar's new track over here I didn't think was too fantastic on his latest record from what I've been hearing so far it's it's like he's kind of taking the vibe and the style of R&B and sort of pushing it into a slightly more abstract and almost like bedroom pop ish realm and as a result of that I think there are some aspects to it that are a little sloppy to the point where it hurts the likeability of the track I would say that specifically Brandy's vocals on this song could have used maybe a second or a third take or something that was definitely something off about her her delivery on this track and off about a few other things as well I mean I get that Daniel may be trying to catch maybe lightning in a bottle on this track and maybe play it a little fast and loose as far as like how the instrumentation comes together or some of the performances don't need to be like you know super perfect or just like one of percent on but again I think this this sloppiness is is not necessarily um all that good for his record it does work in some contexts and there are some loaf I alternate Avari albums or I've heard it work too but for whatever reason it's not really clicking on his new LP for me so far I'm moving out from there claro has a new single out if you guys are huge into that bedroom pop vibe but you want to hear it with a some slicker auto-tune vocals I guess you should definitely try this a new track out over here closer to you ballad wise is not bad but I think the auto-tune does kind of wear out it's welcome after a little while and whatever vocal effect it is honestly that does wear out its welcome after a little while and the instrumental does feel like kind of flat it's not a very dynamic instrumental doesn't progress to a very interesting or an exciting place and as a result of that this one just felt very one-dimensional moving on from there moving on from there we have Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes Fame she is coming out with a new solo record and this new song over here of hers history repeats it's kind of interesting I guess being in line with its title the song is kind of repetitive to the point where it does grow a little stale toward the back end but the vibe and the groove of this track was intriguing in that it was almost like she was trying to pull from the world of New Orleans funk on this one it's like she was trying to pull off something like from the meters catalog just very angular stringy licks and playful grooves all over this track the issue though being that as it continues on it's sort of like stays in this groove rut for a while and again it does get kind of tired before the song ends up finishing but still I did like the vibe that she was shooting for on this track I think it just could have used a more interesting structure I'm moving on from there blank mass has come out with a brand new track no dice it's a very III guess glitzy and glossy electronica cut a little glitzy ER and glossy er than we're used to hearing from this project you know whose tracks are usually a little more abstract noisy strange moving off from there Big KRIT has come out with a couple of tracks from his new full-length album so far and much of them up until this point including this latest one I just thought have been okay addiction is the name of this new one featuring little Wayne and so Edie and yeah it just seems like very slick straightforward standard pop rap pop trap which is a little disheartening because crit to me is a pretty unique artist even if he does tend to wear his outcast you know it is a UGK influences on his sleeve he does stand out in the southern hip-hop field certainly but not on this track not on this cut sadly to me he's sort of like I don't know put together a very competent pop rap track here but it's it's not really much else the little Wayne vs. not really his best and so we need doesn't do much more than just kind of hop on the chorus just add a bit of a vocal variety to the track so yeah it was okay moving on from there wigs we have a track from ASAP ferg over here featuring antha as well as city girls and it's just kind of your standard club banger with you know obviously the the wigs reference kind of being in league with a contemporary lingo and and so on and so forth it's it's catchy but it's it's I think the shelf life on this one is gonna be kind of short it's it's very bubblegum you know after a while it's gonna lose its flavor and be quickly replaced by a track that is just as hooky and you know even more relevant and even more reason in terms of culturally what it's referencing and it's you know again and it's in its lingo so moving on from there let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the ones that really kind of left a bit of an impression on me and I thought stood out thought were special one the new serpent with feet track you guys might remember the project of serpent with feet that I reviewed I think earlier this year or was it last year I can't quite remember off the top of my head but still last time I covered serpent with feet I came away from of the abstract R and B and artpop approach this project was taking came away from pretty impressed and this new track over here is kind of surprising in that a feature is none other than ty dolla sign who look I mean given Ty's last couple of Records I mean every once in a while he does hit listeners with kind of a weird artsy idea and and that does make me scratch my head you know and that does make me think man this guy is like really punching underneath his artistic weight like he could be writing or could be like making songs making music that's a bit more personal but more introspective or maybe even like a little left-field and the fact that he's hopping on a track like this to me like totally confirms that because not only is he appearing on this song but his vocal performance on the track is really good and it's a I don't know just really encouraging to hear this sort of crossover and here it come together so well the instrumental on this one is pretty skeletal but the vocal performances are intriguing and beautiful and definitely speak for themselves the title of this track is receipts give it a try do not let it slip by you moving on from there rich brian of 88 rising fame has a brand new single out titled yellow and this one has been turning quite a few heads this week because sees a total stylistic switch up on the part of Brian in that he is pretty much just like singing all over this track he's singing all over the track and it's a pretty heartfelt pretty powerful grandiose instrumental attached to this one as well I'm not saying Brian is the greatest vocalist on the block or anything but his singing on this track is expressive he does hold his own vocally his singing here certainly more impressive impressive than I would have thought it was going to be given his very monotone rap delivery on a lot of tracks and yeah I'm just again walking away from this thing impressed and looking forward to hearing where he's gonna be going forward you know I mean look a part of me would be sad to hear and totally give up rapping but I don't think that's gonna be the case but still even if that was the case I wouldn't mind this kind of artistic evolution because he seems to be doing it pretty well so far doing it pretty well so far moving on from there purple mountains David Berman's purple mountains David Berman of silver juice Fame who I have shouted out in the segment a few times as we sort of near closer to the release of this debut project from his new band his new group purple mountains another track over here margaritas at the mall lyrically witty funny interesting instrumental is Django Lee a little loaf I a little funky it's a a weird ballad just like David Berman is is usually known for so if you're really into that style which I typically tend to be because I've been enjoying silver Jews music for quite a while and was sad to sort of see the the band dissipate at the time they did it's great to hear Berman back and continuing to do what he do continuing to do he does pretty well so on god brand new single from DJ mustard or just mustard at this point he has a new album out not sure if I'm going to cover it in depth or anything like that but what I can say is that this new single featuring yg Tyga ASAP Ferg and ASAP Rocky is a banger don't know if it's really gonna last for much longer than the summer but the energy from everybody on this track including Tyga is is not that bad it's good hook is solid beat goes pretty hard standard mustard instrumental though and everybody's performances definitely keeps the energy high especially Ferg who is sounding a I don't know in in in in in in his usual form you know it's it's been a while since I've been this into a Ferg feature so yeah diggin it lingua igniter lingua igniter do you doubt me traitor do you doubt me traitor maybe the new track over here new record on the way this thing I is not for the faint of heart it is not for the faint of heart this deep dark disturbing canno piece with shouted vocals with rushes of noisy instrumentation it starts at a simmer and reaches a very intense boil I wouldn't even call it a boil it's more like you know just like an explosion of hot water that's just like giving everybody third-degree burns that it touches it's a it's insane and it's certainly got me looking forward to the the mix of influences that are going to be coalescing on this new igniter record so yeah you know my eyes are like this one listening to this that's that's essentially what's going on I'm whore it's harrowing I'm horrified what that's that's that's essentially the the experience here it's freaky in the best possible way not sure if I could say anything else about it other than that you know not going to go too deep into descriptors as I do want to review this record so moving on from there Liam Gallagher yes Liam Gallagher one half of the Gallagher brothers formerly of Oasis has a new track out I've actually been enjoying a lot of Liam's recent work you know when he was starting to dip his toe into more solo waters it was kind of rough it was kind of rough I I would say he's an certainly a better place artistically right now the Knoll is and this new track over here which is which is titled the river is rocker it's a rager you know it's got a great groove to it it's a little old-school it's a little vintage yes but I like how um I'm not a slightly sunburned the production is and I like kind of the slight aggressive edge to it as well rare that you hear a song from Liam these days that comes off a little badass and and that's certainly how this new track felt over here moving on from there king gizzard new record on the way it seems like it's shaping up to be the king gizzard thrash metal album and they just continue as I hear new tracks from it they just continue to kill it in this style because this is just such a weird take on the genre that is so supremely good just continuing to dig on on this new track over here and on everything the the group has been teasing toward this thrash influenced album with organ farmer is the title of this cut over here it rages it's awesome great guitars zany vocals great grooves and cannot wait to hear the band especially kill it in this style that very few groups in sort of their psyche garage I guess you could even say indie sort of scene or cut from their cloth would even dare to do dare to touch dare to even reference or cross over to and yet they're doing it in a way that is very distinctly them so loving it and that has been the weekly track roundup guys that has been the weekly track round up once more remember that we do have those those live dates coming up in August linked you tickets down below shout out once more to the ridge hopefully you guys got some good recommendations out of this video all the songs I talked about are linked down below and yeah we'll see you in the next one Anthony Fantana weekly track roundup forever 
vqmCLg0zoyo,ah hi everyone hands than a hand tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new black mini album Schlag Arnheim this is the debut full-length album of Rough Trade Sinese uk-based rock outfit black MIDI named after a dense computer crashing form of electronic music composition that is usually packed with thousands if not millions of notes the band black MIDI does doesn't really sound like like what they've named themselves after at least aesthetically anyway I guess in a conceptual sense they are both similarly freakish and disorienting but I think that's where the parallels start and end I first heard black MIDI earlier this year around in February when I stumbled across somehow there Speedway single on YouTube which is a much rougher version than the song the band presents here on this new album even though the performance and the recording on this early version of the song wasn't picture-perfect you could say that most of the elements that make black MIDI what they are now were pretty much in place as the band was still delivering eerie mathematical noise rock with an emphasis on strange grooves and even stranger vocal performances I do want to say though even though black MIDI is pretty weird I mean they've they've gotten odd sound a lot of what they're doing in my view isn't entirely unprecedented personally I hear quite a bit of crossover between them and contemporaries that tend to favor funkier more outlandish music favored experimental rock noise rock math rock post-punk early music from alt-j ought parking courts preoccupations and women there are some moments where the guitar tones remind me of something off of a television record so to me even though black MIDI has quite a few familiar qualities they have definitely hit upon a uniquely unsettling dark and a bizarre sound take the blistering multi-phased intro to this thing I'm 53 which features these odd quickly cycling grooves that are broken up with shots of noise and guitar feedback and it says a lot that the band can suddenly transition from this into a pretty beautiful acoustic guitar passage with very theatrical lead vocals onward we get more instrumental build ups instrumental freak outs featuring melting guitars and falling pianos the whole thing devolves into a punked-out riff fest toward the very end and just becomes absolutely demented miraculously in this one track in this one moment in the intro the band successfully balances all of these sounds and emotions and intensity and volume levels in a way that just is is very cohesive then we have the song Speedway the groove on this one inhabits a place where it is very visceral I really feel it I really want to move to it but there's something that feels just inhuman about it and subtly sinister as well in a way the tracks odd lyrical focus on building codes and urban structures kind of reminds me of something out of a Talking Heads song it's like maybe the band is trying to make some kind of statement about the sterility of urban living or conformity or the rat race and hustle and bustle of city life or maybe it's a rigid sonic depiction of rigid architectural structures either way it's intriguing and I absolutely love the instrumental swell toward the end of the track by comparison the next track reggae is a lot more wild out of control lively as well there is absolutely nothing reserved about this song not only the contorting guitar licks but also the xylophone on this track what sounds like xylophone is just so over the top these singing on this one feels less like singing and more like a very tense and dramatic rant it's like once again I'm listening to the band but with a much more manic lead singer and zanier instrumental backdrop or maybe it's like a math rock band attempting to soundtrack a horror film we then have the even noisier near Detroit Michigan the incredibly hard-hitting jagged riffs that kick that track off give way pretty quickly to these somber musical passages it's very murky it's very atmospheric and the reason the instrumentation is scaled back on this part is because I think the band really wants listener to focus on the lyrics as they present a very on-the-nose description of the various water crises going on in the great lake state right now there is a totally insane finish on this track where you're essentially met with these scream vocals of there's Latin in the water there's light in the water undeniably a powerful and maybe the most nightmarish moment on the entire record I think the song Western at least in the first leg is this album's first genuine attempt at trying to do a ballad the guitar and melody kicking the track off feels like something out of an Americana tune but given that it is black MIDI of course it's not going to stay in this tune full and mellow place sonically I would say it progresses into a pretty surreal place with a lot of lyrics and I think trying to give the listener an abstract depiction of a protagonist essentially cutting off a toxic relationship or connection to someone by I don't know leaving them in a ditch lyrically the whole thing gets more and more unhinged as it progresses with the verses feeling like they're right out of a fever dream a pink caterpillar with six anorexic children let me stay but I had to keep moving through ant eater town after ant eater town after ant eater town after ant eater town after ant eater town it's definitely twisted the mutant rhythms and noise and distortion on the track of Schlag and I'm feels like something out of the 80s no wave scene but of course that only accounts for some portions of this track all the other passages surrounding these moments just move through this indescribable winding progression I'm looking at a list of things I picked up on this track and I know it's all real I know it happened but it's it's still odd to think that there were passages on this thing that felt like they were out of a jazz fusion or a prog track and then there was this groove toward the end of the song that felt like it was out of an 80s boogie banger if you threw a sweet synth lick on this poor it might feel like a synth funk song of course with the weird twisted backdrop to it but still the song BM BM BM is maybe the most grotesque moment on the entire record it features all these weird horror movie screams going on in the background with just manic ranting on top Shem of zetha Pappas what's a magnificent pop house underpass it's easily one of the least tuneful and most repetitive moments on the entire record as well as one of the simplest structurally and yet it's like one of the most impactful moments on the entire album the central idea to this song is is so freaky and just how far they push it is certainly a inspiring the band goes full spazzy noise rock on the track years ago which is another refreshing moment on the album I guess and the finishing track ducktor is a somewhat satisfying closer though I don't think the band really does anything on this track that they hadn't already presented in some way shape or form earlier on the album I wouldn't say it's the most grand moment of finality that I've heard on a rock record this year I will say to throw a few nitpicks in there occasionally the production to my ears does feel a little claustrophobic like the riffs and the bass and the drums everything could just use a bit more space some of the musical detours that the band embarks on in these winding detour heavy tracks sometimes feel like non sequiturs or they derail the momentum of a particular song but I guess the the band always loops back into something interesting so even if they do transition into a somewhat underwhelming moment it doesn't last long the vocals occasionally I think could use a bit more direction sure I do like the lack of inhibitions on the vocal front of this record it does lead to this album having a lot of character feeling a little freaky and a little out there but they're disheveled nature and lack of direction occasionally can be a little frustrating and standoffish not to mention they can feel obnoxious during moments where they're a bit over acted over although I think this album is a great list I love it I'm incredibly impressed with the band's creativity and cohesion and and just how bold their sounds and ideas are right out of the gate so not only is black MIDI sounding incredibly good right now but I don't know I feel like with a band that is coming through with ideas this bold and out there and in songs this compelling the sky could be the limit and that's maybe the most exciting thing about black MIDI at this point I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony

_qziLUViJtU,hi everyone big thony head tan out here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Bill Callahan record Shepherd in a sheepskin vest singer/songwriter Bill Callahan it's been a while it's been a while bill it was six years ago that I reviewed Bill callaghan's last record dream river a beautiful contemplative set of indie folk songs with some very wonderful poetry mixed in and it was about ten years ago that Bill's solo work really started to turn heads and even though I've said this before it is worth mentioning again before all of that bill had forged a reputation as one of the most creative minds in slow core and lo-fi under the name Smaug through the 90s and auth Smaug came out with some pretty incredible records and underwent a pretty stark evolution to take the 1993 Smaug album Julius Caesar for example the noisy production the freaky folk influences the dejected mood on this thing it's like Beck's early work except legit experimental and half of the tracks don't feel like they're just taking the piss compare that to the farm mellower and more coherent sounds Smaug was dabbling in just a decade later and it's like listening to two totally different bands the material Smaug was coming out with in the 2000 saw the project transition into these more Americana influenced sounds which allowed bill to transition into the musical state that he's in the midst of today so even though it's been years since the release of Dream River I still very much see Bill kicking around the same creative stomping grounds with his latest effort to though bill songwriting methodology on this one has undergone some serious renovations mostly gone are the long winding abstract folk meditations of apocalypse and dream River instead with Shepherd bill cuts down the runtime of each track here for the most part - about two minutes and change and this isn't really a brief amount of time for most rappers and pop stars and rock bands for a single or even a deep cut but Bill's songs don't exactly hurry to their destination it's sort of like shooting the breeze for very short amounts of time over this long strung tracklist of musical vignettes and even though the overall feel of the record is relaxed it is laid-back there are some strange and funny instrumental embellishments that I wouldn't have expected on a Bill Callahan record given just how serene and pristine and spacious and open his last couple of projects were so the instrumentation this time around it does have a slightly raw or presentation in a way it's like a soft return to the low five days of smaug emphasis on soft return in comparison with Apocalypse the production the instrumentation here is it nearly as pristine and and purposefully so the lyrics this time around do see a change of pace to Bill's writing is a lot more frank humorous off-the-cuff occasionally he goes incredibly meta like on the songwriting where he is literally writing about writing and how good it feels to be writing again as it would seem he did take a somewhat lengthy break from that on the track Ballad of the Hulk we had bill basically narrating the intro of his own song well after this next song we'll be moving along out of this vein it's called Ballad of the Hulk quite a few tracks on this thing not only see Bill going autobiographical but doing so with very literal terms going on about his domestic life his wife his house renovations his new son the lyrical tone on the song son of the sea is very slice of life very apparent I got married to my wife she's lovely and I had a son other personal moments on this project are complemented with more flowery language like on the track 747 where we hear Bill's very sleepy baritone delivering poetry about flying in a plane or the track watch me get married where bill getting married and having kids manifests itself into a weird fantasy where all of these children are coming out of his chest like subsequent generations of a family tree or something it's it's it's still an odd picture the flow of this album honestly is is not too much unlike the front cover that is pictured here bill laying back stone tastes like he's in the middle of some kind of vision meanwhile a miniature Shepherd with a sheep in his shirt huh is that is that a sheep in his shirt is that a sheep in his shirt he's marching these little pink sheep into his head maybe each sheep is a theme or a song idea or or a track on this thing and the Sheep just like these songs they're hanging there they're chilling they're getting let around they're grazing they're in no hurry to go absolutely anywhere like on the song tugboats and tumbleweeds where bill literally imparts some advice on to the listener saying hey you know chill out relax don't rush through your your youth I guess take a tumbleweed year to where you don't have a care in the world which is a nice thought it's a nice idea I guess though I will say that that Bill's advice sometimes is a luxury that not everyone can afford generally the attitude of this thing is very mellow it's very sweet it's very intoxicating though not always beneficial to the album it does lead to a feeling a little one-dimensional at points while none of the more understated and underwhelming tracks in the track listing here are all that bad while they're on as the album draws on and we get toward the end the fact there kind of padding this album out to be longer than it needs to be becomes very apparent I will say it's not like bill pushes it too far on this record though he's not giving listeners a big ask on this one given that it's it's really just an hour of music and not a lot of the tracks on this thing lasts so long that they overstay their welcome on top of that it's not like this diary like song writing style is unprecedented at this point that's that's basically been mark causal ex-mo for the past several years I just wish more songs on this record offered bolder statements and more defined colorful and memorable instrumentation the ratio of great to forgettable songs on this thing could certainly be better I should still mention some of the gorgeous moving highlights on this album though you have the gospel inspired lonesome Valley which is just wonderful I also love the cute thumb pianos on the track call me anything and bills poetry about riding a bike on this cut just feels like a blissful dream within a larger blissful dream the lo-fi Airy tape according on the first track of this thing is a really great way to kick the entire album off and the track what comes after certainty this C's bill wisely waxing poetic on true love true love is less a magical feeling and more a feeling of constants and certainty in your life as you have forged a long-term bond with your significant other and you can depend on that person to be there and be this recurring supportive force in in in your existence though there is a weird detour on this track where bill talks about signing willie nelson's guitar when he wasn't looking pretty messed up if you ask me bill I'm not exactly sure what what plane of existence this was happening on in his song but it's it's still a very odd moment on the record the track the beast is as good a finale as I think you're going to get on an album like this the instrumentation reaches a somewhat intense drone there's also a very sinister intro on this track depicting a smoky battlefield the lyrics deeper into the track or a weird mix of dark but also lovesick more lyrics turn up recurring themes that popped up earlier on the record like the sea and sailors after this whole thing is over it feels like I've just experienced this very large multi-phased only partially decipherable dream I'm not entirely sure if Bill's very low-key songwriting and singing style on this thing is is complimented by the the brief song lengths and and basic song structures it doesn't always click but a majority of the songs on this thing are enjoyable are quality are sweet to the ear definitely one of the more creative solid and I suppose entrancing singer-songwriter records I've heard in 2019 I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you liked please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to

W6WvTtRBmfA,hi everyone so thin igloo tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a look back on 2019 so far in my view it's been a pretty decent music year 2019 that is I have loved quite a few albums this year and in this video I am going to essentially go over the 15 records that in my view are the best albums of 2019 so far so without any further ado listed in no particular order here they are one the new Odebolt a beaver record that I reviewed not too long ago this is a very great Japanese noise rock and punk outfit whose new record is it's a it's a compilation of sorts it's a mix of new stuff and then somewhat older stuff but it still all comes together into a very cherry absurd exciting off-the-wall mix of chance cheering riffs distortion insane screaming and playing it's it's like a fun Japanese Punk cheerleading mosh pit it's full of fun it's full of character it is a rock album that will have you dislike violently flailing in all directions with a smile going from ear to ear on your face do not miss it it's great next I want to give a shout out to the slow Thai record nothing great about Britain slow tie is easily one of the most exciting voices coming out of UK hip hop right now these songs on his new record over here have creative instrumentals backing them he has a Yelp e unique somewhat dizzee rascal inspired flow and rap delivery and a lot of the very touching and harrowing tracks on this record deal in economic pain and suffering in mental health issues it is a very grim portrait and outlook for the youth and Britain right now and in this album just does such a great job of painting that picture relaying that message communicating those feelings and I definitely look forward to seeing where slow Thai continues from here because this this is still a very early point in his career and and right now he's kind of killing it so uh where he's going to grow from here could potentially be amazing next got to give a shout-out to Tyler Lee creators Igor not sure if I could say any more nice things about this record that I already have it's a great break up concept album incredible songs incredible flow incredible production interesting and well placed features I love the meld of hip hop and soul and R&B on this one the awesome jazz passages that he works throughout this thing to this record is full of so much character and it not only shows how much talent tyler has gained up until this point but how he's able to apply it in such a unique and a theatrical way so I really love this record it's fantastic next the noose laosan Malone record a quiet far well he is a hip hop producer that mixes elements of ambient and noise and sound collage and soul and jazz into his works it feels almost like the next logical step past the brain feeder records can't pass the Madlib camp it's it's a bright abstract exciting future that Malone presents to us on this album and I'm looking forward to hearing him expand it on subsequent records for sure next the new Beyonce homecoming live album not sure if there's much to say about this record at this point it is live album the tracklist of which spans through Beyonce's entire discography going back to the old days of Destiny's Child up to her most recent output with lemonade and basically all these tracks are melded and segwayed together with this incredible horn section and drum line and exciting performance really the only big nitpick that I have with this record is that it could have been recorded and I think mixed a little bit better it does come off a little flat sonically speaking of course but still the vocals the drums the performances the songs they all still shine through that very brightly and just create a very lengthy and exciting musical experience I also of course want to shout out the new lizzo record because I love you Liz o proves her self to be on this album one of the most enigmatic performers new performers working today mixing together elements of pop and soul and hip-hop and R&B in a series of songs that are bold are fun are unapologetic are tongue-in-cheek are silly our somber our celebratory there is no doubting Liz's talent oh my god it's so good choo choo all aboard the Liz o train let's go we next I want to give a shout to the best baroque pop the best chamber pop record I've heard in a while and that is the new wise blood album Titanic rising what a gorgeous beautiful lovely album the tunes are fantastic so solid from back to front on this tracklist and the instrumentation is lovely god it's lovely vocals are slightly nondescript not the most distinct vocal I've heard in this style of music okay I will say that but still songs are amazing the the just everything is so good and even though I don't find the vocals to be the most distinct I've ever heard still the singing is good especially the harmonies the vocal harmonies are quality also shout out to Jonathan Rado for having having a hand in the production on this one because it the instrumentation is excellent God it is a buttery smooth wonderful just the taste tasty record next the new comet is coming album trust in the life force of the deep mystery this is easily one of the most exciting jazz records to come out of the UK at least jazz fusion records to come out of the UK and quite a while Chewbacca Hutchings of sons of Kemet Fame is also involved with this record so if you enjoyed that one you'll most likely get into this even though stylistically it is in a very different wheelhouse as the comet is coming fuses jazz with elements of psychedelic music and even like a bit of metal and some spoken word and electronic music - it's it's crazy it's it's really a crazy record and I do recommend it it's it's very mind-bending it's very fun it's got a few fusions and experiments that maybe don't quite pan out 100% but for the most part it is a mind-blowing and an expansive record that really does try to kind of ride the fringes and stay ahead of the curve stay on the creative edge push the envelope yes baby next in my list is a pop album that honestly I have gotten a little bit of flack for enjoying as much as I do but I still don't understand to this day why there are so many that dislike it but of course I am talking about the new Billy Eilish album this is one of the most unique pop records of the decade like geez the way it brings in elements of electronic music and hip hop music and and weird strange studio trickery and sound effects where the bass is distorted you get these weird ASMR vocals it's so whispery it's so quiet it's so understated and yet it is so bold it's so uncompromising it's so catchy and so enjoyably weird I would say going into this do not believe the hype but simultaneously do not allow the hype to sour you against an album that is legitimately creative also creative is the new matte most record which if you're into sample-based and experimental electronic music you will most likely not want to miss this one is titled plastic anniversary like with many map most records up until this point this one features a concept and that is that all of these samples going into the record are based off of plastic they're sampling plastic plastic in a variety of forms and then basically tuning and twitching and manipulating those samples to create these really excellent vibrant bustling and intricate electronic compositions regardless of the concept or what the source material is this is easily one of Matt Moses most fun and off-the-wall crops of songs yet don't miss it it's a great time mat most forever haha next want to give a shout out to the little Simms record gray area I think this standing at this point is my favorite hip hop record of the year it is bold it is ride is in your face little Sims totally kills it all over this record not only lyrically but also topically and emotionally a great crop of hard-hitting instrumentals in the background on this one too it's a record that's also very to-the-point not shy about anything and is certainly worthy of all the high praise it's received so far I have a few more that I want to shout out one the new blue and Ono record a long red-hot Los Angeles summer night a story / concept album of sorts where the story is in the most original that I've ever heard but still I do love the narrative progression that blue and Ono stir up on this project blue lyrically is in rare form Ono's instrumentals are not only hard-hitting and soulful and gorgeous but they are cinematic it away and provide a great dramatic foundation for blue to spit his lyrics on top of and just tell his story one great track after the next do not miss out on it I also want to give a shout out to the new Shu Shu record girl with basket of fruit a very experimental intense harrowing album that I don't even know what genre to call this it's not entirely an art pop endeavor like a lot of Shu shus past efforts are it's not entirely a post-punk endeavor like a lot of Shu shus past efforts are it's not entirely a noise endeavor either it is just a very hard-hitting abrasive shouty strange truly unique album and it's amazing that after all these years Shu Shu are just continuing to kill it an experiment and just embark on new ideas and even just continue I would argue to break break new ground so Shu Shu hell fucking yes girl with basket of fruit yes do not miss this one Ariana Grande Thank You next easily one of the sharpest and slickest and most enjoyable pop records of this year of even this decade to an extent and finally I want to shout out the new quality Chris record guns a socially conscious rap album that sees Chris getting a little more somber and serious on some of the deep cuts here but still he does provide quite a few weird loopy instrumentals and his his nasally rap delivery they come together of cool for more tracks that basically satirized how insane politically our current social paradigm is and I think I'll leave it at that those are essentially the 15 records that in my view are the best that 20-19 has offered so far I will leave links to reviews for all these projects down below so you can check them all out for yourself if any of them have slipped through the cracks for you please do not allow them to do that and I think we are going to leave it

IgRrcpwwzE4,hi everyone chopped in a chopped anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new little Naz xp7 the SID the 7 EP at 7 this is the debut commercial EP from one of the biggest musical sensations of the past year so that is little nas X if you told me 10 years ago that one of the biggest musical sensations of the decade would be from a dude who basically wrote like a novelty country rap song that was legitimately a banger I would ask you how you got my number and tell you to leave me alone I'm calling the police have I have I made that joke before I might have made that joke before but still that is exactly what has happened in the dimension that we're currently living in so attract this viral that has wormed its way into the minds of not only adults but but also little little children fortnight dancing to it it leads to one question will this dude essentially just be a one-hit wonder I think at this point there's most likely too much industry push behind little NAS X for him to go without not even one single more popular track I mean they're going to give him some producers they're going to give him some collaborators that are going to drive people to what he's doing regardless the dude has just dropped a new song with cardi B but still well nas evolved into an artist that has a shelf life beyond this one track I think this new EP begins to answer that question for one you have the old town road and Old Town Road Billy Ray Cyrus remix bookending this project not sure if there's really anything I can say about these two songs that I haven't said already that hundreds of other people haven't said already most likely at this point you've heard the song and you know whether or not you like it it's a very smooth and even combination of trap and country with the lyrics being delivered with a subtly comedic tone and being somewhat inspired by the video game Red Dead Redemption - most importantly though all of this is attached to a ridiculously catchy chorus the track is something that feels new but beyond the surface it is really just a sharp rendition of something we have heard again and again and again and if there's any formula to win the public over it's it's it's that give them what you know they want to hear but present it in a way where that they think they're hearing something different as far as the other tracks on this EP go though they're really a mix you have tracks on this things such as panini which are not country in any way shape or form very modern very contemporary hip-hop some Travis Scott isms some Drake isms with the combination of these blissful pop melodies and somewhat trippy trap production it's a straightforward but somewhat low-key banger about audience members or people in nas's personal life that don't really want to see him succeed and and change because of the success that he's seeing in his you know musical endeavors it's kind of derivative but at the core of it there is a really solid tune the song ticket comes from a similar stylistic place but offers way more atmosphere in space the instrumental also features these very weird sax embellishments that bring a lot of color to the cut even more surprising are these string harmonies that pop in during the very last leg of the song just just did not see that coming and they're kind of elegant the substance of the song overall essentially I don't know just kind of hanging out selling weed yeah I wish that part of it was a bit more memorable or substantive but still I don't mind it so these tracks on the EP basically serve the function of showing that nas ex can write a contemporary hip-hop song just like anybody else other moments on this EP those show nas continuing to fuse elements of hip-hop with different genres not just country the songs family and bring you down both of which see nas trying to yeah basically pull off a rock song the former feels like an inadvertently awkward take on something The Strokes might do with a kind of peppy driving drumbeat and very sharp staccato guitar chords instrumentally I do think it could be a lot tighter though the tune is is very sweet I think the hook is pretty quality too even though the aesthetics and the delivery of little nas's music does does very much make me feel like his style his sound is everything in many respects is in an incubator stayed he is still showing it at this very early point a serious knack for writing some very melodic and very sticky hooks the song bring you down is almost like what Kid Cudi was trying to do on speeding bullet to heaven it's it's really pulling a lot of ideas from the grunge playbook it's got a mid paced tempo a very moody lead vocal of course a wall of guitar distortion on the chorus that tones down a lot to some very crunchy trevally thin guitars on the verses this track does not just smell like teen spirit it reeks of teen spirit and again it's catchy but having nas X hop on top of a grunge instrumental isn't exactly putting a new spin on anything especially since the lyrics just seem like so non specifically oriented around Rama or maybe revenge or just dislike of a certain person either wanting to call this person out or take them down physically I'm not entirely sure the track rodeo is really the only other song on this EP with a noticeable country influence and I wouldn't even say that's the most predominant style on the cut the watery guitars all over the song feel like they are lifted once again out of the grunge playbook a few of the plucky er guitar leads on the track sound more like surf rock like they're doing a Dick Dale type of thing and then the trap drums and vocal effects and somewhat psychedelic production once again feel very Travis Scott inspired regardless the track does feature a slick hook and a mystical vibe a somewhat funny southern twang to nas exes versus cardi B also makes an appearance on the song I think it's a kind of average appearance for her not too bad not mind-blowing I wouldn't say it makes the song but it doesn't derail it either I don't mind it finally the track closure offers listeners one more surprise here seeing NAS XL ament's of hip hop house even UK garage this track to my ears feels like it could have slipped pretty nicely into the debut disclosure record without much people batting and I added the driving beat sweet vocals and moody piano loops all over the song feel very much inspired by that project so once again nas ex viras left into something totally unexpected but he shows that hey he can he can kind of pull this off too I guess even though nas ex didn't present anything in new on this project I did come away liking a majority of the songs and was pretty impressed by his versatility so I would say in the end I liked this thing it's pretty cool it's not mind-blowing but pretty much everything on this project shows an incredible amount of promise hopefully now that little nas ex has shown he can do more than a couple things and write more than a couple songs he will just kind of move on to the next phase of his career and do bigger and do better things I'm feeling a light too decent six on this one transition have you given this EP a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next

_bipcA0Sn28,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over when I felt

has a new project out we have linked it down below for your listening pleasure okay new blank Banshee new blank banshee warning warning warning vapor wave community warning new blank banjee although this is not strictly a vapor wave endeavor though blank Banshee has always been one of the more versatile artists in the scene so check this one out peep it alright the tracks that I thought were the worst this week not too many not too many worst tracks this week honestly far more tracks that I thought were decent and tracks that that kind of wowed me this week so today today's a positive week for the weekly track roundup thankfully for one we had the new migos track stripper bowl which is an absolutely generic run-of-the-mill you've heard it a million times already me ghost track it seems they are just spinning their wheels in the mud and they have absolutely nowhere else to go they're just kind of waiting for the moment when everybody just kind of loses interest in them and wants to listen to somebody else I guess and moving on from there we have this new cut from little baby and future out the mud and yeah little baby continues to be one of the most derivative and forgettable rappers out there right now and future gives one of his more underwhelming performances over an absolutely run-of-the-mill instrumental so not really much to report on this one in my view let's move on to the track so I thought we're kind of met blowing me away but certainly worth mentioning and shouting out again these are linked down there below the new storm Z track crown is a pretty dramatic powerful track although the melody is eerily familiar eerily familiar it's it's not the first time I've heard a track hip-hop song kind of take on this very dramatic lavish style but storm Z he does pull it off relatively well moving on from there Megatron the new Nicki Minaj track she essentially tries to pull off a dancehall banger on this one the lead melody on the hook is kind of annoying I'm not sure if the the auto-tune compliments her voice all that much but the verses are great the beat is kind of quirky and off-the-wall you know doesn't have anything directly to do with the song but the music videos sexy as hell but still instrumentals a lot of great things going for it lyrically nicki is relatively on point flow as their attitude as their delivery is there she sounds as solid as usual on a good single just really could have used a better chorus we have murder beats teaming up with Shaq West and little pump okay instrumental kind of eerie it's really Shaq West that ends up kind of making the track worthwhile little pumps writing and rapping on this one is understated as hell and not really sure if that does him any favors on this one frankly moving out from their mannequin pussy another track from this new mannequin pussy which is now out I've shouted out a handful of songs from this record so far cream is the name of this latest one and it is a very raw aggressive kind of garage indeed punk cut with the vocals are just our rough as hell and I'm just liking like in the attitude coming off the track moving on from there little nods exponential I think it's a little brief I think it's a little derivative but I do like that nas X focuses on a central idea here of I guess falling out of favor with some fans who may not in his view want to see him grow see him change see him move on to something else not entirely sure as the lyrics don't go into that deep detail but still don't want to give much more away in terms of my opinion as I've gone in depth before check it out on the fan tanto channel and I have a review for his new EP coming up very very soon alright moving on from there holy ghost work their new record is out now the dance pop duo is I don't know on this new cut over here it's not bad it's not a terrible cut it's not a terrible song but it's very reverb II Hollow and and I think you know run-of-the-mill for this indie flavored dance pop style it's very so-so not a whole lot of a personality coming out of the the production on this one just seems very very breezy not a whole lot of flavor the grooves are very light the vocals not doing too much for me either do this is the name of the track it's okay and I don't know just wasn't really all that wowed by this new crop of singles you know outside of maybe one so you know I guess I'm gonna give the album a try when I get a chance but I don't know how uh how much of in a rush I'm gonna be to do that moving on from there Gucci Mane new record out a couple of tracks off the record or at least one that I can remember that features production with Kenny beats so shout out to well good for uh doing some some production on this one this one featuring Meek Mill is not bad Gucci's performance on this track is kind of awkward frankly it's really meek that ends up standing out on the cut instrumentals decent as well not one of Gucci Mane's our songs in my view but still the Meek Mill performance the Meek Mill feature does make it worth checking out does make it worthwhile Frankie cosmos has a new record on the way track out from it now it's a kind of a very soso piece of of indie rock songwriting with a slight lo-fi and bedroom pop twist I suppose close it quietly is the name of this song emphasis on quietly it's a it's decent it's okay it didn't really blow me away or feel I guess all that stand out for this particular style but if if this is very much in your wheelhouse is your favorite kind of music give it a shot give it a try we also have a new track from Devendra Banhart and that's as low-key and sensual and slightly funky as his material tends to be it's not bad but still I just continue to be underwhelmed by some of his latest efforts some of his latest effort so we've we've linked the song down below check it out for yourself you know you may you may dig on the low-key sensuality of the track a lot more than me we have Chelsea wolf over here a lot of people have been super psyched about the announcement of a brand new Chelsea wolf album and a song out from it now the name of this one is the Mother Road it's the intro track it's the first track from her new full-length album which kiddin can be pretty significant because intro tracks can definitely take on a tone setting flavor a totally different flavor than the rest of the record and there are elements of this track that I liked quite a bit and there were elements of it that I didn't I liked how lavish and extravagant the end of the song was but I thought the vocal performance and the acoustic direction of the instrumentation was kind of underwhelming and just felt very angry and I don't know it just didn't really do too much for me it just felt very stale and something like that was kind of beneath Chelsea in a way like she could have gone a little bit darker or embarked on some more sound play or something I mean there was definitely something very underwhelming about taking the first leg of the track in the direction that she did however again I'm not willing to sort of put anything simply on my slight underwhelmed feeling with this track because it is the first song who knows what the hell else the rest of this album holds you know the rest of the record could just bust into some kind of crazy industrial thing and not that I you know wish for Chelsea to do that or that I you know would only enjoy her music if that's what she was doing but the thing is a first track is not necessarily 100% indicative of everything else you're going to get after it so I will say because of the lavish instrumentation and how heavy some points and how dramatic some points the song are I am definitely intrigued but you know the song definitely left me I guess kind of I don't know just impatient and just wondering like man this thing could really use kind of a stronger pulse or a stronger direction or something but I don't know that's my first impression could definitely warm up to the song once I hear the rest of the record we have blink-182 coming through with a new short blistering hardcore punk song with some you know slight pop punk undertones generational divide it's a it's not too bad give it a shot it's it's just kind of a really short you know under a minute hardcore speedy hardcore punk tracks it's not too bad we also have Alex Cameron coming back with a brand new single divorce is the name of this new one if you guys remember I didn't really care for the last Alex Cameron single I thought the production on it was really rough do not know how that track got out with the beat being the way that it was and it's also the beat on this track that leaves me perplexed there's also like this really weird hideous I don't know percussive or synthetic sound popping up in the beat every once in a while every every bar so that they're really just kind of gets in my craw and just kind of ruins the vibe the groove of the song however I do have to admit the song on this one is awesome and it's a one of Alex Cameron's best lyrical performances yet I mean he's essentially going through this very tense situation where it's literally divorce and there's there's a lot a ton of bitterness to his writing on this track to his singing on this track his demeanor his attitude it's it's it's something to behold you know it definitely shows Alex Cameron's talent for being able to act out a song act in character in the middle of a song and the highly recommend that that you listen to this track if not only for that element of it even if there are some aspects of the instrumental I don't think are amazing and let's move on to the track so I thought were the best this week the ones that really kind of left a very positive impression on me but BAM one we have YB and Corday and chance the rapper bad idea a lovely heartfelt meaningful rich little pop rap track where of course chance the rapper gets to just kind of ease down and and rap a little like this cuz I do this is so horrible chance the rapper impersonation but but you know you know those you know that flow chance gets into when he gets really quiet and you know he's trying to say something that's that's really from the heart that that's that's pretty much what this song is you know that's so chance raps half the time and and Corti i think was it was a stroke of genius on his part to do this type of track and and he also performs very well on it you know and in his lyrics are definitely some of the most personal he has delivered yet in in a song in a single that he's put out but chance the rapper it was it was a good move on his part to come through with this track and think oh this would be a perfect song for chance this would be exactly the type of song chance would kill it on we would enhance each other's kind of moody personal vibe on this track and and it definitely worked wonders that appearance did moving out from their yacht the dance music duo yacht are back with a brand new single a downtown dancing it's incredibly funky incredibly exciting incredibly colorful incredibly fun loving it loving it loving it loving it loving it loving it you know yacht is is one of those groups that's I've never loved an album of theirs all the way through or anything but every once in a while they do come out with a single that is incredible and in this song is definitely an example of that all right moving on from there Rick Ross featuring wale active fool easily one of Ross's better singles in a long time really amped hyped up hook on this track while his performance as well as is a little above average for him so I don't know between the rich hard-hitting instrumental Ross's flow and energy level and in wale doing better than expected this ended up being one of my favorite tracks of the week miraculously and and I am NOT like a really big Rick Ross fan you guys know that at this point so give it a shot give it a try I guess moving on from there Metronomy has a new record on the way the British outfit that features elements of a pop and dance music and indie music they have a new track out with a music video attached to its salted caramel ice cream and it's certainly more sensual and funkier and dancey ER and I suppose it's it's easier to kind of get whipped up into in it as opposed to the last single that they dropped the music video attached to it is really cute to give it a shot give it a try Mark Ronson has dropped his new record it's out and about and he has put out one more song from it this one actually featuring angel Olson of all people which I'm kind of amazed to see that she made it onto the record not that she wasn't you know talented enough to to make it on to a Mark Ronson album but didn't know she was on Mark Ronson's radar and Shia does pretty well over this song that obviously is pretty dramatic which fits angel Olsen's white voice perfectly but it's very much a dance pop song you know and and as dramatic as it is you know it does hold pretty tightly to that typical dance pop form and Angel does really well over it so uh I guess the combination of you know voices you know artistic voices that is that I would not have expected to work together so well working together very well so again Mark Ronson true-blue angel Olsen great track definitely diggin it can't say I'm really that excited or looking forward to or even planning to do any kind of in-depth coverage on this album though I mean I've heard most of the off of it and I know Mark Ronson's albums tend to be very spotty very inconsistent very one-dimensional you know usually you're lucky if like two or three songs out of a Mark Ronson record are great and it seems I would have heard those songs already so you know I I guess I encourage you guys to give this album a try and just pick out of it what you can that really just kind of ends up wowing you because of course a little all over the place I love this track I'll the Miley track there's another cut off of it that I enjoy quite a bit don't know if anybody else is gonna be diggin much more out of it than a few tracks at a time though moving on from there we have our boy ho Bo Johnson typical story brand new track brand new single he's kind of made a big deal of her social media this new song coming out and it's a kind of a brand new direction for hobo Johnson and in the band it's a lot more visceral and punked out than I think hobo Johnson's sound typically is not as much folk I think people inherently hear like a bit of a hip hop influence in a lot of what he's doing and that doesn't even seem to be as as prevalent you know sure there's poetry sure there's spoken word you know there's certainly that slam poetry element to what he does and and how that comes together with these like roaring hard-hitting guitars that are you know just very buzzy and again very punky and the aggressive drumming I think it works well I think it works well you know I would hate to hear them do nothing but this from now on because you know I think those other elements of you know especially folk music definitely enhance what he's doing you know but it is cool to hear him and his group become a little bit more dynamic you know and try some new things and work in some other elements and flavours and and have it pulled off well so typical story huh Bo Johnson I I know at this point has shouty you know over emotive delivery and style isn't gonna be for everybody you know that's fine if if you hated hobo Johnson's past stuff you're most likely not not gonna be you know out by this but if you're one of the few one of the proud who was managed to kind of appreciate hobo Johnson for who he and what he does I think you're gonna I think you're gonna dig on this track you know I would say there's a bit of a you know a period of getting adjusted to the latter guitars and you know the the the different delivery the more rock influenced instrumental but you know it's it's a good cut moving out from there we have an artist that I just heard of this week named Claude and the song is is wish you were gay it's a good ballad very witty very passionate love the melody like the lyrics quite a bit and this is not to be confused with the track off the new Billy Eilish record that's pretty much about this the same topic different track different song similar sentiments but still you know the respect to both tracks because they're both good songs they're both good ballots so you know if this is your if this is your mood if you've been looking for more tracks that essentially scratch this narrative itch of sort of I guess kind of being stuck in a situation where you're attracted to another person and obviously the sexual orientations don't exactly line up then this is probably gonna be what you want to listen to I suppose this is gonna be what you want to listen to alright moving on from there we have a Caroline poll a check excuse me of chairlift fame she is coming through with a solo project she has a new single out door is the title of it it's it's a very strange art pop track it is a very strange art pop track I mean the vocals are great the production is good but that's not what makes it strange though there is a quality to the instrumental and especially the hook we're like it's has this very fast repeating cycle to it and it becomes this really entrancing hypnotic experience that kind of locks your brain into this frozen state and I like that quality about it very much it's it's a very strange sort of quality that that I haven't heard a song kind of feature in a while and yeah I'll just say entrancing it's a very entrancing pop song and you know with a good tune to it and some very mystical neat production hooked up to it so door Caroline Pola Trek don't miss it it's link down below with everything else moving on from there blarf is a project that I'm just now learning about linked to Stones Throw Records and badass benjamin button butthole assassin is the name of this song that i am linking you to again I'm not familiar with the origins of this song or this project I'm just hearing out about it now but I'll say this I'll put it this way if you're looking for very funky weird freaked-out sample-based music basically the avalanches if they were raised in a broken home you are not going to want to miss this that and that is that is essentially what this is it is fun it is insane it is colorful it is zany it is off-the-wall and the samples are heavy and the the source material is plentiful plenty of source material going into this track it's nuts it's nutty it's I don't know what else to say about it it's it's insanely impressive and insanely insane moving on from there black MIDI black MIDI black mini black MIDI this is a group that it's it's been interesting covering some of the earliest tracks of theirs that have come out on to the internet that I'm aware of in this segment and slowly seeing interest in the band grow from there in my audience and a variety of different coroner's on the internet and now their new record is out and people seem to be kind of freaking out over it I do like this new song that has been released just before they put this new album out and I'm not going to say too much about it I'm just going to link it down below because they do plan on reviewing this album very soon so just kind of hang tight black MIDI review will happen sooner rather than later so just just be patient it'll it'll occur we have this new track as well from 88 keys featuring Mac Miller and SIA that's life the more distance we get from Mac Miller's passing the more posthumous you know music we are hearing and this track over here is it's stunningly gorgeous it's a beautiful song like not only is the production wonderful but this is easily one of Mac Miller's most passionate heartfelt and frank sort of verses and rap performances ever ever recorded ever released and certainly one of my favorites that he's ever done and I think I'm not exactly sure how long you know this this recording was sort of hanging around and everything but you know I think even longtime fans will hear you know this this is not the Mac Miller that we had been dealing with you know for the past couple of albums not that he was only capable of doing what he was doing on his past couple of albums you know as of late but you know this is definitely a very different tone than what we've been hearing from Mac Miller in over the past few years so it's it's got a very very rich again I'll say a very heartfelt a very motivational song in a lot of ways and again just productions awesome see it kind of brings it up on the back end with a pretty stunning vocal performance as well not really anything you know nitpicky to say about this track it's just great it's great and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody remember all the songs that I mentioned are linked down there below in the description box so if you want to listen to any of them curious about any of them find them down below once more there is also a link to our Ridge wallet sponsor promo code melon and once more we got those tour dates coming up in August I will see you guys there in Massachusetts in New York in Connecticut so that is gonna be it weekly track

gq_duUotnbw,hi everyone Thurston et tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new waste of space orchestra synthesis this is the debut full-length album of experimental metal supergroup wasting space orchestra the group hails from Finland and they've been turning quite a few heads in the underground scene because of the membership that they share with groups that already have quite a bit of cred in the doom metal scene in the black metal scene of course I'm talking about Dark Buddha rising as well as R&C Pazuzu the latter I've covered on this channel a few times before I've been aware of their work for quite a while now Pazuzu has this reputation for taking black metal down more experimental and psychedelic paths they're not simply just another atmospheric black metal band and while I haven't been exactly blown away by their entire discography their last full length record in my view was easily one of their most impressive at least enough to keep me wondering where the band is going next and it would seem the waste of space orchestra is that next move and even though this is technically a totally different project it doesn't sound all that much different than the sum of its parts especially the Pazuzu side of those parts as dark buddha risings material tends to be a lot more formless and repetitive just exploring time and space a little more abstract and lengthy waste of space orchestra isn't necessarily that even though they do have their their moments of a low-key meditative instrumentation but seriously if you handed me this album and you told me it was another Pazuzu record and I had nothing else to go off of I would most likely just believe you that's not to say the change-up in personnel hasn't made a huge difference here it certainly has but in many ways sin theosis sounds like yet another helping of pazoozas very heavy black metal tinge psychedelic rock but with more doom metal leanings and a greater appreciation for the layering and the builds and the exploration of atmosphere that Dark Buddha Rising specializes in I will say the production on this thing is incredible it's immaculate it's clear its vibrant its colourful its juicy its its luscious it's tasty it's wet it's every piece of instrumentation rings pretty clearly and gorgeously the sound of this record is very dense there's a lot going on and it is methodically mixed eq'd and organized and I greatly appreciate that about it the powerful and high-grade sound of this album occasionally is very overwhelming and it gets even more interesting when pazoozas love of these sci-fi and old boobies soundtrack melodies collide with dark buddha risings talents for grand instrumental palates the song void monolith is a genuinely great start to this album sounding like the soundtrack to some 70s sci-fi horror film set in space but distorted to the max it's like something out of an old goblin soundtrack and this track segues flawlessly into the next one shamanic vision with the tracks fast primal drumbeats and horrifying guitar riffs it it makes me feel like I'm being stalked I mean it's a great vibe it's thrilling it's freaky it's scary but I can't say I'm super crazy about where it progresses instrumentally it does build in a gratifying way but a few points when the songs full wall of instrumentation hits it is loud but the performance executing all of it does feel kind of mild and does feel kind of reserved it's like the band is almost like not playing at full capacity the blast beat comes off really stiff the guitar lines start cycling to the point where they just feel stale and repetitive as do the atmosphere keyboard notes that are kind of collapsing on top of each other it just feels like the intensity peak of the track the band hits they could push it a little further if they played a bit harder but they just don't and I don't care for the vocals all that much either I do appreciate they don't sound like your average metal vocal experimental or otherwise they have this raspy freakish tone to them that's very high up in the throat over in the nasal cavity very but there's not a whole lot of rhyme or rhythm to them it's like they're just they're making noise and taking up space because there's just a void that needed to be filled and sadly a lot of these same problems do carry over on to the subsequent tracks in the tracklist the vocals on the track seekers reflection are a little more guttural yes but they are equally lacking in direction and all these little extra bits of sound effects and keyboard leads that add to the songs wall of instrumentation gets Taylor even faster than they did on the previous track as they're mostly hinging on this very weird messy keyboard loop they're not much of a compositional complement to the guitars roaring away beneath them and when the band tones things down on this record things get even more tedious like with journey to the center-of-mass boy does the atmospheric understated psych rock pastiche of the first leg of the song get old fast but also the track includes these indiscernible bits of instrumentation that are so washed out you can't really define what exactly they are they're just like a really uninspired aesthetic distraction from the overall lack of a compositional idea I will say this track does show a bit more chemistry than some of the others here as the band does building up to these more climactic points of the song play a bit more aggressively together in this subtly increasing fashion but even though the band does hit listeners once again with this massive wall of sound compositionally it's it's not doing much it's like a bland horror movie soundtrack or some cut-rate post-rock with a goth twist we then have the song wake up the possessor whose intro I don't care for all that much it's a little too campy and trying to instill this very cheap sense of fear the melody doesn't even transition effectively into the main theme of the song once the guitars and drums and vocals barge in regardless though the riffs and grooves on this track are easily some of the best on the entire album nothing gets too stale too fast and the vocal performances are some of the most gratifying on the entire record - after this those when the tracklist of this record starts to go a little haywire with infinite gate opening you have this weird drum chant piece that provides a cool down moment in the tracklist I guess it just comes off as filler though incredibly unnecessary I would have enjoyed it more if the lead up to this point had been a bit more solid or intense to where I felt like I I needed something to kind of chill me out but for the most part I'm just spending this time waiting for something more interesting to happen I think it would've been better if these chants and ideas had maybe been incorporated into other tracks here to kind of make them more dynamic and multifaceted we have the crushing vacuum head which is a total 180 in terms of sound and attitude the title is totally fitting as it makes me feel like I'm being sucked into a cosmic vacuum a black hole of some sort the wailing synths and guitar distortion on this one are their very very ow ow oh my god oh you're going crazy I wouldn't say it's much more than a sonic thrill but it's certainly the best sonic thrill on the entire album but then after this the universal eye is yet another interlude and in cool down moment and another kind of lengthy one to this one instead though is a very light atmospheric ambient drone that sort of lies there flat without much in the way of anything interesting happening the 13 minute closer is the biggest track on this record by far and it really suffers from a lot of the same problems the main course tracks of this album do it gets stale it gets repetitive the sonic high points and intensity points of the song just feel like they could have gone a bit farther so I guess give this thing a shot if you are looking for some blackened psychedelic sci-fi doom the production is incredible and immaculate and heavy and exciting but the performances are OK and the writing occasionally is very very weak and there are at least a few interlude tracks here that I got literally nothing from so looking back on the entire thing I really like what waste of space orchestra is trying to do more than what I think they're actually doing honestly I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry if the Bell is well over here next to my head is

3lVffzD-UKA,ah hi everyone built in a great anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Baroness record golden gray the sludge and progression of metal outfit Baroness they are back with a brand new album over the past decade or so the Savannah Georgia band has built up a pretty impressive discography and for whatever reason I feel like it was just a year ago that the band was dropping their record purple one of the Bands catchiest and most triumphant albums yet so because of how good and admirable everything Baroness has done up until this point is any time John Bay's lien company announced a new record it's cause for celebration but I can't say I was really all-in with this new one from the jump I thought some of the teaser tracks for this album where some of the weakest Baroness had released in years and it looked like this album was shaping up to be yet another double project from Baroness which the last time they did that was in 2012 with yellow and green and that's arguably the weakest project they've put out so far in some ways I do see yellow and green as a respectable transition point for Baroness as a lot of the more accessible elements and characteristics to their sound on purple were more or less Road tested on yellow and green but those were not the only flaws on the record certainly there were others that could be boiled down to Baroness overextending themselves over the period of a very long project for as progressive as some elements of Baroness's music are they haven't exactly mastered the art of writing the lengthy overblown rock album and they seem even further away from that prospect with a lot of songs on this thing just being pretty direct pretty straightforward more tuneful even some angsty er vocals and lyrics I would do anything to feel like it's almost like the band at some points on this project are becoming the metal equivalent of the Foo Fighters even the song broken halo sounds like what you would get if you took Baroness's sludgy powerful heavy sound and tried to pen some anthemic the super melodic power pop with it a la Weezer I'm not saying the result is good I'm just saying that's kind of what it sounds like a combination but for the most part on golden grey bear nests aren't taking too many risks sure there are a few weird time-wasting interludes that reinforce literally nothing else on the album a couple more mild ballads than expected a heavy sigh crack closer but many of the best tunes on this album could actually slip pretty seamlessly into the purple tracklist frankly I'm already gone tourniquet throw me an anchor the beautiful cold blooded angels so there definitely some quality highlights in terms of songwriting on gold and gray no question but most of this albums full potential is not lost in the lackluster pacing of the tracklist or some of the more mediocre songwriting on this thing no it's in how god-awful the production is it truly is and when I say the production the mixing on this thing is bad I mean it is bad the only tolerable listens I had to this album were on just very small headphones or on laptop speakers because on everything else on a stereo in the car it sounded like a total mess and that's because it just sounds bricked the hell out the vocals get buried in the bass the guitars barely have any presence you can only make out like half of the drum set a good portion of the time the mix is on the first two songs of this album made for some the worst Rock production I've heard all year it's like the drums the bass the guitars they're not organized or focused in a way where they're all reinforcing each other and empowering each other to unite and combine into this powerful and massive sound no it's it's kind of like everything is just cancelling each other out and it's really blurry and lacking in definition when the band tries to add extra little bits of sound and instrumentation they just get totally lost in the haze and lost in the noise it's like they might as well just not even added it or recorded it and even though listening to this thing on smaller cheaper speakers didn't make for a slightly better experience making out the finer details was still really difficult I expected this to be a slight problem because it also was when Dave can't stop compressing Friedman also produced Baroness's last album purple in a way it did complement how heavy and massive and thick and powerful Baronessa sound typically is but with gold and gray it's it's way worse the roaring guitar chords' toward the end of the seong borderline just sound like white noise they're clipping or just overblown meanwhile the wall of sound on the last track of the record sounds like Friedman was just like this mix a fit and this problem is so egregious it makes enjoying the finer writing and performances on here really difficult like why should I only be able to enjoy this album on my macbook speakers it makes no sense meanwhile out of everything else it sounds blown out and indiscernible I'm just confused as to how this album was released with such major technical flaws laced into its sound laced into the balance of instrumentation I mean I guess it's not Baroness's best crop of songs anyway so maybe it's a wash but still I think mixing and compressing this album properly without ruining how it sounds would have made a world of difference in terms of being able to enjoy it as Baroness on this album has gone from being this heavy visceral juggernaut of a band to just sounding artificially loud and muddy I'm feeling a light too decent five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

a58B7bUVD_M,hi everyone density debate tan oh here are the Internet's busyness its inner and it's time for a review of the new Holly Herndon record proto producer vocalist composer avant-gardist techno futurist Holly Herndon she is back with a new record her second for the 4ad label and I was pretty excited to eventually get to this one because Holly is an artist that I have seen great potential in for a while her experimental fusions of choral music and and Glitch an art pop inhabit a space that that so few artists are existing in today Holly's music also seems to be a conscious effort to blur the lines of existence between humans and the technology they create not only by processing her voice so heavily that it sounds robotic that it sounds alien but on this very album this new record of her she's collaborating with a musical AI of her own invention which is named spawn which not only pops up at a few points on this record but actually has a feature on a track toward the back end of this project - and as much as I think this is a cool new frontier for Holly's music let's face it collaborating with or creating an album entirely with a piece of artificial intelligence is is not anything entirely new it's very much been a thing electronic music artist ash Cuccia is just about to come out with another record with his own AI artist Yona there have also been AI pop idols as well as the YouTube channel data bots who've made quite a bit of AI generated music up until this point actually they run a YouTube channel right now where they stream quite a bit of AI or computer-generated death metal so I guess this project isn't really about the novelty of this idea as much as it's about how Holly executes sit and even though proto does feature some AI inclusions stylistically and sonically it's it's not really all that different from Holly's last full-length album as well some of the sounds are a bit richer and the compositions are slightly sweeter and more accessible there are creative parallels between this album and let's say Bjork's madula as well as maybe like some of enya's music it's like I'm listening to a futuristic strain of New Age art pop that comes from a society where everyone's clothes are white the government functions in a totally utopian fashion and we've reached symbiosis with with robots and even though technology has advanced we're still like living in this tribal existence where the communal creation of music still matters as there are a lot of group vocals on this record there are a lot of musical movements that seem to pull from folk music so all these things are exciting ideas they're exciting prospects but I still walked away from this project similarly underwhelmed as I was with pretty much every Holi record up until this point there are some compositions on this project that definitely leave a lot to be desired and there are other cuts here that seem to be orbiting around some central experimental weird idea Holly has conceived and even though I can appreciate how one-of-a-kind a single idea from this record is Holly fails to organize or progress these sounds in a fashion that keeps them engaging and interesting the song godmother features these consistently tedious and glitchy vocal bits that have some interesting rhythmic intricacies to them but they just mostly sputter along and conspicuously after a while it does become slightly annoying I do like the heavily processed blend of vocals on the track fear uncertainty doubt even though it once again presents a sort of futuristic and odd sound the musical progressions on the track mostly feel like Holly is just throwing melodic paint at a canvas and seeing what ends up sticking or just looking kind of good the song bridge features these ambient droning chorus vocals and kind of glitchy manipulated spoken word passages over that it once again presents somewhat interesting combination of ideas but the progression of the track is uneventful the meaning of the song is really vague and sort of touch-and-go the droning chords and abstract spoken word just don't really communicate all that much nor are they so sonically stimulating that you could stretch them out past three or four minutes and they would stay engaging the track extreme love is just one more moment that feels like a d2 here it doesn't really coalesce with anything else on the project though honestly it's one of my favorites on the record I do love the bone chilling instrumental I love the event of spoken word telling this tale of symbiosis with these almost like microscopic beings living in our guts and they're controlling us and and now we live in like this this Borg like state where we're all just one connected being it seems like a pretty cool premise for a sci-fi series or a movie but once again the cool ideas found on this track aren't really reinforced by anything else on this very random album I guess you could say this project is consistently odd but that's a pretty weak thread to pull your entire album together with especially since each track is being odd in a completely different way there are a handful of tracks on here though that are genuinely good futuristic pieces of art pop with some fantastic compositional elements woven in alienation eternal frontier the closing track as well but as much as I like these tracks I would say my enjoyment of them is really only relative in comparison with all the other cuts on the record I would say a lot of these songs do tend to run a little derivative as well even if some of the musical movements they present are beautiful the vocal layers are also very nice the rhythms presented throughout these tracks are very digital and grainy but also primal the funky chants presented throughout these tracks feel like they're coming from another world and other society and other dimension of another planet but again as good as these tracks are by comparison a bulk of this album is just in a totally different place really totally different places as this project is very scattered and I'm not sure what to say about it other than that I do admire how bold some of the experiments on here are but a single cool experimental idea does not a good track or a good composition make and it makes for an especially weak album when you assemble all of these half-baked ideas into a record that doesn't really have any semblance of flow I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would

NKisf0dAyjM,"hi everyone forth Annie more tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the old Jay Paul leak leak Oh for 13 bait ones this is the now officially released demo project of uk-based songwriter and producer Jay Paul it originally hit the internet back in 2013 on Bandcamp but was quickly removed with Paul claiming to have nothing to do with its upload and as you could imagine these demos surfacing caused quite a stir online not just because an artist signed to a pretty notable label XL Recordings had their project leaked onto the Internet but up until this point Paul had already been signed to XL Recordings for years and had little to show for it outside of a few singles at the time this demo hit the Internet the amount of music Paul fans had to listen to was very little personally I didn't really get that much out of the demos when they originally hit the Internet and I gave them a cursory listen and for a long time I felt Paul's hype factor comes less from what he actually does and more from the anticipation of what he could be doing kind of like the Jay Electronica effect except with even less studio quality music to go off of I worry about some of the assumptions listeners may be making as they wait for Paul's next musical move would we be waiting this long if what's coming around the corner wasn't going to be amazing and I think a leaked demo of this magnitude also contributes to that as well because you're not so much reviewing or listening to the music on the merits of what it actually is but more what you imagine it could be if it were polished off if it were touched up if you were to hear it in its final form obviously Paul at this point is comfortable with the demo as is and the mastering it seems to have undergone to get on the streaming platforms if he wasn't I can't imagine that he would have put it out for people to stream it formally at this point so even with a full project of music right in front of us right now we're still in a state of waiting we're still in a state of anticipation because it's a demo because numerous tracks on this thing are labeled as finished cuz even with 30-plus minutes of music in front of us this is not the project Paul intended to come out with now these demos being released are not the only thing that has occurred other gears have been turning Paul along with his brother has announced the opening of the Paul Institute a record label that they're running Hall has also dropped two b-sides not on this record of studio quality do you love her now and the track he admittedly I'm not that crazy about either on both tracks the vocals left a lot to be desired do you love her now read to me like Animal Collective making some really washed out bland old-school R&B the song he I thought was more creative instrumentally and had more of a pulse to it a stronger groove but the track still feels like a motif or just some weak pastiche trapped in a dated drab dream state still featuring this very 80s sheen on it and the song at the core of it I didn't think was all that memorable so with all of this activity happening I figured something big for Paul is coming just around the corner so it might be worth revisiting this project and seeing how it's held up after all this time what is the hidden potential on this project and where might Paul be going next past this I will say sometimes the greatness of these tracks even in their rough state does jump out at you pretty boldly singles like BTS to you as well as Jasmine still sound pretty good after 10 and 7 years respectively the latter sleek nocturnal vibes are fantastic even if the lead vocals are a tad bit dodgy the guitar and simply do OVA nin to this track or both absolute stunners and the former tracks wonky groove and crushing bass cents and laser sound effects match pretty well with the weird lullaby vocal melodies it's a tad bit repetitive as many songs on here are Paul doesn't really develop a lot of these songs all too deeply but I think that can mostly be chalked up to these tracks being demos but it still doesn't hold him back from his instrumental ambitions on this track when he weaves some horns into the mix again despite the rough recording and very basic song structures there are some deep cuts here that are equally satisfying the song straight at a Mumbai is fun as hell the tark words are a little jarring but once the full instrumental is kicked in they bury in with everything else pretty nicely I love the jangly percussion sound effects hanging in the background I love the foreign groove the ham drums the cut is very low fie it's very blissful it's kind of gorgeous I think the glassy throwback synth chords and very busy beat on the track Genevieve are awesome too the nostalgic aesthetic of the song actually reminds me a little bit of Neon Indian specifically Allen's work that sits more in the synth funk realm more in his Vegas side-project realm especially on the Vega international night school record he did but obviously with some of the demos on this project dating back to 2007 it eventually getting released in 2013 only as a leak though and Allen under the neon Indian name undergoing multiple changes to his style to his sound it would be insane to insinuate there's any kind of like influence or ripoff going on here all I'm saying is there's a clear stylistic parallel at least for me and if that's a sound if that's a vibe you're into you will most likely dig on this project there's also a kind of cute cover on this thing of Jennifer Paige's crush which is a pop hit from back in the day I used to love hearing on the radio and even though I don't really care for the touch-and-go production on this cut where every single sound in the mix seems to be constantly weaving in and out of frame what I will say about this track is that it does display the crossroads of sounds and influences that go into Paul's music the indie tronic a-- the R&B the pop and dance pop the synth pop the new wave there are some other tracks on the album where I think the production is so rough that it asks quite a bit of the listener not so much can you enjoy this but also can you make sense of this like the ear crushing spazzy synth lines on the track 100,000 which Berry's just pretty much everything else in the mix even though I do appreciate the abrasiveness of it to a degree I don't really think the sound complements the vocals and the tune of the track all that well honestly though this is not as bad as the tediously cycling beat and shrill synths Wells on the track Desert River probably the messiest mix here and the performances kind of awkward as well with these since lazily playing behind the tempo in a way where it makes the track difficult to enjoy the song vibin as well is just way too faint or vague it's just like a washed out sort of idea for a song maybe I'm similarly underwhelmed by another slow burner on here all night but at least there's a real tune at the core of this one overall I'm I'm not entirely sure what to make of this demo am I - just critique it based on what it actually is a demo that is unfinished it sounds unfinished I feel like I would be lying to you guys if I were to come on camera here and and not say yeah it's it's a demo it sounds like a demo feels like a demo meaning that yeah it's it's very much half-baked yeah it's it's very much not done it does not sound complete it does not sound professional grade in my view there are many many many studio produced albums that just blow this out of the water so is that the angle to take with this project or should I be trying to see past these flaws and review based on what I think it could have been and look imagining many of the tracks off this project in a more polished state it's not an impossibility but even in that scenario and even with my imagination just like cranking on all cylinders I'm still not walking away from this thing blown away as it's not exactly the most innovative thing in all of the genres Paul obviously pulls from on this project a lot of the light boyish nasally vocals I see is not only nondescript but also pretty standard for the indie tronic genre and I just don't think a lot of the songwriting on this thing is up to snuff sure you could argue if paul fixed this project up released it earlier enough and put out another one he could have been early to the party and in the thick of some great prevailing trends in underground music this decade as well as in the tail end of the aughts but that's not how things played out and at this point I wonder if Paul will even have an opportunity to capitalize off of any of that potential because of how long it's taken to get to this point and considering the material on this project the state that Paul has released it in as well as the sound of his two latest tracks I'm not sure if anything here on leaked is indicative of where Paul is going next honestly so there are certainly some good and admirable songs and beats and production choices on this project but these demos are still demos and deeply flawed and I'm not sure if I had much more to say about them than that I'm feeling a light too decent six on this one transition have you given this project to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it

IhxPVSz5IFY,"hi everyone tofu Tony here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 100 gex record 1000 gex featuring Dylan Brady as well as Osos no.1 oh no what is that how you say that also known as Laurel s this duo Dex they're relatively new they're yet to build up a sizeable discography but they're already making some pretty bold statements in the realms of bubblegum base and deconstructed Club though genre labels aren't really a full explanation of GAC sound though of course aesthetically they pull quite a bit of inspiration from those camps the Charli xcx's and the Sophie's of the world music fans will most likely pick up on those inspirations first but the music on 1,000 gex is also an exercise in postmodern lo-fi Pop absurdism assembling one of the weirdest and wildest combinations of sounds I've heard this year without warning this project will suddenly break into passages of emo pop and dubstep extreme metal R&B Drum & Bass and even the MIDI madness of OneNote Rick's point never on the track I need help immediately there's even a ska song on this project about a horse I feel like I'm dreaming it's like if sleigh bells had the Restless demeanor of mr. bungle and they were trying to make songs for Death Grips and PC music fanboys which seems gimmicky on the face of it and some of the tracks on this project are certainly that I'm not sure how a lot of them will age once the music trends they're based on are phased out of existence but still when the songwriting on this thing pops it pops and it makes me wonder if Dex can come through with a more satisfying or maybe even a more experimental project next time around because even those songs like 7:45 sticky and get get get get get as well as hand crushed they're fun but their appeal and their impact are kind of fleeting they're kind of lost in a haze of quirky transitions and genre combinations I get a lot more from weirdo pop ragers like money machine which are super noisy and bright and auto-tuned I'm also addicted once more to this ska song on this record about a horse titled stupid horse and yes it is composed like a third wave ska song but like with every other track on this project it's fed through this lens of noise and glitch and MIDI sure a few pop punk guitar leads do make it into the mix as well as these ridiculous shouts in the background pick it up the only thing this track is missing is is the horn section but at the core of all of this insanity a ridiculous but compelling and catchy song is there and I've just realized right now at this very moment it kind of reminds me of that dude Adam and his package which I don't know if that's a conscious reference or inspiration many many people have not heard of that guy he's just this guy who used to make this really loaf I weird electronic pop music that was very punk inspired and dealt in a lot of absurd song concepts but that's another conversation for another day we also have these sweet and endearing ringtone which is all about your significant others ringtone that you have set on your phone it kind of takes a page out of the Hannah diamond playbook in that it depicts love in the technological age ringtones smart phones group dm's etcetera while these tracks may be jittery and feel a tad bit schizophrenic in a sense there is still a logical musical thread pulling all of it together not that this albums inability to settle on one sound or one idea ruins its 23 minute runtime nothing really stays around long enough for it to wear out it's welcome also it leads to this project kind of melding together into this fast sweet hyper addictive quick jarring experience that's pretty stimulating as is I think 1,000 gex is a blindingly fun project but it is a tad bit derivative and going forward I would love to hear more songs or at least more experiments kind of sticking out of the chaos that gex creates I appreciate how genuinely experimental a lot of what's on this project is but it would be great to hear something from these two that is a bit more coherent has more replay power and relies less on novelty still I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this one transition have you given this one a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it'd be like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Dex 1000 of them forever "
EXlT02OusHM,oh wow wow wow hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time once again for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst

interesting streaming site under under their belts they've been running for quite a while now they not only stream music put artists on help build the profile of independent artists but they also

you guys with a link to the website down there feed bands calm vinyl slash record - archive it's in the description box two bucks a record can't go wrong alright let's get into the track so I thought were the worst tracks this week let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it first one first one BAM The Pixies have dropped a or rather just Pixies yet they're still at it and they have dropped an incredibly weak and awkward cut titled on graveyard Hill there's really not much to say about it's just an incredibly boring drab song just wish the just wish Pixies had kind of a fire in their belly once again but at this point I don't think they do the Nuba dot Madonna song is a very annoying preachy basic as far as the rhyme scheme and message goes and quite annoying quite annoying a track whose song is completely ruined all because Madonna wants to put out this fake woke message about society's obsession with Fame and so on and so forth moving on from there we have a new track from Chris Brown and Drake as well it's titled no guidance and it sounds like your very typical buttery smooth Chris Brown R&B banger with absolutely nothing special about it outside of the Drake performance it's not really all that necessary at this point it's just kind of horrible by way of being so painfully average and let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of myth they weren't blowing me away or anything but I certainly thought they were worth pointing out shouting out you guys might like them more than me first off new rec and reference track a bit of a change of pace from the last teaser the last single the group or the experimental music project has dropped this one is a bit more abrasive and is packed with a very tense bit of spoken word that almost borders on rapping it's very odd although I would say it was a bit difficult to digest you know in the short amount of time I had to listen to this song I couldn't quite make a call as to whether or not it was a really vibing with me or anything but I will say I was intrigued I was intrigued I am looking forward to hearing this track on the context the rest of the album that they have coming out very soon moving on from there Whitney is somewhat breakthrough secretly Canadian Chicago band I mean they've been at it for a little while but this new this new track this new single of theirs giving up has been turning quite a few heads this week it's actually getting quite a bit of play on streaming and stuff like that people making a big deal of the track and I think it's a very pretty classic nostalgic pop rock song with some lavish instrumental passages I thought the vocals were kind of weak frankly but I mean there's so few artists that they're reviving this particular brand of very complexly arranged throwback seventies vocal pop and rock so yeah I mean give it a try give it a try you might like to throw back five of the song quite a bit moving on from there Oliver tree has come through the new cut a new music video rather that's kind of been blowing up a little bit wanted to point it out because it has been doing well for the guy over a million views on in a very short amount of time however I feel like the the tune at the core of this one is easily the most tedious that he's put out in a while the refrain the acoustic guitar passage that there's not a whole lot to it you know it's it's not nearly as catchy and some of the lyrics just feel like um I don't know just just an allusion to something meaningful or an allusion to something deep or emotionally significant but it doesn't really add up into much frankly movin on from there Big KRIT quit here brand new single one of my favourite southern rappers back with a brand new song and I feel like this track has a lot of good things going for it it has a lot of things that I like I wanna love this track honestly I really do and hey you know what the the first major single he teased from his last album I thought was okay when I first heard it I thought was okay at least I can at least from what I can remember I don't remember freaking out about it too hard and and it grew on me it definitely did grow on me though once I heard the entire album that could be the case for this new song over two year but I will say what did turn me off about the track a little bit is that it there was a lot going on but not a lot of it was coalescing in my opinion crit had some very animated over-the-top rap performances on this thing a lot of shouts it was like he was a preacher on the song effectively I mean you could even tell from the cover art here that he's like directly referencing Church culture on this thing and the the gospel influences in the beat were kind of a breath of fresh air as well but the beat two felt almost schizophrenic it away there was a lot happening a lot of weird chopped up samples a lot of strange grooves and rhythms a lot of changes a lot of strange combinations of sounds like a lot of things isolated in this track sound pretty great and come off pretty in Britain and pretty ambitious frankly but I'm still sitting here wondering is is this like really coming together into an effective track at the end of the day it felt a little bit like a mess and maybe more lessons will make me warm up to it a bit more but as of right now first impressions I'm not as blown away by it as I would like to be moving out from their horror and ghosts main have collaborated on a new track that maybe isn't the most seamless marriage of their two sounds but it is pretty hardcore it is pretty aggressive some pretty badass and distorted guitars all over this thing and ghost Mane is woven I think more into a horror sound than vice-versa and and it works it works pretty well it works pretty well even though it's maybe not the most unique song I've ever heard moving on from their gold link has come through with a brand new single featuring Tyler the Creator and Jay Prince there are some elements of this track I thought were well mning some elements of it I like quite a bit I thought the dance beat was great I thought Tyler's performance on the track was great goldlink wants more underwhelmed but I still thought it was one of the though I still thought I was one of his more solid vocal performances I will say that J prince was also a great choice for the chorus on this one did a full-length track review of this on the Fantana channel if you haven't seen that check it out also girlband shoulder blades the the band is back with I don't know that they're their own sort of little brand of very heavy noisy industrial as Shrock music this track especially for girl band was kind of winding and and strange and in patience testing I'm not sure if the payoff was as exciting and as worthwhile as the group thought it would be but if you're really looking for something out there that is abrasive and abstract you're definitely gonna want to try out this this new track shoulder blades moving on from their future has a brand new project out he's been teasing this track or rather you know this track government official has been making the rounds and honestly in my view after enjoying quite a bit of the material where he had better vocal performances interesting beats which ups off the wizard it seems like on this new track over here he's very much going back to just putting in the lowest amount of effort possible and just you know sort of doing future by the numbers which is sad which is unfortunate I'm sure the fans are probably gonna like it but as of right now I feel like future continues to dig his heels into one sound and one idea and one vibe and meanwhile like there been so many new artists evolving past this sound over the past several years and I'm just worried future is gonna get lost in the haze of every other artist out there who is trying new things and taking risks you know even if some of what they're doing is considered trendy today like at least they're on that new New Wave future in my view is sort of behind at this point if he's gonna continue putting out tracks that sound exactly like this so I don't know pretty underwhelmed by it even though it's not necessarily a horrible track from future moving on from there Erykah Badu has come through with a cover song with James Poyser on the track of the song tempted and I I think some of the vocal mixing on the track is a little awkward but still it's a pretty faithful rendition of the song which is a lovely track you know awesome to hear some artists kind of bringing some attention back to it darkthrone has come through with a new track new project on the way the title of this new song is Duke of gloat and pretty average sound and instrumental and progression by black metal standards but it's its Darkthrone they're one of the most classic black metal bands out there if anybody out there is going to get away you know and not that darkthrone hasn't put out records in the past where they've taken a risk you know changed up their sound they certainly have you know darkthrone is fucking change up their sound a few times over the course of their very lengthy career this new track over here though to my ears even though the production you know is nowhere near as grimy or as nasty as a lot of the old-school stuff out of the 90s to me this progression to me this compositional progression to me this type of riff writing just sounds very meat-and-potatoes black metal sounds very by-the-numbers black metal and if you're one of those purists if you're one of those people it likes to hear the genre true to form you're probably not going to you know want to miss this because that's definitely what they're doing on this cut moving on from there blank mass excuse me blank mass the solo effort of mr. power from fuck buttons fame of fuck buttons fame one half of fuck buttons has come through the brain who cut over here and it's titled house vs. house it's a very jittery somewhat glitchy very overwhelming sound a song with some interesting and very repetitive samples reaches a strange climax though I'm somewhat mixed on this track I feel like their element sumit that are mind-blowing in there elements of it that are just so obnoxious to me that i don't want to hear it again but of course I will try it some more times as we're getting closer to the release of the the the new blank mass record and you know who knows I could warm up to it in that time it was certainly weird enough to uh you know get me scratching my head and that that's always a good thing even if I'm not like blown away by a track at first I guess and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best ones this week the ones that really set it off for me the tracks that I thought were the hardest the most exciting first off ooh ty Segall or ty Segall rather I don't want to say his name wrong I don't want to say his name wrong excuse me ty Segall has a new project on the way although he's always got something new coming out of around the corner he's one of the most prolific guys in underground rock music all you really need to do is just like look down at your watch and it's probably just gonna be like a half an hour till the new ty Segall record comes out so you know but he's always got something new coming out and this month is no different this track over here that he's just dropped taste is uh pretty good it's pretty good it's a psychedelic it's punky it's overwhelming it's noisy the songwriting is pretty sharp and it's attached to a pretty hilarious music video as well so you know ty is a guy who I know I'm not gonna like every project he drops he's gonna come out with records that I think are boring our safe are maybe a little too out there or unfocused but every once in a while he does come out with an album and this is why I always try to keep tabs on whatever he's doing that you know really kind of feels like he's pushing the envelope a little bit and hitting a great balance of experimental and accessible and to me this new track over here definitely was was scratching that itch moving out from there sandy Alex G has a new record on the way house of sugar and teaser track from this from this record Gretl I actually enjoyed quite a bit I know a little while ago the last time I did an Alex G review got a lot of flak for people telling me like it you're dumb you're just an idiot you know you don't get the genius of his music and so on and so forth and in look that's fine I'm not gonna like everything but even though by I guess many standards you could say this new track Gretel is is a standard sad boy indie rock tune still I thought the arranged instrumentation on this track was pretty great I thought the climax that it came to toward the end was amazing and beautiful I thought the production had a great mix of just just good mixing good instrumentation a lot of organic tasteful beautiful sounds packed within but at a somewhat low-five veneer that was definitely you know sweet and admirable I I felt like that loafie aesthetic was working more in G's favor than it was on his last album and the songwriting I think has improved since the last record as well just based on this song alone so the tune is their instrumentation is there I think there are some subtly experimental and weird aspects to the sound of the song too that I think are pretty cool and creative so yeah house of sugar looking forward to it Sam for the great rapper Sampha the great has an amazing new song out titled final form and this is like the best rap performance I've heard her deliver on a track and apparently John Wayne also mixed this song and did it did a hell of a job at that as well if you listen to one rap song this week if you listen to one new rap song this week make it this one cuz it's fuckin awesome thank you alright snort snort print print hurry and noise project Prairie ends has a new project on the way and there has been a song released a song teased this one is titled Screaming Eagles airborne graveyard and it's obviously tied into the title here garden of the mutilated paratroopers and this song certainly sees Prairie and going back into that just straight-up noise almost like power electronics phase of the project's career it's very abrasive it's very distorted tons of feedback it's like it's literally a shock to the ears it's a shock to the brain and it's very short as well so it's not like it goes on forever or anything which I do think it is kind of unique that Pirin tends to you know keep these very noisy and abrasive abstract modes of music kind of brief and to the point I find it refreshing in a way even in the short amount of time you know two minutes and change that the song lasts doesn't leave a very strong impression I mean again the the feedback and distortion on this track is absolutely shocking and grating to an extreme degree it feels like being in a war zone frankly and almost traumatizing in a way I will uh I'll leave it at that I definitely recommend trying this track out if you're looking for anything experimental or something that's gonna like you know really melt your brain moving on from there Liam Gallagher of Oasis Fame has come through the brand-new single a track that I actually liked quite a bit believe it or not even though I found quite a few songs from his last record kind of bland the shockwave is the name of his new rock anthem his new barn burner over here yeah it's it's got some pretty Liam Gallagher ish guitar riffs and vocals but it's kind of a hell of a song you know it's simple its blunt it's straightforward it's hard it's got a lot of attitude certainly more teeth on it then I think a lot of Liam's recent work has his hat and certainly blowing anything his brother is doing out of the water right now let's see oh we have a new track over here from a project by the name of Gauls w-why Rd not too you know familiar with that you know that lettering but Gaul if you're unfamiliar is a long time black metal vocalist known for his work in word Runa as well as one of my favorite black metal bands Gorgoroth but still you know I haven't gotten into every single so lower side effort he's ever been involved in and so this new project has a record on the way and the song out that has been released this week is ech ear alar hope I'm pronouncing that correctly ik errol are and it's a pretty interesting bit of black metal I mean how to explain it I mean for one the vocals are absolutely twisted I mean not only yeah I mean I guess you could say in a way they do fit the typical black metal vocal form but there's something uniquely twisted and chilling about them they sound like something out of you know my nightmares they're very freaky they're very bone-chilling I'll say that and you know the the guitars sound hellish yes but kind of weird just really warped it sounds like black metal from a surreal dream or again I'll just use the word nightmare it sounds like black metal from a surreal tortured nightmare you know where someone just like creeping over your shoulder and they're gonna get you it's it's it's very freaky it's very freaky and I like it quite a bit do not miss out on this song the metalheads in the audience don't miss out on this track sizzling sizzling sizzling sizzling brand new track brand new single from Daphne aka caribou it's a great dance on it's a great dance rager it's got some awesome like kind of funk soul disco samples placed throughout it it's got a great progression high-energy beautiful illustrious instrumentation I would love a new Daphne record frankly of tracks just like this I would love that wartime dub culture city this is a brand-new track from culture abuse and it features a little ugly mane and it's a little ugly Mane rapping over a very strange instrumental that is very obviously influenced by Deborah reggae and it's a kind of abstract a little weird and off-putting but it's actually a pretty great song it's actually a pretty great track looking forward to more material from this project and hopefully more crossovers in the future I guess yeah I thought it was pretty cool a a project or an artist's of just hearing of now Channel tres sexy black Timberlake this song is hilarious this song is so funny and fun and catchy and chock full of personality I just love it it's very playful it's very tongue-in-cheek it's I'll say it's even a little sassy too and I don't know the dance groups are great I love the vocals it's kind of a mix of just dance music hip hop funk pop but it's it's definitely got a strong weirdo edge to it you know it's it's not you know obviously Justin Timberlake is referenced in the title here but it's it's not a Justin Timberlake song it's not anything like that um but it does play on the idea of making kind of sexy danceable pop music and it does so in a very clever and ingenious way you know again another track you know if you walk away from this video hearing one track in addition to the sample track may get this one as well this one is a very fun dream glow BTS Charli XCX from from the new BTS world soundtrack I guess yeah Charli XCX and the famed kpop outfit they finally crossed over and yeah it's it's a pretty good song charli's vocal vocals on the hook here kill it BTS sound smooth and execute well on this I like this song quite a bit more than a lot of the tracks off persona there were some verses that I thought were a little underwhelming on the track you know some some moments during the verses of the song with the instrumentals solid outside of the beat being a little repetitive and again chorus absolutely rules and it's a pretty well produced cut as well so yeah like to quite a bit bode ver has come through with a few singles recently that I have talked about on the Fantana channel did a full length review of them over there if you want to hear more thoughts subscribe over there check out that video but the names of the tracks are you man like and Hema you is not a track I would put in the the best section of the week we track roundup it's more of a meth in my opinion kind of a very straight back underwhelming underwhelming unfinished ballad meanwhile Hema is actually uh I think one of the better songs that Justin Vernon has written and released in a long time a bit of a fizzle ending and the drums are kind of buried but the instrumentation sounds rich and gorgeous Justin's vocals are pretty nicely layered and harmonized his vocal performance is convincing as well very passionate very powerful which had a bit more oomph to it but it's a beautiful tune it's a beautiful song and looking forward to hearing more like it hopefully boss has come through dream Ville artist dreamville rapper boss who I have covered on the channel I think in brief before because I thought his last record was super underwhelming he's come through the song over here where his rapping and his performance actually grabbed my attention thought up until this point that the dudes stuff and his rap style were just really underwhelming and just nothing to write home about but this new track over here fried-rice he really jumps off the page now that could have something to do with the fact that jid is on the song and JIT kills it on the track I mean he definitely comes out ahead on the song nobody ever really comes out of a JIT song outperforming jid I actually wonder at this point if we had jid and Kendrick on a track you know like would would Kendrick even come out of that song sounding more impressive than than Jude would I wonder I genuinely do wonder but still having said that I do think having JIT on the song did sort of put vos in a position where it's like okay I gotta like up the ante here I gotta like raise the energy level and do my best and write my best shit and you know pull together like a really impressive flow for this song and and for the most part he does and it leads to great chemistry it leads to a lot of excite it leads to a pretty great track a very punchy very fun very thoughtful hip-hop track that that does being lyrical and does rapping proficiently well you know it's not just like that generic spiritual lyrical miracle you know kind of crap so you know definitely keep this one check it out and that has been the weekly track round up everybody thank you very much for watching thank you very much for listening I hope you guys got some solid

4c_G72t4pO8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for another edition of our great album segment where I go over some records from the past month that I covered that I loved that I do not think should slip through the cracks anya so pay attention please I'm going to link them all down below so you can check out the reviews get more information and make sure that these records get to your ears and yeah let's go yeah first off I want to give a shout out to the new slow Thai record nothing great about Britain a fantastic grime and UK hip hop record from a bright new artist who is making some very exciting waves if you are into the likes of Dizzee Rascal as well as the streets and you enjoy some of the more I guess personal and introspective narratives and lyrics those artists have dropped over the years either you're going to get a lot out of this album especially with the very bold mental health narrative that a lot of these tracks take the instrumental choices on this record are certainly quality and slow tie himself sticks out because of his yell P and expressive and very out-there delivery again one of the most interesting faces and voices coming out of the UK at the moment and yeah yeah just excited to hear more from this guy next I want to give a shot to the new Megan the stallion project fever a record of one banger after another is a tad one-dimensional but if you were looking for like some strip club ragers with deeply sexual lyrics with a lot of female empowerment angles tossed in I think you're gonna get a lot out of this project it's incredibly catchy calls back very clearly to the mid-2000s era of three 6 mafia's catalogue their loads of three 6 mafia samples and references even a Juicy J feature on this thing - and Megan is certainly a very bold and bright personality in her own right not dropping the most intricate or most layered lyrics that I've ever heard but very brutal and their aggression in their dark humor as well as their dominance on the sexual battlefield next I want to give a mention to the new Tyler creator album igor wow wow wow wow wow definitely a fantastic concept record a very compelling take on the genres of R&B and soul with some hip-hop mixed in there too tyler is pulling pretty heavily a lot of inspiration from Pharrell from Kanye West as well as some other places that may not be that obvious like low fine music post-punk music some listeners have complained this album is maybe not as easy to listen to as flower boy and I think that's fine I like that I prefer it that way I like the ambition of this project like the themes of this project I do like the dark weird warped somewhat messy aesthetic of this album - all of which is pulled off pretty skillfully and takes little to nothing away from the very skilled songwriting here so Tyler the Creator Igor while it is not a typical Tyler project in a lot of respects in my view I think it is his best one next I want to give a shout to the noose louse and Malone album a quiet far well if you guys are into instrumental hip hop experimental music noise drone sound collage plunder phonics this album brings all of that it is at a very strange crossroads of influences and ideas that you typically don't hear in the underground what slaps and pulls together and how he pulls it together is incredibly refreshing on this thing and I very much see his work on this project as being like the next logical step past this era where we are dealing with a lot of wonky music with a lot of lo-fi hip-hop with a lot of instrumental hip-hop with a lot of what has come out of the brain feeder camp over the years this is very much post the J Dilla's and post the Mad Libs and bringing a lot of that sound and a lot of those ideas into hopefully a more experimental era the aesthetic of this album overall is not too much unlike Earl's latest some rap songs so you know if you're very much into that record I think you'll probably enjoy a great deal of what's here if you don't mind hearing that fed through a much more abstract lens and finally I want to give a mention to the latest king gizzard and the lizard wizard album fishing for fishies flawed album there are some tracks that do leave a lot to be desired but I have quite a bit of admiration for this project not only for its environmentalist Vista Vista themes but also the way the band embraces boogie woogie rock and boogie blues on this project - not something I've heard a younger band embrace for a very very long time and King gizzard not only kill it with that sound on quite a few tracks but they put a very unique spin on it as well doing everything from kind of weirding up maybe a song or sound idea that you might catch on a Fleetwood Mac album - literally like throwing in robot vocals and progressive synths and a whole host of other things on the tracks I boogie so very weird very risky album certainly one of the most out-there projects from King gizzard in my view even if I think they kind of flew a bit too close to the Sun on this one and made a few difficult to digest choices along the way but that's pretty much gonna be it for this great album segment those records again don't let them slip by you my reviews for them are linked down below check them out for yourself and ya-ya-ya-ya-ya let me know what some of your favorite records have been from this past month and transition have you given any of these albums a listen did you love him did you hate him but would you rate him you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana great albums for the month may 20 19 forever 
lEVXXtQUiXU,hi everyone weep the me weep Tanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new full of hell album weeping choir for over a decade now these guys have been a jack-of-all-trades in extreme music violently blending together elements of sludge and grindcore and noise death metal and power violence to all until it becomes this dizzying vortex of rifts and drums and demonic screams the band has been building up a large discography of albums and splits EPS and collaborations and they've come through with some impressive highlights along the way what stands out to me most personally are some of the collaborations they've done with the body as well as noise legend MERS bell while these albums are perfect they usually feature full of Hell being pushed out of their comfort zone and lending their powerfully heavy and blistering sound to some very strange and exciting experiments the band's course studio albums though I'm yet to be blown away by either because the band's performances hit like a noisy blizzard of chaos that's difficult to decipher or the band's sound just comes off as like this generically heavy riff fest where they're not putting their own distinct flair on any one style of extreme rock it's just kind of an amalgamation of everything and the combination of sounds and styles I guess is the thrill I mean the band is easily one of the most consistent in power violence this decade there's no question about that but outside of this niche genre albums such as trumpeting ecstasy haven't been much more to me other than a short shot of adrenaline so I went into weeping choir wondering if something within this 25-minute album would really leave an impression on me and even though there are definitely some low points on this record as well as some forgettable ones to this album does contain some of this band's most distinct songs and most exciting style combinations yet we have the track Aria of jeweled tears where the passages of shrill screams and blast beats contrasts really well with the pummeling drums and bright shocks of guitar it sounds like a combination of black metal and death grind and with the manic vocal passage the end and the shot of straight dissonance and noise it's a pretty exciting track then there's the track armory of obsidian glass which features these heavy dumi riffs then there's the blood-curdling screams which are enhanced by this group of haunting howling vocals it's like listening to a chorus of tortured soul sing backup for a band of demons it's also the longest track on this album at 7 minutes most likely one of the longer cuts full of Hell has ever put out and given how short this record is this one track takes up almost two-thirds of the album's runtime still despite it being nowhere near as brief as every other track here it is hellish it is despondent it is heavy it's great and it pretty much fits in with the overall aesthetic of the album there are also some triumphant chord changes at the very end of the track it's almost post rock Ian in a way it's like this portion of the song was inspired by death Heaven's sunbather there's also the track thundering hammers which features these chunky heavy demented breakdown riffs just circling in this mosh pit like cycle of hideous screams and growls and once the band starts throwing in sour and dissonant shots of guitar the track becomes oddly catchy meanwhile the track silmaril is absolutely vile it features a somewhat generic start but eventually the track shifts into these bum-bum-bum-bum-bum riffs with very deep guttural growls it's like the band suddenly makes a transition into this brutal death metal passage I mean we're literally just a few steps away from the vocals on this cut sounding like a toilet flushing or a pig swallowing its own vomit I also like the scorching distortion laced into the riffs on the track angels gather here the mutants screams and grooves on this track definitely leave an impression as well and toward the end of the cut there suddenly like this industrial heavy very basic percussion flying in it's kind of code orange ish but you know then there are tracks on this thing like downward and haunted arches as well as the opener that really just go by without doing anything of note even if I do think some of the breakneck transitions and stylistic combinations are kind of impressive and while I admire the band's commit to noise and some of the harshest sounds coming out of these genres the track rainbow coil is about as tedious as it comes it is a three-minute noise piece that goes pretty much nowhere it's not stimulating at all and it totally kills the momentum of the overall album I think weeping choir is another decent album from full of hell nothing more nothing less there are certainly a handful of highlights on this thing but a lot of other cuts here are just pretty forgettable and honestly an album this short cannot afford to have duds cannot afford to have moments that aren't leaving a lasting impression on you I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it but would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry at the Bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or they link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana full of hell we've been choir of forever 
0Q6NiItmGqo,hi everyone Internet traffic here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Steve Lacey album Apollo 21 this is the debut full-length album of multi-instrumentalist DIY producer wiz songwriter key member of the internet mr. Steve Lacey who has been operating in the music industry for a while now but since making the effort to define himself more as a solo artist there's been a lot more attention on him he's also nabbed some pretty impressive production credits with the likes of Kendrick Lamar and J Cole and goldlink as well as Denzel curry he recently landed himself in the feature list of the latest Vampire Weekend record to lacy style on his new album isn't too much unlike what we've heard him put out so far in the Internet on his demo EP a few years ago he's orchestrating tracks that are equal parts funk and soul and R&B but with a slightly absurd or weird or psychedelic twist in comparison with his previous output especially with the internet the music on Apollo 21 is maybe more personality driven maybe some of the instrumental choices he makes Herbet quirkier more playful that being said while I guess this album is Lacey's biggest and most professional project yet it still pretty much sounds demo quality it's like a really long demo a lot of the mixes on this thing are dry they are flat the songwriting is really haphazard much of the time these tracks feel like they're rooted in a quirky or a funny idea that he drew up in a door or something that he just kind of rift out on his bass or his guitar so many moments on here offer so little in terms of a compelling song you have the whimpering slow jam on lay me down which has the stuttering hi-hats these sensual descending guitar chords it's a pretty interesting vibe but the appeal of it melts away pretty quickly once you realize how tedious and repetitive the songwriting is and this is not the only track on this record that is so repetitive it feels like I'm trapped in a prison I can't wait to get out of I'm counting down each second like it's it's a month the song inside is certainly guilty of this inside inside tell me is it inside the track guide does feature a very fun bass and drum loop but when the song does transition out of the section all Steve offers us is this really stringy guitar passage some weak falsetto vocals it sounds like something that should be building up to a chorus but but there's not really one there all in all this track sounds like Pharrell doing a really bad Rick James impression and even when Steve Lacey does come through with a compelling song idea he does something like Niek habit by making it criminally short like on the track basement Jack or the track like me which is a very compelling song about being different being bisexual and struggling with that but the track is nine minutes long and after the core song Steve unnecessarily guides listeners through these random musical passages after literal dead silence does not connect to the previous musical passage at all it feels like one of those ending cuts on an old CD from the 2000s where a band Dick's around for a few minutes in the studio after five minutes of pure silence except this is the second song on the record the track hate coming down does have an interesting song at the core of it but the very nasally and weak lead vocals leave a lot to be desired the track in lust We Trust literally just sounds like a very bad guitar demo with some weak falsetto singing on top although I do like how absurd the lyrics are about wanting love but then also wanting to sleep in this person's car yeah just to sleep in the car one of the best written songs on this record is no question love to fast but even the instrumental execution here is really sloppy it basically sounds like a reference track that you would hand to another artist so they could bring it to the studio and do something interesting with it and of course as I'm complaining about the sound quality of this album I am open to alternative styles of mixing I am open to lo-fi music but this doesn't even feel loaf I the sounds of the instrumentation here just come off very plain and raw and untouched like Steve just play the instrumentation assemble the beats and then just didn't really want to do anything with it beyond that outside of maybe adding a touch of reverb occasionally I mean I'm not trying to knock Steve Lacey's talents because I have been impressed with his work before on his demo on his production credits but for whatever reason the quality standards that were applied to that stuff don't seem to have carried over on to Apollo this thing just feels like a demo masquerading as an album and asking fans to listen to 43 minutes of barely finished ideas is a big ask I mean if you're such a super fan of Steve Lacey that none of that even matters and you can easily see past the blemishes and a half-baked songs on this project you will most likely enjoy it but if you're looking for a record that is more fleshed out and substantive and well produced you are probably going to want to go somewhere else I'm feeling a light too decent 3 on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like feel like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell is well over here

Qu16IKIAjaw,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week the room is obviously a different color right now I got things going on in my life guys things are happening in my life that are not just music related I I do things I do things other than making content on the Internet why do you think I have a screwdriver on my desk over here okay why do you think I got a screwdriver but still that has not changed the fact that we are sponsored by the good people over at the ridge they make these nifty metal plated wallets money clip or strap on the back they hold your cards quite nicely been rocking mine for months now it's still holding up get your own join the minimalist wallet revolution destroy and replace your disgusting leather bulky wallet that you were still hanging on to God why using the link down below use promo code melon to get 10% off and also down there are our Amazon and turntable lab associate links especially that turntable a blink hit that one up get a colorful pressing of a record we have reviewed on the channel we get kicked back from it supports the channel supports the segment treat yourself and here we are with the worst tracks of the week quite a few this week it has not been the most positive week there they're great tracks this week don't get me wrong there are great tracks but a lot of trash first ah this new tuflow song this new tub low song which I am not very into at all it's it's been a while since I have covered Avalos music this new track over here glad he's gone I do appreciate the sentiment of Independence on this song that the feeling of this guy was a dick I don't need him anymore but the song is subpar it's this boring someone unselfie Asian of pop and hip hop and the music video is is demented in a way where it just kind of makes me worry about tablo's well-being makes me worry moving on from there we have a new tepid song from Noel Gallagher's high flow birds were handling rows it is just a very basic and completely thankless piece of over the hill rock and roll with kind of a psychedelic twist to it not much in the way of flavor or excitement on this one but no surprise there moving on we have Miley Cyrus with the track cattitude featuring roof which is it's a it's a hot mess rip up up up up up Miley is wrapping her foghorn voice the way her voice is mixed the instrumental while this track is featured on a small EP and you know it's not as bad and over-the-top and overblown is like dead pets we are reaching like dead pets level of levels of awfulness here so a new Miley Cyrus project out now cattitude is a terrible song on it moving on from there we have a brand new track from a project by the name of ideal Seraphin is the name of this cut it is spearheaded or at least it at least includes a hunter Hunter hunter hunter Hendricks who you guys might remember from the Amandla dodgy and from what I had read sort of over an Instagram description this track features elements of trap but also gent it's got a bit of a prog metal vibe as well there are some compositional elements of this track that I think are ok but the production is just way too much of a trainwreck and the vocals leave a lot to be desired you know I want to see some of the cool things going on on this track but they're just too many like negatives working against it that I would love to see smooth it over on a on a future song though I am loving I am loving those those natural camo boots in the shot that's that's quite nice moving on from there here vapor Gaz Diplo and Charli XCX spicy is the name of their new collaborative track over here and it's kind of a remix kind of a flip kind of a cover of the the the Spice Girls song tell me what you want and I don't I don't know man it's a it's a bit of a hot mess I'm not sure what else to say about it I mean it's it's a little uh I I want to see or rather that the track is want to be what I want to say I wanted to get that title right there but I wanted to say it's it's it's got a bit of a sea Punk vibe to it I don't know just at least on the music video front it's the some of the vocal processing and manipulations and effects on Charlie's singing just makes it sound terrible the the original structure of the track isn't even intact which is why I kind of say it's a bit of a remix even though there is like original production in original singing going into the track which would make you think it's a cover but it almost feels like they're just trying to turn it into like a track that would play over well like an EDM festival or something like that yeah it's it's a bit of a train wreck and and I think you know just kind of ruins the song honestly as much as I do like Charlie we also have another track from Damon Albarn's Africa Express become the tiger featuring subo as well as mr. Jukes and another song in from this new project and I'm still scratching my head like what exactly justifies this project being named Africa Express I don't know I mean obviously some of the collaborators are from there but it mostly just seems like really boring electronic pop with without much in the way of like very many international flavors going on in the production in much of much of anything really yeah I don't know I I really don't know I guess I'm just confused maybe I'm buying a bit too much in the name and rather maybe I'm buying a bit too much in too and it's it's distracting me away from what I really should be focusing on but honestly even out of the context of the name I I don't think the production I don't think the song is very good I don't think the vocals are very compelling I just feel like a little Africa Express thing just throws in this added element of huh like why I mean you know as someone who has long been a fan of afro funk and afro jazz and afro beat music and so on and so forth maybe I'm not as into the the current wave of what a lot of people talk about is as afro beats and so on and so forth but uh you know artists like Fela Kuti and so on and so forth I'm uh yeah not really a vibin with what's going on here and again the name just kind of confuses me it sort of makes me think I'm gonna get one thing and I get an entirely different thing I don't know let's move on to the tracks let's move on to the artists that I thought were kind of man certainly worth pointing at certainly worth shouting out but not really blown me away or anything first off white Reaper they have come through with a brand new track over here might be right it is a power pop rager maybe not much in the way of personality but if you are a hardcore like old-school Weezer fan I think you will get into what the band are delivering here the band is delivering here quite a bit moving on from there the voids with Julian Casablancas they have come through with a brand new cut as well the title of this one is the eternal town they actually features some co-production from Mac DeMarco and it is honestly a bit of a hot mess in my view in terms of the vocals the songwriting and the production just sounds like a bit of a clusterfuck even if there are like some chord progressions and some vocals on the part of Julian that I do think shines through a bit even though again some of the auto-tune on his voice just really turns it into aha mess a squad b of main attractions fame has a new project out which i guess has been produced by none other than a little bee which is a kind of legendary I think this debut cut over here that was released on the social media is pretty cool if you guys want to find out more info and in here the rest of the project it's linked down below squatter's vocal performance here is rapping didn't blow me away or anything but the production is actually kind of nuts with all the different sax Lee it's kind of thrown over each other so perhaps a little beyond uh I guess uh having a hand in this project and helping it come together the new single from Rosalia I'm a little underwhelmed by it mostly feels like she's trying to take her mainstream flamenco pop sound and try to apply her own version of a Beyonce song to it it sounds like she's trying to do a Beyonce track just honestly it's what it pretty much seems like she's trying to do not only from the tune of the song but the vibe of the music video as well and and I can't say I think it's going over all that well pretty much this feels like a Beyonce ripoff with you know of course those like claps going on in the background and stuff and and vocally I think she's kind of punching under her weight too like she does not go as hard vocally on this cut as she has on a lot of her most recent material maybe because I feel like those kinds of vocals that you know you find her delivering on some of her more traditional cuts maybe are fitting for this kind of song is kind of instrumental but still it's it's a little disappointing to hear Rosalia singing in a fashion that just seems a very middle-of-the-road and very soso right moving on from there we have a brand new track from a group by the name of pi pi which are featured on i want to say king gizzards label and of course because of that you're going to hear you know some psych rock here it's pretty drippy it's pretty sweet it's pretty quiet of scopic it's a little quirky as well not too in love with the vocals or anything but I think the instrumental backdrop is uh is quite nice for the psyche revivalists out there that can't get enough of the sound moving on from there bachata me has a brand new single out which is titled lately it's not one of the groovier or funky Singles the group has ever had but I still think it comes together pretty well don't really have anything too negative to say about it outside of you know it's just a little underwhelming but if you're looking for uh some some very light easygoing guitar-driven pop with a sweet lead vocal and some pretty pristine production give this one a shot give it a shot give it a listen we're not from there we have another single from none other than Mark Ronson find you again featuring Camila Cabello this is definitely one of the more promising singles that has been released from his album so far but he's been releasing track after track after track week after week after week by the time this thing comes out there's not going to be anything left up to the imagination and it's just gonna be BAM we've pretty much heard most if not all of the record but still I thought cabela's vocals on this one we're fine in the tune was certainly more solid than that of his past couple of singles so I'll give it to him give it to him and Jay Paul has come through with two brand-new singles people are like hoping and praying new project new album is on the way the demos record that leaked of his online several years ago maybe longer than that at this point I can't entirely recall I apologize with the demos project that dropped a while ago on Bandcamp that he eventually said wasn't his or rather he said that he did not upload it it was his music but he did not upload it himself somebody else did he has released that online people can seek that project out pay what they want for it download it and in addition to that as I said he's dropped two new tracks do you love her now and he and I know a lot of people have been waiting a long time for new Jay Paul music dude could have been like the new wave the new face of pop at R&B music and so on and so forth and honestly I just find these tracks frustratingly tedious and the lead vocals are incredibly weak production is a little lifeless I do think there are some cool artsy elements to it that I find admirable but for the most part I just think these two tracks are very very so-so moving on from there Hot Chip has a brand new cut out that I think takes a little too longer really kind of get all cylinders firing and even when it eventually does it's not so much like you know fulfilling and gratifying and groovy it's it's more just like kind of a noisy cacophonous climax which I don't think Hot Chip pulls off as many other groups out there but if you're into a pop tune with a linear direction and some very sweet and tender and the other word I'm looking for is is somewhat vulnerable lead vocals melody of love is certainly worth a listen and cardi B her new track over here press which I reviewed on the Fantana channel I do think has some admirable qualities to it but cardi getting in trouble and causing headlines and the press is obsessed with her so on and so forth I feel like she doesn't really dive into that concept all that deeply and she doesn't really give the full story either it's mostly just another reason for her to brag that she gains attention and and you know media outlets are trying to cover every single thing that she does is really you know all this track kind of adds up to and let's get into the best tracks to the week the tracks that really kind of blew me away the tracks that are certainly left an impression on me the tracks that I am uh you know looking looking forward to what they're leading to first we have a brand new cut from none other than trippy Road under enemy arms which is attached to a ridiculous music video I would not pay too much attention to it would not pay too much attention to that but the tune itself is is one of his better song it's one of his better produced and I don't just looking forward to hearing him kind of carry the torch continue to carry the torch for a for that for that emo trap sound you know because it's it is kind of emotional it does hit hard it is aggressive it is uh crying on the inside and I'm liking it quite a bit Sufjan Stevens has put out two brand-new cuts apparently in in honor of Pride Month love yourself and with my whole heart are two very sweet songs from him with your art is uncharacteristically poppy at least it's been a while since sue Fiona's drop music in his catalogue that is this poppy in this groovy in this sweet to the ear upon first listen meanwhile love yourself is a much older song from him but the way that he updates it with this instrumental or here is that it kinda sounds like a postal service song and not not a bad thing you know not a bad thing necessarily it's uh it's it's kind of sweet to hear I'm kind of pull off that sound pretty well so for you looking for some very easygoing synth pop and indie tronic music leaves to attract a certain worth here worth your time sleater-kinney has come through with a brand new single new album on the way produced by saint vincent okay so that's pretty exciting and yes I am absolutely loving the fact that this single brings back Slater Kenny like with the woods kind of diving into some more daring sounds and production it doesn't sound like heavy and noisy like the woods or anything like that I'm not saying that they're going back to the sounds of the woods it's just that you know for a long time I've been wanting Slater Kenny to go back into a more experimental direction you know take a few more risks and and certainly they are doing that on this this brand-new cut over here it hits hard since worked into the track our great Carrie Brownstein vocals are super over-the-top the guitar the the guitars are raw as hell and I think the the phone view of the music video is pretty creative and done well to also want to give a shout out to poppy who has a brand new cut out featuring the fever 333 if you guys remember my review of her last album we did talk about some of the tracks on that record that featured like a bit of a new metal element and it seems that she is coming to us with that direction even more she's going further in that direction scary mask is in the name of this cut over here and once more we are hearing poppy transition from these light airy kind of dramatic verses where she's singing with a very pillowy voice then all of a sudden we transition to these heavy screaming riff packed like hardcore and metal passages that are a little thrashy there are a little new metal some vocals from the fever as well come in and kind of just like back it up and just make it even more aggressive I don't know I'm just loving it I think this combination of pop and and and new metal music and alternative metal and extreme and industrial metal is is the way to go I think it's a bearing out some some interesting tracks of interesting music moving out from there shout out to Chong the nomads nothing else featuring Flint Eastwood brand new cut over here pretty vocals on this track awesome beat Chung nomads is the total package she can produce she can write she can sing she can get a feature onto a track structure at all make it all work again total package and I don't know I just will tell you guys if you listen to any track in this bunch make it this track because I feel like she's not getting as much attention as she deserves and her talent is pretty apparent on first introduction incredibly apparent honestly moving on from there we have another brand-new song from King gizzard and the lizard wizard self-immolate is the name of this cut and it's it's funny the song has reminded me before the release of the last king gizzard album the band dropped another track attached to a music video of a single where they were all in jumpsuits this track is well attached to a music video where the band is all in jumpsuits it's crazy it's off-the-wall and just like with the song attached to that music video which did not make it on to fishing for fishies for obvious stylistic reasons because it didn't really fit into the Boogie vibe of that record but still just like with that track this song over here self-immolate is the band going thrash metal it's the band going fresh metal and I don't know it's just as good as the last track so our king gizzard here essentially gearing up for a thrash metal album I hope so because the material so far is sounding great so I don't know I'm just gonna just gonna leave it to that it kicks fucking ass Katy Perry come through with another new signal never really over and it slaps it's great it's actually one of her best singles in a long time I feel like to get to that point though not only is the tune good not only is the instrumental great and her vocal performance is pretty Stein too but to get here I feel like she's very very very very very much taking a page out of the Carly Rae Jepsen playbook where you've got this very modern punchy production very sweet and you know well arranged song but a lot of the synth Tambor's and some of the percussive elements of the track throw it back to the 80s throw it back to new wave throw it back to synth pop you know she's not doing like a tainted love or anything like that it's it's not you know she's not throwing it back that hard I wouldn't say there's like a you know a supreme element of nostalgia going on here or anything like that but still like a lot of those melodic and aesthetic foundational elements tacked into this track in a creative but subtle way you know subtle set it's the nostalgia isn't the first thing that hits you feels very 80s you know so I think I'll just leave it at that again track slaps track is great tracks amazing definitely one of the better pop tunes I've heard this year Freddie Gibbs in Madlib new track out new music video out crime pays bandana on the way it is June it's coming out in June this month bandana is dropping and smooth soulful hip hop grimy lyrics Freddie flows flows flows flows flows mad lib and Freddie just seem to continue to bring the best out in each other and Charles Bradley posthumous album on the way new track Lucifer for whatever reason every teaser cut I have heard from this forthcoming Charlie Charles Bradley record even though I haven't really been all that crazy about the man's music previously every track teasing that this album is freaking fire I don't know what to say and this this new track over here Lucifer is absolutely chilling in terms of its its message its themes and also Bradley's vocal performance to instrumental is dramatic as well definitely you know loving the the dark sort of take on soul music that he and his band members took on this track it's a that's pretty moving and burial has a brand-new track out as well twelve inch on the way burial yeah it's it's not a whole album it's not an EP and the the version of this track that you're most likely going to hear at this point is like a radio rip so the sound quality does leave a little bit to be desired and while this track is a lot busier I think it doesn't have as much open space and you know atmosphere as you know any cutoff of untrue I do like the driving busy pulsating beat some of the vocal effects on the samples are maybe a little annoying but again I feel like the sound quality or the things about the sound of this track that bugged me or even that I think are great you know I can't fully make a judgment call on until I hear like the actual 12-inch audio quality version of the song because this radio rip that's floating around the internet again it doesn't sound like you know altogether doesn't sound all there but still even with what you know is presented it's it's very impressive and you know I guess you could say it doesn't necessarily blow anything that is his classic stuff out of the water doesn't see him moving into you know super different direction or anything like that but I don't know I guess in comparison with his past three or four songs they use released if I can remember correctly because his output is so spotty I think I've liked this one the most but you know don't quote me on that I guess still I ended up enjoying it overall obviously this is in the best track section alright Adam Green freeze my love new single from him new album on the way absolutely loved it think his ism is on point the strings all over the instrumental here is lovely The Dude's approach to art pop and chamber pop certainly puts him in another league than a lot of other songwriters maybe his quirk and maybe his somewhat understated delivery isn't for everybody and neither is a sense of humor but still it definitely is for me I've been enjoying this man's work since you know Moldy Peaches and everything like that and it's definitely cool to see him continue to grow and progress even if he does you know not stay engaged as often I was as often as I would like him to when he does pop up you know it's usually to say or do something interesting so freeze my love definitely a great new track from Adam Green and that has been the weekly track roundup everybody that has been the weekly track roundup thank all of you very

3UetWwNf9ms,this dj khaled album it's not good father of Asad DJ Khaled new album DJ music industry Titan social media star living meme you know who he is he has a new record out and many of you may come into this video not at all surprised that that it's not good but it really is it really truly is not very good at all and it's somewhat maddening who DJ Khaled is and what exactly he does it's pretty well-established at this point even if there are some people who still look at and they're like wait wait what what what is he is he is he producing no that's not what DJ Khaled is or what he does he's more da curator of sorts a mover a shaker a director somebody who basically grabs and funds a bunch of rappers and singers and producers coming together on a track of his imagining and they just kind of you know have at it they all take part somehow a song just comes out of it and sometimes it's actually a hit song and when dj khaled does manage to masterminds a track that climbs up the charts I mean I have all the respect and understanding in the world for the dude and what he does but the thing is dj khaled himself is is not exactly a singer he's not exactly a songwriter and as a result of that he does tend to put out a lot of BS and I think that's especially the case on this new album over here it is very trendy right now for rappers to be guiding these large-scale very collaborative projects that involve a lot of input from a lot of different people Kanye West and Tyler the Creator and ASAP Rocky and so on and so forth Travis Scott is well cannot forget Travis but the thing is that's been dj khaled mo since like forever maybe I'm more of a microscale maybe he's more of a singles man than an albums man but still it's it's what he does however the quality of the songs on this new project they are awful they are terrible there are tracks on this thing that there is just no rhyme or reason to them they are a total fucking traffic jam the opening track is a key example of there's so many performers so many singers the track is like a reggae flip and it's a total goddamn mess it's like in a perpetual state of booting up and introducing like it never reaches a moment where it feels like okay the song has officially started you have that you have tracks on here that are merely passable and feature a very generic trap instrumental and a couple of lyrical performances from people who really should be spending their time elsewhere cardi B and 21 savage on the track wish wish Travis Scott and post Malone on the track celebrate got to highlight the fact that Travis's hook on this one is again he's been dropping a lot of garbage lately on his features and I mean it's not hard to see why the dudes probably paid tons of money just to show up and vocally riff with some auto-tune and reverb on his voice if that's what I was getting paid to do that's what I do to the track big boy talk featuring Jeezy and Rick Ross isn't bad either feels like a bling era throwback some decent performances from both of these guys but it's still a criminally short and under written track that there's not really much at the core of outside of hey I've paid these two guys to appear on a song and I've gotten a random instrumental under it here you go then their songs on here where dj khaled has had past successes with these artists in almost the same genetic makeup and it's like he's just trying to see if lightning will strike twice in the same spot like on the song top off with jay-z and future and Beyonce Khaled already did this track he has I got the keys but the song is never going to be a hit because the future feature sucks and the mixes shit we also had the song no-brainer with Justin Bieber chance the rapper and quavo does it sound familiar yes he had that same exact lineup sans little Wayne on the track I'm the one which is an infinitely better track not only because the hook is pretty sweet the instrumental is better too but it was also kind of cute and novel the first time around hearing them all together now it's just like why are we here again there are some other tracks here where the combination of features doesn't really make any goddamn sense freaking you with little Wayne and gonna is absolutely redundant and totally pointless meanwhile Meek Mill and little baby on whether the storm I will give it to me his performance and his lyrics on this track are pretty invigorating pretty great he's definitely a breath of fresh air on this album but he makes absolutely no sense with little baby on a song they have two totally different styles that are not compliment it's just a combination of two dudes who are popular by a man who doesn't really seem to have much in the way of taste when it comes to combining people if Khalid applied his talents for assembling people together on this album - let's say romantic matchmaking he would create some of the worst relationships in all of human history for sure there are a few bright spots on the record the Cee Lo nas coupling on a track here is pretty great and the Nipsey Hussle feature and the John Legend hook on the song higher is actually great nipsey's lyrics and his performance here are heartfelt John Legend's vocals are incredible the grand piano infuse instrumental is glamorous its powerful its uplifting but outside of that I can't really say anything nice or interesting about any of these tracks jealous with Chris Brown is absolutely generic the song holy ground like the intro cut is hugely inspired by reggae music but it's I guess one of the better Tunes on here comparatively I still think some of the vocals are slightly rough and the production is kind of cheap but it's it's not as bad as that goddamn post Malone and Travis cut I guess yeah this this thing is really a hot mess and I'm not sure what to say about it there's very little in terms of anything likeable and enjoyable on this project I didn't even get into the track with scissor which is literally just scissor vocally riffing over the goddamn instrumental - miss Jackson but it's not the authentic instrumental it's like some kind of terrible bastardized version of it it's like what you would get if you went into YouTube and typed Outkast type B but yeah that's garbage as well which I don't put on scissor I don't think it's scissors fault the song is terrible and I don't think the responsibilities of these songs being bad is is put on any one of the features here necess Sara Lee most of them are either just showing up for the check or phoning it in or they're just here for like the songwriting credit or something it's dj khaled that has assembled this musical Frankenstein monster and thrown his goddamn name on it I think this record is reflective of a few different things that I'll say right here one I will forever be surprised by how great the industry is at thrusting mediocrity up and I'm not talking about the same kind of artistic mediocrity that might drive a Taylor Swift song no this is really like on a new level it's a different kind it's really no different than Donald Trump like slapping the Trump name on a fucking ugly-ass building that's literally what dj khaled does but just on a musical level because he didn't build the building he didn't draw up the architecture he just passes the buck on that over to people who clearly don't care all that much about the artistic integrity of what they're making it's really more about how relevant the song is going to be or whether or not the track is going to sell so you know you just appear on a song from a dj khaled record because it's it's truly no skin off your ass and you'll probably be paid pretty nicely to do it so whatever yeah this this album it's it's it's not good 
VUND2yZH6UQ,hi everyone missiny fit Stano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flying Lotus album flame agura this is the long awaited sixth album from legendary producer Stephen Ellison aka Flying Lotus a lot of anticipation for this one for me mostly because I've been enjoying flying lotuses music for a long time since the days of Los Angeles which is over ten years old at this point and that's very weird to think of so I'll stop that now Ellison's music not only revitalized recontextualized and reinvented the dynamics of instrumental hip hop he was vital in the popularization and inception of the wonky genre and in a very short period of time founded a groundbreaking label brain feeder records and inspired an entire generation of left-field producers and rappers it's also pretty amazing that he's been able to evolve so boldly from one record to the next the trailblazing Los Angeles which saw Ellison crafting this hypnotic inspiring lo-fi hiphop way before anybody was anime studying to it the progressive and otherworldly Kozma grandma considered by most of his fans to be his masterwork you have these subtle and moonlit until the quiet comes which in his discography contrasts very well with the incredibly explosive bold and kaleidoscopic you're dead so where does a man who's always turning up somewhere new go next that's a hard question to answer especially considering the crop of singles and teaser tracks from this record we have an eerie spoken word cut featuring David Lynch songs that have Anderson pack as well as Denzel curry on them where FlyLo can be heard doing his best to sort of put his own spin on an instrumental that really complements their respective styles there's also the matter of surprise appearances from Tara wack as well as Shabazz Palaces and of course some of the usual suspects turn up on this record - like Thundercat so again pretty hype for this thing especially since it's Ellison's longest album yet it's an hour and seven minutes which is spread amongst 27 tracks and now that I have heard it and I am ready to review it I have to say it's flying lotuses weakest album yet ah no it hurts to say it burns the tongue it's like bleach in my mouth I think the easiest way to explain my feelings is that this record completely fails on nearly every front that flying lotuses previous albums succeed on our we handed a cohesive seamless set of tracks that reinforce each other's creativity with a central focus or theme or flow no absolutely not this thing is loaded and just packed with so many random ideas and fillers and detours that there's really no rhyme or reason to much of any of it it's like sitting through a bunch of arbitrary load screens where I'm just waiting for something of substance or significance or interest to pop up compare the dodgy inconsistent progression of this album with the non-stop thrill ride of you're dead and you will hear a night-and-day difference even Los Angeles and when the quiet comes while these records may not have exciting progressions across the entire tracklist they do have focus they are immersive listening to them transports you to another place because these albums have a sense of place whereas this new album just really has no true identity so if Flying Lotus doesn't do that on this record does he at least present us with a new idea direction something groundbreaking I would have to say no to that to this album mostly feels like a hodgepodge of ideas that he's already explored on previous efforts with a few unexpected experiments and features thrown in that are pretty hit or miss I mean you do have the surreal and twisted genius of fires coming with David Lynch the tale told on that track is actually kind of cool and then you have pygmy which sounds okay it's a vibe it's a motif but not much else it's kind of like a bit of a beat Jam a beat chill-out inspired by a jungle sounds relaxation tape say something surprisingly enough is a 3/4 piano and string piece that sounds straight out of the Eastern Bloc it's kind of enchanting kind of elegant and not at all congruent with literally anything on the album the most annoying and tedious thing I've heard in a while definitely goes to yellow-bellied featuring Tierra wack and it's not even Tierra wax somewhat repetitive and absurd performance on the song that ruins if anything it's one of the few appealing things about it no it's actually the rickety-ass instrumental that sounds like something any band camp producer could pull together in about an hour which brings me to my next question is Flying Lotus even living up on this album to the quality standards that he set for himself on every record up until this point am I consistently impressed on this album with the sound play the sound craft of the beat assembly no not really not at all you know it's not the case with every single song on here because the quality and the style of these tracks is so varied and so unpredictable but some of the mixes on this album are god-awful layers of instrumentation that just blog together hideously making it difficult to decipher exactly what's going on the worst offender on this front is easily the intro to Anderson PACs more then there are tracks on this thing where Flying Lotus uses way too much reverb and look on his previous efforts Flying Lotus is no stranger to reverb he uses it but I've never heard him use it to the degree that like a bad indie band that can't write a song does I would say the tracks where he's most guilty of this tend to be the cuts that have some lead vocals front and center Debbie is depressed spontaneous featuring little dragon the George Clinton cut the reverb also feels like it's doing double duty on these tracks - trying to cover up how horrid some of the singing is also 9 carats with Toro y Moi it's difficult to even make out what he's doing vocally because again so much reverb the vocals and the overall sound of the tracker just hollowed-out there's also the matter of some of the instrumentals here not bringing that strong of a groove or packing in sounds that feel really flat and basic and cheap like the track heroes in a half-shell or the very goofy pilgrim side I and given his previous output some of the beats on this thing just feel completely beneath the ff4 instrumental literally sounds like a generic lo-fi hip-hop anime study beat instrumental on a youtube channel and look there's nothing wrong with that sound there's nothing wrong with that style but does fly low put his own spin on it or anything no I mean it's just like a one-minute throw away that should have been left on the cutting room floor it just seems like literally anything is just making it onto this record I mean don't get me wrong there are some beautiful highlights on this thing it's nothing new for Ellison and it's pretty low-key but the track post requisite is a smooth groovy wonky rager with intergalactic sparkly lead melodies sputtering drums jazzy synth chords it's great the track remind you features this very winding and starry and harmonious jazz progression that could if it's somewhere in the cosmic grandma tracklist there are some mind-expanding string arrangements in the second leg of land of honey featuring Solange and the climb featuring Thundercat is great as well even if it is a little guilty of an overuse of reverb it is one of the more solid Tunes on the record here and it could easily go toe-to-toe with any number of highlights from Thundercats past couple of albums there's also a very touching but short instrumental tribute to Mac Miller on this thing - toward the end so there are some very good tracks here but with a lot of them being as short as they are their impressions are not that large and none of them really get a chance to reinforce each other because they're all surrounded with these supremely mediocre cuts it's very sad to say but this album does not present the inexplicable rush of beauty the incomparable attention to detail or the mind expanding explorations in sound that Flying Lotus is known for I'm feeling a light 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is a another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Flying Lotus forever 
s28_I0Hu_Sg,Oh hi everyone who's Annie hi tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rammstein album untitled this is the newest full-length album from one of Germany's biggest bands of all time Rammstein one of my favourite bands when I was younger Rammstein is one of the few groups from my adolescence in my teen years that I could look back on pretty fondly as their biggest projects today like sin should and much her as well as fry so raisa have all aged fairly well you could say the band had a pretty great run from 94 to about 2004 but they have had a hard time staying relevant and cutting edge with the slow fall from grace that new and alternative metal had in the mid and late 2000s as a lot of the Bands fanbase was gained through exposure on traditional media outlets like American rock radio as well as MTV it's actually miraculous the band got as much traction as they did considering their weird alien presentation and the language barrier but I think that just speaks to how good the band's music was during their peak of relevancy they just had this weird knack for dark dramatic dance metal ragers that no other group at the time did I see Rammstein so for record rise arises as a bit of a breaking point I'm not surprised after this album that the band hit a bit of a creative wall it may not be my favorite album from them but it's definitely their heaviest and most crushing to the point where I think they lost their groove a little bit on this album as a lot of the tracks on this thing we're smothered in these somewhat slow arena sized guitar riffs after this project it's not surprising the group would go right into a record like rosenrot where they essentially started penning even slower even more brooding material most of which I could really just take or leave it's not a god-awful album and up until this point Rammstein is yet to release a project that is absolute crap and there were some pretty great instrumental climaxes on this project especially on the cut hilf Mir but without their edgy ER production and dance music roots I wonder how much appeal Rammstein really has for me Rammstein a follow-up album in 2009 liebe East for a Lada is often hailed by fans as like a bit of a return to form but considering the thunderous production as well as instrumental bits like the whistling solo on the track Rodgers hand it's it's pretty much just an extension of the previous two albums but here we are now 10 years later with a new album the band also excited fans with a pretty great debut single from this record Deutschland being no stranger to social commentary as well as taboo subjects of course the single was attached to a very colourful and very controversial music video depicting all these symbolic renditions of Germany's finest hours as well as greatest horrors the lyrics of the song explore the cognitive dissonance of being proud of who you are and where you're from and your heritage but simultaneously acknowledging all the terrible things that may be packed away in your country's history vocally and instrumentally I'd say the song is pretty Rammstein by the numbers with its rave synths and driving kicks and heavy guitars and till Lindemann very theatrical and authoritative voice but still it's easily one of the best written singles the band is released in like two decades radio is also a pretty fun track on the album definitely a poppier take on the band's usual form sounds like something that would have made more sense to release back in 2005 as a last power grab for pop appeal as the modern rock radio well was drying up I love you subtle Kraftwerk influence on the hook of this thing the lyrics are pretty intriguing depicting someone that sounds like they are from East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the music and the radio this person has access to is limited so the music they want to hear on the radio they have to sneak away and listen to it in secret the grand chorus of singers on the track is pretty stunning same thing with the crushing thrash riffs on that same song as well if you've been listening to Rammstein for a while the track Outlander is a song that really you just have to shake your head at it sees the band bringing back the dance music influences of their early years back in a big way but now with a more grand instrumental presentation like on Raisa Raisa the crushing on this track sync up pretty tightly with the 4/4 kick drums the growling bassline the synths on this track kind of looked like something you'd hear out of an EDM festival however the song is attached to this cartoonish and kind of tasteless display of colonialism making it seem like it wasn't really as destructive as it truly was the lyrics of the song they don't seem to deal directly in this though it's more about world travel and sleeping with people that you meet in other countries that speak different languages and again to a newcomer this song in this music video might seem like a uniquely weird perversion or something but if you've been listening to Rammstein for a while you know that just about half their discography is based on some kind of sexual antics and sometimes that can drive them into making a tasteless or a cheap song speaking of which we have the fifth track on this album sex which I'm surprised it's taken Rammstein this long I'm actually kind of blown away we're not a sex part 3 at this point and yeah the song is about sex and lyrically it's about as on-the-nose as you would expect to the point where I'd say it's obnoxiously basic especially with its low brow bar band guitar riffs roaring throughout most of the mix after this point though the band starts whipping out more turgid long-winded ballads like we're back into rosenrot territory and the results are mixed even if we do get tracks such as the harrowing Popa which features some pretty incredible vocals I mean the screams on this thing are throat shredding it's a totally manic performance the heavy drums on this track as well are incredible these synthesizers take on a very eerie John Carpenter ish vibe the following tracks though do get pretty underwhelming though even if some of the singing on diamante is pretty dramatic after that back in my opinion is maybe the weakest and blandest song Rammstein has ever written and recorded the mid paced riffs on here and drums have little to no soul or groove the guitar solo on the track is absolutely boring the synth sound like something out of a bad prog song tattoo instrumentally is another very formulaic track for Rammstein but it does not have the benefit of being one of the better written songs here the lyrics just seemed like a very humdrum poetic tribute to being tattoo not much else however we do have an incredibly twisted closing track on this thing where lyrically it seems like we're being told a story about maybe a kidnapper who sexually abuses their victim and then maybe leaves them to drown in the ocean every single bit of progression in the narrative here is not spelled out exactly so some of it is left up to interpretation I guess but it does seem like a pretty dark and disturbing story and again if you're familiar with Rama Stein's history putting out a track like this at this point on the album is not really all that surprising as unsettling as it is my biggest issue with the track though is really that instrumentally it does leave a lot to be desired it's nearly as bland as every other track on the back end of this project overall I thought this one was a pretty okay return after ten years although I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that it came out just so-so it has been a long time not only since Rammstein has put out an album but also a long time since I think they put out a mind-blowing album yes unfortunately this one in my view does trail off pretty quickly after the first leg and especially around that midpoint so I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link

Be70pP6C4ow,
AzbBTaF45cg,ah hi everyone up the knee Chuck tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Megan the stallion album fever Megan the stallion is in Houston rapper and one that I have a somewhat hard time describing because she pulls a lot of inspiration from many different places for one the album cover over here is very dramatic intricate and obviously inspired by blaxploitation films her unbreakable attitude on a lot of tracks reminds me of legendary female MCS such as little Kim Megan smooth and catchy flows especially the ones that ride along the lower end of her vocal register reminds me so much of Missy Elliott Megan is also a southern rapper through and through which can be heard in the Juicy J feature on this thing through the multiple three 6 mafia references and samples throughout this album which can be heard in the obvious gangsta boo and 'glitch at influence on her delivery on her Rocchi lyrics also Megan's hooks and instrumentals on this thing are pretty straightforward trap from the sub-base to the crisp snares to the rattling triplet high hats but the take megan has on the genre seems way more in touch with its roots than some bastardized internet era version of it Megan's songs are more like something you'd hear blasting out of a slab car or a Houston strip club and not so much like your buddy's soundcloud page as much as the internet has blurred the lines between those two things you could easily slip the song Simon says on this record into a DJ set between songs by Master P and three 6 mafia and Little John and it would just work there's also the matter of Megan's personality her message on the surface it might seem like a lot of threats and posturing and aggression and sex though even without further analysis Megan already shines on all of these fronts she already sounds more ruthless than a great deal of male rappers trying to sound hard on tracks today and she's also an unapologetic freak of the just oozes sexual appeal the only rapper out there right now hitting this hard that is raunchy er than Megan in my opinion is maybe cupcake though a lot of the time cupcakes x-rated lyrics border more on parity especially in the case of tracks like Squidward knows for Megan though her exhibition is more like a serious show of her dominance and power whether she's showing her total control over men or a specific guy or she's showing her lack of need for one like in this one set of bars where he's asking or you try to trap me with like how good the sex is and she's like no no just go leave how to stop but you already knew that even if I brought him to you still couldn't get your boob back I'm gonna argue with you this ain't how we do that he was already mad I'm just adding something to that hey that's cute that's fun that's fun I also love this next set of bars where she might be hearing this dude bare his soul and tell his secrets and she doesn't care but when she's talking about eating her out she's like okay hey hey now we're talking a topic I'm interested in also further down the line when she's sending dudes pictures of somebody else's boobs that's pretty funny too also this next set of bars damn I want some head but I chose the dough instead I can never let a dude fuck me out of my bread ain't no dick alive that could make me lose my mind every dude that done tried still be crying on my line is like some of the catchiest stuff I've heard all year this same track in my opinion also kind of dives into the blaxploitation film theme of the cover with how ridiculous the juxtaposition is on the hook of you hearing Megan wanting to get her a seat but simultaneously blasting this dudes face off with a sawed-off shotgun yeah that's like what a lot of exploitation films are just like sex and violence there's a good chunk of tracks in the tracklist here where the thrust of the song is very much Megan sex drive and her ability to just rap men around her finger or these on cash shit pimping sex talk and then there are spots on this thing where she comes off more cold-blooded than any gangster rapper operating today whether it be hood rat shit or the song weak ass bitch which is a track all about people talking shit on the internet and when you meet them in person you just vaporize them crush them between your fingers megan packs some seriously infectious aggression into this track along with some hilarious one-liners one about rubbing her pussy on a dude's forehead out of disrespect for this this chick it's way out of pocket in the middle of the record Megan does slow it down for one track the track best you ever had and given the aggression given how in your face a great deal of this album is you wouldn't think that this would be Megan strength that she would pull a track like this off well and yet it's somehow one of the best songs on the entire project the short laid-back vocal line on this cut is catchy as hell it's the perfect ear worm the Bee is intoxicatingly groovy with its kick snare pattern as well as the woodwinds sampled in it the lyrics are still pretty rated-r but they're flirty they're fun they're sexy they take on a more romantic tone he say he feel intimidated when he talked to me I got that hardcore but he want that R&B meanwhile the track Simon says is one of a few songs on here that sounds like hundreds of asses shaking all around you in every direction this is also kind of the case for the song dance as well as ratchet Megan's simple but effective hook on this track is absolutely addictive Simon Says put your hands on your feet Simon Says bust it open like a freak no question Megan has contracted whatever virus southern rappers have where they're all just so freaking good at penning these perfectly repetitive but also addictive and they just sear themselves into the back of your brain choruses she comes through with these on nearly every track on this thing especially on money good there's also a lot of very simple but quality song structure building a lot of these songs up to with Megan's verses contrasting very well from her choruses not to mention Megan's delivery on a lot of these tracks is bulletproof as well she's expressive she's mean she's animated she is a total character that just jumps out at you and demands your attention I will say there are a few weak spots in the tracklist here for one the closing track being a freestyle even if it is decent one is a little anticlimactic these songs shake that is far from one of the harder and more memorable tracks in the track listing here not to mention that I think it shares a lot in common instrumentally and vocally with the song cash shit which is a far superior song so shake that pales in comparison and feels redundant the song big drank is a scissor anthem whose tune and instrumental combo is maybe the weakest of the entire record even if once you dive into the lyrics there is certainly something revealed here as Megan is not the person drinking the the purple drank rather it's her boyfriend or her significant other and she doesn't like to see what he turns into when he's on the stuff which frankly is a kind of refreshing point of view given all the lives in the industry we've lost in lives that we've seen ruined due to recreational cough syrup drinking overall I like this project a lot yes sometimes it is a little too on the nose in the case of tracks like ratchet as well as the opener real er songs that are so mean potatoes concept wise you can't really stretch them out all that far but truth be told even though fever doesn't leave a whole lot up to the imagination what it does provide is actually kind of titillating and full of replay power it's irresistible it's fun and even if there aren't a whole lot of in-depth narratives on this record most of what Megan does lyrically it does paint a character portrait one that's pretty bold and powerful and confident but honestly that's all just a side dish to how frickin catchy this album is I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my

4yp-id2UnS4,hi everyone sign Fenice lontano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for a review of the new Pierre born and young nudie record fly mare young nudie in Atlanta rapper with a growing profile and some interesting connections he is the cousin of 21 savage and on this new project over here he is linking up with one of the most in-demand producers in the game right now known for his minimal and funny and subtly psychedelic beats all over playboy car teased I'll it pier born doing double billing on a record with just about any rapper right now is going to gain attention though this is far from the first time he's worked with nudie before as he's given the guy tons of instrumentals on his slimeball mixtape series on his new deal and project the connection between these two guys runs long and deep but honestly I see the relationship as being sort of one-sided as the instrumentals make up for the majority of the appeal the majority of the time on any given nudie song for me nudies greatest strength I guess is that he doesn't distract all that much from the good qualities of the instrumentals peers playful and cute melodies his hypnotic and simple percussion it sort of strikes a vibe but outside of that I don't get what's so interesting about this project nudies flows on this thing aren't exactly coherent or consistent sometimes he's barely even on the beat like blue face but without even a fraction of the charisma he's just another one of these rappers who comes in sounding incredibly faded in the booth I mean it's kind of a giveaway when you put out a mixtape titled faded in the booth and look it's not something I'm inherently against there are plenty of great artists that do it but I don't think it's necessarily to nudies benefit on this record as he's vocally just wandering over every beat here and he's not incoherent in the same way that in a you're a future or a thugger feature might be where the lyrics aren't quite as important as just the feeling of the performance those artists are giving honestly most of what nudie is saying on this project here is pretty easy to read and decipher I say nudies performances on this record are incoherent because he's so far from saying anything notable or anything memorable that he might as well just be speaking in made-up language it's not just a lyrical thing either because his performances his rapping his delivery on this project is shockingly underwhelming sounding high out of his mind on this thing does lead to some moments where he doesn't have that many inhibitions so some weird and funny vocalizations and inflections will kind of slip through but his performances aren't nearly as dynamic or as expressive or as intoxicating energizing as any of the other rappers currently operating in this minimal psychedelic weirdo laying of trap right now playboy cardi being the most obvious comparison not to mention every feature on this thing commands at least two times more attention than he does Megan the stallion - baby little Aussie vert 21 savage across the rest of the record there's not a whole lot to report once you have the formula of the first few tracks you pretty much know what the rest of the album's gonna do the shouty overdubs in the background of the track black hippy white hipster are kind of weird you don't hear that every day the beat on sunflower seeds is particularly sad that certainly makes it stand out in a good way and these synthesizers throughout the track dispatch are warped and eerie they almost sound like something out of the undertale soundtrack I could keep listening but nearly everything that stands out to me on this record has directly to do with the instrumentals and the production honestly I just see this album as another submission in the current paradigm of the skeletal surreal and somewhat trippy trap albums with lyrics that are a little directionless which isn't a bad thing if the songs come out intoxicating if the songs come out exciting but this one is pretty unfulfilled in that regard even though nudie seems pretty off the deep end on a majority of these tracks very little of that actually translates through the songs and his performances though I will say Pierre did kind of kill it on a lot of the instrumentals here even if the incessant producer tags and Jamie Foxx samples he throws all over this thing kind of killed the vibe overall it's fine when it's on but I don't really see what about this record is going to draw listeners back to it once the trend that it's following is over I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this transition have you get in this project to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana young nudie Pierre born of forever 
Ev-XuqyhWk8,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd hope you are doing well and it is time for another edition of our weekly track roundup where I go over tracks that drop over this past week that I thought were pretty good pretty not-so-good let's get into it first I want to give a shout out to once again our continued sponsor on the channel the good people over at Ridge wallet they make these nifty metal-plated minimalist wallets that fit nicely in your front pocket minimalist wallet gang I just want everyone to know that I went on a West Coast tour recently brought this thing with me rocked it the whole way it held up like a brick and yeah you yourself can make the switch today hitting the link down below in the description box use promo code melon do get 10% off your order and yeah that's it also down there are our amazon and turn to the lab associate links if you want to hit those up treat yourself especially the turntable a blank one get a colorful pressing of a record we have covered on the channel we get kicked back from it supports the segment and all that all the reviews and let's get in the worst tracks of the week first off kicking it with yg do not disturb with Kamiya and gez it is like a bland uninteresting version of what he was doing on his still brazii album very sad to hear it given i was hoping for a return to form on his new project and i love that record so much and it's it's just kind of a bit of a loss in my opinion to hear yg going down the watered down and mainstream path because he was he was beginning to grow into a rapper that really had kind of a voice and style of his own I also want to give a shout out to this new and almost completely pointless new collaboration between joiner Lucas and none other than logic Bobby Tarantino himself they rap fast over a generic beat and there's not really much in the way of a lyrical focus in any way shape or form even though the track is titled Isis and there are a few lines that refer that but yeah it's it's just basically fast rippity rap for people who like their hip-hop with a lot of speed but not a whole lot of substance and also the new Ed Sheeran cut featuring a chance the rapper and PNB rock it's absolutely obnoxious trash not really much in the way of composure to it either it's just just a really annoying combination of voices and sounds and styles that I would have rather never heard in my entire life and yet it exists and yet it exists alright let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of math still worth mentioning though first off this new collaborative cut from young thug Jay Cole and Travis Scott surprisingly is a good amount of chemistry between these three on this track and they complement each other pretty well and young thug's performance on the song is really over-the-top and insane the downside is the beat is kind of mediocre and there's not really that much in the way of like a strong song to it or anything like that but still young thug J Cole and Travis Scott on track miraculously kind of makes sense moving on from there a new track from rec and reference this project you guys might remember I've covered before on the channel they've embraced some elements of experimental rock and industrial rock and noise and experimental music as well in the past and this new cut over here is is very much a slow burner very droney very bass heavy very strange not sure entirely what to make of it really but I'm slightly intrigued by this new cut didn't love it I felt that kind of drew on a little bit too long and that its intentions were kind of cloudy but uh but still I guess some of the more experimental noisy bits in the track definitely piqued my interest and and make me wonder where this projects next record is going to go moving out from there a new cut from ty dolla sign featuring J Cole purple purple emoji purple emoji it's a kind of cool and devilish combination of R&B and modern hip-hop nothing too memorable from tie in my opinion not one of his best tunes but it seems to be performing pretty well online moving off from there Steve Lacey whose new track hate CD I'm also going to put in here I'm not going to talk too much about this cut honestly because I do plan on reviewing this new album this week but I definitely wanted to make you guys aware the Steve Lacey of the internet multi-instrumentalist producer a guy who's been getting a lot of praise for some of his production placements on some key hip-hop records over the past few years or so a new record out new album out so try it out give it a shot see what you think of it before I end up talking about it moving on from there the Flaming Lips have a brand new track out as well giant baby is the title of it and it's a pretty strange patience testing but funny new song with some ridiculous lyrics not one of my favorite tunes I think they've ever put out but still pretty entertaining all around moving on from there a track from the band Dungan hope I'm pronouncing that correctly I don't think I've ever covered this group in depth before even though as a psychedelic rock outfit they have been around for quite a while and this new song over here title VAR har du variate is a nice smooth jazzy trippy combination of sounds although it is very middle-of-the-road and light on the ears sort of like elevator music or something like that but it's at least pretty and kaleidoscopic elevator music I'll say that much and also let's give a shout out to a Clara with her new track bags I appreciate a little bit the homegrown bedroom pop aesthetic of her previous cuts but now that it seemed like she's getting a bit more attention and obviously a bit more of a budget behind her music it's like she's just pretty much making straight forward mean potato's average everyday somewhat depressed indie rock and I don't know and in the grander scheme of things in my view it doesn't really stick out nor is the songwriting in my opinion as memorable as some of the viral tracks she has dropped so far but I don't know hoping for songs that are more memorable in the future and instrumental pallets that are a bit more adventurous and quirky this very humdrum guitar percussion vocal combo is not really doing too much for me especially since the the instruments are played so a pathetically you know I feel like it's one thing to have guitars and drums and vocals and it's another thing to have underwhelming guitars and drums and vocals let's move into the tracks that I thought were the best this week the best tracks this week first want to give a shout out to Z loopers a Detroit rapper who is affiliated with Danny Browns bruiser brigade crew he has a brand new track out titled Easter Sunday 97 featuring Earl Sweatshirt which for both of them is is a pretty uplifting and positive track it's kind of interesting to see both of them getting a little nostalgic and kind of positive and a little upbeat and warm-hearted in their performances I wish it was longer that's really my most major complaint Slater has come through with a brand new atmospheric and very strange Britney Spears cover of all things Believe It or Not of the track every time it's actually pretty beautiful and strange if I didn't use that word already or maybe I did either way strange moving out from their mannequin  a project that I have given a shout out before even though it is pretty average power pop sonically I think the lyrics and the vocal delivery are pretty bold and pretty in your face and this new track over here who you are has a lot of attitude and is pretty compelling lyrically narrative Lee a lot of hurt a lot of heartbreak a lot of heartache a lot of emotion being just splattered onto the canvas like blood from someone's slit throat I also want to mention here the new Denzel curry single speed boat didn't love it as much as ricky the previous single to his forthcoming zoo project but but but but but still another melodic hard-hitting banger with compelling charismatic verses and rapping Denzel just continues to kill it and brings a lot of personality and energy and anything else likable that you would want in a hip-hop song to a hip-hop song so yeah shout out to Denzel keep it up moving on from there lingua igniter has a new record on the way that has been getting quite a bit of buzz in the underground music community in the metal community it's coming out via profound lore records I believe it was a year or two ago that her breakthrough record was kind of making the rounds on Bandcamp and was turning a lot of heads for how abrasive and shocking the album was and ever since she has been a kind of blowing a lot of people away with her intense live performances and definitely going to be keeping an eye in an ear out for this new project that she has on the way the title of this new song over here is butcher of the world and it's got some really twisted vocal performances some really unsettling noisy sort of droney bits as well it's kind of heavy its kind of harrowing the back end is definitely not as full as the front end but it's still a pretty intriguing composition and looking forward to seeing where else she goes with her a teaser tracks going forward for this new album movin out from there Flying Lotus has dropped what I think is maybe my favorite track from his album that is now out going to be reviewing as soon not gonna talk too much about this song in length but it is the new track featuring Denzel curry black balloon surprise goes hard Denzel kills it okay not gonna say anything else as I plan on reviewing this very soon move not from there Ezra Furman who's punked out approach to garage rock has been flying under my radar for I guess a little bit he has a new track out here titled calm down aka I should not be alone which is attached to a kind of genius animated music video as well that I like a lot a lot of attitude coming off the vocals in tarz pretty badass performance and yeah just all around a good garage punk tune Esther Rose is also an artist a country artist who has been flying under my radar for a little bit she's got this track out with a music video titled only loving you and it is so freakin cute it is so freaking cute I can't get over how cute it is and it's just a lovely tune as well very earnest and pretty and straightforward vocals on the track a very rich and authentic country instrumentation don't know what else to say about Dada excuse me don't know what else to say about this track other than that it's lovely it's pretty it's wonderful definitely touched me right in the fields also want to give a shout out to this new DJ premier track that dropped a little bit over a week ago I forgot to mention in the last weekly track roundup at headlines featuring Westside gun who's been making quite a bit of buzz lately Conway and Benny DJ Premier brings a pretty heavy and badass beat in his usual style of course throwing it back a little bit Westside gun Conway and Benny brings some tough-as-nails versus Westside guns definitely sticks out the most though do not give this one you know the pass or anything like that you know make sure to hit it up for a hip hop head and also want to give a shout out to this artist over here that I am just now coming upon after maybe seeing her featured a few times along with other artists that I follow on Instagram her name is Bri a runway Tuan is the name of her new track and music video over here it is criminally under traffic there's not a whole lot of views on this song right now and a little head over heels for it her sound and her style is kind of like a combination of hip hop and pop and art pop and a little bit of like noise and industrial in there it's it's um really just kind of strange and intense and freaky but also like lots of energy lots of attitude pretty exciting as well and yeah she just like totally kills it in this song and music video totally slays and I don't know what else to say I think I'll just leave it at that she just kind of seems like a very bold interesting exciting new face whose work I am going to be looking out for given how thrilling this new track was also want to give a shout out to Bill Callahan who has actually dropped six count them six new songs from his like new full-length album coming out very soon the one that stood out to me is the Ballad of the Hulk not nearly as lavish as some of bills productions off of his recent records or anything like that but still very I guess rustic acoustic guitars pretty balladry Bill's deep authoritative voice with its gentle tone and it's just easygoing demeanor kind of spell binds with you know the lyrical twists and turns that he takes on this track shout out to Bill Callahan shout out to Smaug shout out to all of the indie folk weirdos who have somehow made it this far and are still dropping credible and worthwhile records today and that has been it for our weekly track roundup everyone thank you very much for watching you can hit up another video over there in the feature tour next to my head we

vpnfhLVkpLQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for a review of the commercial debut album from injury reserve injury reserve injury reserve hip hop trio native to Arizona it's been a little while now since Richie and grogs and producer Parker Cory began making buzz with their debut mixtape in 2015 live at the dentist's office and at the time when this thing dropped I was blown away by their cutting-edge take on jazz rap as well as their knack for creating both total bangers and introspective sadboy anthems such as kill the vibe the production was consistently visceral and creative and bubbly the bars throughout each track were sometimes witty sometimes conscious sometimes ridiculous sometimes aggressive if there's one thing to know about injury reserve it's that they do not want to be pigeonholed into one thing which is something they've successfully avoided with each new project and this is most likely been for the better even if it's kind of led to the industry not knowing entirely what to make of them one thing's for sure though for injury reserve it's about the music and it's just about the music which showed in their 2016 mixtape floss a project that showed some of the trio's best tracks yet oh shit all this money songs that to this day I am shocked that they sit under a million views on YouTube and the deep cuts on this thing we're even more insane like the trippy industrial banger eeny meeny miny moe or the jittery and head crushing what's goodie with an amazing feature from cakes the killa and the trio's bangers kept coming on their next EP drive it like it's stolen with see you sweat as well as boo boo boom but still even at this point very little in the way of viral acknowledgment of the trio's efforts thankfully nods from the likes of ami-nee as well as this new deal from Loma Vista Records has brought the trio some of the long overdue recognition they deserve and with that they essentially started dropping a new crop of singles in promotion of this new project tracks that were some of the group's most futuristic and conceptual songs to date we have jawbreaker featuring Rico nasty and proto they cut all about fashion and overspending on it in the social media age the song isn't necessarily anti-capitalist or anti looking good or anything like that it's really a song that urges listeners as they express themselves through clothes to forge their own path with that and not mindlessly buy into whatever the most expensive hypebeast trends are just for the sake of fitting in the protein's hook on this track is absolutely unique for a hip-hop song and the RICO nasty verse fits really nicely into the concept of the track meanwhile Parker's instrumental on this track is great it sounds like an international showy abstract piece of music sound tracking a fashion show then there's jailbreak the Tesla which is pretty much about hacking into a Tesla car Parker on this instrumental develops this perfectly glitchy noisy post-industrial deconstructed Club beat makes me feel like I'm being downloaded into the goddamn mainframe Ritchie's first verse on the song sets the tone of the track really well builds the concept up in a witty and entertaining way meanwhile the Amin a feature on the back end is absolutely hilarious these references to Elon taking shrooms and Grimes voice being the GPS referring to himself as a black James Bond and saying your engine go vroom my engine go silence aesthetically the song resembles more like a Sophie track or a PC music single not your average hip hop song which I think just goes to show how unique injury reserved our Corona and lime wasn't a bad taster for the album either it's got an instrumental that sounds like an odd future throwback but there's way better lyricism and lyrical chemistry between Richie and grogs based off the singles alone I was anticipating this was going to be injury reserves most defining musical moment their most groundbreaking record yet but the deep cuts on here tell a slightly different story for one this is the shortest full-length project the trio has put out so far at 38 minutes a chunk of which is padded out with these interlude cuts that don't really add that much to the flow whether you're talking about the QWERTY interlude or the song hello which is a decent idea that I wish was fleshed out into a longer track where the message of this very short cut could be brought home a little bit better then there's the two-minute rap song tutorial which introduces listeners to this monotone dystopian female robot voice introducing separately different parts of a hip-hop song the drums the melody the hook etc it's a cute listen once through but once you know the humor and the progression of the track it's painfully tedious and there's really no reason to hear it ever again even if the example songs shown in the interlude kind of sounds fire in fact I would have rather just had this song there are maybe a few other tracks here as well that I found a little confusing like these song get the fuck up I love how this track busts in with another noisy industrial beat the trio invites cakes the killa on once again to deliver a completely fire verse one that sets the bar for every other feature on the album the first leg of the track is incredible it's amazing but the transition it makes after a minute 30 is a head-scratcher it totally deflates all the momentum the song had going so far sputtering beat Wiebe strings kind of anti-social verses from Richie and grogs it just seems like the weirdest place to put this the Segway wasn't all that great either on top of that the track ends off on a totally sour note with these repeated samples of JPEG mafia just saying get that back up pitched at different levels sometimes it's slow sometimes it's chipmunk but every time it's annoying and not to say that's on JPEG mafia that I'm unhappy with his appearance here I just wish his feature and his vocals were utilized a bit more creatively and even harder pill to swallow in my view in the tracklist here is the song best spot in the house which is a really odd exorcism of emotions especially for Richie as he's rapping about being looked up to by his audience and then not feeling like he's living up to the idolization which i think is a pretty normal reaction for most musicians that find themselves of the fanbase however instead of agonizing over his shortcomings or analyzing this phenomenon on a macro level the track comes off more like a lecture to the fan for I don't know selling themselves short or being dumb for idolizing him or them in the first place which is a really odd tone to take especially since even the most hardcore fans understand that nobody's perfect even their favorite artists but everyone needs inspiration and everyone needs something to aspire to and this phenomenon Ritchie is rapping about is more about what the artist does and who they are as an artist versus who they actually are as a person but this realization seems to elude the songs concept though plus some of the auto-tune vocal breaks on this track just seem really sloppy and tacked on just tossing something in there because there has to be some sort of refrain some sort of hook new Hawaii is another moment on the album that comes in with great intentions but leaves me feeling underwhelmed even if the back end of the track features Ritchie delivering one of the most beautiful and romantic rap verses of this decade he describes these kids he plans to have with his significant other as if they're pieces of art it's kind of beautiful but everything that brought us up to this point is a total and complete snooze fest and not that the guest singers throughout the track especially DRAM are all that bad they're not but the beat on this thing is so skeletal and so bare and so scant it barely supports the song it's just like background noise there are some other tracks on here that I liked though there's the cut wax on featuring Freddie Gibbs not one of the trio's best dark and nocturnal tracks but certainly a good one the heavy drums the massive bass the dreary distant tones and the instrumental are all really nice grogs verse on the track reflects on the difference between being industry successful and personally successful socially rich and financially poor meanwhile the Freddie Gibbs appearance on the track is pretty good he brings an incredible sync up with the flow of the hook and grogs verse and given his previous material on shadow of a doubt the very dark hip-hop songs all over that record he is a perfect fit for this song the song gravy and biscuits isn't bad it's one of the shorter and less developed cuts on here but it's got a fun attitude some very clever wordplay from grog Zant Ritchie and an instrumental that sounds like something Eminem would have rapped on back in the day with like these a playful groovy beats and funny Latin jazz piano samples the song what a year it's been is a noisy and intense retrospective on everything that's brought the group in the short term up to this point where they're on Loma Vista they've got quite a bit of recognition more than they in the past and they are coming out with their new injury reserve album it is the best track here when it comes to exploring the change and stress and depression that has come along with all these shifts in the group's career the opening verse from grogs on this cut is soul-crushing with him talking about being depressed and being in a funk and ghosting his loved ones and so on and so forth the explosion of drums and psychedelic auto-tune in the second leg of the track is incredible it's got a huge like Kanye and Travis got vibe to it and then there's the heartwarming and triumphant closer three-man weave which sees the group off on a positive note much like the song look mama I did it but without as many tears being shed a few vocal jabs from Fonte of little brother Fame which is a sort of funny inclusion on the album given the line from s on your chest where a Richie says big poo is kind of lame but as far as Richie and grogs vs. go I love how they play into all these themes of sports and basketball and how these things used to matter to them when they were younger and I've kind of moved on to music and other aspirations I love that when Richie said he was younger and playing that by hip-hop standards he was Russ decent as good as as Russ the rapper Russ Russell overall it's a decent album not as consistent as dentist office or floss in my opinion sadly not as full of as many futuristic and hard-hitting cuts as I thought it might be due to some of the singles but still what injury reserve has accomplished on injury reserve is a cut above most of what you're gonna find out there in the current rap field today I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry hit the bell as well over here next to my head is another video that you can check out hit that up are the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana injury reserve forever
