bvq9_gEwE9A,thanks beautiful day rooster glass ERDs hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review rusty glass swords rusty is a Glasgow electronic music producer this is his full-length debut which I'm sure coucher chesta has an opinion on maybe they shouldn't left it at out in the rain it's rusty alright so Rusty's glass swords this album is basically like dying and then going the video game heaven the album starts off with these two listening ethereal synthesizers and this really infinite guitar solo and everything is atmospheric and and everything is reverb Dan just huge and an arena sized and it just kind of feels like the start screen to a Super Nintendo game and it really sets the mood on the second track it goes full throttle into a series of songs that just remind me of playing Capcom games on NES and Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis when I was a kid or maybe even doing something like playing Street Fighter 2 turbo on an arcade cab at the local arcade and kicking everyone's butt and getting the high score I didn't even use in any quarters and I'm actually getting Zangief to do a piledriver crazy I mean rusty goes even further to make the link between his music and video games really apparent by even sampling Navi from Zelda's ocarina of time on the 4th track where I'm always hearing hey look there is a really huge video game theme on this album but you will catch a couple more flavors among these tracks there spots here where I'm hearing Juke and dubstep and synth funk it kind of sounds like what might happen if burial and machine drum collaborated with Romeo take the songs surf and after light where you've got all these really jukey repetitive chopped and looped vocal samples these g-funk vocoder vocals and these really really kind of scattered beats twittering away in the background and a lot of these tracks have these really quick fast high energy loud build ups before they drop into a heavy beat like we and then this drop comes in kind of like a dubstep tune but the wobbling bass isn't there a funk beat or a two-step beat is there instead and there are also moments on here on catching a really strong hip-hop flavor like the song City Star where man just just the drum programming really reminds me of something Lex Luger would do maybe I could see somebody like Rick Ross or even waka flocka flame rapping over it maybe what kind of keeps that from happening in my head is that the synthesizers are just way too bright and neon colored and sugary kind of bombastic and I would sum this album up in that word a little bit no matter what kind of style or idea a song on this album is chasing it's always kind of coming out loud and flashy it's like Sonic hedonism but that kind of has a negative side to it for me because it makes this album a little one-dimensional I think you've got all these tracks trying to be as pleasurable as they can as fast as they can and as a result a lot of them use the same exact tricks to go about creating that atmosphere really similar beats really similar layering really similar build ups like the beat em up games like final fight that stuff like this used to soundtrack there's not much of a strategy here these 13 tracks without much variation really all attack from the same angle I think what you get out of this LP has a lot to do with what you go into it looking for this is not your chin scratching electronica album that's really soft and subtle this is louder and brighter but definitely not as trashy or is dumbed down as something you would you would stereotype to be played it at a rave or something like that this is something loud fun an instantaneous for fans of Hudson Mohawke subtract Flying Lotus and the brain feeder crew but a feeling a decent too strong seven on this definitely some highlights off of this thing and rusty undeniably has a nice style going for him what do you think of this do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh rusty forever 
xt8IbWk9eSQ,what if I was like Anthony Fantana hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for a review of the new Feist LP metals this is going to be a kind of weird review because Feist's new album Feist Leslie Feist Canadian singer-songwriter this is her new LP follow-up to the reminder very big record sold hundreds of thousands of copies and launched her into the acclaimed contemporary female singer-songwriters status that she enjoys today and this is a weird feeling because most albums I kind of feel like I listen to them over and over and over and I kind of get to know them just just blanks become filled in slowly one after another and I guess right now I know how I feel about this record I don't really like it but I'm not 100% sure why I do kind of know why I feel like this album drags on forever but it's not because it's quiet it's not because nothing happens actually I think this album is louder than Feist's last LP which also had that you know broke pop chamber pop element to some of the tracks on there but this this LP comes on even heavier with the extra instrumentation so the dragging for me is is definitely not for lack of things occurring and this album is not longer than the last album either what has kind of shifted on this LP is is the mood I know it's been four years about four years and spiced has come out with their last album but it actually kind of feels like 50 because the reminder felt so fresh and so young and just so vibrant to this by comparison is is really dreary worn tired old it's a series of songs that kind of feel like they have nowhere to be and nowhere to go actually I would say this album sounds exactly like the cover looks a really gray desolate landscape there's no life in any direction as far as you can see and there's nothing to look at except a giant wooden F and all I can think is what am I doing here to me a lot of these tracks wander really really wander wander with vocal melodies that that don't feel all that memorable wander aimlessly in the in the sea of instrumentation that's been arranged around these songs also while we're on the instrumentation on this album I think the kind of tired and worn emotions that are showcased on this LP really get out shined by the strings and the horns and the woodwinds it's to the point where I will get really bored with a track until I hear an instrumental swell or something and then some emotion will hit me take the second track for example I think the instrumental swell toward the end of that song is way more interesting than anything that happened to before it in a way this album does feel more mature than the reminder to me definitely definitely but it just kind of makes this album feel old when I'm listening to this album I kind of feel like I'm a four-year-old kid and I'm bugging my grandpa this album to come play let's go let's play yeah let's play yeah yeah and he's all like no I'm watching the crashes rap I long to get up some of you guys may remember my review of how come you never go there a little earlier this year and I'd like that song like by itself I think that's one of Feist's better vocal deliveries on this album and there are other spots on here that don't feel weighted down in all this heavy instrumentation and in a song a focused clear-cut song really kind of shines out I'm thinking of a track like the sixth track bittersweet melodies a lot of the other songs on here don't feel complex or complicated to me they just kind of feel like the Feist I'm usually used to hearing but kind of smothered in molasses while I do like some of these tracks separately I feel like listening to them from really becomes a very tiring gauntlet for me kind of an unrewarding gauntlet in some ways maybe this album is is fitting as a fall album but it's not the kind of picturesque fall day that that one would imagine it's more like a day where all the leaves are dead and have fallen off all the trees and the sky is gray and the wind is blowing hard enough to give you frostbite so yeah I didn't like this I'm kind of feeling like a strong for decent too strong for on this but you know I would love to read somebody's comment below telling me why you like this album or loved it if in fact you didn't love it and and that's it man y'all know this is just my opinion but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana Feist forever you you

QSMwuVqBQeA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an EP review the new James Blake enough Thunder I've reviewed this guy earlier this year English music producer touched down on his self-titled LP I think as far as electronic music goes blake has some of the more interesting ideas out there right now however if his discography so far is is any proof I don't think James Blake likes focusing on one single thing even if that single thing is a good idea and a fresh idea the self-titled LP was much different than the EPS that had come out before it and the LP itself is loaded with a ton of different sounds and styles on there an acoustic guitar ballad piano ballads a dubstep Feist cover drones auto-tune lots of multitrack vocals lots of keyboards he's always trying something different even if that something ends up being not that good or a song that is very unpleasing to his fans I mean look at the order panned single that came out after the self-titled LP which is a kind of alienating transition for anybody who jumped on the bandwagon when they heard songs like the Wilhelm scream sure some people on the internet found out that you could take both sides of that single and combine them into kind of a different song but my point still stands now of course enough Thunder is a different direction to this thing kind of concentrates a little bit on the piano ballad Rhee that was on the self-titled album and if you guys remember from my review that was maybe my least favorite part of the LP the part that kind of left me wanting more where I was really underwhelmed but on here James Blake is making a serious effort to try to improve upon this kind of piano playing singer-songwriter side of him just take the opening track from this with these really lonesome open vast piano chords and vocals there they're both kind of slathered in this atmospheric reverb and the song doesn't really have a clear structure or direction or anything it just kind of like repeats this one melodic idea to the point where it becomes kind of hypnotic like a mantra something that blake was doing on the full-length but there's something kind of off about the track and that's the miscellaneous electronic is kind of surrounding the vocals and and the piano those little low-end rumbles and the and the I feel like these sounds kind of interrupt more than they actually add but the song not long now I think is is the best combination of these two worlds the acoustic piano world and these electronics that Blake is trying to incorporate but the song kind of shoots itself in the foot a little bit toward the end when this beat comes in and it just doesn't feel like it comes together the piano and the vocals kind of remain unchanged the beat just appears and it ends up sounding like two different songs playing at once I just kind of like scrambled and wondered if there was something wrong with my copy of this EP the only songs on this thing that I liked were the straight-up piano and vocal tracks especially a case of you which has some very loving and tender lyrics but of course before I finish this review I have to I have to talk about the song Fall Creek Boys Choir the first track to drop from this EP of course a collaboration with Bon Iver a lot of people were freaking out about this song when it first hit the Internet and I'll give it to him it doesn't sound much like anything else I've heard this year sure it does remind me of of the final moments of bony bear's new album it does remind me of some spots on Blake's full length but this definitely hit a new level of something now first off with this track I like the melody I like the melody a lot actually I think it's the one grand thing about this track the drum fills aren't bad the piano is nice but what's over it is about half a dozen auto-tune Bon Iver voices layered into a couple casserole of ugliness and part of me finds it kind of intriguing but only in like a Frankenstein monster kind of way like this is a serious kind of musical mutant so for me this IP it's it's a kind of a different direction for Blake if you've heard the full length you're not going to be completely surprised by what you hear on this thing it just kind of goes further down a road that he's toyed with before what hurt Blake's full-length album in my opinion is that there were too many moments that felt like just loose sketches and ungroomed ideas this EP a majority of it feels like that so I'm kind of feeling like a strong four to a light five on this thing but what did you guys think of it did you like it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next you have any Fantana James Blake enough Thunder forever 
yxTPfKspFl8,La Dispute Wildlife hello my needle drops Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review these easy these guys are a Michigan band second album and I think my first reaction to them was up pretty bad pretty negative I heard them in a blog TV and I I think I just felt like their music was annoying overly dramatic overly emotional whiny but since they put out this sophomore album I've been listening to it and I've I've done a bit of a 180 with these guys now these dudes get labeled as post hardcore a lot but don't worry this is not your crappy average modern post hardcore where you get the kind of scream vocals and then you get a dime-a-dozen kind of breakdown right after and then right after that you get all these really cheap sugary ultra clean vocals kind of swooping in like when I'm listening to bands who do vocals like that it's like listening to a million nyan cats all fly into the music at once crapping rainbows in every direction instead this is some of the most raw urgent and emotionally intense rock music you're going to hear this year I think to start off with the production I think it sounds great the guitars are sounding fantastic on this LP they're heavy they're loud they're blaring when these guys reach like mountainous climaxes but also they have very quiet subtle moments to where the guitars just go soft and don't lose their flavor in the process these guys have a lot of dynamics and all of their energy translates perfectly through this record sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm listening to a record it just feels like I'm listening to these guys play live in the studio just sort of like really in the moment now the bass and drum sound great they play a lot of fantastic grooves on this LP and I can actually hear the based on here which I like a lot and the vocals are in an amazing spot on this thing they are so audible I hear almost everything they're saying but yet they don't feel too much louder than the rest of the music musically I think this LP is pretty pretty good too it's very ambitious for a rock album of of any styles to me these guys remind me of some of my favorite old-school post-hardcore bands or emo bands or screamo bands like like rites of spring like Fugazi because they have this very raw going to use that word again intensity to them energy to them but they have this more modern and and musically and emotionally and lyrically complex side of them that is totally within the new school of post-hardcore that's been around ever since bands like refused and at the drive-in sort of made it big yeah some of the pounding buildups do sound a little Sammy Sammy on a few tracks but overall the guitars the bass the drums are just this perfect backdrop the perfect dramatic backdrop for the vocals the lyrics the stories on this thing and now we got to talk about vocals because I think these are what is going to make it or or break it for a lot of you guys on this album the frontman for the span Jordan Dreyer I believe his name is he is so bold and emotive and sincere with everything he says on this album this dude's lyrics are very wordy and very very specific there's tons of imagery in everything he's saying which makes me kind of feel like I'm watching a movie when I listen to some of these tracks because when I'm following this dude's words I'm thinking of all the things he's saying like st. Paul Missionary Baptist Church blues where he kind of just paints a picture of this church going into just major major disrepair losing its congregation and kind of likening his loss of love for living and just his interest for life to that kind of faltering Church or Edward Benz 27 times where he tells a story about this the schizophrenic kid on pills and and there's a really intense like twist ending at the track I see everything where he's just talking about this cancer patient and kind of giving the the the progress of his deterioration over these specific dates or probably the biggest song on here King Park where it's a track about a drive-by shooting and eventually ends with with a standoff with police that gets pretty what's important is that this album didn't make me feel like oh I relate by you know kind of being really vague about the situations it discusses it made me feel like oh I understand because it's so specific and so detailed this album is kind of like an emotional exorcism for me I imagine it is for the guys playing in this band a lot of these vocals are just shouted screamed whispered narrated it's not just singing or or fronting for the band but it's its acting this this album has a lot of stuff kind of beating down on it but it's determined to survive to the next day to a day when things are better when things are nicer I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this a lot of flavor to this what do you think about this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana why dispute forever [Music] you 
b0tyB8tkmU8,her I'm a misfit I'm from The Misfits ah ah you can tell from my shirt ah do you like my devil lock hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm dressed like this because it's October and October is a time for creepy times and Halloween and all that stuff and recently one of my all-time favorite punk bands released a new album The Misfits the album is titled The Devil's rain but of course The Misfits is one of those bands who have gone through enormous lineup changes over the years and their new music no longer sounds like their old music and I don't like any of the new music and I don't really like any of the songs on the new record sorry Jerry still I want to celebrate this band's legacy and tell you guys my top 10 favourite misfit songs to start this list off I want to say the misfits in my opinion are an essential punk band and in the 70s kind of set themselves apart from all the other punk bands around by kind of centering themselves lyrically around horror based themes gore violence monsters if you listen to one horror themed punk band this month make it the misfits gonna start this list off with an honorable mention the song Halloween not on this list but it is October misfits Halloween scary songs it makes sense Halloween my 10th favorite song from the misfits off the legacy of brutality compilation American Nightmare really kind of out of character for the misfits more of like a b-side for these guys and kind of taking a break from the whole punk aesthetic and doing a whole rockabilly kind of Elvis thing on this track really surprising but catchy too number 9 it's kind of like the Las Vegas of misfit songs it's like their most popular track it's got to be last caress I think this track was so much more appealing to me when I first heard it and now that I've probably heard it three billion times it's still one of my favorites but you know it's it's not my all-time favorite and and still has such a killer killer opening one of the best openings in a punk song I've I've ever heard and lyrics about killing babies it's a pretty nasty song behind all the speed and the catchy hooks but you know it's it's nothing to be taken seriously my eighth favorite misfits song coming off of the EP that they put out together back in the day that right here Bullitt song about JFK getting assassinated and also includes a weird little sex fantasy starring Jackie O which gets pretty graphic I got to say my seventh favorite Misfits song one of their shorter tracks we are 138 I love this track it just has this really pounding introduction and then speeds into this breakneck and has one of the funniest guitar solos I've ever heard in a punk song it's pretty much just these two alternating notes my sixth favorite Misfits track one of my favorite songs off of walk among us which isn't actually one of my favorite misfits albums but it does have some of my favorite songs astro zombies hilarious track great track not only is the hook stellar but the lyrics detail this strange zombie alien invasion where faces are being melted it's great my fifth fear misfits song was actually covered by Metallica and comes off of what I think is my favorite misfits full-length and that's Earth ad Wolf's blood this thing I I know the misfits were really great at being a punk band and writing these really catchy tracks but what I love so much about this album is just has this sheer energy to it the sheer aggression to it this album changed the misfits from being just a punk band to a hardcore punk band my fourth favorite misfits track is one that I think is one of their least horror themed songs and that's added dude it's it's not really a horror song at all it works more as just kind of a general Punk song and I think might be one of the most appealing songs on this list you got to check out this song I think you guys if you haven't heard this can relate to this track you ever have somebody giving you an attitude and you basically want to put their face to the floor that's what this song is about my third favorite mitzvah'd song also comes off of this EP it's a track that I didn't actually hear until I got this EP because the album static age has most of these tracks featured on it but not this one which I love and that's horror business and I think it's kind of inspired by the movie psycho psycho 78 twelve o'clock don't be late don't go in the bathroom with me I just love the intensity of this track and just glenn danzig voice on this song just sounds so urgent you know he he sounds like the psycho who he's singing about in this song and my second-favorite misfits track I think it maybe is just what their best hook but one of the best hooks in punk period and that's where Eagles dare oh man I I cannot help but sing along with that every single time it comes on every time that song comes on my blood just gets pumping and my favorite all-time favorite misfits song I thought long and hard about this track and I cannot figure out why I like it so much even though it's criminally short criminally it's just got maybe my favorite melody out of out of all the misfit songs and my favorite vocal out of all the misfit songs - and that's hybrid moments definitely not one of the more highly regarded misfit songs but my favorite misfit song I think and that's molest what do you guys think were your favorite misfit songs what are your least favorite misfit songs and maybe as a bonus question if you've heard some of the new misfits album what did you think of it Anthony Fantana misfits you 
BXralORhPus,dippity-doo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's coolest music nerd time for an album review you you you these guys are a Texas band this is their third LP and on this album they're feeling like a fresh new group but I will start off this review by saying that this may be their last album and this album was recorded almost two years ago it's just being released this year that's all this band's older albums most people have labeled as indie rock I would agree with that and I think this LP kind of fits into that same category but the mood and the personality are kind of different on this I think the previous two records I think we're kind of upbeat and kind of lively a lot of shouting in the vocals but this thing is very listless kind of depressing bit of a slacker attitude this album feels really kind of tired of the monotony of life or maybe it's just beat down from laying in the Texas Sun all day in the lyrics and the vocals this LP just has this really cynical attitude toward life and everything it has to offer and is just loaded with punchlines that make me laugh but then right after I kind of let out a depressing sigh and the reason this is a mood changing album to me the reason I think the personality of this album changed is because the frontman Andrew savages personality kind of altered for this record and what changed about savages delivery as a frontman is he's singing in a lower register his lyrics I think are a little bit darker something that you might have picked up on an LP that he was on that I reviewed earlier this year Ferguson Geronimo's on learn and that LP definitely has a huge emphasis on on satire and being funny and just making some interesting observations this concentrates more on being a damn rock album I don't want to call it a throwback but it definitely reminds me of when indie rock had a Messier edge to it combined with with catchy songs it got me thinking of how good bands like pavement and Built to Spill and and said the dough used to be coz coz coz coz coz while these guys do have some good hooks they write some pretty noisy and and abrasive songs for the most part I mean there's all this amp feedback on some of these tracks wailing guitar solos that can get pretty dissonant and don't care what direction they're going and kind of like you're just swinging a hammer around in a china shop with your hand over your eyes but there's some sweetness here - I think songs like no fragments and and thousand might actually get away with being played in a country bar if they had a different singer landlocked state has these really cute awesome background vocals bouncing off of the lead vocals and Kachina doll has this really nice pretty and glistening acoustic guitar solo over the bridge I also love the the recording on this thing the mix it's really thick it's really loud it it they're an indie band but they got that punk band volume and they reach that aggression to on a track like zealous convert where they're making a lyrical jab at religion and playing at a faster speed and while we're sort of mentioning the lyrics the lyrics are another thing that kind of make this album pretty moody for me references to atheism and shoplifting and friends who you haven't seen in a long time and karaoke and and rebellious bands becoming trends this album feels like to me a good friend of mine who you could just hang out with and just talk with for hours you know just like be nasty with but you know you don't want to be around them all the time or else you know you might kind of lose your positive outlook on life if you have one another kind of issue I have with this LP is that I don't feel like there's anything really new here musically I feel like there's a really good recording on this LP and there are some good hooks but a personality is kind of what comes down to making this record appealing to me kind of like that Ferguson Geronimo record that I mentioned and and also the Andrew Jackson jihad LP I reviewed recently this LP is a different sound for teenage cool kids yeah but is it different in general no but still I like the personality here it's amusing and depressing kind of at the same time I like the fact that this LP can rock its ass off and then kind of turn around and do something odd and do something creepy like the song beg to differ feelings strong seven to a light eight on this thing it was a fun lesson kind of feeling like maybe I kind of have a crush on this thing but what do you think about this do you like it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana teenage cool kids forever you 
JeIw4S0_mKU,oh well oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review wilco the whole love I'm finally reviewing this all I needed was just you know a little personal time to go back and revisit some older albums in Wilko land and I would try to give you some background on these guys but I'm just going to let kal George s to do that before we start off this review thank you anything at the wilcos is a group of reck musicians and they release albums on a regular basis and their first album came first before all the other albums that they have released now their newest album is newer it came after all of their older albums which were released before this album believe it or not that that might have been his most accurate band introduction to date alright so new Wilco album Wilco sadly is is another one of those groups whose new material is constantly getting shot down by haters and by fans because their older stuff is praised so highly wilcos new stuff gets labeled as dad rock they get called out constantly for not being as experimental as they used to be and even though I think this new LP goes against some of those stereotypes this album will probably not shake anybody who's been saying that stuff even though this album is much louder and much bolder than sky blue sky most of the time even though this album to me is as experimental as a ghost is born in some points even though this album is is way noisier and Messier and more experimental than the self-titled LP even though this LP finishes off with a heavily arranged 12 minute piece of alternative country and even though the opening track has these rising strings in this heavy be in all these electronic textures that kind of remind me of Radiohead's last album all that stuff will probably not shake naysayers because people love being right and if anybody decides to just like opt out of listening to this that's fine let them because I thought this was a fun listen Wilco has really gotten their act together again and assembled a series of really catchy fun straightforward pop rock tunes that I think longtime fans if they're open to it and newcomers can enjoy the LP starts with a kind of impressive opener like I mentioned earlier that Radiohead kind of similarity there between the strings and the beats and the electronics it's a really impressive piece of studio work and I know Wilco isn't exactly known for this sound but they sound so comfortable doing it the only spot I wasn't in love with on that track was toward the end where they really sounded like they were playing their asses off but the mix is kind of thin and not all that great it didn't feel it didn't feel aggressive it just felt like the guitars could have just been pumped up a little bit too mmm add some herb then maybe it would have blown me away you know it wasn't a fantastic ending but I thought it was still pretty decent track and pretty ambitious but after that song it's just clear sailing for country ballads power pop tunes and psychedelic popery just really good songs with great personality melodies that just stick in my head as a band I just think Wilco showcases a lot of charisma on this record which is why I'm kind of able to see past the fact that most of these songs really where their influences on their sleeves on the song I might there's this organ that sounds totally like it should have been on that classic garage rock tune ninety-six tears the song son loathe has this really Beatles esque psychedelic pop atmosphere with these rising vocals in the background that kind of remind me of the song because from Abbey Road and the song capital city to reminds me a little bit the beetles like when they would play these tunes that featured a lot of like pre-war jazz chords like when I'm 64 or honey-pie and the song dawned on me I think has the most borrowed melody out of any song on this album the melody sounds like Madonna's like a virgin it sounds like super grasses alright doodyhead we listen for you thank you the songs open mind and born alone have melodies that sound really familiar to me and standing O has an introduction that you've probably heard in a million rock songs still wilcos really great production and sincerity and just ability to rock some of these ideas out make hearing them all over again kind of worth it it makes these ideas kind of feel like shiny and new again like a virgin now my favorite moments on this LP are the upbeat tracks and thankfully there's a lot of those to be had on this I mean Wilco has really kind of turned up the energy on some of these songs I know these guys are no Punk band but they have not kicked this much ass in their songs since like the 90s I might just has these really wailing guitars and pounding drums and Jeff Tweedy sounds like so energized with his vocals and when the hook comes on it's just this swell of glockenspiel and acoustic guitar and organ and drums and it just sounds really really friggin messy but it's also fun too they're going more for this energy thing as opposed to this you know refined kind of thing to me all the upbeat songs kind of share that that characteristic dawned on me standing OH it's energetic but innocent it's like drawing all over the walls with crayons and shit now the slower tracks and the softer tracks on here they're decent I'll listen to them but they don't get me going as much as much as the faster moments and it's not necessarily because they're softer it's just that songs sort of like black moon for example are wrapped up in the same kind of you know generic instrumental arrangements that that made sky blue sky so kind of under well I guess the softer tracks on here copied just as many ideas as the more upbeat tracks but for some reason they just don't sound as interesting to me wilcos softer and darker and sadder side is usually what gets people talking what gets people freaking out but those songs on this record just don't have as much impact for me songs like the title track on this LP are the ones that just have this really feel good fuzzy mood to them and I think they come off the most successful and I think that's a great thing especially for Wilco a band that's usually known for the opposite plus I think a lot of groups kind of go for that aesthetic they try to make something upbeat they try to make something sweet and fun but it ends up just sounding too sugary and Wilco does you know have some sweetness to them on this LP but they kind of even that edge out so there's no sugar rush by making things a little noisy a little experimental a little sweaty I didn't hate anything on this LP but there were a good handful of tracks on here they're just kind of breezed by me and don't hold my attention especially the last song which which I don't think justifies it's it's 12 minute length with enough changes in my opinion but still I thought this is a pretty good record I enjoyed it and who knows maybe it'll grow on me a little bit I think I'm open to that because there are enough great songs on here that I may want to return to this in the future what do you guys think of this LP I know some of you Wilco fans are pretty opinionated do you like this do you hate it do you find yourself constantly comparing it to every other album they've ever put out let me know I'm feeling that a decent - strong seven on this thing hmm Anthony Fantana Wilco the whole love forever music you 
cDpIC-MaY4Y,hey hey hey hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's while my voice sounds really weird in my own head right now for some reason the Internet's most futuristic music nerd and it's time for an album review future islands on the water now I reviewed these guys last year when they came out with the LP in evening air they are a trio and they create really dramatic really moody synthesizer pop and they wrote one of my favorite songs of last year walking through that door tinman was a good track too they were just making stuff that I feel like I could just dance around in my bedroom to just shake my shoulders and cry my eyes out you know just like knocking stuff over and in wasting tissues the drama and the synthesizers that that made in evening air so good are in full force on this album too thankfully and one more thing as well if you're not familiar with these hits they've got these really special vocals they're really gruff they're really dramatic and they're kinda raspy at this point I think I am just maybe a little a little infatuated with the singer this band I think I will maybe listen to anything he is singing on just because he's singing on it he just like loads his delivery with with passion and and sometimes I think I'm detecting like a like a kind of a forced English accent in there when he sings he just makes me want to start singing along even though I have no clue what what the lyrics are he just his delivery just makes me think whatever he's singing about is really really important and I need to pay attention to it what has changed is the production is a little different this time around future islands last release was a little flimsy it was a little sim and that was fine because the band had a good style they had some great songs too this LP adds a little more atmosphere to the equation some more reverb here and there it kind of sounds like the band is playing in a semi large auditorium but nobody is there and because of that some of these tracks just kind of have a sonically a really really empty feeling which I don't know in some in some ways I could kind of see myself being okay with that I've seen it work in other instances but here I just kind of wish they filled these tracks up with a little bit more than than just drum machines and synthesizers and this really thin bass sound that that I feel like I've enjoyed more on echo and the Bunnymen records you're like New Order's first album I wish maybe they added a little more instrumentation maybe some more live instrumentation not just for the sake of hearing more things but I think it would take some of the emotions that are on this LP and really kind of drive them home empower them because to me some of the drums and some of the bass kind of feel flat repetitive they feel fresh at the beginning of a track but by the end of the track after hearing them kind of do the same thing for a while it feels kind of stale just a little bit just kind of gets gets old quick for me I think an example of that is the opening track to this album the song is good melodies great vocals are stellar but there are parts on this song like the explosion of distorted bass at the end that I think sort of putting all this atmosphere in between me and them most of the tracks on here are decent though some standouts and and the standouts for me are the ones where they're filling up this atmosphere with either some extra sounds or just by playing louder I like the single before the bridge on this because they really cranked the synthesizers on that one the third track fills up the mix by throwing another voice into it doing a nice little male/female do wet that I didn't think would go over so well but it's great the vocals just intertwine so nicely and the song close to none has a really loud energizing ending after this really really really long ambient synth scape that's kind of mesmerizing at the beginning I like that progression I like that change for the most part I'm into these songs you guys already know I like the vocals but I'm not really down with how a lot of these tracks are dressed instrumentally I guess I found some pretty enjoyable moments on here but nothing that I'm going to be repeating to death like some of this Bands older material kind of feeling a light to decent six on this thing but what did you guys think of it did you like it did you hate it why and how do you think this measures up to future islands earlier stuff as you guys now this is only my opinion anthony Fantana future islands forever 
1EuXsp4iqZw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd going to review this new 9th wonder LP the Wonder Years 9th wonder is a huge hip hop producer must be known if you're a hip hop fan you must have heard of this guy and if you haven't you must have heard his production at least somewhere the dudes worked with some of the biggest and some of the smallest - and what I like is he consistently kind of stays in tune with both sides of the aisle he's worked with giants like jay-z Destiny's Child Erykah Badu and he's nowhere near fading and relevancy because he's working with current people - like Drake and Chris Brown the dudes come out with great collaborative albums - with MERS and one you definitely have to check out with Jean Grey genius that in his early work and the group little brother make him an underground hip hop legend as well now his beats are heavily heavily dependent on soul a very warm sound and the guy has come out with solo albums before but I was hoping that the Wonder Years would maybe be something a little different at first considering the first track which is kind of a retrospective of of ninth one ninth one 9th wonders career and the title of this album and kind of the the old worn look of the the cover I was hoping this would be kind of a retrospective you know of what brought 9th - where he is today and in the way kind of is because this album is is littered with pretty much the emcees that he's met along the way in his producer journey of course MERS and Fonte a lot of emcees he's close with are on this album but he's got members of wu-tang on here and tons of up-and-comers which I like a lot for Sean kendrick lamar's on here as well Mac Miller is on here in MC who he worked on a mixtape with recently - Tom Rd every track has different feature every track has a different flavor and it all kind of adds up to nothing more than a light casual come whatever time you want to party there are some party snacks some good conversation a few drinks maybe you'll meet a couple people you think are cool but it's not really one of these crazy all out unforgettable parties that that everybody's gonna be talking about tomorrow and there will be some incriminating photos uploaded onto Facebook and because of that this has a very smooth ambience to it but also nobody on this thing is really bringing the heat there's little to no aggression on this thing the few MCS that do kind of come hard stick out like a sore thumb but you know is that surprising it's not like 9th wonders beats are all that conducive of a cypher or something like that and a good chunk of the songs on this thing of love songs I mean overall I like the beats on this thing they're pretty good but it's just the the guest MCS either they're not that great and they're just underwhelming me or their MCS that I really really respect but they're definitely not bringing some of the best material I've ever heard them bring I did like Raekwon on here MERS was pretty good Vontae was great but for the most part the mcs that stuck out to me the most on this mixtape were the ones that were younger the ones that had kind of something to prove out of all the love songs on this thing I think the only one I liked was actually Mac Miller's because his was not only cute but kind of immature and had a funny twist ending and was really kind of self-aware saying yeah love songs they're corny but everybody falls in love there have been other LPS where producers have sort of had the power to kind of cherry pick their favorite MCS produce a bunch of different tracks and then sort of feature them on whatever songs they like mad libs done it Jake one has done it but the thing is those two LPS to me aren't all that fantastic for the same reasons that this one doesn't feel all that fantastic as much as I may like a good handful of the tracks on here there are so many that just that just lose me and I think it's gonna feel that way to a lot of people but this should still be checked out if you're a fan of hip hop because the thing is you may not like the MCS that I liked from this album you know I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this really lost me on the whole but still there are those tracks on here that I enjoyed a lot those features that I thought were pretty decent but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan out ninth wonder forever 
NLVxe2Evtkk,Oh oh it's so beautiful it's a double rainbow ah ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's koulos Taemin coldest music nerd and it's time for an album review J Cole Cole world the sideline story oh oh I love albums with colons in the title ah Cal calmly calls Cole's : cool crazy chick rock J Cole is a rapper producer singer who's recently been signed to jay-z's record label Roc Nation it's his first official release for a while he's been putting out mixtapes and little EPS kind of you know finding his sound and his style and for the most part this new LP is everything that he's he's been doing but he's kind of going big time with it I mean he's really kind of come a long way from sounding kind of generic and really murky in 2007 now a lot of the students lyrics are about struggling and coming from nothing and making it in the rap game and you know we've all heard that angle before but he you know kind of peppers his lyrics with flashes of social awareness and now that he's kind of hitting the big time he's no longer rapping about how he wants money and he wants girls now it's more like he has money and he has girls let's start with the production on this thing I first heard of J Cole when he was producing for one of my favorite rap albums of this year Kendrick Lamar section.80 he made the beat for high power and damn such a good beat and the thing is like anybody who makes a beat that good must be checked out so I had to check him out J Cole shines the most as a producer and I think jay-z how he signed rapper producer Kanye in the early 2000s he's now trying a little bit to kind of create that magic for the most part the beats here are really cinematic the sideline story because of the instrumentals feels like a story rising string sections and glistening pianos and cymbal swells and that's only on the first two tracks the dudes got a pretty diverse array of sounds throughout this album I like the really heavy just like bumping electronics on coal world I like the chill guitar and organ sampled on nobody's perfect where Missy Elliott is featured there are these giant epic pitch shifted choruses on rise and shine and these quivering like heart-wrenching vocals in the background on God's gift and I love the Latin music sample on can't get enough I know Jay Cole did not produce that particular track on the album but still it's on here and it sounds good the dudes even bring him back oldschool boom-bap beats that are littered with soul and jazz piano like lights please lost ones sideline story Jay Cole really knows how to set the mood musically he knows what sounds kind of should be paired with what messages and ideas and that's really important but the thing is Jay Cole is a rapper is really kind of where I end up wanting more I feel I feel I feel I feel like he has great ideas great tastes and a story and a message but half of the time all he's doing is just reminding me of other rappers I mean he has this really mellow light sad introspective side that really reminds me of Drake a lot where he kind of perceives himself as this character who is famous now but he's still kind of awkward and he doesn't know quite what to do he's kind of feeling weird in this Fame situation where the lights are blinding him and also like Drake he has a lot of stories a lot of lyrics about the ins and outs of bad relationships but I think he goes a little darker with it sometimes especially on tracks like never told and lost ones and I like that and sometimes when he goes hard when he goes in on some of these tracks he reminds me of Kanye West which is something new because I was not getting that vibe from a lot of the tracks on Friday Night Lights one of his last mixtapes I mean it's to the point where it was really like making me mad I couldn't handle the irony of the track Cole world he's rapping all over that song about how other rappers are ripping off his style and about how there's no innovation in the game how can you say that when at the end of almost every one of your lines you're doing this Kanye West growl hey he's going hard and he's got some lyrics but like practice what you preach come on so I'm just kind of sitting here wondering if Cole is going to grow into his own or really just end up copying the styles of other rappers in the future because to me I feel like it could it could go either way at this point because there are a lot of tracks on here that catch me as being of a personality that is only his like lights please where he's rapping about being in this relationship that's really sexual relationship it's hot but it kind of distracts him from deeper thoughts and pursuits sidelined story God's gift dollar in a dream part three those songs hit me is just being really really personal just all him in the song breakdown oh yes that song is bold I don't hear more songs like that more because man he just like tells this story about how his his relationship with his father is just non-existent it's terrible and I've heard a lot of rappers attack this angle before but man he hit the nail on the head he just made me feel for him on that track I wanted to cry just kind of like battling this this hatred for his father but this you know this insane need to have a dad and a track that feels even bolder than that one to me is lost ones we're such a weird concept but follow me he basically raps from the perspective of an irresponsible male who gets his girlfriend pregnant doesn't know what to do is saying we can't take care of this kid we're kids this is insane but then in the second verse he starts rapping from the perspective of the girl he got pregnant how many rappers do that it was kind of weird at first but it actually works he paints a really detailed story and he really gets into the character it does not sound like him when I first heard this track I thought it was a feature track and I'm like who's this other guy rapping from the perspective of this girl it was him acting I'm hearing spots on here that are really exciting and unique and I just want more but then Jay Cole will just turn around and do a song like mr. nice watch and come on if you've heard that song let's admit it that is a throw away from Watch the Throne come on the electronic be the Kanye level cockiness Jay Z even comes on for a feature and has the balls to recycle the same flow he used on him now as far as lyrics go for the most part Cole has him but sometimes he doesn't I got the game in headlock I'm red-hot and here's a good one I'm here I'm there I'm everywhere they're not these might pass in 1982 but not 2011 I let you feel like you're the but boy you can't out fart me got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin at me how that feel very happy it's like it's like waka flocka flame your ghostwriter not to mention that you could probably start a drinking game at this album oriented around how many times Kol uses his name in place of the word cold the moments on here where Cole is being really introspective being his intelligent self those are the moments I like the most where he's just being creative he's trying new things he's rapping from the perspective of a pregnant girl I like that he's just challenging other rappers abilities by doing something different the party money girl tracks are kind of where he loses me and not because I'm against those kinds of tracks in general but because when he does that stuff he just ends up sounding like somebody else he doesn't sound like himself I have a love-hate relationship with this album some tracks are just so fantastic to me and others you know I wanted to be as excited for this as I know a lot of you guys are and and I was at first but as I listened to it more and more and more just the things I did not like became more apparent I'm peeling the strongest and beefiest and most muscular of sixes on this album I liked it overall but only a little bit but what do you think of this thing do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana coal world you 
A96ENM-zcnE,that bad not good hi everyone Anthony Fantana the Internet's baddest music nerd right here going to do a review of the new bad bad not good LP a lot of you may have seen that today this YouTube channel is featured on the front page of youtube.com and maybe y'all are wondering maybe y'all are speculating ain't nothing changing around here hmm just going to write a reminder that everything is going to stay the same I'm even going to put this reminder in a bag where I keep very important reminders right here these guys are a Canadian jazz trio this is their self-titled self-released album and to simply call them just jazz is a little bit of a lie this is not the bebop that you remember from the 1950s and these guys don't want it to be there's a funny quote at heum at the end of this album I think it's the drummer talking his name is Alex and it starts off with a question it says Alex what do you think of giant steps and Alex says something to the note of it's 50 years old it sounds like crap write a new song I know those are harsh words for a beloved standard but I think musicians on some level have to kind of have that attitude or else they're not going to propel themselves past what influences them it's important to have influences and understand where things were to understand where things are but what's the point of rehashing the same ideas the same exact way again and again and again another example for me is is is in punk music classic punk music I mean I'm a huge punk fan but if you told me that for the rest of my life I would never hear the songs blitzkrieg bop anarchy in the UK or I'm so bored with the USA again I think I'd be okay with that and it's because I want to hear something new you know it's like I've heard those tracks so many times it's like I know them like the back of my hand bad bad not good has the same attitude about jazz and it's not like jazz has stopped or anything like that there is new jazz music out there that's pretty good but the has a lot of jazz these days is now kind of being marketed to and tailored for in adult contemporary audience the jazz listener base is not as young as it used to be bands like bad bad not good I think could change that up this is jazz infused with electronics infused with hip-hop music as well it's not that new of a sound or concept because hip-hop in a lot of ways has always reflected a jazz influence the Tribe Called Quest J Dilla diggable planets DJ premier Madlib the roots Kid Koala the Beastie Boys to the list of hip-hop artists that have sampled or referenced jazz music in their music goes on forever but we've got to admit that if we were going to make a list of jazz musicians who have celebrated hip hop the list is going to be much shorter the link between hip hop and jazz already exists what I like about this album is that bad bad not good makes this street seemed more like a two-way street not just a one way street so what makes this LP jazz what makes it hip-hop well first off these three guys piano bass drums together they just show a lot of great musicianship there are a lot of great improvisation to enjoy on this LP and they just play off of each other so well you've got really intense moments like the improvised Jam that I think is track 3 these guys really bring that track to some some hot and heavy climaxes and then they're just as good at creating quiet subtle moments to like the beginning of fall in love with this really moody modal intro that song just sounds like a beautiful delicate shiny ice sculpture to me and the solos are so good at some of these points just looked like fun to listen to you know you don't have to sit there and be like ooh this is just I love listening to this drummer the intro track I could just like hear this guy all day is just rocking this great B and as far as some of the piano solos go look at one of the final tracks on this album sorry is song where the melody he's playing on that he is cradling it like it's a baby he's just so gentle with the melody on that track I love it and the bass player is really great as well another moment toward the end of the album he's playing the lead melody on the song and I did not see that coming most of this LP is nothing but recreations of popular hip hop instrumentals and I know on paper conceptually that seems a little gimmicky but the thing is I don't see why these dudes play with so much sincerity they're taking songs relevant to them and reinventing them so what's relevant to these guys Gang Starr not old dirty bastard Joy Division slum village Flying Lotus and the soundtrack to Legend of Zelda's ocarina of time now I'm not trying to say this album is perfect I do think some reinterpretations go over better than others there takes on slum villages fall in love gang stars mass appeal and nas's the world is yours I think are the best tracks on here the electric pianos are just glistening the drums are hard and heavy and just pushing these fat hip hop beats and the bass is just got this really nice round obese sound I think the only reinterpretation that I didn't like all that much was flying lotuses camel and the reason I didn't care for it all that much is because they don't jam on it really for the most part they're just really recreating the song instrumentally which is the feat in and of itself if you've heard that Flying Lotus track and as long as I'm complaining I wish there was more original material on here one of my favourite tracks is an original on this list eerie osis and that song just has like these escalating tense piano chords over this boom that beat it feels like just like running up an endless flight of stairs salmonella listeria says I get it guys funny there's kind of an experimentally electronic spot on the song freedom / billion Evans and I like that track it's a nice from the other songs I would totally be interested in not only seeing these guys kind of run further down that trail but maybe combine it with their jazzier elements a little bit more now if this thing were a Christmas tree the star on top of it would be the 10-minute Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time medley I know some of you may be much younger than me or much older than me and because of that you don't quite understand that in the late 90s Nintendo 64 was the shit the Ocarina of Time was like the life of a lot of kids back then mine too to the point where the music of that video game is laced into my childhood so deeply I will probably never forget any of the songs and I've heard a lot of covers a lot of tributes and this ranks among them is one of the best and the reason why to me is because it works outside of the nostalgia you don't have to have played Zelda on the n64 to love that song actually I don't think you need to know any of these songs that these guys are covering to enjoy them because the musicianship is so strong the solos are great the melodies are clear and emotive these guys are having fun playing together so for the listener it's a fun experience to hear I think this LP is a little all over the place but bad bad not good to me is still in a very kind of fetal stage all of their material isn't really coming together and flowing in this one focused direction still despite the fact that this LP is a combination of older and newer material and features a lot of different ideas it flows pretty well so I'm excited about what I'm hearing on this LP I'm excited about what it means for this band what it means for jazz music and what it means for hip-hop and what it means for music fans - I'm feeling a strong 7 - a light 8 on this LP it's brought me many smiles and if you want to hear this thing it's free just go on the band's band camp there's a link below this video you can download the whole thing and once you've heard it or if you've already heard it let me know what you thought of it did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching and thanks to all my new subscribers for subscribing Anthony Fantino bad bad not good forever [Music] [Music] 
ApMeFBLy3v0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Mastodon LP del hunter highly requested review highly anticipated review for a lot of people and when I run across bands artists who have a large back catalogue a lot of history I like to let couch your chest to come in here and give some background on the artist cow eye Thank You Anthony mr. Dan is a metal group they have a lot of guitar they have a lot of drum and they have voice in their music and it's very what I hear is allowed and if you like to be a deaf after you hear music mr. Dan is the band for you I hate coucher Justin a lot for a while Mastodon has kind of been pigeon-holed as this metal band for people who are metalheads you get a lot of people on the internet saying man this is great but I don't even like metal and for the most part the reason why that is is because they break a lot of the alienating metal stereotypes especially with their latest releases mastodons guitars especially on this LP feel more heavy than they do harsh their production is usually pretty bright and smooth and accessible the vocals are usually some clean with a nice harmony in the background it's really hyper melodic - and this has brought a lot of fans but this has also brought some naysayers as well because without a doubt these guys have put a more accessible face on the style of sludge metal I don't think they've really put out an album that made me you know grit my teeth since remission or Leviathan the whole accessibility thing looks you know bad on paper people think of things in their heads like who sellout but this band has managed to exit you did pretty well while making their music more accessible I think they've come out with some of their best material and still managed to stay progressive in the process like crack the sky where they're showing a lot of strong flashy musicianship especially in the drumming a lot of interesting transitions in these tracks and 13-minute songs as well but the thing is the accessible angle Mastodon is always kind of stereotyped to play comes out on a new level on the hunter it's really really really gone far this time I have never considered Mastodon this kind of band but I could totally see a good handful of tracks on here getting play on commercial rock radio a song like curl of the burl could totally get inserted between spins of Ozzy Alice and Chains and Godsmack singles but there are also tracks on here that I think are in line with with any great Mastodon track from the band's previous LPS the song black tongue is a fantastic opener really thick mix sinister opening riff drum rolls drum fills almost in every direction I feel like the song loses its groove a little bit because of how incessant the drums are but it's a pretty relentless track and it's got the personality that I look for in a mastodon song the song star gasm has a really heavy opener that makes me go like invisible oranges and it's got this really low heavy riff and when they let that OneNote ring out yes it's so heavy and harmonious it's like planets smashing together and when the track speeds up eventually it stays pretty engaging all the heavy lifting has a great hook and as far as my other favorite track on this LP I got to say spectral light which has a really pumping riff but you know it's not anything I haven't heard these guys do before but the thing is this album loses a little bit of steam for me when these guys take a break from being interesting aggressive intense basically a metal band to start putting together some of the Poppaea stin carnations of sludge I've Hurd gonna go back to the track curl the burl I mean I know this song has gotten a lot of you know kind of bad reactions at first and maybe a lot of you have listened to it so many times that I kind of like it now but I'm still cringing Mastodon has put together much more much more interesting tracks than this their tracks on Leviathan that you know left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was gonna happen next tracks like curl the burl don't really hit me like that they don't sound like music that I'm really intently listening to they sound like music that I put on to go do something else it's loud but there's no real intensity there's no real bite to it there's no real urgency to it it does everything that you would expect a radio rock single to do nothing more in order to kind of break things up Mastodon starts throwing in some kitschy sounds on some of these tracks like octopus has no friends where they have these really robotic space vocals they've also got these really atmospheric keyboards opening up creature lives and it really builds up the track I get excited for it but then the song starts and it has this melody that sounds like it took Mastodon five seconds to write I do have some love's I do have some hates on this album but the the sad part is is that a majority of the songs on here don't really swing me in one direction or the other like the songs drive on valley or thickening they're decent tunes they've got heavy riffs they've got a loud mix they've got Macedonian vocals but I'm just kind of bobbing my head to it that's it you guys have seen me review metal records on this channel before you've seen me excited before over a metal record you know I love metal records that bring out a primal side in me I want to hear a metal record that makes me want to throw my arms up in the air punch a hole through the wall or something this album despite having a lot of metallic elements somehow approaches that feeling for me but it doesn't quite bring me there it doesn't get me there it doesn't step over the threshold and the thing is it first I like this album on my first maybe two listens thought it was really good I could feel my blood sort of getting almost to that boiling point but as I listen to it more and more and more I kind of got less into it the more I listened the further away from that primal feeling I felt because by that point I just knew it wasn't gonna happen so instead of excited instead of in danger while listening to this album I feel a little underwhelmed I feel safe I just feel like I should be keeping my arms inside the vehicle at all times I don't feel overwhelmed I don't feel pushed I don't feel like there's really a climax here I kind of feel like I was left in the dust on this one it's to a point where I feel myself kind of favoring bands that Mastodon has in a way kind of carved out a niche for like give a l'heure talk who I actually think rocks harder than this album and just has better grooves Baroness as well who in comparison to the hunter writes much more righteous and intricate melodies we're the band torch tour Shay who in comparison to the Hunter especially on albums like Neanderthal have a much heavier much thicker sound and catch your hooks so it's not like taking doom metal and sludge metal and making it poppy is necessarily a bad thing these bands have done it overall I just kind of feel like this record is a more accessible version of the Mastodon that we have kind of grown to know it is really immediate it makes getting into this album pretty quick pretty easy but to me releases like Leviathan are going to loom over this one with a dark ominous shadow I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on the hunter I was underwhelmed but I already said that what do you guys think of this thing how many times have you listened to it I feel like with more lessons it's kind of just been wearing its welcome on me and shouldn't the opposite be happening where does this record stand to you in comparison to the rest of mastodons work and what do you think I should review next thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Mastodon forever [Music] 
2c5KCsYiYoY,Oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's wildest music nerd time for an album review of the new Wild Flag album wild flag is a rock outfit from Portland Oregon which made its full-length debut earlier this month now even though these guys are a new band their ranks are filled with indie rock veterans Carrie Brownstein Mary Timoney Rebecca Cole Janet Weiss between the four of them they've worked in the spells sleater-kinney the minders the go-betweens and that's not even like close to the full list of projects that they've been affiliated with and to me they are playing indie rock on this album but it's this really simple fun catchy kind of muscular style of indie rock it's not this cheap glossy pretend happy like stereotype reinforcing brand of indie rock that gets thrown at us all over the internet that of all the group's wild flag is affiliated with I think sleater-kinney is going to warrant the most comparisons especially since Carrie Brownstein is kind of fronting the band but even though those comparisons will be made I don't think this album really leaves off where sleater-kinney did in 2005 with woods which was a really noisy experimental kind of emotionally intense album to me wild flag takes a detour from that intensity and takes just just a more scenic route I think longtime sleater-kinney fans will see parallels between this and an older album like dig me out the faster catch your tracks from that album but still wild flight by comparison is noticeably different to me the post-punk spirit is here but none of the the sorrow or pain or angst it's a terrible word I know but of the angst that fueled some of those sleater-kinney LPS just is not here it shows up a little bit on some of my favourite tracks like boom where Carrie Brownstein is singing in this really kind of eccentric kind of slightly deranged vocal or even future crimes which is a little upset and a little desperate in a way that I like but the thing is for the most part this album really kind of has no tears to shed I mean this album is really in too good of a mood to be depressed or all that self-aware wild flag is writing songs about glass tambourines and electric bands and throwing haze and Yaz and okay's and all rights into their lyrics I could totally see Carrie Brownstein playing these songs live and like doing windmills on her guitar or something that's how upbeat this album feels to me even in its most depressing moments the drums are really sharp and snappy the bass lines have a lot of spunk bunk the organs are kind of quirky and I like that and the guitar leads are just rough and wild they just wail when I first heard this LP I kind of questioned it because of how simple it is you know oh it's you know it's it's so simple it's not really all that intricate but as I listened to it more I kind of ended up enjoying how free of of complications it is there's no weird abstract deeper layer to this album what you see is is what you get and what you get is just a nice attitude and a group of 10 songs that kind of just want to rock and there's a nice variety among these songs too I don't feel like I'm hearing the same song over and over and over these guys write a group of tracks that land around two or three minutes but they could totally just change gears pull out a 6-minute track like racehorse with this drum being guitar riff that reminds me of Fugazi and yet it still sounds good and for the duration of the song they stay engaging there's a consistent sound and style on this the production is pretty good in my opinion I feel like the songs that were on that wild flag 7-inch that came out earlier this year that got reworked for this open you came out pretty good there were moments like something came over me that felt a little underwhelming to me but overall I thought it was a very good debut but I think some fans are gonna look for more from this album considering who is is making it and I and I have to admit I did too a little bit but still what's kind of interesting is that all these members in wild flag kind of seem to have brought themselves back to square one with this band in a good way because they're kind of writing and performing as if this is like their first band almost all the members of wild flag sound really excited to be making this album they sound really energized this album feels really fresh it feels really new it doesn't feel like the Reformation that it actually is to me so to me this album is just kind of like an assembly of catchy tracks it's nothing mind-blowing but it is solid it is dependable and it is admirable I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this but what do you think did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana wild flag forever 
NvFPmfdppYg,Oh path heritage oh you've done an intro like this already hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review and of all the requests that I get all the time this review is kind of become a highly highly anticipated review oh pets heritage now these guys are a Swedish rock band known mostly for their interpretations of progressive metal and progressive death metal but I've never ever ever ever ever been an Opeth fan never their melodic and and to me kind of overproduced take on death metal just has never ever done anything for me I know that's gonna piss some people off because opeth has kind of become over the years through a consistent style and a lot of releases become this metal sacred cow but on this new LP heritage Opeth throws away all death metal and even just metal in general sounds for this record and just makes a really complete and an honest and Breece of progressive rock now it's not like that's anything new for these guys they've done that once before on 2003's damnation and some of the quieter moments on this new LP actually reminds me of 2002's deliverance a little bit at least that's what I think even though Opeth has played in this area before this album is getting a lot of mixed reviews and I'm not completely sure why I'm not a huge fan of this LP either I don't think it's gonna be for the same reasons that Opeth fans are the band's frontman whose name coucher chesta is going to pronounce nikhil Ecker fileted tim has put his death growls away for this album but i don't see how that would ruin it I mean I don't think it's just simply his growls that were bringing opeth fans to the table to me Opeth on this album they're embracing in older shade of progressive rock to me this album is like totally King Crimson it's totally jethro tull it's even a little Mahavishnu it points especially in the drums these these drums on this record are fantastic they're just these jazz fusion drums with these you know hard-hitting rolls and fills but you know you've got these jazzy ride cymbals and great grooves flowing underneath a lot of these tracks I like the texture of the guitars on this thing - they've got a nice edge to them but they don't come off like just distorted and blaring like your average metal guitar I mean it even sounds like a kind of close friend of the band Steven Wilson from porcupine tree had a bit of an influence on this record since there are moments on here that remind me of songs off Steve Wilson's new solo album and I like how tight up at the sounding on this album - especially the second single that these guys dropped this year The Devil's orchard the syncopated drums guitars an organ on that track are great they just sound so badass in the way that organ just colors the background with this just sinister sinister sound is nice the band shows a lot of dynamics and a lot of interplay as they transition from these latter moments to these softer moments they just it just happened so gracefully to me it's not like there's a heart in or a heart out or it's really obvious it's like I don't know where the band is going or what they're going to do until they finally get there especially tracks like I feel the dark which start off with vocals acoustic guitar but then they subtly grow into bass drums keys in the background and then when this main booming guitar riff just punches in it's like this nice shot of progressive rock adrenaline I think a lot of the tracks on here of interesting song structures it's just not your average verse chorus verse but like I said I'm not really a fan of this album and it has a lot to do with just one single thing have you ever had an entire album ruined for you because you're not into one single thing on the I'm just one sound that they keep using or or one instrument or or just one way they mix the drums or something I've never been into Opeth vocals sadly I just I just have not the growls have been pretty good in the past but the cleans just do nothing for me and this album is nothing but cleans the vocals have a good range there on pitch I can't take that away from them that's fine that's fine but it's just whatever technical term you want to slap on it the the tambour of the vocals the cadence the inflection just the the sound of them they just sound like your average modern hardrock vocals to me it sounds like this is a voice I would hear if I went out to the local bar to hear the best cover band in town that's not really the issue I mean there's little there's a larger problem for me and that's that to me the vocals just don't feel urgent to me they don't feel emotional to me they just don't grab me they don't captivate me they don't pull me in let's take one of the first big thematic lyrics from this album comes off the devil's orchard god is dead god is dead it's repeated a bunch of times God is dead one of the most revered figures in history is dead shouldn't I feel something or think something when I hear this being said this line sounds like it's being sung in a local musical theater production the vocals just hit the right notes that's all I can say they do they just don't convey any emotional highs or lows to me they never feel really depressing or really soft or you know really dark and they never feel really intense they never feel really in my face or thrilling I know I like the way the band is playing on this LP I know I like the style that they're embracing but to me the vocals are just such a central part of this album I know a lot of Opeth fans may have already decided how they feel on this album and that's fine but if you've never been an opah fan I would at least try this thing out because they are trying something different on this LP if you've been turned off by album like Blackwater park or something like that in the past then this is definitely worth trying because it is a different flavor different direction I'm feeling a light too decent five on this one it was alright on the fence with it just not really loving it not really hating it but what do you think about it do you like it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next you have to be Fantana Opeth this is just my opinion forever [Music] 
pOI3xkXoId0,enter jackson jihad what are you laughing at what do you laughing at what are you laughing at can't I just you know be happy can't I just be happy Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's jihadist music nerd we're going to do an album review like we usually do but like in the vein of my past couple videos I have a couple things to mention number one the needle drop calm has been redesigned check it out the needle drop calm looks different now and to today is the final day of our YouTube on the rise contest there's no more voting after today so if you haven't voted for us yet in the polls please do our competition is catching up we can't relax now we're at the final lap look for a link below this video in the d box head straight over there vote for t ND in the upper right hand corner and thank you and to the review Andrew Jackson jihad knife man there are a lot of albums coming out this month toward this part of the year I'm getting really overwhelmed by it but I'm happy that a lot of them are good these guys get labeled as being folk punk a lot and it's understandable they take a lot of folk instrumentation and they fuse it with a with a punk energy in an ethos but in 2009 with the album montane that they came out with they were fleshing out their sound and their style a little bit with different kinds of songs and different instrumentation electric guitars and horns and junk and this album knife man goes further down that road with lots of fat red cords esque distorted guitars kazoos piano organ strings I mean they were sounding really skeletal in 2007 with this album but now with knife man they've really done a 180 with how they stir the production value has been bumped up and I can name a lot of bands who have done that but have lost their flavor in the process these guys still feel like the same group to me they're still targeting society with the the same consistency a band like crass would personality is really what this record and ever Andrew Jackson jihad record comes down to because usually on a record from these guys the chord progressions aren't anything new being familiar familiarity is is intentional because the message is what needs to be focused on what makes knife man a little different for me is that Andrew Jackson jihad just kind of felt like they were playing these communal folk songs before but now with all this extra instrumentation in this better production they don't feel like these you know little whispers and these little stories that are passed down from person to person they feel like anthems now now I'm going to talk a little deeper about what I think my favorite thing on this album is and it will probably also be the least favorite thing of a lot of people the vocals the lead singer of this group sounds like a skinny whiny white guy it sounds like he just boils on the inside with all these nasty thoughts about the world around him and doesn't let them out until he's actually writing lyrics for his songs I mean the first lyric on this album is the Michael Jordan of drunk driving played his final game tonight I mean this guy's got some really polarizing thoughts and I don't think that's a bad thing I think it's a great thing it makes this record stick out this thing is hilariously bitter and cynical from racism to sexism to poverty to love songs and even the Sun these guys have something nasty to say about almost everything I love the track American tune which is pretty much about being a white straight male and how that kind of comes with some privilege if you live in America where you're walking down the street you're not being raped you're not being hassled by police officers I like the track no.1 which is kind of really bluesy and and depressing and about people who are poor and forgotten friendless family lists helpless there's a hilarious line on here about priests feeding sinners with fur food with diabetes inducing high fructose corn syrup and I think to me my favorite line on this album not because it's funny but it's just really it just cuts to me hope is for presidents and dreams are for people who are sleeping but the thing is you know I could see the questions popping up in people's heads who is this band who are these guys who are they to judge us judge society I would kind of feel that way a little bit too but what I think is interesting about this LP is that the preachy songs are like balanced out with these introspective and kind of self-deprecating songs where the frontman of this band sees himself as kind of being just as flawed as the general public he's critiquing I think my one issue main issue with this album is that some of the punk rock tunes on here just sound really really kind of plain they sound like any modern pop punk band that like I said earlier would kind of be on Fat Wreck chords with with kind of a poppier Punk sound but still these guys are great at coming up with lyrics and stories and images that keep me on the edge of my seat waiting to hear what the next thing is it's going to be said not only that but go back and re listen to this album to pick up things that I missed and this LP is 45 minutes long which is kind of a stretch for Andrew Jackson jihad I've enjoyed these guys plenty of times before but I never saw myself enjoying them for like 45 minutes but the thing is even though this album is a little disjointed stylistically there's like a track that's a blue song on here there's a track that's like you know a tear in your beer country jukebox kind of song like I said punk tunes there are stripped-down folky acoustic moments that feel like they could have been on earlier Andrew Jackson releases all this variety makes this album feel kind of fresh for me and makes it feel worth it to listen from beginning to end it's a little bit like a mixtape for me I loved this thing I wouldn't listen to it again I had a lot of fun listening to it um feeling a decent too strong eight on it thought it was really good but what do you think about it do you like it do you hate it is this band too preachy and and whiny for you or are they speaking to you Anthony Fantana Andrew Jackson jihad vote for us in that YouTube competition forever [Music] 
OmUdajuMIns,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review but first two things one I just hit 40k thank you and two we mustn't get complacent we're still in the middle of YouTube's on the rise contest and I know originally I was 5,000 votes behind and that I caught up and I was in the lead and I I'm still in the lead but our competition is no slouch they're catching up and it's going to be a close one if you haven't voted for the needle drop yet look for a link right below this video in the d box and it will bring you to a page where in the upper right hand corner pick tnd and then you can pat yourself on the back because you've done your good deed for the day alright so Veronica Falls English band some members from Glasgow Scotland - I believe been listening to this thing pretty hardcore for the past few days and coucher chest has been overhearing it as well cow what did you think of the Veronica Falls is she okay no that's that's the band's name what did you think of the band what being Veronica Falls oh all right is she okay I hate cow church esta ah to be honest Veronica Falls doesn't really reinvent the style of music that they're playing but they do play this stuff really well they managed to add a lot of detail to this indie rock sound while simultaneously making a sound so light simple and like effortless they sound pretty similar to a lot of groups from the UK who got labeled as as either being truly or cat6 and the 80s like pastels or shop assistants it's a sound that a lot of groups on the same record label that these guys Ron are trying to recapture and relive groups like the pains of Being Pure at heart procedure club brilliant colors and these groups all kind of have their own take on this style the muddy bass guitar the kind of jangly guitars made gargantuan by reverb and effects very simple straightforward driving drums and these vocals these boy/girl vocals that sound so breezy they sound like basically anybody could sing them like now Veronica Falls has their own kind of spin on this stuff this thing is definitely a perfect fall record I mean this thing sounds like the leaves changing on some trees in a graveyard on a very gray windy day and outside of the style that these guys clearly put themselves in I'm catching some whiffs of some Velvet Underground of some Pixies or the breeders and I'm hearing a lot of influences coming from like English folk tunes too with how these guys arrange their vocals on a few of these tracks and the vocals really are kind of the biggest treat for me on this album they're kind of what makes this thing both sweet and sad at the same time if this thing is a fall album the vocals really are kind of the the chilly wind blowing through the trees making the leaves fall off the melodies here they're just either so sweet and catchy and just stick in my head instantly like on the song found love in a graveyard which is kind of literally about falling in love with a ghost and on the other side of the coin you have songs where the melodies the vocals are kind of eerily beautiful like the fountain the only thing I love more than the vocals on this LP is how these guys structure their songs the parts themselves are pretty simple and skeletal but you've got a lot of different parts in each song moments where these guys are speeding up and slowing down and playing double time or coming up a little segue or a little fill into the next section you've got plenty of bridges and solos and moments where the vocal melodies altered slightly from from line to line so that they don't repeat entirely these guys really do keep the longer tracks on this album from stagnating which is great now even though the music here is very sweet it's very approachable it does have a post-punk influence you know it's got some speed it's got some momentum there is a bit of aggression there a bit of an edge and that you know really keeps me interested plus this sounds like the recording of a band playing together not a bunch of people performing on click tracks so there's definitely that momentum I guess in terms of negatives I wish this album had a little more meat on it lyrically there are moments on songs like found love in a graveyard and come on over where I kind of wish I wasn't hearing the same lyric or the same hook repeated over and over and over and some of the songs here are a little too kind of breezy for their own good to the point where I I don't even remember them all that much like all eyes on you I'm feeling a light 8 on this loved it loved a lot of songs on here but what do you think of this LP do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino Veronica Falls friends "
yvjxdtcLVfI,"yes racist relax hi everyone my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's least racist music nerd here back where I belong doing a review with you guys watching I have so many things to tell you guys let's start one this week I'm a part of a YouTube on the rise contest I made a video about it maybe some of you didn't see the video but basically there's voting involved and I'm pitted against several other channels and whichever channel gets the most votes gets featured on a front page of YouTube awesome I was like 5,000 votes behind the leader in this contest but thanks to you guys I'm in the lead now what thanks to the people who watch that video thanks to the people who saw my YouTube updates on my tweets saw my facebook updates and went on the page and voted the page is linked below this video in the d box if you would like to vote for this channel and there's also one more person I have to thank we have a couple more days of voting though so keep the needle drop in the lead we gotta win this second thing I got to mention my computer is really loud I hate it third thing I gotta mention I was in New York today and I don't want to mention why yet I'll tell you guys why as soon as as soon as the video that was shot there is up on the internet and once it's up I will let you guys know and you will be so excited you'll be so happy alright let's review this thing that's racist relax this is the New York hip hop outfits first official pay for our album release before this they were dropping mixtapes sit down man and shut up dude both of which I reviewed last year link to find that review down below this video in the deep box but if you're yet to hear these guys those two mixtapes and relax are some of the funniest oddest most abstract hip-hop you'll ever hear I mean they go so far to that extreme that last year they were pushing a lot of buttons with people people didn't know what to make of them should they be taken seriously I mean they can rap pretty well but they have a song about a combination pizza and Taco Bell and you know I don't think - racist ever wanted to push anybody's buttons to me it kind of sounds like they're just being themselves and I feel that way because - racist doesn't push their odd behavior on relax it's pretty much the same familiar personalities that run sit down man now we're on shut up dude but I'm going to be straight I'm not going to leave this kind of for the end of the review I'm going to spoil it I'm not as much into this as I as I am the mixtapes I think this LP starts really strong though with these two tracks relaxed and Michael Jackson to me this is like perfect - racist the humor is very witty it's very layered it's very clever and you know it's it's just repeatable meanwhile the beats are sampling Middle Eastern music they're really heavy they're really hard on the tracks Victor Vasquez comes off really quiet really kind of you know shy ish blunted but he says such out-there stuff it's hilarious one of my favorite lines he spits out is a rap genius.com his white devils sophistry I'm pretty sure that was him pretty sure but the other guy rapping teams on this album I feel like there's more of a separation between him and Victor on this LP because he comes out on a lot of these tracks being really kind of forceful he's like the muscle on some of these tracks especially relaxed and Michael Jackson he just demands attention and he is always as funny as Victor but sometimes he'll throw out a line on here that it's like some real shit what look what good is this cashmere if they're still dying in cashmere custom ear that was Holmes and that was just dust here I love another line on there where he spits about having a bank to brag about and sort of pushing himself past a young reckless guy I mean tracks like relax and Michael Jackson are just like a bullet a bullet straight to the head they're straightforward you know what they're all about they have everything they need and nothing they don't there are tracks that come off way more blunted like brand-new dance where things get a little sillier things get a little more ridiculous but the song still has like focus things start to go downhill for me around the second third of the album like with the track girl like is that song supposed to be a joke the problem for me isn't that it's too weird or it's too out there the problem for me is that it's like normal it's just like a poppy love song with - races singing instead of rapping and you know what the thing is on paper I'm Pro - racist making a love song but to me they don't really bring the unique perspective they bring to everything else - love I feel like I'm kind of missing the joke on another track booty in the air which sounds like any old hip-hop song about booties and you know I do realize that maybe there's a bit of a joke in there with just the mere fact that it's - racist making a song about booties in the air but if I didn't know was - racist the joke wouldn't be there the song Punjabi song is another track that to me is devoid of humor is devoid of wit I actually think that track they kind of missed an opportunity to I don't know make a song about what it is to be prune job' or something like that instead the songs just kind of about getting wasted in the club and the only thing pooja be about the song is they have a Punjabi singer on the hook other songs like happy rappy the trick celebration Selina these are really good songs but they don't feel as focused as like the first four on this LP they seem all over the place they don't really have that punch of a song like Michael Jackson or relaxed Plus on this LP - racists kind of try to relive past glories by doing another feature track with LP which they did on their second mixtape and and also they through the song rainbow in the dark on here which was on their first mixtape and I love the LP feature I love the song rainbow in the dark but you know I've heard those tapes I love those tapes I'm interested in not hearing the same - races but - racists 2.0 like I said I didn't enjoy this as much as the tapes but still - races consists of two MCS that have two extremely unique personalities that you're not going to find anywhere else in hip-hop if you've loved the two mixtapes that these guys have given you already in your hardcore - racist fan I'd say why not pick this thing up supportive it's their first official release I'm feeling strong 5 to a light 6 on this what do you think about it do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana - racist relax forever "
lKwifoAnEFo,this is an awful idea I hope you know that right Anthony the channel is is growing it's getting bigger and you need to start giving the people what they want you see the comments they say couch couch esta nobody wants this they just think that they want it let me shine let me get mine alright fine fine just let's just get through this all right I can I get a super input thank you thank you hi everyone couch your chest to hear that roommate of the number one guy hosting a new segment on the needle drop a title that your your net review Anthony here has given me a list of albums he is refused to reveal is it because he has some kind of greater purpose he should be covering something else or is he at being just a jerk and pretentious and snooty you decide even with no review some of these releases cannot go unanswered they cannot go unacknowledged Oh Morgan start off the list right here at you will Matt review the new blink-182 album makes more sense blink-182 punk band you like punk they invented punk I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that yeah I don't want to review the new blink-182 LP neighborhoods yes it's their first LP in eight years and they've come back in prime blink-182 fashion and they're sounding like blink 182 and I don't think you guys need a six to seven minute video telling you that the blink 182 sounds like blink 182 there are some new additions like a lot of effects and a lot of sense but pretty much as usual these guys are playing pop punk with as much emphasis on pop as you can have before it no longer becomes Punk at all you know I've never really been big on these guys but just like everybody back in the day I've owned a copy of enema of or a fair enough fair enough all right number two you refuse to review and then new premise primis album premise yeah I don't want to review the new Primus green naugahyde but the thing about that band is that I'm actually still kind of a fan of them you know um I still actually have suck on this Frizzle fry sailing the Seas of cheese in my collection you stole all their albums actually it was really obsessed with the band at one point thought they were the most original thing on the planet and then I heard discipline Eric King Crimson and the residents and Pink Floyd and I can appreciate that these guys want to bring their sound and style and message to a new generation by still making music but this is pretty much business as usual for Primus you've got crazy stories and narrations from Les Claypool lots of weird funky quirky slap bass lines really hard drumming lots of grooves its primus what more do you want they suck nevermind you you don't get it just the next one the next one you don't get the joke what do you have to say yeah you're not going to review when the rat the rapture religious sounds like yeah actually I wasn't too into the new rapture LP I mean I liked them so much more when they used to have a post-punk edge on albums like this but now they just kind of sound like an indie dance band which is okay they've still got the pretty eccentric vocals but you know none of the songs themselves were freaking me out except a couple I wouldn't say avoid it okay yeah well what about mr. the game I'm sure he worked very hard on the the red album doesn't mr. mr. game deserve a review I'm sure the game put the best of his game into this album but you know I've never been a game fan even when he was big when I was in college and he had the whole g-unit acting thing going I was just never a game fan there's nothing on the red album that changes my mind I think it's cool that he's perceptive enough to grab current features like Drake and Tyler the Creator and and kendrick lamar and they'll come on and they do their thing they do a great job actually loved Tyler on this album I think he's got some clever lines here and there especially on the track shake but overall this is just like it's a spotty album that's that's my issue it's not solid all the way through there are a lot of tracks that I would skip you're really a huge jerk you're ugly in here hurry you won't review the the new trick record trick e why yeah their name is thrice thrice major minor um been listening to it vagrant has a preview of the album online you know I've never been a thrice fan this album isn't really changing my mind for loud rock standards it's just not that cathartic or exciting for me it just doesn't evoke any emotion out of me whatsoever the whole LP even and it's like most emotional moments is just like so meticulously produced and planned out and like rock music isn't like that for me where's the edge on this thing where's the danger okay yeah what about a kiss bein qez bein ya the new Caspian record velociraptor it's it's not for me and I'm pretty sure that everyone requesting it knows that already so why it's pretty much just expensively produced alternative rock with a very British edge to it taking a lot of influence from almost every major English rock act since the 60s they take a lot of influence from Oasis - I think it's decent for what it is I think tracks like goodbye kiss are great but other tracks like the title really get too corny for me to enjoy them but hey it's better than PDI sounds like a great band to me okay well your funeral alright um you won't review the The Dream Theater's y-yeah the nutrient theater um do I look like a dream theater fan look I love progressive rock but this broke my heart a little bit I mean this is the band that made metropolis part two okay and now on this they sound like a watered-down new metal band tracks like build me up and break me down I was honestly wondering if it was like a joke it was a bad joke being played on me because if I only had that song to go on from this LP I would guess that even a band like disturbed could outplay all these guys technically I've never been big on John Petrucci vocals but they've been better than this will we progressive rock you like that mmm experimental it's this you like that you're really you're something you're you're terrible okay you I've seen a lot of comments for this one you will not review says here a faster the people's why yeah I've gotten a lot of questions about that foster the people album I'm I'm just not into it it's very cute light fun easygoing indie pop but for me it's just kind of in one ear and out the other none of it really sticks with me I mean if you're going to make pop music it's got to be catchy it's got to be memorable it's got to be infectious and none of this album is that for me a lot of this LP kind of reminds me of a less less less experimental MGMT or Passion Pit I mean these guys actually make MGMT look like Moondog or captain beef and I'm just not into this new strain of indie bubblegum pop that that is totally radio ready this stuff was more fun when Peter Bjorn and John were dropping tracks like Amsterdam still it's got its moments I like the song dumb stuff that one's really good oh it's too sugary for you you brush your teeth and you'll be okay ah hurry and last one you don't want to tack about Bombay Bicycle Club Bicycle Club Green save energy greenhouse gases sounds like good yeah I pretty much feel the same way on the Bombay Bicycle Club that I do the Foster the People it's just not really pushing me in one direction hey or the other direction love all that much it's just kind of got me right down the middle the road it's fine for what it is fun light poppy and no boundaries pushed at all in any direction this album avoids boundaries like they've got the cooties well there you have it ladies and gentlemen at Anthony Fantana outright refuses to review these releases um maybe it's against his best interests to do so especially considering there are leagues of talented artists among these groups but whatever he chooses that's his channel it's his party he'll die if he wants to alright this has been a segment of you your your NAT reviewing and next month we'll have another one when Anthony probably decides not to review other things because they're not experimental enough or they're not the adventurous or whatever um how do you end these things I usually oh no just say whatever you want at this point this was this was terrible to Chester you 
7KSn_S1rMIU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here doing an album review what's kind of been building up to be a highly anticipated album review the new me on Indian LP actually and before we get into this I'm going to have Cal Church esta over there give us some pertinent background information on this on this artist Cal Church esta Thank You Anthony thank you at I discovered in my very extensive research that the Neon Indians are in fact not affiliated with India or Native Americans not the case instead non-indians is a dance music dance music electronic electronic ax accurate reporting as always counter gesture this new LP I'm not exactly sure what to say to me it kind of feels like just yesterday when everybody was was freaking out over the summer single deadbeat summer off 2009 psychic chasms that hope he wasn't perfect it was far from perfect they had a couple dud songs a couple of the tracks that I even thought were good were mixed really badly and and solo fine and shrill that I needed to turn the treble all the way down on my stereo in order to enjoy the track pipe aside I enjoyed psychic chasms for for what it was it was just a really light quirky fun pop record with a lo-fi recording I had some big expectations for this expectations that neon Indians kind of sole member Alan Paloma would elevate himself pasul chillwave thing past the hype of psychic chasms and bring something big and ambitious and sadly I I don't think that's happened for for the most part I kind of feel like this album is psychic chasms part 2 with a better recording because this album is not as lo-fi Neon Indian needs to figure out a way to make it kind of murky and he does that with reverb tons and tons and tons of reverb and it's like not even a good reverb it's like a shrill really synthetic reverb that doesn't even feel good and he buries a good handful of these songs so far into it that I'm not even really hearing the song I'm just hearing the effects I can't help but feel like there's really shy and apathetic aesthetic to this album not only in just how much reverb these songs are smothered in but in how mumbly some of the vocals are more mumbling out here than they were on psychic chasms plus I'm not really liking the the slight style change on this album to Neon Indian no longer feels like a little pop project or you're going to get a little bedroom rock project now Neon Indian kind of sounds like that haziness that we associate with chillwave mixed with Allen's other project Vega so basically this kind of shoegaze II dance music with really wonky synthesizers and very kind of bleepy blue pea 8-bit esque synths that remind me a lot of Crystal Castles they kind of feel like tracks that would soundtrack a dance party filled with people who are really too heavily sedated with opiates to actually dance their songs on here that kind of fizzle out abruptly their instrumentals that just go nowhere and tracks that kind of feel really rushed just like psychic chasms that album had those flaws too but the reason I kind of forgive that record is that it was funny at some points like I should have taken acid with you or it was really fun and catchy just like on deadbeat summer the fun light-hearted moods are kind of gone on this LP it feels more serious more mature and yet the way the songs on here are written and produced don't reflect that so yeah most of the time I just kind of felt shortchanged underwhelmed by these tracks and I didn't really find much of this thing to be memorable with this I'm really just left wanting more a lot lot more I'm kind of feeling a light too decent three on this was really underwhelmed by it but still I got ton of comments asking me to review it what did you guys think about it did you like it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana Neon Indian forever [Music] [Music] 
JGeLYl3kkmg,st. Vincent hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the new Saint Vincent LP st. Vincent is singer-songwriter Annie Clark as far as I can tell former member of The Polyphonic Spree and this is her third album under this name strange mercy the LP she came out with in 2009 actor this was not one of my favorite albums of the year but that's only because in 2009 I sucked at reviewing music and now I only suck at it a little bit less but after going back to that album and giving it a deeper listen and then listening to this thing there's such different albums to me let me know if you think the opposite but for me actor is kind of a very friendly record it's a very approachable record tracks like actor out-of-work stick out as being especially noisy and that's the kind of direction that this album moves in strange mercy is a weirder st. Vincent album but it hasn't lost the beauty that makes st. Vincent's music so good it's kind of turned into this odd mutant beauty now pretty much all these tracks function on a verse chorus verse thing it's an artsy pop album but there's like equal attention paid toward making these songs catchy and also making them kind of surprising take the the biggest single to come from the cell peak rule the track just opens up with these gorgeous string arrangements like closing credits at the end of a Disney movie gorgeous it sounds like a fairy tale with a fantastic beat but there's this really dark undertone to the song with the lyrics and and not only that but the the solo the guitar solo in this it's so ugly and distorted and just like broken sounding it's this intentional blemish on this really pretty song that song and the rest of the songs on here are just so like too they're really easy to get into but they'll turn right around and just sort of like fly a freak flag I think my favorite song on here though is dilettante and that song might be my favorite just because of how how weird it feels the drums are like stumbling they're stuttering like they're they're trying to get going but they can't and they're moving at this this slow pace and I'm just like on the edge of my seat waiting for them to go faster waiting for them to do something but yet they just hang back here and they played so sparsely and then all of a sudden just this this rush of distorted guitar and bass and piano just all hitting keys syncopated at once it's poppy and it's sweet but yet again it's like so harsh and abrasive it's like something I'd hear on a grinder man record or like a Tom Waits record I mean throwing all these really noisy elements these glitchy electronics - especially on the fifth track Northern Lights which I love it just feels like really liberating to me things don't have to be just pretty or just harsh and abrasive they can be both now this LP swings over to the softer side of things as well but it stays really alluring and it stays pretty weird - the title track I love the title track on here it's just really stark and cold and kind of painful surgeon has a really weird synthesizer landscape hanging in the background and I love how kind of robotic and mesmerizing the hook is on that track of the weird guitar leads and it just mm-hmm their morbid lyrics on this track about being cut open and that's one of the many darker lyrical moments that will buzz by you if you're just wrapped up in the music which I can understand because there's a lot going on musically on this album a lot of layers a lot of subtleties a lot of things you're gonna pick up with multiple listens but lyrics like convinced it was the end of times and and sharks swimming in the red no matter what kind of flavor or sound that a song is going for on this album that dark outlook is is one of the few strings that run through all the tracks I thought actor was we colorful album but this thing brings out way more color and not only that but the songs on here feel a little more polarized in that the more depressing moments are more depressing and the brighter louder noisier moments come off even more bold and that's a word I have to kind of bring it back to bold I would use that word to sum up a description of this album it is pretty bold it's got some very strong instrumentation surrounding these tracks it's got some strong vocals in a time when really light weak singers with not that much range are praised left and right in the indie community my only real gripe with this LP is there's a handful of tracks that do not come off as flamboyant or adventurous to me like the track neutered fruit it's a fine song but it kind of ends up sounding like a more pleasant version of a track from Dirty Projectors bit of Orca but aside from a few tracks that I just think are ok I can't say much negative about this album it pretty much does a perfect tightrope walk of being experimental and catchy it was really easy to get into and yet I don't feel like I'm listening to something sugary dumbed down or simple and most importantly it was just fun to listen to I think even coucher chesta had it had a fun time I can't really see much I might I'm not religious well there you go feeling a light too decent 8 on this loved it thought it was really good I recommend it which is why I'm making a video doing that what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana st. Vincent strange mercy forever [Music] 
axVo2kNjKXc,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the new wolves in the throne room LP celestial lineage these guys are a West Coast metal band who just about everybody seems to have an opinion on I'm sure Cal Church esta even has an opinion on them if you got wolves in your throne room you should probably call an exterminator hurry add dad catcher I hate counter chesta but seriously with these guys american black metal represent now these guys other than that with 2007's to hunters and the album that came before that diadem of 12 stars these guys were creating this this really vast an open style of black metal it sounded like a black metal ocean that's how massive these records sound atmospheric black metal isn't new at all it's not a new concept but these guys brought it to a different stylistic level to the point where it was almost like shoegaze music and these guys also kind of brought American black metal to a new level of popularity to it just kind of put black metal on the table as being a worthy discussion for people who weren't just black metal fans now is American atmospheric black metal was getting bigger wolves in the throne room went in a kind of different direction with their next LP black cascade there were still some effects on this album but wolves in the throne room stripped a lot of the reverb away and just put all the guitars drums and vocals in in plain sight it was a very kind of naked direction for the band now this new LP celestial lineage this feels like a much more kind of logical follow-up to two hunters everything that made 12 stars and two hunters unique records is back and kind of taken up to a higher level I feel like the female vocals on this album are spotlighted more their their lavish sound effects and field recordings and and chimes pop in a little bit there's a pretty noticeable synthesizers on here a spot where I think I'm hearing harp and some male choruses to the atmosphere from wolves in the throne rooms earlier work is back to it's not as high as it was on two hunters and twelve stars and I'm liking that because it's kind of made this LP feel more heavy than it is hazy but I have a pretty big gripe about this LP sometimes something that's really holding me back and keeping me from loving it I feel like these guys haven't really pushed themselves past their previous efforts to really kind of make this feel like a new album this to me kind of feels like an old album but with some slightly new additions the freshest out of all the tracks on here to me feels like the first song which starts off with these really kind of empowering female vocals has all these new righteous guitar leads that these guys haven't really explored yet but you know as beautiful as other tracks are like Woodland Cathedral where you've got these female vocals singing over a really kind of primal and sparse beat with these soft distorted guitars in the background it's not really like new territory for the band another track like subterranean initiation just comes on really hard but it feels like a little bit of deja vu for me wolves in the throne room throw some new sounds and ideas into a couple interludes on this album but outside of that I feel like they're pretty much aiming at the same target same exact target that they aim for on previous albums it's a target that I think they've already hit the bullseye on it makes me think of another American black metal band with third and fourth albums Agalloch their third LP ashes against the grain is way different than marrow of the Spirit not only did Agalloch change what production and what instrumentation they surround their songs with but they changed how they write their songs to wolves in the throne room on the other hand in my opinion are just kind of writing songs the same way that they have been it's like the same buildups same concepts the same anthemic asked melodies thrown in the same spots at the end of these same ten-minute tracks there are similar chord progressions too I feel like the only difference this time around is that it's done with with more volume and more layers and you know what that has its merits too consistency is important and if you're into wolves and the therm room sound then there aren't really going to be any potholes on this release for you and the thing is I like this - when I was listening to it it's not like I was scrambling to turn it off but then again if I was given the choice to listen to this or twelve stars or two hunters I'm going to opt for one of those two albums before this and those two albums already sit in my collection I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing thought it was decent like I said not really any potholes on this but it's not offering anything refreshing to me that makes me want to return to it but what do you think of this thing are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana wolves in the throne room celestial lineage forever you 
wFKoYmiTws4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most unshaven music nerd and it's time for an album review the men leave home these guys are a New York band this is their second full-length LP I heard a lot of people asking me to review this back in May when it came out I promised myself I would get to it eventually so here I am now if you're a punk fan if you're hardcore punk fan a noise rock fan if you've enjoyed albums like Ice Ages new Brigade that came out this year I think this is definitely something you need to try out these guys have a lot of good things going for them they recorded this LP to tape so the distortion the really saturated and compressed guitars are just really filthy their grimy the the distortion is is is really coarse it's the difference between you know rubbing some sandpaper on your hand and having your skull just like dragged across a hundred yards of asphalt the drums are booming the guitars are just abrasive they're loud there but what I think is really cool outside of the production is that there are three people in this band who all kind of share songwriting duties so this LP has a kind of schizophrenic make up with one song going in a completely different direction than the next the opening track does a heavy psychedelic kind of thing the third track goes into this noise punk thing with these dissonant interludes where these guitars all freak out and play these random leads blast track has the kind of driving post-punk repetition that that bands like the fall popularized the sixth track sounds exactly like a Fugazi song and the fourth is almost kind of like a doom metal track so there's a lot of variation among these tracks almost at the point where this album is is kind of scatterbrained the only thing that to me really links all these songs together is that no matter what different idea the men seem to be chasing after they just turn it all the way up to 11 and just do it in the most extreme way they possibly can in terms of volume in terms of noise in terms of speed in terms of energy so this is kind of led to an LP that has an interesting progression it's always switching gears and there's nothing more I hate than putting on an album the first few tracks are hard they're heavy they're loud they're maybe they're fast to their extreme and it's got me pumped and maybe like three or four tracks and I just start getting bored because all the songs sound the same not the problem here but I do have a major issue with this LP it's kind of a major issue while I don't really hate any of the songs here the guitar riffs the melodies a lot of them are just so bland and forgettable and just kind of like throwaway for me you know I know nothing is 100% original these days everybody is borrowing from somewhere but I just don't really find anything distinct about the guitar riffs that are used on a lot of these tracks they don't really stick into my head and most of the time they're just kind of giving me this this sense of deja vu I think it's something that should be checked out if you are into noise rock if you are into punk rock and post-punk I'm feeling at 6 on this but what did you think about it if you've heard it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana thank you for watching the men forever 
a9TwaFehPHo,he's the most thunderous cat around his name is Thunder cat bass solo it's an airbase Thunder cat oh hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here internet's busiest music a nerd and it's time for an album review the new Thundercat LP the Golden Age of Apocalypse Thundercat is bassist Steve and I first heard of him through a feature spot he had on Flying Lotus his last LP cosmic grandma Flying Lotus actually produced this LP and Steve also serves as the latest bassist for one of my favorite crossover thrash acts suicidal tendencies Steve isn't a part of the original lineup but still he's in this band and he also collaborates with Flying Lotus and now he has a solo LP of song after song after song of just these spacey a lek tronic jazz fusion tracks something is up something is here somebody who stretched themselves into so many styles and categories has to be doing something interesting now when I first came into contact with this LP I had kind of been fed up by being disappointed by a lot of releases coming off the label that this album is on brain feeder records so after a short listen I kind of discounted it but I was getting a ton of comments to review this thing so of course I had to give it a deeper listen and it wasn't long until I realized that I was actually enjoying what I was hearing a lot now if you're a bassist or you've hung out with bassists you've probably heard them say oh man you need to listen to some Jaco Pastorius man you need to listen to some Stanley Clarke dude and I've enjoyed that stuff I enjoy those dudes I enjoy the music they make but the style of jazz fusion they play even the style dude like George Duke would play a guy who under cat actually covers on this LP that sound is just so isolated in this old time period dudes like Marcus Miller and Victor Wooten and Stanley Clark are still alive they're still kicking still making music I think a lot of that stuff has just been stereotyped as being music for for musicians one of the only artists who I can think has branched kind of outside of that camp while still playing some kind of shade of jazz fusion is like square pusher who is combining that sound with with drum and bass in the 90s so because there's a lot of music out there like this already and I see it either being glossed over or people just aren't paying attention to it that's what makes this interesting to me this LP people are hyping it people are freaking out about it people are loving it and people are asking me to review it and I'm not saying it shouldn't be enjoyed I'd actually like to argue that this sticks out for good reason on this LP thundercat embraces an older smoother style of jazz fusion but execute it in a way that could have only been done in 2011 in a way that only could have been done with Flying Lotus producing this thing this LP makes this style like really fun and vibrant and alive again it's like hopping into a spaceship and rocketing through a jazz fusion galaxy loaded with stellar bass solos and fantastic grooves and some of the bass lines on here just so nimble and dynamic they're like doing backflips all over the place like on the song fleur ultra one of my favorite tracks on here I mean the bass line on that is just dizzying that track is more of a fast straightforward lean more orchestrated instrumental and then there are songs on here where Thundercat is actually singing in this very light falsetto I'm not totally into it I don't think it's the strongest vocal on the planet but when he does sing it's usually this winding jazzy melody that is so great that I just fall in love with what the vocals are doing anyway that's tracks like is it love and for love I come those are more like poppy catchy accessible moments where the vocals are really kind of leading the way and then again there are songs on here where they really kind of feel like jams like there's a lot of improvising going on tracks six to eight or kind of like that but there are a few moments here that I think maybe some people are not going to love right at first because they sound a little bit like they're just base exercises but the thing is spots like that are very few now aside from the vocals I think the only shortcoming of this album is that it's a little short a lot of these tracks feel a little short considering that Thundercat is such a strong bass player an improviser I think a lot of these songs could have been a minute longer a lot of these tracks sort of fade out or just end abruptly or really don't go on past the two-minute mark when for me things are just kind of getting started I think this thing could have explored a little bit more so so yeah my biggest complaint is I want more but outside of that I love the style I love the songs the recording is fantastic just the the the the rising instrumental crescendos they're just so gorgeous but even though I thought this thing was a little short of breath I do have to give it to Thundercat and maybe this has to do with with Flying Lotus producing that he's taken this style where you know it might not be uncommon to put out a 14-minute live track or something like that but he sort of pared it down to the two minutes three minutes four minutes and even though I wish it was longer it doesn't sound bad this thing was a really fun listen it's an enjoyable album I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this I liked it a lot didn't underwhelmed me at all I find this guy's playing really interesting if you consider yourself a jazz fan a fan of strong musicianship then got to check this out at least once Thundercat the Golden Age of Apocalypse what do you think of this LP love it hate it let me know Anthony Fantana Thundercat forever [Music] you 
MbLt2Qgl350,son Holy Ghost hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd time for a review the new girls out this is the third video I'm making about this California rock outfit and the road to this album has been a little rocky for me I'm still like completely head over heels for their debut album album it just kind of makes me want to take all of my money out of my bank account and then just fly to some island in the Caribbean and just see how long I can live there off of it it just feels really warm it's just filled with love I just feel all this love pouring out of that album and I love that now the EP that followed album I didn't I didn't really care for long story short I felt like the band had brought on all this new instrumentation and the personality of girls was drowning in that it it was a little colder a little more kind of professional I was hoping that this would not suffer from the same problems and and and it doesn't completely and even though I felt like you know he could have been a little bit higher you know just a little bit more out in front on the first track honey bunny it's nice to hear girls playing something really warm and fun and upbeat and kind of innocent again hello the pacing of that track too with the bright background vocals and the and the surf guitar and just just the bass line to it reminds me of the beach boy is doing a cover of Paul Simon's Kodachrome now one thing I like about album that continues on this LP is that it feels a lot like a mixtape and sometimes girls with the different styles that they try out on their albums just throw a surprising left hook and the first one to come on this album is definitely the song die to me that tractor sounds like a classic piece of hard rock heavy metal stoner rock there's just these really distorted guitar riffs it's something that I could see coming out of a Black Sabbath album or even like a Motorhead album before a girls album and though you know it's not the best take on the style that I've ever heard girls give this kind of stuff the the proper amount of energy and force it deserves and to me because they did that track they're just kind of it like another level of versatility for me now but the Everly Brothers influence that made so many of the tracks on album such Heartbreakers is still present on this thing thing thing thing its strongest on the track how can I say I love you I think it's my favorite song on here the lyrics are just so corny and mushy but the song it just has so much sincerity to it it's it's hard not to take it seriously and just kind of fall in love with it there are songs that feel even more sugary like magic and maybe they get a little too sugary for me these sugary moments on this album are matched with really depressing depressing lows like the first song to drop from this thing vomit so not only are these guys you know really covering a stylistic spectrum but an emotional one - because man even with the heavenly background vocals kind of hitting the mix every once in a while this thing just feels so dreary especially when the the the guitar leads start like banging into each other really chaotically and the and the distortion and the drums just coming really heavy the production the composition the new instrumentation girls are definitely more ambitious on this release even if I'm not really in love with with every direction they move into I think my least favorite moment on here has got to be just a song which starts off pretty well it's a nice tearjerker I love the keyboards in the background as as Chris is singing about the happiness being gone but what happens at the end the band like hits this bass line in this this drum roll and it just sounds like they've literally taken that moment where Chris is singing and that drum part and copied and pasted it in post-production again and again and again for two minutes straight there are a couple moments where the soulful backup vocals that seep into some of these songs I'm not totally into them it sort of just feels like a style clash or a mood clash for me thankfully for me the album ends kind of strong with Jamie Murray like the spotlight is on Chris Owens and just his guitar this track pretty much has everything that I feel like is missing from some of the previous songs everything that I loved about the songs on album it's just got a simple build the very complicated feelings it's got this relatable personality it's very sad but it's very friendly I don't love this thing as much as album but I do like it I like it a lot a lot of solid songs came out of this thing I'm feeling a light two decent seven on this but what do you think of this thing are you loving it are you hating it and if you are why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana girls album forever you 
e9cxD4xYB_M,drums hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching going to review an album here the new drums LP portamento this is the second time member viewing an LP from this new york band you can click there if you want to see my first review of the drums my first review from these guys is really positive and after they dropped the first single from this LP money I was pretty excited to see which direction they were going to head in with this album there's definitely a bunch of stuff on here that I expected them to change there's definitely some signs of growth but I was nowhere near in love with this overall the drums are still playing this really spunky hybrid of post-punk and indie rock and indie pop they still sound like Joy Division if they had a really upbeat disposition in my opinion anyway and the whole presentation on this thing comes off a lot less amateur it's a little more focused the singing is a lot less off-pitch the production is a little meteor there's some stronger hooks on here and the lyrics delve into some deeper topics here and there like about being broke and religion portamento doesn't feel as boyish it doesn't feel as silly and you're not really going to catch these guys on this album you know screaming out lyrics about going true in a way the band almost seems like more confident in their style to the point where they're not really deviating from this one kind of execution with these downstroke guitars downstroke bass and very simple drums but the way the guitars are like executed on this album constantly being down stroked in eighths and sixteenths all over some of these tracks really kills the momentum for me it kills the rhythm for me like on the track I don't know how to love instead of like propelling the song forward and making it feel like it's moving faster just has more tension to just kind of muddies up the sound because the guitars in the bass are kind of moving at it at a different pace than the drums are Zaher Zaher Zaher even when the band will bring in a keyboard or maybe even a violin like they do on one of these I'm still feeling like the vocals and the guitars and the drums surrounding all of that are just giving me this sense of deja vu just say me say me say me say me for me the self-titled debut had more posts to it it had more standout moments like you've got a really slow emotional spot like down by the water you've got something very fast and and silly and playful like best friend and you have another track that has sort of an acoustic intro like I'll never drop my sword there's a clear separation between these moments where on this new LP I mean you do have spots like searching for heaven where the band kind of goes on this on this synth Odyssey but but I guess it wasn't really the the kind of variation I was looking for the drums really kind of stick to their guns on this LP I can appreciate that they tried to flesh things out a little bit more with little extra instrumentation with a better recording quality but the way the tracks are executed the way they're put together the way they're arranged it's all just done in such a similar way I don't get much out of listening to this album all the way through I feel like I would enjoy it a lot more of these tracks I would enjoy them a lot more if they were nestled into some kind of shuffle among other bands and other songs I know it's only been like a year since these guys put out the full-length debut but for a sophomore album I was expecting more change I was expecting more growth and progress so not only am I seeing similarities between the tracks on this album but this LP doesn't really give me anything that the first album didn't already I guess it's just my opinion but but maybe the alterations I was looking for on this release will be on the next one it doesn't look like the drums are going anywhere anytime soon I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this it was alright it wasn't terrible it's just ok for me um but yeah that's how I'm feeling on the on the album and before we finish this video I want to say that uh that the needle drops intern Chris his internship is over so say goodbye bye maybe he'll be back let's but what do you think about this LP do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next and thanks for watching Anthony Fantana the drums portamento forever [Music] [Music] 
_Fh9EiKr9iU,come on mom dad bye hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review slow-mo and this is his according to the label that this album comes off of the full-length debut of this project but this is not shalom o's first rodeo there were some eps that came out before this a nice little compilation of new and old tracks and it's all built up to this an album titled bad vibes this dude is an electronic music producer from LA and he's heavily influenced by the beat music scene out there that's been getting a lot of press all over the internet this year there's just been no shortage of this stuff between flying lotus and his label brain feeder and basically any unsigned artist who can log on to Bandcamp and soundcloud and you know upload their own little EP or album of beats that they've produced on their laptop but thankfully this thing stood out to me it did not come on strong it's not a really bright album but it stood out nonetheless the first thing that i think is worth noting about this LP is just the really chill mood the chilled out atmosphere it's the most prevalent thing on this entire help it's just one soft pretty beat after another that sounds like this guy's been listening to a lot of downtempo from the 90s i wouldn't say this LP is ambient though it's kind of like relaxing beats for the foreground and there are a lot of points on here with this album actually reminds me of Bath's debut LP the strong percussion and the falsetto vocals that fans love from that thing also appear on this another thing about bad vibes that makes this thing stick out to me is the detail and the effort that i sense in these tracks a lot goes into these songs it's 13 different tracks on this thing and a lot of them land around the four-minute mark you're not going to be listening to another J Dilla copycat who's somehow thrown together twenty one minute beats in a day and they act like they're the first guy to do it the tracks on this thing don't just run around in a circle they have a point a a point B the beats change they shift new sounds introduce themselves different instruments pop up atmospheres layer on top of atmospheres the music just gets thicker plus a lot of the tracks here just have strong melodies good chord progressions and that kind of brings me to the style the the aesthetic the production of this album it's definitely a do-it-yourself affair and it doesn't embrace being do it yourself it doesn't embrace the bedroom aesthetic by being really low fire or really noisy or really messy or anything like that it embraces the sound by incorporating sort of everyday sounds that occur around us the percussive sounds on this album sound like they were recorded by like tapping or just sort of lightly pounding on a desk or just smacking pencils together snapping your fingers and a lot of the melodies on this are coming from acoustic guitar either being strummed or just a melody being played some electric guitar here and there baby xylophone birds chirping getting a sample on here on a track some melodic cut to slo-mo just has this really interesting way of taking the very quiet sounds that just occur in everyday life and making very beautiful music with them MacGyver beats that do a lot with a little their beats on a budget it's low volume bedroom funk now there weren't any tracks on here that I really hated but there were a good chunk of songs that just kind of breezed by and that's kind of the point of this album anyway to kind of be relaxing be kind of a place a setting to just chill out in there are spots on this LP that demand my attention a lot more though like I love the guitar chords the very pretty good power chords and the subtle groove on the track places I love the droning the booming the distorted guitar chords on trapped in a burning house it's kind of like Shlomo tried to create a little tiny baby son concert in whatever room he was recording this album in' and the cute little synthesizers the plinky dinky synthesizers that open up just us make me want to cuddle with my girlfriend there are more pretty moments than there are bland moments on this LP and that's obviously a good thing this thing is really consistent it's very ambitious considering how little it has to work with and it's very slow burning its beat music for people who like to stop and smell the roses there are some songs on here that I think get held back a little bit by how limited the resources are on bad vibes like a lot of the tracks where Shlomo is just kind of throwing out these falsetto vocals moaned into a microphone and then a bunch of reverb is thrown on them and that's only going to do so much for me especially considering that this guy's voices is not the strongest vocal in the world I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this what do you think of it 
rXgxJk5dBS8,tripper hi everyone welcome to the needle drop the YouTube channel most impersonated by ball boys cute girls and creationist cats I'm Anthony Fantan Oh Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review all right so here's an album I was really anticipating when I heard it was going to drop hellas tripper these guys are best known as a Sacramento drum and guitar duo made up of Zach Hill and Spencer see him sign say I'm Sam I am these guys pretty much can be credited with helping to keep math rock relevant into the 2000s by taking it to an extreme that their forefathers on this LP hella regresses they go back to that drum and guitar dynamic that they built the project on because if you remember in 2007 they were fleshing the hella sound out with a lot of new members new instruments on this album there's no 666 in outer space and I can really only guess that they they brought on new musicians because they didn't want the sound to stagnate especially for them I can imagine that Zach and Spencer would would need have this need to experiment because experimenting is is basically built into hell as DNA and after there's no 666 Zach and Spencer sort of broke off from Ella and indulge in a bunch of different side projects and I'm just happy to hear these guys back at home with hella kind of taking the things they've learned outside of the band experimenting collaborating and bringing it back to tripper the LP starts with the first track to drop onto the Internet from this album headless and I'm lovin the energy behind this track hella just has this insane ability to be extremely disorienting it can where it's welcome fast but I haven't listened to them in a while this album has been an excuse to so to me it's kind of a fresh visit you know I mean these guys sounds so disorienting on that track that the word disorienting doesn't doesn't really put it correctly it's an understatement it's so disorienting that they take the word disorienting and throw it down a mineshaft shake it violently hang it upside down for 48 hours then they throw it into a blender and then they waterboard it and that's pretty much what this album feels like the way the song is constantly starting and stopping on a dime and speeding up and Shh it's like a fun mental exercise and it just brings this intensity that makes these guys one of the more notable duo's since ruins or lightning bolt but what stinks is is is after the first track this album hits a little bit of a drought for me where a lot of songs are they're intense they're in my face they're energetic they're technical they've just got a lot of flash but they just kind of feel like you know just any old hella album I just feel like I've heard this before I've been here before it's not blowing me away I love the track you Bacoor which is surprisingly more melodic than a lot of songs on here but this album doesn't really get really interesting for me until like the second half where I start hearing some some some weird electronic effects and synthesizers laced into the music it kind of feels like the experiments Zach Hill was doing on his solo stuff they're kind of bleeding into this album in a good way in a way that kind of breaks the LP up a little bit the last three tracks on the album have some pretty nice melodies especially the last one Osaka which is it just has this really eerie feel to it and and Zach's drums aren't aren't muddying it up in the background so it comes across really clear and and catchy so the album has this you know a little bit more of a melodic finish hella on this album does have a lot of virtuosity the same virtuosity you would expect but they're showing a little bit more restraint I think but of course I have some gripes with this LP I do wish there was more variety on here just because the project is going back to Zack and Spencer doesn't necessarily mean that the instrumentation has to get pulled back too and the thing is when I do here extra instrumentation on here like when I do here some bass or I do here a little bit of extra guitar I can hardly hear it and it's not necessarily because Zack and Spencer are just playing so frantically the production on this album it's kind of bad everything feels so claustrophobic when Zack and Spencer are playing louder it doesn't feel louder it doesn't sound ladder it just kind of comes off really flat and cacophonous and a lot of the time the guitars are just feeling a little thinner and int in ear more brittle than usual for a hella album especially with the track on the record which kind of sounds like Spencer's playing his guitar through a McDonald's drive-thru talk box but you know I would have loved to have heard just a better mix with more range lower lows higher highs and just some more separation between the drums and the guitar so that they're they're easier to read I'm feeling a strong six on this but what do you think of this thing are you loving it are you hating it why and what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Phan tanto correct 
mk43w6R5vW4,Hey sorry about yesterday's video I'm using Final Cut studio now and making a lot of mistakes never used it before so hopefully in future videos smoother sale hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's we sziasztok nerd in it's time for an album review little Wayne's the Carter for I've gotten a ton of requests to do this LP and we also did this yesterday on yesterday's video had couch esta gives some background on the artists that we're reviewing I figure I'll do it again hopefully it'll be better this time cow Thank You Anthony thank you for having me on once again a hurry little Wayne is a a rhymer he rhymes over beats and his new album is the carter i we which is a a double and tandra a deeper meaning if you will about the Ivy League Ivy League education which is why you see the child and the front of the record cover with the murder guard in the graduation gown he just gets better and better at that doesn't he so a lot of you have probably already heard this LP I've gotten a ton of requests for it but usually the requests for this album come tagged with oh it sucks or you're gonna hate it or tear it apart and I wasn't looking forward to listening to this album I would have rather you know kind of passed by it especially after hearing little Wayne go auto-tuned white guy strumming a guitar in a coffee shop while wearing a scarf on the song how to love and I listen to this but I'm not seeing the reason for all the hate isn't this the kind of stuff the little Wayne has built the young money brand on simple poppy beats a southern feel poppin bottles money jewels sex really shallow emotions and when it tries to be emotional it's like funny too many features no consistency a lot of auto-tune and just pretty much a focus on the singles I really got a call bullshit on this and not on little Wayne not on this album but on music fans who have been praising him but are now turning around on this albumen and saying it's bad and I think little Wayne is actually kind of taking a bullet from music fans who will critique him but then turn around and like praise artists who are either copying his style or the style of artists who he fronts on Young Money Records like little B childish gambino The Weeknd various members of Odd Future if you love the party raps and the cheesy brags and the plastic production and the hedonism and the forgettable quotables that these guys throw at you you should be opening your wallet and shelling out your money for a copy of this thing I would say something like it doesn't make sense but it actually does because little Wayne makes bubblegum pop rap and the thing about bubblegum is that it tastes really good but everybody knows that nobody swallows it me personally I've never really taken little Wayne seriously so that actually kind of helped me with liking a lot of parts on this album I didn't expect a lot I didn't get a lot so I was disappointed and some of his lines as cheesy as they can be they stick in my head hear no evil see no evil Helen Keller to me it's just a fun popular sound I love the Southern Fried beats on Mega Man and especially six foot seven foot which has a repeating vocal sample from Harry Belafonte's day oh the way it's executed is almost genius and I love little Wayne's flow on that one he sounds like almost deranged on liking that track for a lot of the same reasons that I like a lot of tracks on Danny Browns new release but you know what it's like not long before I start getting annoyed with tracks on this album like blunt blowing and nightmares of the bottom they're decent songs but for some reason like little Wayne is totally ripping off Drake's style and I have no clue as to why he's rapping with the same exact inflection Drake's even featured on the track she will and Wayne and Drake it's almost impossible for me to tell the difference between the both of them on the song but if you really want to hear things go downhill on this album listen to how to hate featuring t-pain and I know that guy was important when it came to popularizing auto-tune and of course he brings it on this track the way t-pain is using auto-tune the way it's mix the way it's processed I'm not sure what it is but it sounds like a test of the emergency broadcast system it does it hurts these it just like hurts more and more and more until my ears and a burning like they have an STD and the song abortion is definitely one even though the song how to love is more deserving of the title the track President Carter is pretty much a laughable attempt at it being political and deepened and meaningful I would rather listen to little bees point of view on the world this LP is pretty much just like every other little Wayne LP it's about portraying an image chasing popular sounds making money putting out singles there are tracks where bun B and tec-9 and Andre 3000 and nas and Busta Rhymes show up to throw verses out but but who cares though I like their contributions it's not like these guys are actually saving the album so I'm feeling a light too decent three on this album not the worst thing I've heard this year but it's definitely not doing anything for me not even close but what do you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana little Wayne the Carter for [Music] 
QTR2Gxt4Hmc,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd time for an album review and I can't ignore the requests any longer so I'm going to give the people what they want a review of the new Red Hot Chili Peppers album I'm with you for me the whole underground vs. mainstream argument dynamic it's it's not really there in the internet age it's no longer relevant in my head there's just two kinds of music there's music I like and there's music I don't and I used to like the Red Hot Chili Peppers back when I was a kid I grew up on those guys I remember playing one hot minute tape cassette in my boombox all day and I used to freak out whatever cuts from blood sugar sex Magik would come on the radio but my infatuation with them didn't really last all that long I guess and not that they had betrayed me or disappointed me or anything like that I was just into different sounds once I reached high school in college I wasn't following what these guys were doing I was listening to a lot of punk music and a lot of metal music so if this review doesn't have the kind of insight and experience that you wish it had remember you requested it you did and another thing that gets a lot of requests is that I should let kouchuu chesta review an album and I'm not exactly sure I'm ready to let that happen especially since he's Cal Church esta but what I will do right now is just sort of let him give some background information on the band Thank You Anthony at the band the Red Hat chilapa no pepper is a super-duper group rack rack music that's very funky with a lot of bass like dome dome the dome and their first album came out before Anthony was burned and California thank you thank you like cake or Foo Fighters the Red Hot Chili Peppers is another one of those radio rock bands that hit it big in the 90s but have somehow managed to stay relevant stay whole and stay producing music well on past 2010 and the latest LP from these guys I'm with you comes at kind of a pivotal change for the band their longtime guitarist John Frusciante has left the group and has been replaced by another guitar player josh klinghoffer now if you're Red Hot Chili Peppers fan you already know how monstrous of a guitar player in a musician John Frusciante is and you know that when he rejoined the band in the late 90s he just sort of brought this ambition necessary to make double albums like stadium arcadion switching from John to Josh has meant a change in dynamics for these guys but Red Hot Chili Peppers with this album seem kind of determined to not let that be the downgrade that everybody is expecting it to be the strengths and weaknesses are different now and they sort of realign the way they make records accordingly the really flashy strong fiery guitar playing a lot of chili pepper fans have come to love is not on this record and he'll like even fleas bass lines have been kind of dumbed down a little bit purposely intentionally in order to make an album that's a little more accessible a little leaner a little more straightforward little catch here and of course among all these tracks these guys kind of jump from one stylistic idea to another because of that I think this is the kind of record that's really going to resonate most with with hardcore fans that have followed the Chili Peppers up until this point there's really standout tracks on here some of the nicest I've ever heard from this band but still there are moments on here where are these guys indulging in bossa nova in a piano ballad in an acoustic guitar intro like a trumpet solo handclaps in the background there's even a song on here where Anthony Kiedis is like doing these really shouty narrated verses these guys are basically taking advantage of this lineup change to step into a lot of different territories and I think that's something a hardcore fan would be more interested in seeing these guys really experiment because you're familiar with their sound you're familiar of what their capabilities are so maybe you want to see them do something different but I would have preferred something a little more consistent the first track that I think I really loved on the album was Brendan's death song which opens with an acoustic guitar kind of starts off to be a ballad I assumed at first and then Anthony Kiedis is vocal I'm not praising his lyrics but his vocal style is still really strong still really you can pick it up just about anywhere and he hasn't lost it but what I love most about that track is that it builds which makes it so much more different than any other song on the album as it switches from verse to chorus diverse to chorus the instrumentation behind the song is just getting louder and louder and more tense and just more there's more passion there are more layers and the bridge breaks into this like psychedelic garage freaked out that I might hear on a Stooges album or something and despite the fact that there are some changes on this album there are moments that just sound great are really catchy and just sound like kind of classic Red Hot Chili Peppers like Ethiopia one of my favorite moments on here where Anthony Kiedis isn't so much singing lyrics but just kind of making these vowel sounds with his mouth and it ends up being catchy ER then then any set of words could have been and toward the end this LP meet me at the corner I think that's one of the best slower songs that these guys have ever written though a lot of fans are going to cry over John Frusciante leaving I think the guitar playing on that track from from Josh he really shows some prowess he really shines on that track with the chord progression with the fluttering the embellishments he plays just the tone of his guitar just how nice and rich it sounds but it seems like for every spot on this thing I love there's a spot that that I that I hate to be completely honest there there are some songs on here where I feel like Anthony Kiedis though I think his voice right now is the strongest and most definitive thing that this LP has going for it there can be times where he's like lyrically off-base for me like on Raindance Maggie the first track to drop from this LP and the last track on the album dance dance dance dance dance and there are plenty of other songs on here that feel like Red Hot Chili Peppers they feel like classic Red Hot Chili Peppers they have that same momentum you would expect from a Red Hot Chili Peppers song but it's just not as hot it's just not as bold now overall I think I could have handled a record from these guys that that tailored things back a little bit that would have been fine my biggest issue with this LP is that it's just so all over the place with the moments of bossa nova with the piano ballads I'm with you just kind of seemed like a little scatterbrained for me a lot like The Strokes last album unfortunately I think this could have been a more consistent a stronger record my opinion overall I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this it wasn't bad it wasn't offensive there were some great highlights but a lot of moments where I was just left hanging but what do you think about this you asked me what I thought I don't know what you think do you love it do you hate it are you a hardcore longtime Red Hot Chili Peppers fan what do you think of this and respect to everything else they've done let me know Anthony Fantana Red Hot Chili Peppers Bret [Music] you you 
d8kP_uGxNfc,hey guys Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd as you may already know that hurricane that hit Connecticut has already passed and unfortunately we withstood some damage powers out unfortunately probably not going to be able to make any vids for a while so yeah what you doing in the derrick I hate you I hate you so much we're gonna do an album review of this self-titled Giles Corey LP okay I suppose this is a pretty good album to be reviewing right now post-hurricane Giles Corey this album I've had a physical copy and a copy of the book that comes with it for four months now I was sampling it here and there and coming back to it and it just wasn't like clicking you know it wasn't clicking with me not because it was bad but it's really hard to digest piece of audio there's a lot to think about a lot to consider even if you're not taking the book into account there are moments on here of of noise and drones and field recordings and also shoegaze e-rock and acoustic ballads and gospel like dirges with soaring background courses the entire LP is soaked in this really eerie atmosphere and stylistically it's like all over the place but I would expect nothing less from the guy who's behind this album Connecticut musician Dan Barret his biggest project have a nice life has been just as varied in how many flavors it takes on from post-punk to noise and drone to industrial rock and I think the projects outside of this that Dan's been involved with have been pretty interesting too novel ear for one which saw him diving into dark ambient music into black metal as well it wasn't as well-received does have a nice life but if you're in a depressive black metal like SAS there or something like that it's at least worth checking out now there are a lot of tracks on this thing that are not about having a catchy tune or anything like that it's more about atmosphere noise just texture style you've got to take some of the songs on here and maybe this entire album as an experience or maybe a full spectrum or picture of a certain emotion or feeling for the most part I thought this album was pretty creepy pretty haunting and it all starts off with with the haunting presence first track that song to me sounds like listening to souls from beyond the grave screaming lyrics against a really somber piano phrase and there's this like this rising noisy deafening sound kind of just like swelling up in the background in it and it's slowly like choking the entire song it's like indescribable it's like a field recording from another dimension this whispering vocal comes up and just sort of introduces itself as these larger-than-life bass drums or pounding pounding pounding like knocking on this gigantic gateway or something and it's like all of a sudden the door just opens just flies open and all these horrible like mutilated faces are screaming all at once against this organ pumping out these sinister chords it's pretty disturbing and sick and the whole track is followed by this really tortured tortured screaming and slamming hands against a piano it's pretty freaky this song and a lot of this album is like bringing Dan's capabilities as a singer-songwriter together with a lot of the experimental sounds and drones from that novel ear record there are other tracks on this LP that have kind of similar swells like I'm not going to do it it's kind of like being suffocated really slowly by depression there are some more accesible moments on here too kind of had these more experimental ones out I know I'm more partial to the experimental tracks on this album but I don't think everybody is going to feel that way so luckily there are some acoustic ballads on here that remind me a lot of grizzly-bear actually that album yellow house in that you've got these very kind of straightforward acoustic songs but they're just matched up with it with a sea of reverb and background vocals empowering and just making it seem bigger than what it really is but in a way it also kind of reminds me of Mount Airy it's produced in a way that's messy but kind of lends it this unique style that you're not going to find anywhere else Dan Barrett's production style like on have a nice life like on novel ear some of the sounds on here that get louder really over modulated kind of overblown some of the guitars feel kind of thin and tinny a lot of vocals in the background when they're being multi-tracked and singing in courses they assemble a little lazily and like I said about the reverb there's tons of it but enough music translates through it so I can actually hear what's going on you know it's not like I'm losing the song in the reverb plus Dan loads this atmosphere with lots of subtle textures and just interesting sounds that I pick up a little bit more of them every time I revisit this album it's like an Easter egg hunt or something now this book is kind of like a different story a lot of pages a lot of text a lot of pay pictures as well like previous projects dan has been involved with themes of this album revolve around depression death suicide but there's sort of an added element of the occult and the afterlife and ghosts involved with this a lot of the pages on here kind of in a way look to give the reader some kind of existential crisis but when it's not doing that the the words on this thing kind of followed the exploits of someone I assume Dan made up because when I google this guy pretty much all links go to this album the man's name is Robert for like any good piece of fiction this book takes what is not real and routes it so deeply into what Israel that it kind of blurs those two worlds so in a way I'm convinced he's real his obsession with the afterlife death and the occult they're real I'm convinced that the hood wearing cult that he led into the woods that was real there are points on this book that reference back to particular spots on this album which actually kind of made this LP go from being creepy - like frightening for me when Dan was talking about the vores head device which is this weird hood that I alluded to earlier which is supposed to be giving members of this of this cult like visions connection to the afterlife something like that and Dan explains wearing this hood and getting axe to the piano and just like having this freakout session that got recorded to tape and then it's thrown onto this album Plus for me it was pretty great to get a look into the lyrical side of this album by looking at the pages of this book like the song spectral bride is pretty much about being so depressed that you want to commit suicide but you have this loved one that you've left behind that you want to be with romantically so you know you die but you're still with that person as like a ghost the context and the ideas that this book brings they're fine they're good I think they empower this album a lot I like the fact that this album is named after Giles Corey who was a colonial American who was killed during the Salem witch trials and was basically put to death via getting crushed by stones because he refused to plead guilty or not guilty to the witchcraft charges he was faced with and on this album and in this book Dan pretty much puts himself in Giles place but instead of being crushed by rocks he's being crushed by this story about Robert war ideas and obsessions with death in the afterlife and and suicide and of course depression to all of that is crushing down on him now is this book necessary to enjoy this album probably not on some level I think a lot of people are going to enjoy this album even without the book but we're living in an age where for some reason people are more interested in what goes on behind the scenes with albums and and just sort of what makes albums tick and what inspires albums if you really want to see what made this album what it is the book is a must sonically I think the only issues that I really had with this LP there were a lot of points where I was hearing like synth horns and that's like possibly one of my least favorite sounds on the planet I feel like the last track on the album there could have been a little bit more to it it could have been a little bit more climactic or something but I love this thing I love the concept I love the way it made me feel because after I read the book after I sort of took the album in it just kind of made me feel paranoid about everything so if you're in the mood for an album that is going to depress you a little bit yeah I think it's a pretty ambitious work and would love to know what you guys think of it if you've heard it love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next feeling a light to decent eighth on this thing loving it I know I've been pretty positive in my in my most recent reviews and it's because I have a lot of music that's worth praising don't you think Anthony Fantana Giles Corey forever you [Music] 
oGO4NB57E5k,Liss hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest friggin music nerd not to win a review today not doing a question or track review anything like that we're doing a list a list that i compiled with somebody who's been hanging out with me on a regular basis for the past several months his name is Chris he's the needle drops intern he's over there right now in the official tnd intern pain got an intern this is my zone just share the space I'm going to list off three albums from this list and Chris over there is going to be reporting over there from the from the intern pen because there's clearly not enough room over here um this is a list of albums which in my opinion and Chris's opinion are way ahead of their time um I want to start this length cow was with they like this bed joy I am very happy I know what you mean I mean the happy feelings is that happy being not really no not actually why would they knew themselves Joy Division if they're not happy or divided masses I get it okay Chris Chris get over here over here from here don't don't talk to him nothing good can come of that alright we're going to start I'm gonna let Chris start with it with a with a with an LP from from his list okay Chris Chris take us off album that's ahead of its time according to you go well the first album that came to mind when I was thinking of this list topic was the modern lovers self-titled debut album which came out in 1976 but it was actually recorded three years prior the album is really a collection of demos that were just recorded by the Massachusetts band you know in 1973 and then later were you know put together for include on an LP but even for like 1973 these songs are like really Punk sounding they are they're not and not only Punk sounding but they actually have that kind of jangling indie rock style that many bands would later use in the 80s hmm all right so you're starting off with that I'm going to start off with the first Violent Femmes LP self-titled Violent Femmes album I don't know if anybody's heard the entire LP but I figure most people have heard blister in the Sun that album was so ahead of its time that band didn't actually get popular until the night that's right I mean the record is so 90s that it didn't get popular until the 90s when I believe they they kind of came out with a compilation of kind of their best songs and blister and the Sun just instantly became a radio hit but the thing is and I remember growing up with that song and until I really researched the Violent Femmes I I always assumed they were just like a 90s band you know but then I totally freaked out when I heard that this album was recorded in 1983 you know it's it's like this full Punk post-punk record but also has these really whiny angsty emotions that you really wouldn't hear in sort of like regular rotation in the indie scene until guys like Elliot Smith Conor Oberst and Simon Joyner yeah you know or even like the mountain goats or something yeah that okay what's what's the next record for you when Talking Heads 1988 album remain and light is definitely another album that came to mind when I was thinking about this topic that came out 1980 yeah okay I thought it was just maybe a few years later to know as 1980 all right so what puts that album ahead of its time for you well it's interesting that you mentioned you know that you thought it came out later because it actually that album has a lot of sort of new wave sounds that didn't really become popular until you know later in the eighties but I think what's actually most sort of revolutionary about it is the way that it was produced from what I understand from when I research the LP before I mean he used a lot of looping on that open yeah that's right they just like took a lot of riffs and they just repeated them over and over and over again that's exactly right the band would go into the studio and record you know simple all loops that gorgeous feet yeah exactly they would just be looped over and over again in the song and when you think about how difficult it was to produce those to implement those techniques at a time I mean it's really admirable they went on you know and David Byrne went on to do the same thing the next year with my life in Ocean Grove yeah alright I'm going to move on to to my next pick not really an album kind of a collection of singles it comes out from two guys to New York guys double D and Stein ski lessons one through three these were like Girl Talk before there was even Girl Talk they were making dance mashups of you know of hip hop songs at the time of dance songs the time just pop music songs radio pop at the time not only did this stuff you know kind of set a bar for albums that would come on later that also extremely extremely used sampling to get by like Beastie Boys Paul's Boutique definitely a something ahead of its time in hip hop well my last pick was actually one that took me kind of a while to think of it was a record that sort of struck me as odd when I first heard it but never really gave it that much thought in terms of how its influenced what came afterwards or you know how ahead of its time it sounds Scott Walker of course that yeah do that too yeah Chris I'm talking about Scott Walker's the third album at Scott three many people regard Scott four as sort of the the magnum opus of his you know more accessible early career period but I actually think Scott 3 has a more experimental edge when listening to you know a group like Radiohead you know if you take an album like kid a and hear this I remember hearing those strings on how to disappear completely after listening to the Scott Walker record and thinking wow that really sounds exactly like you know the string some of the strings on that Scott Walker album all right here's my last pick for this list something that's ahead of its time got to be the first mission of Burma EP signals calls and marches these guys if I remember correctly are a Boston Massachusetts band and a lot of the sounds a lot of the tempos and the tapes and and sonic experiments that were happening in the background of some of those tracks just a lot of the abstract lyricism coming especially from Roger Miller just reads to me as artists like Sonic Youth you know it's like to think that the songs on this EP came out in 1981 yeah it's just really kind of difficult for me this is just really out of place considering what year this stuff was coming together um yeah those are those are our six six releases of note that we thought were incredibly ahead of their time just going to leave it at that anything else to to say well thanks to the the guys on the forum who ended up suggesting that that topic that was a yeah yeah it was a good one I'm positive that there are more releases that are ahead of their time but you know maybe that's a list for some other time Anthony Fantana Chris 
aAKCV2xq4ak,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most apathetic music nerd and my throat hurts today but I don't care don't care I'm here so apathetic at this point that I don't really care about album reviews I don't care how this dude is well I empathy is a a wrapper for a connect I can connect Ike how dough hurts I'm from Connecticut you can't even see where we live right gonna get a ticket couch esta is right apathy is a Connecticut wrapper and this is his third LP it's titled honky Kong and if that wasn't enough of a hint he's white like me this guy's career goes way back back to the 90s back to 1997 where his first feature was on the first Jedi Mind Tricks album and digging through this dude's past was a little bit of a nostalgia trip for me just kind of reminding me of a lot of hip-hop that I used to listen to in the early 2000s 7l and esoteric Lewis logic and this crew that apathy runs with the demigods and over the course of his career apathy has been kind of like a snowball just rolling down this hill and picking up friends connections features and all of them come together and help him make this album what it is longtime allies show up on this album like self-titled and ill bill and Vinnie Paz who actually have a new collaborative album out and even more people come out of the woodwork for an eighth feature posse track toward the end of the album this dudes momentum has gotten so huge that there's even a feature with exhibit on this album another hot commodity from New York right now Action Bronson is even on a track and DJ premier produces a beat for this guy as far as the beats go on this LP it shoots for kind of a classic boom bap style but with a more updated feel it's definitely not as gritty as things used to be in the 90s bored but this album still shoots for some thing really straightforward and raw there's some great moments where guitars are sampled on this album I love the horns and sinister strings that show up on the opening track honky Kong and I think my favorite sample on the entire album are the really low evil villainous vocals chopped and looped on the song the villain of course there's DJ scratches all over a lot of these tracks and there are some moments like on the recipe where this album gets kind of a little more electronic in the beats but it doesn't get soft in the process makes that transition pretty smoothly of course there are tracks on here to where you're gonna catch funk and soul samples overall it's not really anything all that inventive to be honest the beats do the job you know overall what really makes this album for me are the lyrics apathy so on this thing doesn't really come off really intricate technical or flashy he makes up for that by being really consistent and real and bringing a lot of charisma to the table he's always very articulate and clear and vivid with the imagery that he's putting together whether he's being aggressive funny or like emotional they're a good chunk of like braggadocious tracks on here some of them sink and some of them float the first track comes on really hard just like a first track on an album like this should and app these laying down these hilarious lyrics about the kind of people that come out of the woodwork for music like this and he's rapping about girls with stretch marks and love handles and no money who swear they're like playboy bunnies but tracks like fear itself or albino gorillas or even Never Say Never the hooks get pretty bad and the beats are just okay and the lyrics just aren't great enough to save the song you know where this album really shines are on the more conceptual tracks that are more lyrical or have a narrative thankfully that's most of the tracks here I love the track of the villain where basically the whole theme is to just talk about villainous things politicians pedophiles demons pollution and I love the apathy can have a guest emcee on that track and they link up with the concept of the song and actually carry it out collaboration check to check is about being broke as hell and I love the Outkast sample on that song the recipe with exhibit is great where most of the lyrics are acronyms it's only hip hop is a fantastic song about pretty much fans being a little crazy a little obsessive and pretty much apathy coming out and saying look I'm just a person you're making a pretty big deal out of this and that's not something that you know over a great beat with some great lyrics you usually hear a rapper say I haven't heard it done to this extent since like that Eminem song Stan I dedicate this to you is a love song that pretty much goes off without any hitches it gets a little corny but it does the job but the song that was nearest and dearest to my heart was peace Connecticut a straight up rap song about Connecticut and it's really something anyone and everyone from Connecticut should hear from calling Willimantic Connecticut heroin town rapping about grinders north face jackets good old Tom it should make anybody who lives in this state feel a little bit of CT pride there are some moments on this LP in the lyricism in the beats where this feels like you know a typical rap album it feels very typical of hip-hop but thankfully apathy has great taste and beats a really strong personality and enough lyricism to make this album feel like more than that as a whole you can call me CT biased that's fine but I don't think this dude would be attracting the kind of features and the attention that he is if this was just a Connecticut thing I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this liked it a lot I wish it it ventured more I wish it experimented a little bit more but apathy is more of a guy who brings it straight from the gut doesn't take himself too seriously and comes with a lot of energy if you've heard this LP let me know what you think love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana apathy honky Kong forever 
DPeE28Fb_L8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a review Danny Brown xxx aka 30 and I know this is a hip-hop review I'm sure I'm going to see some comments that are all like the needle drop reviews too much hip-hop when I can't help but the hip hop is killing it this year I can't help that I'm just following my ears you know what do you want me to review so a lot of people have been asking me to review this thing and I'm glad I checked it out I'm glad I did I might have actually slept on this because the first time I ever heard of Danny was last year when he came out with his album the hybrid he emailed me a page where I could stream the whole LP in full its it's an email I'm sure he sent to a lot of blogs he said something like pitchfork took a whack at my album you should too I liked his flow I was kind of into his voice at the time but I just had a hard time seeing what the big deal was I didn't like a lot of the beats on the album here's some tracks from some mixtapes that he's released before the hybrid but definitely after this there was some kind of revelation some kind of change outside of Danny Browns now kind of Skrillex looking haircut on 30 Danny is coming out with tracks that are really raw disturbing personal like almost too raw disturbing and personal to me this is kind of like hip hop's version of dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde but you get way more mr. Hyde than you do dr. Jekyll on the cell P Danny wraps about the usual kind of rap cliches you know just greed misogyny money violence bragging about himself about his mic skills making really kela similes everywhere but like the Death Grips album that came out earlier this year he takes all these ideas and brings them to such an extreme they kind of become parody it's a kind of cartoony embrace of drugs and violence that reminds me of Eminem back when he was kind of in his prime and when I say cartoony the dude does sound kinda silly and it's not just because Squidward is the first pop-culture reference on this album it's his voice he just has this really odd whiny inflection when he's rapping it's something he kind of puts on you know and it may take a little bit to adjust to it's not something that you you may necessarily just fall in love with on first listen but for me it was semi easy the way that he just throws his voice everywhere and just kind of sounds like he's going a little bit wilder than he really is kind of makes me think of him as a really skinny high-pitched old dirty bastard but during these more kind of dr. Jekyll moments on the album he is rapping in a more normal inflection a more accepted inflection this album is 19 tracks almost an hour and I'm not going to lie you may be tempted to turn it off as soon as it starts but if you're in hip-hop music stick with it because the full punch doesn't come until the end of the album when the bigger picture kind of comes into view on the first chunk of this album the beats are really sparse odd electronic a lot of atmospheric sense hanging in the background something I could almost hear like little be spitting over a little bit the track died like a rockstar has these really fuzzy bass notes hanging in the background and the lyrics on that track are pretty much about these excesses that Danny raps about kind of bringing him to an early end and that's the character he plays here the character is excessive but not necessarily stupid like on the track radio song which is a pretty clever piece of satire where Danny is pretty much spitting in the face of commercial rappers with a very Annoying hook intentionally annoying and the song bruiser Brigade comes out really violent almost in a parody of violence sounding kind of like a waka flocka flame track and even referencing him in the process but as weird as Danny gets I feel like maybe there's a little bit of Danny in all of us because he was pretty much reading my mind on the song I will the first part of it you got a listen to the tape to figure out what that songs about so as Danny comes out with this really eccentric personality he's droppin lines that are so hilariously quotable like the Virgin Mary snorting coke certain parts of the anatomy tasting and or smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos or tropical fruit skittles crapping on someone's mixtape literally giving a girl's jaw stretch marks and the beats match this weirdness like the weird bleep II blue penis on the track outer space or that very high-pitched noisy whine on Detroit 187 the party on this album though is kind of over once it all comes to a head when Danny drops a track referencing one of his favorite drugs adderall before that track the entire album was kind of like the high it was the high and after that everything just drops into a depression after this point Danny is rapping in a more normal inflection and he drops a track called DNA where he's rapping about how his addiction is like hereditary and kind of coming to terms with it rapping about losing family members and friends and pretty much like letting go of his life but I la I love the ending of this album where Danny is back to his weirder character he's back on the drugs he's having an emotional meltdown his entire life is melting down he's overdosing on pills paramedics are trying to revive him he's rapping about fool's gold finally signing him and it's just a really hectic ending to this thing on this LP there are a lot of moods Styles sounds layers and personality it comes on strong it comes on kind of weird to don't listen to this and just observe it at the surface scratch below interpret think observe and enjoy I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this I think it's great there were some tracks here that underwhelmed me a little bit toward the middle of the album but strong start and strong finish but what do you think of this thing loving it hating it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana dan brown forever you you 
KXUyCz1rYM0,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's most active music nerd and it's album review time active child you are all I see active child is the project of singer-songwriter Pat grossie this is his second LP under the name this thing pretty much began as an ethereal bedroom recording project with a lot of laptop and synthesizer in the mix and there wasn't really much to separate it from pretty much everybody else who was making music in the room with a laptop and a synthesizer but even at the start of this project Pat had a pretty unmistakable vocal very heavenly very sweet I wasn't surprised to find that this guy actually has a background singing in choir when I was reading up a bit on this project it's one EP and kind of an entire year later and we've got this you are all i see and this album comes with some really big improvements ambitions and sounds all of these changes all of these great sounds are apparent right from the start of the album with pat's vocals they just sound like rays of sunshine breaking through clouds of harp arpeggios these analog synthesizers kind of starts swelling in the background and it's given me kind of an 80s vibe why but overall it's kind of like a dreamy pop opera a dream popera it's all very fine and pretty and delicate a lot like an antony and the johnsons song but a lot less eccentric and not implying arts enos in every direction possible I love the sounds on the track and most of the sample might do but it's not like the opener really has a song that I'm blown away by you know it's it's it's more like a pile of really pretty sounds like butterflies just fluttering about not really a direction more of a mood but my favorite two tracks on the album come next and they stick out like sore thumbs this LP because they are very very different they're wrapped up in the same shimmering and glistening production as the other tracks on this LP pretty much the same instrumentation but the execution is different and that execution is experimental R&B something that a fan of the weekend or maybe even how to dress well could appreciate and I know I have reviewed albums from those projects and I didn't really dig them but I am digging this these tracks just really have very smooth beats lovesick lyrics honey-flavored vocals and they're all just filtered through this active child lens with lots of atmosphere and reverb inand pretty acoustic ethereal instrumentation just swarming around it like fairies how to dress well is even on one of these tracks and active child throws a little bit of a gritty loaf I ish sound on his voice just kind of maintain that maintain that same aesthetic that he had on his full-length LP but what I love about the sounds here is that the beats are better the synth our betters everything is a better sound I would love to hear these guys collaborate again in the future maybe on an EP maybe on an entire full-length I think that would be amazing active child departs from the R&B stuff after these two tracks and that makes me kind of sad because they're really the high points of the album I'm not saying the rest of the tracks are bad they just kind of evoke different imager you know they make me kind of feel like I'm floating through space or ascending to heaven or listening to something that would be put on at a cult meeting there are some tracks on the latter half of this LP I do love though like High Priestess which is this very bleak atmosphere kind of art pop song in the vein of Peter Gabriel or especially fever ray considering how many weird chorus effects are on the vocals on that track the track way too fast is lyrically as lovesick as some of the R&B songs on here but the vocals feel way colder way more electronic and that's kind of empowered by a lot of synthesized zehrs in the background a very steady rigid beat and the vocal melody sounds a little bit like something James Blake would even sing and hearing those really kind of passionate vocals fed through the vocoder that active child uses on that track it's really kind of freaky it's like hearing a robot trying to a moat a lot like that movie bicentennial man with Robin Williams where Robin Williams is a robot and he wants to become a human I guess my problem with the very end of this LP is that active child in my opinion just kind of runs out of ideas a little bit and is recycling them and that doesn't make the songs terrible to me it just makes them a little less exciting a little underwhelming that's all I'm feeling a decent too strong six on this I liked it but definitely not in love with it what do you think of this if you've heard it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana active child forever you

dnYa0GqNk8M,Africa high-tech hi everyone Anthony there's a moth that Fanta no friend to no one hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd friends with everybody and it's time for an album review thank you for watching some of you who are watching this video may be new to the channel because this channel just got featured on youtube.com slash music which put a smile on my face like this so to those of you who are new or maybe just don't know yet and have been subscribed for a while the point of this channel is to introduce you to music you may not have heard of yet hmm that sounds nice just think of it the greatest album you you've ever heard in your life could be out there somewhere and you just haven't found it yet that's what I want to help you do I'm gonna help you find that album so maybe this will be the album Africa hi-tech 93 million miles this is a duo spearheaded by two musicians Mark Pritchard and Steve Spacek and between the both of them and their various side projects they've covered everything from soul music to techno but this is my first introduction to their stuff so please excuse me if I'm not very well-versed in what these guys have done already now this LP came out in May on warp records and when it dropped I was feeling it a little bit I thought it was okay mmm definitely some bright spots on here I did a track review of the album put it up on the needle drop calm toward the end of that month and let's just convinced that I wasn't going to review the entire album just because I thought it was it was alright but to me like the show of a good record is that you want to return to it you want to hear it again you want to revisit you want to get the same feelings and the same experiences from that album over again so surprisingly like at the beginning of this month I just started getting this very small but ignore ball to listen to this thing again eventually this itch got so big that I just couldn't think about anything else anymore I had to listen to this again but this time when I listened to it and I revisited the LP it just like clicked what magic I mean don't you love it when albums do that now my favorite thing about Africa high tech is this project sounds exactly what you would assume a project with this name would sound like one track after another finding a different balance between African and electronic sounds like the track out in the streets which is done in a juke or ghetto house style of electronic music with lots of repeated vocal samples very fast busy beat it's a style of music I ran into earlier this year on that machine drum album rooms however at the time I wasn't all that experienced or knowledgeable on the subjects of ghetto house or Juke and I wouldn't say I am now but I am conscious of the style now I know that's what the style is that is being pursued on that track and I apologize for anybody who I may have pissed off for mislabeling that machine drum album sorry I I don't know everything I wouldn't be the first guy well now that I know about this style I love the way it's executed on this album on that track with a really hard nosed beat that just makes me want to throw my hands up in the air and this really dizzying repetitive vocal sample of Jamaican reggae singer na Camozzi just cycling over and over how didn't the speed in the street didn't is it's just really overwhelming for me just makes me feel like I'm spinning in a room I love it the track do you want to fight is really synthetic the strings the horns the beats the keys all this sounds so robotic and to throw on top of that someone kind of like singing or emceeing really there's an African accent in the voice I think but there's some heavy vocoder on that voice so it's like listening to an African robot spit over some weird electronic Africa beats it's strange and there are other tracks on here like Gang slap and future moves and the opening track to that just feel like an electronic drum circle with different poly rhythms introducing themselves throughout the track arpeggios - and sometimes when these new things fly in they change up the groove like all together the sounds here are just so so plentiful so colorful so blatant so bright and sweet it's like eating a hundreds leaves of like digital lifesavers and some of the beats on here like almost 8-bit quality it's kind of like listening to african chip tunes i mean just like in the way that african drum music can be seen as is kind of going back to the beginnings the more primal moments of music this album takes electronics themselves back to those beginnings - much simpler much more blatant rigid and robotic sounds some of these tracks can be kind of like staring into a big ass circuit board or something there are a lot of tracks on here that hit hard there are a nice chunk as well that come on slow and soft I love one of the longest songs on here our love which just mmm just swells nicely with keyboards in the background just keeps the soft repetitive groove and has this robotic woman's voice just announcing various musings about love it's something that like the Kraftwerk and laurie anderson fan in me just eats up like it's candy and in this softer side of this album some acoustic sounds come out to the track spirit has these sampled hand drums on the song and this voice that's that's touched with a bit of vocoder to make it sound robotic underneath all these very subtle electronics it's kind of like trying to spot an animal hiding behind all this brush in the jungle or something especially considering all that the jungle sounds happening in the background of this track with crickets and I think I hear like a monkey or something and the last two tracks on the LP have a really chilled out tribal vibe to them to some songs on here to me are a little short of breath maybe some of the the vocals in the background of some tracks could have been brought to the foreground and and yeah there is a very blatant influence on this thing coming from dubstep coming from techno coming from Juke and ghetto house sure but all these songs have such interesting production and sounds in an African twist to them that makes this feel really unique to me I've just never heard this kind of stuff attacked specifically at this angle so many times I think what did keep me from loving this LP at first though when I was first listening to this thing again and again is that when I say bright and when I say blatant on this album I do mean that it does throw a lot of sounds out there right at the get-go it is kind of difficult to digest in one sitting and the influences are clear about making sense of all of it quickly is just not gonna happen if you do decide to listen to this do give it a couple chances because I did and I'm really happy I did I almost dismissed this and I'm glad I can say that I'm feeling at this point a very decent two strong eight on this thing loving the hell out of it it's just a really fun listen for me now and really just gets my blood boiling and I love it when electronic music can do that for me what do you think of this thing if you've heard it love it hate it why then what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana Africa high tech forever 
IqaUt85GOH4,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's druggist music nerd album review time the war on drugs sleeve ambient you know today I was reading some of the comments on my watch the throne review um let me tell you for me some people just don't get that this this is opinion this is just my opinion that's it you know it's nothing more than that I'm not right about anything I might actually bet that I'm wrong just some people get so my kick the war on drugs is a Philadelphia project spearheaded by singer-songwriter Adam and I was pretty excited about the build-up to this release because this album is a very interesting hybrid of two styles sounds that I really love tracks like come to the city and baby missiles remind me of guys like Bob Dylan because of Adam's really roots II draw in his vocals and folk full crock really cool you know it's hanging at the bar and then all of a sudden on this album shoegaze music and and krautrock kind of come over to it and buy it a few drinks and seduce it and take it home and then the three of them do things to each other that they'll never speak of this thing is kind of the dirty secret that's just been let out now and there have been a lot of psychedelic takes on folk music and folk rock before trying to weird it out one guy who I have to say sounds a lot like the war on drugs is curve Isle actually who dropped an album earlier this year so imagine my surprise when I was looking through the internet and saw the Kurt Vile is actually on this album kindred spirits I still got a review that album though this LP is not just your your usual psychedelic take on folk music the drums behind this record are very muscular repetitive and driving much like the drums off of one of my favorite records of all time noise seminal noise 75 great record with one rigid krautrock groove after another especially on the second half every track on this LP builds into a wall of sound a nice atmospheric wall of sound imagine Neil Young's Allah knows if it actually had a backing band behind it that's how I kind of see this record and though this LP can be pretty loud pretty overwhelming at times the sounds on here for me stay very pretty this album really kind of glistens you know they shimmer it's like watching a waterfall in the moonlight and in the vein of a lot of crap rock artists some of the tracks on this album get kind of strung out like five or six minutes making these long Airy psychedelic jams while I do love the concept of this record I love the idea I love the fusion not every track is is as stellar as the next for me there are a lot of points on here where the sound of this record and the songwriting come together to make something awesome like come to the city which has these really heavy primal drums that come on slow and build the track up with one climax after another just making the song bigger each time the vocal melody on the opening track best night really pretty really captivating and baby missles is where adam on here gives his most enthusiastic vocal delivery in my opinion but sometimes on this LP Adams vocals either take a turn for the worse or they just kind of feel okay to me like I'm not getting a strong personality from him or something I feel that way on the song I was there he's really off pitch kind of all over the place on that song and some of the instrumental interludes on this LP like the animator are really pretty I love the way horns are used on that track it's very ambient it's really gorgeous but other instrumental songs like original Slavin and city reprieves they don't really add anything new to the album they're not bringing anything to the table that all the tracks before those tracks didn't already bring and this next thing I can't really explain I'm not sure why it could have something to do with the way these guys recorded this album but the grooves on this LP just feel really flat for me I'm not really feeling any interplay or interaction with the keyboards the guitars and the drums the momentum just kind of feels like this doesn't really feel like I'm hearing a full band playing together you know I could be wrong and and I'm open to that but still the the climaxes and the jams I'm just not really getting anything out of hearing them go on for an extended period of time I just got to feel like I'm hearing the same thing over and over and over again I just don't feel like I'm progressing with some of these songs I don't know I love the sound I love the concept and I love a good chunk of the songs here I was just kind of left wanting more and that's it overall I liked it I'm feeling a a decent two strong six on this pretty enjoyable and but to be honest what I really want to know is actually what Cal chesta thinks of the war on drugs you know what I think legalize it man I agree Jesus Aaron Henry yes do it do it Oh Daria you 
FMhrhf5kENY,where's the love where's the love okay all right happy times Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd thank you for watching album review time on the needle drop Chelsea wolf this woman is a singer-songwriter who I admittedly unfairly categorized unfairly grouped into this new wave of dark wave gothic rock and maybe even like which house bands I slept on her first album and I was going to do the same with this album but then some some comments and suggestions really made me want to listen to it really deep give it a deep listen and just see what comes out I was streaming some of it on NPR music and it didn't take long for me to find out that I actually loved what I was hearing the title of this album is in Greek and the word apocalypse actually descended from this word but in Greek it translates roughly to Revelation which can be just as cataclysmic as an apocalypse if you're interpreting it from a biblical standpoint it's not like I really get a religious vibe from this album but considering some of the song titles on here there's definitely something spiritual going on there's something just kind of otherworldly about it this thing soaks in its own atmosphere and atmosphere is the key word because this album is a little drenched in reverb which is kind of something a lot of bands are way too addicted to these days reverb is kind of like becoming the duct tape of studio recording like oh does your song sound like crap throw some reverb on it but the reverb itself isn't bad it's just finding out that there's not really anything behind the reverb on this album everything that you would want in a good song is behind the Reverb some solid playing a simple foundation of guitars drums vocals and some organ here and there and various noises and effects popping up like I'm in a haunted house kind of there are actually some tracks on here where I was hearing reversed guitars just weird wailing in the background and I just could not figure out how some of these sounds were were being made it's that kind of out there now this LP is incredibly consistent in its style it's always spiraling downwards into a hellish pit of confusion and ominous Ness there all sorts of cobwebs everywhere snakes speaking in tongues almost just just freaky shut what I love about Chelsea wolf and this album is that this album approaches darkness with a lot of different flavors sure every track is just kind of covered in the same reverb has roughly the same mixing and an instrumentation Chelsea's voice is always present but some moments on here and the vocals and the and the simple guitar and drum foundation remind me of PJ Harvey the track demons on here the pace and the rhythm of the drums in the guitar really reminds me of like Sonic Youth there's a little bit of vocal phrasing and rhythm on the last track that really reminds me of Portishead after listening to this album a bunch of times I'm absolutely sure that Chelsea is at least a little bit into Nick Cave and this might be a stretch for some people but considering how long and kind of do me some of these guitar riffs are some of the slow sludgy paces of this album I'm thinking a little bit of Earth or at least do metal as a genre going back to Black Sabbath there's an ambient sound scape on the ninth track Chelsea obviously has a lot of influences but what I like is that she brings these influences out without drowning in them she doesn't just become the artists she listens to she takes those sounds and molds to the direction that this album is moving in out of all the different things Chelsea tries on this album I'm not really finding a weak spot on here I mean yeah the the 24 second intro where she's kind of doing these black metal growls and the ambient sound scape on here were both a little bit of a surprise but shorter and more straightforward tracks on here like myrrh to me felt just as entertaining as songs that come on a lot slower like the wasteland which just starts off quiet and slowly becomes this bigger shimmering wall of sound that I feel like I could just swim in and die this album kind of shifts into a lot of different gears from beginning to end between these ten tracks but it all adds up to a really nice moody ride kind of narrated by Chelsea wolves voice which is kind of just punctuating the darkness of this album and just giving it meaning giving it direction I love the flow of this album - it doesn't just feel like the collection of songs I have to kind of listen to this thing from beginning to end to really get the full effect of it it feels like kind of a sculpture kind of like a rebuild of Pandora's box and I just want to open it again and again if you're looking for some pitch black rock music with a lot of atmosphere around it in a pretty strong female vocal this is where you want to be I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing this was nice this was a nice surprise for me but let me know what you think about this thing if you've heard it hmm love it hate it why and what do you think I should review next hope you're doing well Anthony Fantana Chelsea wolf forever [Music] I want to say thank you to everybody who actually went on that South by Southwest panel picker page that I brought up in an earlier video and voted that thing up means a lot thank you for the support thank you for trying to get tnd to South by Southwest in 2012 it means a lot spreading tnd gospel gotta do it I appreciate it thank you 
aGZqWwuLdjA,it's track review man it has been a long time since we've done a track review we're here on the needle drop Anthony Fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd reviews the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion if in this review is the first track to drop from the upcoming Feist album metals how come you never go there now singer/songwriter Leslie Feist she is so popular I don't think I need to go into the details of how or why other than that in my opinion she's one of the more interesting in these songstress --is out there today and sadly it's been a while since we've heard from her full-length style this is gonna be the follow-up to the reminder which actually dropped in 2007 and like I said the first track to drop from this LP is how come you never go there link below this video listen let's let's listen with our ears first thing that really hit me on that track is as being really enjoyable was of course the instrumentation had a nice subtle combination of of piano bass vocals and drums right at the start and what I love about Feist's voices that it has enough personality so that I pick up on it right from the start but it's not so weird and eccentric that it sounds annoying to hear her multitrack herself basically kind of clone herself in the mix as backup vocalists what makes Feist different for me is that she's a little bit more ambitious in her phrasing she's got a wider range and she jumps all over it on this hook jumping up to those highs and then digging down into those lows this song has a nice really swaying groove to it it just makes you want to go and it's really soft really comes on easy the instrumentation here a lot like Feist's voice does not aim for a heavy impact it doesn't scream for attention but there's more going on than you may think if you're just kind of you know giving this a really quick glance there may be a different drum fill there may be a couple little piano notes added in a different vocal phrasing a little bit of horns just flying in for a quick visit it's really subtle and I like that what I like even more is that this song does not rely on the hook it doesn't rely on the chorus to kind of make the track interesting I actually like the verses more than the hook I really love listening to Feist kind of get lost in this narrative that she's singing the lyrics are kind of like a monologue of a character she's playing and the story to me I kind of feel a lot of abandonment in the lyrics I feel like there's no love but there once was love and the two people involved are trying to get it back if I had a couple of wishes for this song I wish that I heard a little bit more from the horns toward the end of the track maybe to fill the song up make it a little bit heavier and I wish the ending were a little bit more fleshed out we're a little bit more ambitious these multitrack vocals just kind of pop up like a stone wall and just stop the track just kind of like guillotine the song into ending done I could see this thing is being kind of underwhelming for some people because it's not gonna come out and punch you it's not a physical punch it's more like an emotional punch like a breakup letter you just got to read it you can't just put this song on and go internet browsing you have to pay attention I'm enjoying the hell out of this track and if this new LP maintains this really bleak sorrowful attitude it could be a nice nice fall album I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this song but what do you think of this track are you excited disappointed a little bit what do you think this new LP is going to offer and what did you like or dislike about this Anthony Fantana Feist metals forever you 
1G57MNa37Nc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review and I actually found out about this LP from a forum I visit every once in a while a day my first introduction was was looking at this album cover a bald guy standing at the top of the staircase with a bald guy standing at the top of the staircase painted on his head with a bald guy standing at the top of a staircase painted on on his head what but after listening to this LP I think I learned to judge albums a little bit less by their covers thanks forum and I love my forum to the needle drop comm forum I love that love that forum pressure and time is rival sons sophomore LP and it's pretty good it's 10 songs in 30 minutes of some straight-up blues rock and hard rock they've gone back and listen to their Sabbath's they've listened to their Hoos they've listened to their Led Zeppelin's and from the guitar playing on this album and some of the vocal phrasing I could only guess that these guys definitely have some blues records in their collections too along with some Creedence Clearwater Revival and maybe some animals because this song young love definitely sounds like a little bit of Eric Burdon is in the vocals along with the bass and drum combo but on the song white noise things change up a lot these guys take the album into a surprisingly psychedelic direction with fuzz Dow guitars and just an overwhelming amount of sound and it kind of reminds me of something I could hear like the who playing to end out a live set with Pete Townsend just smashing his guitar all over the stage but on a majority of these tracks the musical group that comes to mind the most as an influence has got to be Led Zeppelin which kind of becomes a thing at a bad thing the guitarist here is no Jimmy Page and the singer is no Robert Plant and I never really come away from any of these tracks and man that guitar player has chops or the freezing and the singing is really ambitious and emotional but maybe these guys save their really flashy playing for their live shows as a unit these guys really shine it's not like you're gonna listen to this just from the guitars or just for the vocals you're gonna listen to this because these guys are a tight band that writes some really lean catchy and great songs and maybe that could be a good thing for some people because often Zeppelin have been critiqued as being a little too indulgent for their own good you know and if you're looking for something of a hard rock style that's more straightforward more to the point maybe this is for you there are some really standout tracks on this LP for me I love pressure and time the title the guitar riff and the drum be in that song just make me want to like go downtown and just start strutting in that electric piano that pops in over the chorus great and I like that these guys can put slower and softer tracks on this LP and keep them as interesting as the more upbeat songs but I think the combination of hearing this stuff before and hearing it done better is holding me back a little bit it doesn't ruin the album for me it's nice to hear a modern sound on this kind of stuff there wasn't a single song that I hated just some impressed me more than others feeling a decent too strong seven on this liked it a lot and was pretty surprised that this album is being released on earache records ear ache records and there is an addition of this LP that comes with bonus tracks and some of those are in my opinion better than the songs that actually made it onto the LP so if you can get ahold of that do it if you've heard this thing what do you think of it loving it hating it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana rival sons pressure and time forever 
L8adbT0u1rA,cerebral hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd we're viewing the self-titled cerebral palsy album before I start this review I want to apologize for yesterday's review of the Madonna Roberts album coincoin chapter one free people of color I kept seeing her name wrong and maybe I said it wrong just now too either way it was like 4 or 5 a.m. and there were a ton of editing mistakes in the video but still those of you who enjoyed the album thank you you know just let it be known that I make mistakes lots of mistakes all the time and just sometimes I really do seriously ok these guys are in New York hardcore punk outfit this is their self-titled debut release through Williams Street which is kind of a sub little record label through Adult Swim and Turner Broadcasting Corporation and when I first came upon these guys I was really excited because they have this throwback Punk sound they just display a lot of aesthetics that I think have been missing in Punk for a while now it's just very rough very fast and very kind of grimy it feels like a New York City Street with a gutter and trash and smog and just like dirt gathering under my fingernails everywhere I go and I have no clue where it's coming from and that was my first impression I thought I was gonna love this the more time I spent with it but this thing really did a 180 on me and fast there are just so many things I guess I found missing from the album you know one thing that I love about punk music is that it's so full of energy and that it can be so full of rage and meaning and purpose but the thing is that rage and meaning and purpose is so much more significant when you know what the reasoning behind it is or you know basically what's led the singer to this point to be this angry and not that there's not a reason to be mad if bands like crafts or Dead Kennedys or even DRI were in their hay days today they would be having a field day with what's going on across the world but what keeps the lead singer of Cerebral Palsy awake at night is that people are telling him where to peak a release that came out last year the set of off EP is kind of comes to mind as a punk throwback and this stuff is fast it is furious it does have a lot of personality but the thing is you know who the targets are that frontman Keith Morris is singing about like on the track poison city which is a pretty bold statement about terrorism 9/11 propaganda not everything cerebral ballsy says needs to be on that grand of a scale but I guess I just don't understand their approach to rebellion I mean getting wasted isn't rebellious to me if it was then basically everybody who goes out to a club on the weekend is rebelling in the same way that cerebral palsy is because people who are drunk out of their minds don't want to be told where to pee either and I guess the only other thing that's really bugging me about this album and keeping me from enjoying it are the vocals and they're not the most terrible vocals in the world the vocalist of cerebral ballsy sings in a pretty established style that I've heard paired with hardcore skate punk before but his voice just has this really snotty cocky or around it that I I just I couldn't get down with I'm feeling a strong 32 a light four on this album but what do you think of it are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next and what have been one of your favorite punk releases of this year let me know that too Anthony Fantana cerebral palsy forever 
7hpw4H18k3M,artist album title hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review with my my special guest crickets thanks for watching this is the latest LP from saxophonist and composer botana Roberts and yes you guys convinced me to man up and review a jazz record anyway she's put out full lengths before this album she even has a live album that came out this year too but this is my first introduction to her work so it's not like I'm an expert on her earlier stuff but still this album was a really good introduction to her and I think it could be for you too if you're willing to kind of suck it up and just try something different because this thing is not your your average jazz record it experiments more than it sticks to traditions if you're a fan of avant-garde music and you've enjoyed jazz greats like Ferris Sanders some raw Alice Coltrane Ornette Coleman you will definitely feel at home with this album coincoin chapter 1 free people of color is an album of music of songs but I really think it's best to kind of approach this thing as being a story a narrative kind of a movie and this thing is chapter one in what's supposed to be a 12 chapter series six chapters of this series Madonna says have been worked on improvised written and I'm just thinking when will these 11 other pieces be heard this one album is an hour will they be her live will they ever see a print on record will they have the same narrative as this album are they going to be in a similar style have a similar sound same musicians the more I tried to read into that and Madonna's personal approach to musical notation using like visuals I just got really confused I don't really want to know how the sausage is made I would rather just the sausage be cooked and then put on my plate and I enjoy it for what it is or what I interpret it to be between the eight tracks on this album Matano goes through a lot of different jazz styles from light loungy jazz to Dixieland to modal grooves and drones as well as free jazz passages that get pretty noisy and dissonant there's even one track that just really openly embraces the sound of spirituals which really sit at the roots of jazz music and this story that this album tells that I keep alluding to is one about the ancestral history of Africans in America going all the way back to the days of slavery now being a white guy born in 1985 with European descendents from France and Sicily who traveled over here to North America a couple generations ago for a better life I cannot relate at all to what it must be like to be a slave in the 1700s but what I love about this album and Madonna's work on it is she takes her emotions for this ancestral history and translates them into music in such a way where it impacts me and makes me feel like I relate in a way or not really relate but just feel deep and painful emotions for what she's saying and what she's trying to convey on this album with celebration and fear and confusion and suffering this thing really covers the emotional spectrum and it all comes out ringing loud and clear but musically it's very noisy harsh taxing and experimental at a lot of points it can be really difficult to translate and wade through the music on this thing really kind of brings me down too depressing lows and and of soaring high as one right after another the introduction to this album rise is really sporadic really kind of awkwardly disjointed not one of my favourite tracks on the album because things feel so disconnected on that particular track but it serves a purpose with a really tense and kind of ugly soundscape of horns strings piano upright bass drum rolls in every direction it just really kind of creates this pull that snaps on the second track when the music basically explodes and I mean explodes in a way that I've never really heard an album explode before not only is all the instrumentation just boiling over like lava out of a volcano but Madonna is screaming blood-curdling screaming she's just screaming murder and not like screaming in a really obnoxious or annoying way for me that's it never came off that way though sometimes screaming on an album can make me feel like that it was more like a painful scream a scream of of suffering of heartbreak and it literally breaks my heart to hear it over and over as much as I am kind of drawn to the uniqueness that I feel in that track and this album it's still not very easy to listen to the song falls into a groove and Madonna through some spoken word just presents this character that she's drawn up to play this narrative that she wants to weave together she's 16 she's a slave she's being bought and sold her parents died of yellow fever it's a song that plays every single time Madonna needs to kind of come forward and push this narrative again and tell you more about this person who she's talking about the second time you hear about her she's 25 and her master seems to be kind of forcing himself upon her and having kids with her at first I didn't really like her spoken word I didn't like how jumpy and and jittery it was but as I kind of returned to the album and listen to it more I just came to appreciate what she was saying and how tense she needs that moment to kind of be when she's describing this character and telling the story on the fifth track the lyrics lay heavily into a spiritual but the lyrics diss but the lyrics disturbingly paint a picture of people being lined up to be bought and sold and just auctioned off there's only so much I can really say about that track I feel like some people will be too cynical to take it seriously but I found it too disturbing to really kind of put into words and by the last track this character that Madonna is playing is speaking for has been released by her master and has had kids with this guy for almost and as kids with this guy for like 19 years and she now has land is working it is making money and is doing her best to buy back her kids and other people as well it's a pretty powerful story just enhanced by all of this tense and and beautiful jazz music and it does have its upsides it does have its really difficult moments I mean I found a lot of this album to just kind of make me sick to my stomach literally literally sick like and kind of disgusted and not in a in a white guilt kind of way like I feel directly responsible and guilty for slavery because I'm a white guy I'm just more shocked at the sheer inhumanity of this whole situation this album stares boldly into the face of inhumanity for a very very long time longer than most people would be willing to bear musically I guess the only issues that I have with this album is the first track feels pretty disjointed and maybe it's not the the strongest introduction to this album for me I felt like it could have been a little bit more to the point and the last track though I enjoy the sentiment behind it it feels a little kind of anticlimactic or uneventful for me it does kind of end on a lighter note but it's not like maybe the the climax or the explosion that I was hoping for but maybe that's what will make this album kind of a perfect lead-in into chapter 2 which I hope gets released this is a very strong album it's a very bold bold album and definitely unlike a lot of the music you're going to hear this year so at least go into this expecting that there's a link below this video somewhere on the needle drop com2 or you can string the entire thing in full let me know what you think I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this Anthony Fantana Madonna Roberts coincoin chapter 1 free people of color you 
HLMuUZhHZqE,sweet baby Jesus pretty hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review that I'm sure you saw coming the throne watch the throne throne throne throne as you probably already know this is a collaboration between two of the biggest rappers out there right now jay-z and Kanye West and they've been building up to this album with a lot of teasing some pictures two tracks Otis and ham and you know what those songs haven't grown on me but at least now I can kind of appreciate the theme of those songs and what Kanye and jay-z are going for on this LP you know just see the concept of this album for what it is hearing about Kanye and jay-z collaborating rapping together on the same album has brought up a lot of questions a lot of talk like ooh who's gonna out rap the other who's gonna be the better rapper hmm and if you're asking that question or really you know discussing who out rapped the other that it's it's a dumb conversation it's a dumb question you've missed the point of the album entirely you should just not even listen to this don't listen to it give up on music altogether don't listen to music anymore this album isn't bad meets evil where you have two very technically proficient emcees pushing each other to the next level this album is a celebration of jay-z and Kanye West's little rap dynasty and I say dynasty because jay-z despite being you know a great emcee having a good ear for beats and the way things should sound as well as being a very savvy businessman did one of the best things a musician or someone who wants to stay relevant should do and that's fine an understudy to carry on your legacy through jay-z Kanye's beats in the early 2000s had a lot of high-profile homes and when Kanye came out with his first album it had the backing of jay-z and Rockefeller records every one of his albums have and together these guys have constructed one of the longest runs of relevancy in rap history 15 straight years of unwavering popularity no matter how talented or relevant you think Kanye West is he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for jay-z this album even points that out when Kanye is rapping about coming up and meeting no ID and giving jay-z Beats and also when jay-z is rapping about being King on the last track and kind of making Kanye royalty and Kanye pledges loyalty to jay-z it's kind of cult ish so don't come into this album expecting a fiery lyrical competition between Kanye West and jay-z don't even call this that why would these guys even do that what do they have to prove I mean to Kanye and jay-z greatness is proved through popularity they've gained legitimacy in the hip-hop community and beyond so Watch the Throne is a pop rap album meant to keep these guys relevant and struggle for the top of the charts and what better way to stir up controversy than to do an entire album together and steal the spotlight away from Drake and little Wayne and Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross for a few weeks okay so that's the the context of this album the story the music is a completely different thing for me do I enjoy the music like My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy I feel really polarized on this album finding tracks on here that are like some of my favorite hip-hop songs of the year while others were extremely disappointing and kind of confirmed my worst fears about this album and that's that Kanye and jay-z would come on here rapping not like rappers but like celebrities like on the track Otis it's interests these guys would have the balls to sample Otis Redding number one but I'm really kind of like fed up with hearing that same cut over and over by the end of the song and you know to be honest I just don't feel like hearing Kanye and jay-z brag here is any different than than hearing them brag anywhere else who are they really competing against you know it's like they're throwing punches at an opponent who isn't there it's like pro wrestling you can watch it and get excited over and pretend that it's real but we all know that it's not boo at raging the gauge you're going down I'm gonna do three cup I'll driver you know not not all the brags are bad but on some of these tracks they just they just back them up with the worst beats imaginable like on that's my bitch with these cheap turntable scratches cheap cents cheap drums sample and the kind of chauvinism that if you are flashing it around on the street people would think you're a jerk but because it's on an album it's great right you know and then you got a track like the Beyonce hooked lift off where I really don't like the hook I mean it just feels kind of cheesy take it to the moon take it to the stars aren't these guys lyricists and made in America or sweet baby Jesus Frank Ocean from Odd Future shows up and Kanye and jay-z rap about their success in a way that I would only care about if I cared about them as celebrities the one thing I took away from that track is that Kanye West is still rapping about that stupid South Park episode in 2011 oh but you know he's he's designing now and that's cool but nine Tony Awards but there are some things I live on here like the track got a habit and the third track have some of the smoothest beats on here the weird vocal sampling actually works in favor of got a habit and when Kanye and jay-z brag on these tracks they sound charming and charismatic and relaxed it doesn't feel like they're trying to convince me of anything they're not shoving anything down my throat they just sound like they're having a good time making a track together and that makes me interested in hearing it and there are a couple spots on here where Kanye and jay-z kind of sober up from being drunk off of their egos all the time and and just kind of rap about something outside of themselves like a new day where they write these verses about their hypothetical sons and just kind of wanting them to grow up happier than they are RZA had a hand in producing this track and there's this really auto-tune vocal sample but it still comes off really soulful and just really emotional I just just pull so much out of me but my favorite song on here has got to be murdered to excellence and I don't feel like I'm stepping over a boundary by saying that I feel like Kanye and jay-z rapped with a lot of guts on that track because they're rapping about something of consequence they're rapping about something you know with substance violence urban violence black on black violence not to mention the beat is fantastic with the opening acoustic guitar and and it sounds like a chorus of girls sampled and just looped again and again it's just got this epic feel and I love the way this album ties up with why I love you and that track is really an emic to hearing jay-z and Kanye actually rap about you know their relation to each other is interesting and hearing jay-z kind of paint his climb in his place at the top as a lonely place where people kind of grow paranoid is real no matter what I think of Kanye and jay-z they are popular they're successful that's how they've gauged their greatness and if that's what greatness is to them then they've achieved it and if you're interested in celebrating that with them you'll like this album these guys have made a lot of songs and a lot of albums that I love that I think are great that I think are standouts but the thing is with me my love stops there I don't love Kanye and jay-z as personalities you know and maybe that's partially why I'm not on board with this album I'm kind of feeling at a strong five to a light six on this on the fence had really high moments and really low moments for me but what do you think of this are you loving it hating it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching all the way through guys Anthony Fantan oh you're the best Connie and jay-z the throne watch the throne [Music] no I did not get a shout out 
z_dFxCKsLvg,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Shabazz Palaces black up right there sitting there gonna be there all week okay Beirut is a project spearheaded by multi-instrumentalist Zac Condon and this is his third LP third full-length LP under the project the riptides so Beirut when I first came into this band it was pretty exciting because around that time in college a professor of mine had recently introduced me to Balkan brass music gypsy music Romanian music klezmer and ever since then I've had kind of a soft spot for that stuff and anything that you know kind of tries to be like it the kind of sounds that that bands like a hawk and a hacksaw recreate so lovingly and so well it's not new for a western band to be kind of toying with this sort of stuff but Beirut to me was a little bit different in that Zac Condon really wanted to write pop songs but was still so in love still so enamored with this sound and style it just had to be incorporated into his music he seemed really like kind of dedicated to the origins of this kind of stuff and making that really clear in his music I mean he even collaborated with one of mine and and I'm sure there one of his favorite Balkan brass bands the cocaine II orcas star if you check out B roots first record gulag workers star there's just a mood there that isn't usually there in western music with the really weepy horns and accordion and and strings and piano just just really weepy really mournful I don't mean sad I don't mean depressed I mean mourning and Zach took that sound and really just like translated and translated it for a Western audience there were poppier on that album like postcards from Italy but that stuff wasn't the the main event for me the main event the majority of the stuff on there really had deep roots in that Eastern European flavor then after that came the Flying Club Cup in 2007 and there was a change there the songs seemed a little simpler a little poppier but it resulted in catchy ER songs something that was a little more immediate plus the recording was better there were some awesome string arrangements on there from Owen Pallett and it just seemed like the natural progression past gulag things fell silent for a little bit and then Zack dropped these 2 EPS together real people Holland and March of the zapotec real people Holland was something from another solo project of Zacks which was really more of an electrified indie pop sound but March of the zapotec achieved something that I always wanted to happen for Beirut a really gigantic huge live hit Orchestra sized horn section not multitrack horns thrown together in a studio real actual horn section playing arrangements and songs that he's putting together perfect recording and great musicianship just bringing it all together for just a massive and emotional set of songs and now we're here with the Riptide and I can't help but feel like we've moved backwards just a little bit those 2 EPS that Zac released in 2009 they were on such opposite ends of this spectrum that it was hard to love both of them but now after I hear this I can I can hear why he wanted to print both of them because his love of really simplified pop music comes on strong with the Riptide in comparison with the Flying Club Cup and Gulag orca star this thing comes to the table with less less detail in the arrangements less length less foreign flavor and less energy it's hard for me to feel that way and be happy you know what I mean the songs on this are simple and the songs on the Flying Club cup are simple too but the trade-off on that album was that you know the songs are simple but the Arrangements come on heavy they're everywhere they're intricate they're very layered and there's always something new you could pull out of them making it worth it to return to this album and listen to it again and again and again they're still horn sections on here but none of them weep none of them really a Moute none of them Papa they just all kind of fly in between verses to to just break things up a little bit East Harlem vagabond Santa Fe Zak's horns have kicked more butt than this they have they have and you know I can appreciate simpler simpler is cool but these heftier horn arrangements these heftier instrumental passengers haven't been replaced with anything the songs just feel a little neutered most of the tracks on here just consist of of several different chords I mean the first two songs pretty much had the same chord progression but in different keys the same chord progression in a different key that is used behind the song Nantes on the Flying Club cup this thing isn't entirely bad though I still dig Zacks vocals a lot and the songs I gravitate toward the most are the ones where he's digging into that a lot his vocals his singing on port of call is great I love his emotion on that and hearing him sing over that pump organ drone I assume it's a pump organ on the peacock is really dramatic too still all the instruments are on this album just like they used to be there was a little bit of a flash of indie pop flavor here and there like on the song Santa Fe with the with the bouncing synthesizers that open up the track and for the most part the music here still implies stuff like baguettes and wine and candlelit dinners on the balconies of of expensive and fancy five-star hotels and Downton Abbey it's just that to me the riptides is like a night in Paris whereas flying Club Cup is like a week and gulag work as stars like a year backpacking through Europe visiting every country that you possibly can still this thing is a beirut album I would rather listen to this and I feel more definition in this than any number of low fire or synth-pop bands who all sound the same but I still can't help but feel like I've heard this done before better by this project I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this what did you guys think of it love it hate it why but what does Cal two just think u.s.a u.s.a u.s.a u.s.a forever 
TyynHvJiG_4,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's funkiest music nerd and it's album slash compilation review time brand new y ou funk fast times and Nigerian boogie badness 1979 to 1983 this this is what music nerdery is all about this compilation covers an interesting spot in Nigerian musical history at this point Nigeria's already had a rich tradition of various kinds of folk musics high life music is popular and now afro beat and artists like Fela Kuti are in full swing after all that comes this and what I love about this compilation is that it comes with a book that goes into detail with the artists the producers the labels and label heads and sort of displays their rise and very quick fall and because the biggest label at that time putting this music out phono disk splurged millions of dollars on the recording process of these albums the compound the recording studio the quality the sound of these songs is is comparable to what was being put out in the US and Europe at the time in some moments I mean you know it's not like I'm listening to ABBA or KC and the Sunshine what what is it don't bring up the names of bands and artists that I don't like in your reviews even if you're comparing them in a way saying they are like or unlike the artists and the comparison is at least somewhat accurate why because I would rather get angry and complain then get anything people editor review I hate counter chesta there are tracks on here that I swear would most likely have been hits if only they were pushed over here during the time like at the track I want to feel your love where there's no accent very poppy string arrangements a nice disco beat a catchy hook with memorable lyrics the tracks basically begging to be played at a roller skating rink the people behind these songs were not just writing songs they were kind of parroting a really well developed an obvious formula that was already very popular in other countries I mean I really think these guys were trying to engineer hits really recreate the disco sensation in Nigeria like a Nigerian reinterpretation or something like the track the second track on here from Chris a Cote show me your backside and he's got these really boyish vocals the songs got a fast groove a really quick pace it sounds like their target was some off-the-wall error Michael Jackson but there are some moments where the foreign charm really impacts the influences and fuses to create something that is odd and that wonky guitar that really rigid beyond that a melody more track accidentally I think kind of sounds like something Talking Heads would do my total favorite track on this thing is the Joe mock song boys and girls which has this you know we weird B and just quirky fake synthesized strings in the background it's just got this funny presentation that to me doesn't feel disco at all it feels like a post-punk song it feels like something Rough Trade records would have put out back in the day if only they knew about it it sounds really delta v it sounds kind of Yoko Ono ish there are a couple duds on here it's a compilation usually there are duds that kind of make me feel like I'm eating pizza that I got at a Chinese buffet I mean you know yeah it's pizza it's got sauce got bread and it's got cheese but it's somehow so far off the mark the duds on this compilation though don't exactly ruin the flow of it for me it's not oh I want to skip this uh it's more like I like them anyway but kind of for novelty reasons you know brand new y OU is a nice fat compilation 15 songs 15 different artists I look at the cover I read the title I got what I expected and more fun listen light and easy to get into and something I could see myself coming back to in Wynwood if you've heard some tracks off of this linked down there below and on the needle drop calm what do you think love them hate them why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana brand new Y o forever 
E_WWgVVeFjs,then hey times our review the new Red Hot Chili Peppers no new Red Hot Chili Peppers no yes yes yes hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Theophilus London times are weird these days you guys may remember I reviewed the EP to come out before this LP earlier this year dunk it a lot but the review for this is is not here this review was a collaborative review with the guys over at a dead end hip hop you can't open see there it is there it is it's plane right there there it is click on this ok click on this to see the review and also I did another video with those guys where we talked about what makes an album classic as opposed to trash you can click on that if you want to see that you should click one of these click up click either one of them well watch the videos if you click you see the video yep one of them and either one click either one any time now ok yep time to click quick time click a roué 
TR7xn0tJ-7E,Hudson Mohawke Hudson Mohawke Hudson Mohawke Hudson Mohawke Hudson Mohawke hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd here to do a short little five-track EP review of the new Hudson Mohawke release satin Panthers this is this guy's third EP on warp records as far as I can tell and on this thing he pretty much continues down the same path that he forged for himself on his 2009 album butter his music has attracted labels like wonky which would kind of relate him to glitch hop artists people who are just kind of fusing hip-hop and dubstep together to an extent but to me kind of what this music is is like a glorious lack of refinement in you know genre electronic music that emphasizes tweaking very serious sounds and textures and perfection when I think about this guy I imagine him and and most electronic music producers sitting at a table a big table eating dinner and Hudson Mohawke is the dude with elbows on the table he's chewing with his mouth open he's spilling water he's getting food all over his face he's telling dirty jokes he sounds like a very unpleasant guest but he might also kind of be the guest that this dinner party needs to kind of liven things up a little bit now there are some spots on this EP that really require and like display some finesse like the introductory track which is really glittery octan or even the song all your love which has these very smooth pitch shifted female vocals even on my favorite track on here Seebeck which kind of floats in elegantly on this chariot of epic synthesized strings and horns just for 20 seconds before this dude kind of takes the track off-roading through the mud this filthy heavy dirty beat comes in with these weeping synthesizers hitting the tempo kind of awkwardly it actually kind of reminds me of the beat in little Oh Millie and is something I could totally see little bees spitting on if you're watching this video do you can to contact him get him to spit on this get him to wrap on this friggin beat cbat please and if I can just you know suggest some lyrics Anthony Fantana no and then the fans hand no Anthony Fantana no see that is a heavy-ass shaker but it's far too weird and silly sounding to be played on commercial radio or you know be a certified club hit and that kind of puts Hudson Mohawke in a weird place take the lead single on this album Thunder Bay that track goes hard but the sounds are so squeaky and squishy and kind of silly I mean this guy is making straightforward hard beat bass music but it does not sound as expensive or flashy or technical as stuff from dead mouse or even Skrillex guys like that I'm not sure how this would really go over with that crowd but on the other end of the spectrum you have fans of stuff like micro house really subtle quieter electronic music that emphasizes minimalism this also would not do well in that arena this guy avoids subtlety and too much detail at the same time keeping things really simple very primal no secrets no hiding places and I really think this dude could be chasing after a more accepted sound after a more popular sound after something that's more flashy more detailed he could be using the same wide array of colors most electronic music producers are that 64 Crayola Crayons set instead he's kind of passing that up and trying to draw the best damn picture he can with the original 8 I'm feeling a strong 7 on this I liked it a lot but wasn't really in love with that I felt like the intro track was a little underwhelming toward the end for me and overall I really just wanted more from this I mean I did not feel satisfied at the end of this at all but I was left wanting more so what do you think of this EP do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Hudson Mohawke satin Panthers forever you 
PaWQFOJ7D4o,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching it's time for an album review machine drums rooms machine drum is the solo effort of electronic music producer Travis Stewart the sky has recorded under some other names in the past he currently has some new stuff out in the duo sepal cure and the machine drum discography as far as that goes goes all the way back to the early 2000s with the album now you know but this guy doesn't have the following you would expect somebody would if they were creating music for over ten years he recently got a nice endorsement from Hudson Mohawke but he's still not a big name in this genre it maybe it has something to do with him kind of being a musical chameleon his early stuff was influenced by a lot of hip hop instrumental hip hop kind of glitching it out experimenting with it an eidm every release after that would kind of switch lanes between being more hip-hop influenced or being more IDM influenced and it kind of came to him even embracing that wonky hip-hop sound coming out of LA from producers like Flying Lotus this is on that album want to 1/2 it sounded like he was embracing dubstep a little bit on some of the tracks from that LP but he went even deeper into that wonky sound on the mini LP he put out afterwards many phases on the first half of it on the second half he plays with a lot of house and 2-step songs but now the sounds of future garage and this new sparse take on dubstep is hot and now he's kind of doing something that could be compared to joy Orbison burial DL Scooba like any other record in this style there are a lot of broken clunky complicated beats that just click tap pop heavy bass sounds rumbling away in the background not the wubwubwub they're just a lot of thick synthesized bass and there's a ton of atmosphere around the synthesizers the vocal samples but there is something very different about machine drum on this thing he isn't very bleak he isn't very atmospheric like a lot of artists chasing this style he just saturates the mix with tons of different sounds and textures and I would say it like kind of works in layers like a lot of electronic music does you know one sound on top of another sound like a lasagna or something like that but this is like more of a 3d experience with sounds popping up all over the place it's like a galaxy of different sounds with stars popping up here here back there Arang from your face which makes it kind of dizzying to listen to on headphones it's really obvious that this new string of producers coming out of the UK is influencing this guy but he really produces these tracks to be thick and cacophonous like a producer would who was making a drum and bass track or a jungle track in the 90s but sometimes this dude's love of experimental hip hop instrumentals does kind of come back to haunt some of these tracks a little bit like with the very fat clumsy heavy beat that would totally fit in a brain feeder on the track sacred frequency the song universe actually even sounds like something Flying Lotus would do sans the auto-tune vocal samples I do like the future Garage sound that machine drum is is emulating on some of these tracks but once he starts breeding that style with other things some real Frankenstein's kind of pop out like G B ye where this guy really goes trigger-happy with the vocal samples and the auto-tune there's no possible way to escape them it's like really overkill it's like taking a bazooka to go deer hunting still despite what genre hopping this album does it comes off pretty cohesive pretty solid stylistically and that's mostly because machine drum make sure that the sounds that are being used are always high-quality he really lays into these vocal samples keeps those consistent and every single one of these tracks just keeps a really constant groove my main issue is that some of these tracks just function simply on throwing as much sound out there as possible without really placing them in a really interesting way and at first I was like yeah this is fun this is colorful this is overwhelming I like it but the more I visited this record the more I kind of saw through the clouds the parting clouds the more I kind of sorted out the clutter the more I realized the magic just kind of was disappearing for me the title track is a good example which you know I thought was pretty good at first but now that I have everything on it all kind of separated and interpreted I'm just still there are some standouts on here I think it's a pretty solid release overall I just wish it stuck more truly to these dubstep and future Garage sounds that made machine drum kind of turn in this direction in the first place because to me those are the best tracks on here I think we should ask coucher Chesto what he thinks if this is a dubstep they like to hear some DEP run or Deb jump and that's why I hate him what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana machine drum rooms fret 
hN5hDEvNMGU,hi hello and how are you Anthony Fantino here the Internet's most unknown music nerd here with a review unknown Mortal orchestra after yesterday's death metal orgasm I figured I would go for something a little friendlier a little sweeter a little lighter on the ears for you guys hmm alright so this band is in fact not an orchestra they're a trio they're just a couple years old now and sort of came together after the band's guitarist left the indie rock group the mid chicks and this LP comes after the release of an EP which had four tracks on it and all four from this thing make it onto this thing and the sound UMO has on this LP is a vintage one so you can add these guys on to whatever lists you're keeping of bands that are going for a sound from the 60s there are a lot of groups that have kind of already reigned supreme in this category a little like the fresh and onlys generational 's tame impala these guys also remind me of the OCS a little bit and more recently that band cults so if you're if you're into the style these guys might be worth checking out but the question is you know will they last is this a go back to record for one I do love the sound of this album it's mixed in a pretty interesting way with the guitars riding back si along with the vocals and the drums really Drive this album along with the bass which is kind of sitting shotgun a lot of these new psychedelic bands a lot of these bands that are mining from that 60 sound just kind of try to suffocate themselves and reverb and I don't know why maybe they're trying to kill themselves but these guys are really kind of up in my face not a really aggressive way but just to know we're really close together kind of way we're really close right now these guys are like literally hiding nothing in this recording everything is on display the base is really round obese fazt it's like a 400-pound guy that had to take up two seats on an airplane and like that Colts record the drums on this thing aren't usually what you'd hear behind music like this sounds a little bit more like a hip-hop beat with really heavy kick drums kind of reminds me of some of the hip hop beats Beck used to back his old stuff with the guitars are really sharp and brittle the vocals are even sharper sometimes jumping into a false set oh and these vocals really make some of these tracks stick really catchy really mmm bring themselves in my brain almost to the point where it's annoying but the thing that kind of makes this group stand out for me is definitely their melodies without them they would just sound like one more generic take on this style like the track jello and juggernaut switch it really kind of rips its style from classical music you also have thought balloon the melody on that really kind of jumps around hops around like a frog and little blue house which the melody on that track it kind of sounds like it ripples and then Peters out like if you threw a rock into a lake the only thing that really bugs me about this record really makes me want more is how they structure these songs because how these tracks are are layered and built just seems so fast and simple with a lot of fade outs a lot of repetition it kind of seems a little rushed a good chunk of these songs just feel like I'm running in circles like funny friends the opener to this album where I feel like I'm hearing the same part over and over and over and over there are even spots here that sound eerily similar like the verses on bicycles sound a lot like a slower less effect heavy version of the verses on how can you love me I mean the album came on really fast it was really easy to get into it was really colourful it was really upfront about everything that it had to offer but it quickly started kind of wearing its welcome for me too and I kind of catch myself thinking like the first half of a lot of these songs sounds exactly like the second half of a lot of these songs that's how you know bad some of the the repetition can be this wasn't a terrible album there were some very likeable tracks a couple pretty good tracks too but it just feels a little flimsy to me it's just kind of like a old lime green couch with some holes in it picked it up at Goodwill Salvation Army something like that I need something to sit on in my apartment why not it's my apartment let's bring it in put it down there and you sit on it you jump on it you watch TV on it you make out with a drunk chick on it but it's not my bed and when I move out of the apartment I'm not gonna bring it with me not gonna tell my kids stories about it I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this album of pretty on the fence with it but what do you think of this do you love it do you hate it and why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantino an immortal orchestra forever 
SaiXRdS1gl0,dis mah towards the megalith hahaha Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's sweatiest music nerd doing an album review of the new disma LP towards the megalith this is going to be something that doesn't make a lot of people happy it's a metal review but no come up come back come on come on come on go come on sit down it's alright so I want you to follow me on this one come on thank you between all the members in dyzma these guys have like a couple lifetimes of experience and playing various styles of extreme metal and this album fits pretty snugly into the style of death metal it's a style I don't cover often and I've said why before I don't like a lot of the modern sounds coming out of the genre the drum triggers the really overused compression just to make the music sound louder and it kills the dynamics the thin digital recordings the melodic passage is trying to pretty death-metal up or just emphasizing technical ability over the overall sound of the music some people are like even singing kind of clean over it you can call me a purist if you want I like my death metal freaky and gory like a horror movie with blood pouring out of the walls and people screaming for dear life which is why I prefer the earlier sounds from the genre like death or more of an angel they had a new one out that I thought I didn't like that much or autopsy but they also had a new one that I didn't like too much or even the band incantation which is a group Dismas frontman Craig pillared used to sing for in the early nights with all of these older bands from the 80s and 90s to sort of keeping the idea alive and this new sea of bands coming in I feel like dyzma still stands out the group has this really slow heavy doom metal approach to death metal that they kind of carried on from the early days of incantation and like those off EPS I reviewed last year I kind of get the feeling that maybe this album is an attempt to reclaim glory from the past and that's a good and a bad thing because while yet it's it's good that disma takes a pure approach to this death metal sound and really relives it in a big way but it's not like they really reinvent the wheel or anything stylistically you've got a lot of basics on this album just double bass drums tremolo picking on the guitars really crackling distortion thick heavy distorted bass that's really murky muddy filthy blast beats a lot of chromatic riffs and leads also tempo changes and of course we have the cookie monster vocal on this album too it's a name I hate to put on that style because it makes it sound silly but if you really listen to this album on a big stereo kinda high volume there's a lot of obvious technical precision he's not just fooling around or making noises he does what a lot of death metal vocalists only try to do sound like an honest-to-god monster I mean listen to him his voice sounds like it's it's almost swallowing all of the music behind it he sounds like the mighty Kraken awakening from like a millennium long slumber and he's like punching the Statue of Liberty in the face and plunging its claws into skyscrapers and like eating the people it pulls out this dude's voice just just goes the extra mile for me it's so low and it's got so much Rumble in this mix it was kind of actually like listening to a Atilla singing on Suns past album monoliths and dimensions sometimes he's got these long-winded growls and other times just like this really ugly Koff like wreck bruh and you know all of it just kind of sends chills up my sideburns and then to the top of my head where my brain starts melting the vocals are huge on here but the music is is almost as massive it doesn't sound like your average metal band recording it's kind of encompassing I'm surrounded by this music I feel like I'm in this album while I'm listening to it it sounds like so panoramic like the music is just going on all around me like I've been sucked into this alternate dimension where demons are decapitating people and throwing the corpses into like a lava bath while they laugh maniacally throw a blast beat behind that and you've got a pretty ugly intense situation going on there and things get even better once they kind of let go of that release it and go into a breakdown get really slow get really sludgy and there's a nice balance between these moments - I didn't feel like these guys laid on being too slow being too fast it was a nice even mix of all these different paces I never felt like a part or an idea went on too long or too short never really felt like anything was too undeveloped but to be honest as far as like standout tracks and moments go on this album I can't say they're there any it's not like there's a catchy track or a really light track or a really melodic track this thing is this solid ball of evil I don't so much see this album as a series of eight tracks it's more like a bunch of very ugly and disturbing moments that last 44 minutes these guys for me make death metal really grimy and really ugly again and I love that not an easy job to do in 2011 this is monstrous this is scary this is serious this is a strong eight to a light nine for me disma towards the megalith forever 
8WQLoylfS7U,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's question of the week time and I've always flirted in my head with the possibility of asking this question but I never really got around to it but with the recent little dragon album that I reviewed very glowingly the question is on the tip of my tongue and I have to say it I have to ask it what is your preferred music of choice when it comes to kind of having a soundtrack to your sex yeah sex music music for sex I'm not talking about a sex song I'm not talking about a song to set the mood I'm talking about a full album - just do it - or you know a band or preferred artist when I'm in need of some sex music there are some certain things that I look for I like a nice steady beat you can't be throwing math rock on the stereo that just screws everything up you need a nice smooth sweet sensual vocal you can't be putting Tom Waits on the stereo okay and you know the music the instrumentation it's got to be it's got to be light it's got to be sweet it's got to be you know kind of kind of honey like it can be atmospheric you know maybe a little shoegaze II or something like that but you know it's got to be sweet it's got to taste like sugar I'm thinking you know put on some Chromeo put on some beach house put on some Blonde Redhead maybe going to the the whole trip-hop thing put on some Portishead put on some massive attack of course little dragon - but even that new subtract albums is pretty good for doing the dirty and you know maybe if you're feeling a little more Ricki like sex this time around is going to be a little bit more of an exercise or something like that you throw on some prints you put on some Budo spin you throw on maybe maybe some death from above 1979 and you know if you're a complete psychopath who is completely devoid of any and all subtlety you can always throw on some big black love comes in many forms man and a woman woman and a woman man and a man man and a woman cyber in over Facebook because they live long distance or maybe even man and a synthetic life-sized doll however you choose to love another being or plastic figure what music do you like in the background whilst you do it and what do you look for in insects music let me know because that's what I'm curious about Anthony Fantan Oh sex music [Music] [Music] 
-nG5Q3kMgq8,hello hi Melo hi malachite malachite malachite mellow height mellow height now oh hi Nell hi Mel height mellow height mellow height due to to to to to to to hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd album review mellow hype the reissued version of black and white I've been getting a lot of requests for this thing and I've been kind of hesitant to do it and the reason why is it's an odd future related rap project and not that I was afraid of the music or anything like that but the last odd future release I reviewed Tyler the creators goblin left a pretty nasty taste in my mouth and it's not really just because I didn't like the album from this California rap outfit but so many people on the internet just dick ride convincing themselves that there's no possible way anybody in this crew could do anything wrong or do anything that is short of amazing I mean if you want to be a fanboy that's your choice but this review is more for people who are genuinely interested in what Odd Future may have to offer even though they've kind of hit a peak of popularity which really slumped after Goblin came out I don't think these guys are going anywhere and there's no reason they can't make music I like more in the future even though Tyler the Creator has kind of been the flagship artist of this group not every person in Odd Future sounds like him or Earl look at Frank ocean whose new LP I thought was okay and he's definitely more of the the R&B type or even mellow hype with this new reissue of black and white this thing features Hodgy Beats is the main MC and left-brain producing the beats jumping on the mic on occasion and this thing was dropped originally last year during Halloween but now this kind of vamp version has some tracks taken off and if you add it on I am kind of sad to see tracks like strip club which was a sillier track or even loco which which had some great rhymes on there sort of get kicked off this LP but still black and white is pretty representative of what you can expect from mellow hype and what they have to offer the first thing that hit me on this album I'm sure it's going to hit you on this album is just how young Hodgy Beats sounds he is a skinny guy and he sounds like a skinny guy he's got a really thin thin voice but not necessarily in a bad way I kind of think he sounds like a way less desperate and obnoxious childish gambino he may not have as much dizzying wordplay as Earl does and his voice may not be as unmistakable as Tyler's but I think he's got something a little more accessible going on he's not dark in an annoyingly angsty to the point where you can't relate to him and he's not desperately seeking to piss everybody off with an ear shot plus he doesn't rap about all that that psycho rape crap that that so many people are kind of up in arms over this thing is pretty much weed raps girl raps brag raps gun raps it's not too far from what you might hear on the radio subject matter wise but it's not like Hajis approach to these more familiar subject matters is dumbed down and mellow hype as a unit can really kind of put a song together when they're trying for me there are three tracks on here three that are fantastic standouts that I would love to see more of from mellow hype and the first track that hit me was brain featuring Domo Genesis and what attracted me so much about that track first is just the beat just has these these heavy bass just just low-end kicks this squeaky little synth line and when it really got sexy is when this piano drone kind of just melted into the track like blunt smoke filling the filling the room filling the air of the track Hadji and Domo have good verses on that track but I think the the the real pillar of this album attract I was kind of on the fence with but the more I heard of the more I liked it 64 the synths and the drums just sound really dark and Halloweeny it's closer to what you'd stereotype odd future to sound like but I really love the the lyrics the Hadji lays into this track kind of rapping about his atheism on the first line with I never trust faith with my trust funds he manages to reference wrestling in the midst of rapping about getting someone to overdose on pills references a ton of things among them chicken of the sea tuna and as far as I know one of the fear a pers out there to ever use the word rhetorician in his song in the hook something for the philosophy fans out there the great beats and personality continue on loaded which is pretty much about breaking some bricks of weed down and packaging them up and then moving them on the street and you know the the is as good as the track sounds it's really chill I like Mike Gees verse on that love's low voice when he comes in on the hook but I'm not sure how far into Hajis fantasy world I'm willing to go I mean you know I'm tough I'm a drug dealer now I shoot cops all the time outside of those tracks for me everything else is is either alright or not so alright and that's really where it kind of becomes the usual from odd future for me because it just kind of feels like amateur hour on a lot of these songs you could take a track like I got a gun I see it as a joke especially with the the cartoon vocals coming in on the hook goin you better rude to me when this album gets gets really bad is when mellow hype is actually trying to be good like on dead deputy where you have a pretty good flow from Haji sounds like he's going hard sounds like he's enthusiastic but I can't even tell what the hell he's saying because he swallowed up by this terrible and repetitive sample just the beat engulfs the entire track and it's not even that interesting of the beat and as funny as I think the track the police can be I don't think Tyler and especially left praying are wrapping up to Hajis level on that track it's funny to hear Tyler kind of argue with this imaginary cop but left brains verse is just such a pothole and then on the very last song left brain jumps on the mic again and just has this really amateur clumsy flow and the first lines he throws out there about rocking his hat backwards and dipping his fried chicken in the barbecue sauce the beat on the last track is fun but listening to left brain rap is not as an MC Hadji is pretty good and some of the beats on this thing are some of the best that I've heard from Odd Future so far but this thing still suffers from being pretty inconsistent and all over the place I liked it I'm excited to see what mellow hype does in the future especially if there are more tracks like 64 coming on the horizon but if there's also going to be a bunch of songs like I got a gun then you know inconsistency is still going to ruin whatever these guys put out but what can you expect from Odd Future their popularity their fame has basically been built on the single combined with a music video can we really expect these guys as long as they're riding the odd future wave to really put a solid album together one solid track after another or are we just going to get a string of releases we're get a single hot music video linked them together put the album out singles good some other tracks are okay but there's a bunch of brews for on this thing I'm feeling a light too decent six on this I thought it was likable it was fine a nice handful of tracks I could take away enjoy a lot some bad spots but decent ones too to kind of even out the playing field what do you think of this LP lotta hated why what should I review next thank you for watching my needle drops Anthony Fantana the mellow is music nerd [Music] you 
LK5U4DeBO_o,Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd hello my needle drops hope you're all doing well and having a nice day thanks for watching and it's album review time let's get this out of the way Cal what do you think of little dragon this is a Cal chester reminding you that our little dragons are wild animals not good pets stay safe and get a nice dagger kitty instead spay and neuter that Barker classic cow little little dragon is a band my girlfriend got me into and another reason Americans can be obsessed with Swedish music hava JJ the radio department the knife The Hives luckily Robin the tallest man on earth we definitely do not drool over this many Italian rock bands or German pop singers and I'm sure there's a long winded and historical answer to why this is but I don't have it all I know is that ritual union is little dragons third full-length studio album and a follow up to 2009's Machine dreams and this LP comes after a lot of great guest spots and collaborations for the band and it's frontwoman yuqian igano they've appeared on the new subtract album the new maximum balloon album they will also be contributing music to the forthcoming big boy LP and of course they had some of the best spots on the last Gorillaz album Plastic Beach everything is looking up for these guys right now lots of exposure and I would sure considering how much of a strong straightforward pop record Machine dreams was that ritual Union would be all like simpler louder brighter lip but that's not what ritual Union does it's not and all the pop simplicity has been exchanged for something much more danceable in sensual instead of just like switching gears every single time a hook comes into town a lot of these tracks just function on a single repetitive electronic groove that grows progresses with flex of vocal and synthesizer improv just kind of icing everything and that's me that's a much less instantaneous album than Machine dreams and I could see that being kind of a disappointment to a fan who was hoping these guys would kind of come on strong again because after listening to this thing over and over and over I was actually enjoying it on the same level that I was that new subtract album them really chill beats lots of melody and harmony and great singing to top it all off I mean hell the song precious on this album even sounds like the band has been listening to a little bit of dubstep but before I get further into this LP let me touch down on the vocals you key me into ghana's vocals I love them I could just listen to them all day they're so sweet they're so warm they're so emotive they're so sincere I just get so much out of it so much out of them even without knowing exactly what she's singing about she's just got so much sweetness to her voice and a lot of volume control a lot of range she's just a solid singer something we don't hear often in the age of auto-tune if you're completely new to little dragon tracks like nightlight shuffle a dream and ritual Union those those are easy ins very the immediate very catchy but there's a much darker side to this LP though and the consistent beats synthesizers and vocals just kind of keep those songs from feeling out of place the album flows into these darker moments very well liked the third track on here brush the heat very kind of odd bearing track just these squawking and droning synthesizers in the background it's very moody it's like being followed down an alleyway by a shadowy figure at 2:00 a.m. but this LP gets the most experimental on when I go out which is six minutes long longest track here and has this very light but fast pulsating V and you kinis vocals over it just really go about everywhere she can put them with these fever ray ish effects on her voice just layering all these weird choruses into the mix but no matter how accessible or odd the track on this album may be the whole thing as a whole ritual union as a complete and total package is very smooth and sexy album I usually judge albums and engage my happiness with an album based on you know the feelings it pulls out of me oh this album gets me really excited this album gets me really pumped this album gets me really angry well then this one kind of got me turned on as far as the synthesizers and the drums go like I said little dragon is is is getting more experimental and more sparse with this release they're throwing less sound at the speakers than they were in onine but the set tons that they have kept around are very high quality you know I was kind of tainted against this LP because I saw a little dragon live and they played a good chunk of this album when I saw them and to me a lot of these songs just kind of came off like shortened versions of what they would perform live because a lot of these tracks in in person they were drawing them out I would have been happier if there were more songs on here like stretched out to six minutes but I was pleased with with most of them landing around like 3:30 or 4:30 kind of feeling a light eight light two decent eight on this loved it enjoyed the hell out of it and we'll be getting turned on more by it in the future Anthony Fantana little dragon ritual Union for 
TyGMJtRPF78,They Might Be Giants join us hi everyone he hath anu Fantana here the internets giantest music nerd album review time this is why I love reviewing music because I get to talk about some bands that I love to a group of people who are as excited about music as I am so this review is of the new album join us from they might be giants a Brooklyn band started by singing songwriting duo John flans Berg and John Linnell the John's and easily these guys are one of the nerdiest bands on the planet but we know around here that being nerdy is a huge compliment in fact I think if it wasn't for my nerdiness I wouldn't enjoy songs about shoehorns or cranes or cows or beards or racist friends or mammals or skulls this bands lyrics and song subjects have always made them stand out but they've been paired usually with great pop hooks fantastic melodies bold experimentation and an unmistakable personality They Might Be Giants may not always come out with a great record but they have never made a faceless record even after all of the music that I've heard in my very short lifetime They Might Be Giants stuff still ranks as some of the most fun music I've ever heard for me it stops just short of being a joke for some these guys will be too absurd to take seriously but I need some absurdity in my life every now and then and they might be giants as the perfect place to get it for me now lately these guys have been putting out a lot of kids albums a lot of children's music but still it's not even like their adult music plays to an adult sensibility they're usually playing to the kid in every adult on the face of planet but if you are counting children's albums join us if I'm correct is they might be giants fifteenth studio album there's been a lot of evolution up until this point but I would say the band's recent stuff their recent adult albums have been pretty great at translating their eccentric personality through some modern production and a full band now it's not like they might be giants are going back to their roots on this LP or anything but join us really does come down to sounds and songs for me the songs are pretty on point not everyone is a hit but there's a lot of classic they might be giants on here some tracks are solid but very simple others with very difficult weird and complexly layered vocals that are singing in rounds spots that are almost hilarious spots where songs pause ridiculously esoteric lyrics like an old pine box or even moments that would probably be hilarious to everybody like the track when will you die yeah that's that's about wishing someone was dead and they're great hooks coming from both Linnell and flans berg like on the really jazzy protagonists or the the the small-scale rock anthem canada harry there could have been more experimental tracks on here though these guys are known for really working outside of the box and and being somewhat zany but i guess i don't get enough of that there are two different sets of lyrics going on in the left channel and the right channel on spoiler alert that's pretty funny dog walker has pitch shifted vocals which and i didn't care for it's different ground for these guys but there's a spot on here where john f-- Landsberg is narrating the voice of a raindrop on cloisonne where he just so you know not only is this thing not really pushing all that many boundaries for for they might be giants but to be honest the the sound here on this album really is not doing it for me at all now the sound isn't terrible it's not like it's it's terrible quality it's not like it's weird or anything like that I guess for the first time the instrumentation behind the John's songs sounds a little generic it's not like I mistook they might be giants for another band or anything like that but on a lot of these songs the the sound of the guitars the bass the drums and the keyboards they kind of feel like they could have been generated by like like any group to me on earlier records the guitars have sounded fuller the woodwinds and brass have sounded more eccentric this just doesn't sound like the usual level of color and quality join us kind of sounds like a live session recorded at a radio station or something like that not a fully completed and detailed and rich piece of studio work in comparison the else and the spine are way less flimsy sonically it's kind of like hearing my usual they might be giants but there's like a the thin film of dust on it that like I'm rubbing at it with extra listens and it just will not come off and don't get me wrong there are spots on here where the songs are so good that the sound the plainer sound I guess doesn't really bother me I mean is the band maturing are they trying to distance themselves from the from the quirky label that people always throw on to them are they trying to put together something that is simpler more skeletal something that's easier to execute live but yes to any of these questions on paper sounds great it sounds really good but if it's gonna make an album like join us I mean I'm gonna have to advocate being immature being quirky and throwing all of the complications into overdrive so I'm feeling of 5 to 6 on this record it's not terrible but it's definitely not going to go down in history as one of my favorite They Might Be Giants albums but if this is the first time you're hearing of the band or if for some reason you've heard of them before but you haven't checked them out don't let this album deter you if you do check it out and you don't like it if you're going to get into these guys their first for albums you cannot go wrong they sit proudly in my personal collection especially Lincoln if you haven't heard this album please check it out to not like it is to not like fun but if you were they might be Giants fan let me know what you think of this LP love it hey that why do you feel the same way I do about the sound of this record and if not let me know and what do you think of the songs on this thing - thank you for watching Anthony Fantana They Might Be Giants forever

Uknh7QaW87Y,Portugal man hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's manliest music nerd and the album review Portugal the man in the mountain in the cloud this is the second time I'm reviewing something from this Alaskan band on this YouTube channel but this is definitely not my second run-in with them I've been following them since I got turned on to their LP censored colors in 2008 which actually became one of my favourite releases of that year but maybe that album was a bad place to start because ever since I heard censored colors I haven't liked anything Portugal the man has put out since then I haven't liked any of it for me the satanic Satanist and especially American ghetto are the opposite of censored colors because they're so condensed they're so shortened they're they're simplified they're plainly structured too much to really give me the same rush of energy that the songs on censored colors did and for me this album returns to a little bit the same ambition and big production experience that I fell on censored colors on this album Portugal the man really let's it's David Bowie influences fly to drumming up something that is equal parts psychedelic rock glam rock indie and baroque pop nearly all of these flavors hit on the very first track of the album with these guitar chords syncopated with the drums this big joyous bright rock chorus a lot of strings tightly wound around this chorus too and just a lot of instrumentation backing the song up in general it kind of felt like something I could hear t-rex doing but the style that the band goes for on that track they don't vary too far from it on a lot of these songs it's kind of like hearing the same thing executed again and again and again and again and not that that's the worst thing in the world but some moments were clearly more exciting than others for me and still Portugal demand is is not ready to give up its desire to condense its songs they want to throw more instrumentation in more layers more everything but they don't want to give these tracks more time to grow and breathe and explore like on the track floating I'm barely getting a taste of the verses on this song because I'm hearing the ooo chorus so many times not only that but but but a lot of these choruses sound pretty similar similar two songs these guys have written in the past and songs that are on this album as I'm listening to a hook on this LP I hear memories of other ones echoing in my mind and this is something that usually goes away as I listen to an album more and more oh some of the tracks sound the same I'll listen more I'll learn and I'll hear the differences in the subtleties but the more I listen to this thing the stronger that feeling became still that's that's just my opinion and and there definitely are tracks on here that stick out for me God it all is a great single for this album it's passionate it's invigorating it's a great use of the strings that Portugal the man broked this album out with and the verses have the perfect and the verses have a great amount of breathing room and do I hear some bongos in the background of this track if if I do nice touch the track all your light just brings things down lets things simmer it's a great kind of lower darker point that I wish this album had more tracks like there's a spot of acoustic ballad Rhian once was one and my favorite track which shouldn't be hard to figure out if you've been listening to my gripes is the last one which clocks in at 6 minutes this track takes its time introducing the vocals the electric guitar the swelling strings the cymbal rolls before it falls into a groove and then it saves it's all an explosion for the end and I just find that much more gratifying than three to five semi explosions in one single track though this LP is a step in the right direction I just found too many similarities between a lot of these tracks to really kind of want me to return to them again and again again and I'm not talking about instrumentally I mean Portugal demand is usually pretty good on this LP about kind of featuring spotlighting a different instrument in each song what I'm talking about here is melody chord progression and key I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP I know that isn't an exciting number for some of you but it's exciting to me actually because I haven't liked anything these guys have done since censored colors to find myself at least digging this LP a little bit is nice what do you think of this LP love it hate it why what should i review next you're the best thank you for watching Anthony Fantana Portugal the man forever you 
Lu7PAAopMyY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review toxic Holocaust conjure and command I went back and looked at some of my favorite LPS of this year so far and this is definitely one of 2011's more grim moments the personality and just attitude this LP is so horrifyingly ugly that it really ranks up there with Death Grips for me but this is not an experimental hip-hop album it's actually a thrash album the fourth to come out from this project fronted by multi-instrumentalist Joel grind who up until this point recorded and performed all of his albums himself his demos to the stars have really aligned for toxic Holocaust Joel is not solo anymore the project is performing with its best recording quality to date and this album offers up some of the most immediate and pummeling thrash hybrids I've heard in a while because toxic Holocaust is is not just a thrash metal band there have always been elements of hardcore punk crust punk and black metal powering the sound behind this music too but on Condren Command the aroma of black metal is kind of fading in the air and that's not necessarily a bad thing I actually think it's led to something with a lot more impact even on my first listen this LP was getting me really pumped and excited like some of my thrash crossover favorites I know this doesn't really have a classic sound like something from the cro-mags or suicidal tendencies may but I still get that same feeling here of just this unstoppable force the sound of this release is a little different from previous efforts there's little to no reverb on this thing it's not really drenched in effects it's pretty dry actually very lean the beefy as well it's nothing but muscle and bone dismembered limbs and corpses and it sounds so good on my stereo when I crank this thing oh it's so good loud the drums are fantastic the snare is really nice and punchy the cymbals aren't mixed too high like they were on previous toxic holocaust LPS and the rhythm guitars have a nice coarse grinding texture to them it's kind of like rubbing my fingers across some sandpaper or getting dragged across asphalt by a rope tied to the back of a pickup truck and joel grinds vocals for me he walks this perfect tightrope act of just being so forced and so loud that it holds my attention but he's not so extreme that i get tired of hearing him really quickly overall the sound of this album is very filthy it's very thick it's very grimy very grimy thrash album all the songs are covered in this really similar grime eNOS so much so to the point where when some of these tracks fly by even on the second listen of this LP you might get the feeling of oh this is Sammy Sammy but believe me when I say that that's not the case my eyes my ears kind of needed to adjust to the apocalyptic fog that these songs bring so this thing did offer a little bit more every time I listen to it again and actually it wasn't until my last listen that I really started getting into the lyrics and basically the words are about every ugly terrible thing that mankind has ever done lots of imagery of of dying breaths being hunted down by a murderer eating the rotting flesh of dead dogs nuclear fallout there's even the track on here where a woman is being burned at the stake because of course she is being religiously persecuted though the ugly picture is nice what I like most about the lyrics is that most of them are are detailing a store and that's what makes them really stick with me but even the less wordy moments on this LP still come off really great to me because the sound the riffs and the energy are all high quality because this thing is a thrash crossover record it's more of a focus on the grooves the breakdowns the momentum of these songs not really the the flashing musicianship that may pull some metal fans into their favorite thrash albums but I will say these guys are not as punked out as a lot of crossover acts maybe because there are some spots on here where I do notice some nice guitar solos even if they're short I noticed some key changes and some harmonious guitar layering that I think a more punked out band would would avoid and even though toxic Holocaust doesn't change it up a lot on this album it's not like I really need them to this thing only lasts 33 minutes I only have 10 tracks it's a nice quick shot of and this album definitely serves as a nice modern middle ground that I think metal fans and Punk fans can approach with excitement I'm feeling a decent too strong 8 on this loved the the hell out of it really enjoyable but what do you think of this album did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching love you Anthony Fantana toxic Holocaust forever 
-jvtyvMWE88,but cooler kids ride the bicycle Anthony Fantana the Internet's cruelest no busiest music nerd and it's album review time the cool kids when fish ride bicycles I've been getting a lot of requests for this one and you know what I was excited to do it too because i can't believe it's been three years since i was introduced to these guys on the bake sale EP it almost feels like yesterday when i was listening to chuck english and mikey rock spit funny rhymes about cars and clothes over that chunky beats that rumbled my stereo but after bakesale dropped to me the cool kids kind of lost a lot of momentum I know we got some mixtape action in between then and now but the mixtapes weren't that impressive and my expectations weren't that high to begin with because they were free mixtapes and even though on this LP the cool kids sound roughly the same the more I listened the more I kind of realized I'm not dealing with the same people I was in 2008 one thing I do love about this LP though is something that I think has remained intact and stayed awesome about the cool kids that's the beats Chuck Inglish is production is fantastic it sounds so heavy so crisp it just has so much impact and yet the sounds aren't overbearing there's not a lot of stuff being thrown at me they're very simple beats they're loud but sparse and just really focus on the bass those heavy rhythms they're just a giant and tasty in and simple it's like just jamming ten pieces of bubble gum in your mouth all at once and chewing them up and then blowing a bubble four times bigger than your head they have a sound that is creative fun and playful that you don't hear often in modern hip-hop something that I feel like was was lost a little bit after the 80s another thing about cool kids that's on point for me for the most part or the hooks most of them are pretty monotone and repetitive mantras but that doesn't stop them from being catchy but even the tracks that feature singing on the hook some some R&B influences aren't that bad either like the song boomin or the track swimsuits featuring mayer hawthorne i think summer jam is really the only track on here that has a hook that borders on being a little too corny but my major gripe with this LP my problem and it's a big problem really keeps me from enjoying it the rapping the cool kids have never been the most lyrical duo in hip-hop it's not really what they're known for but to me there was a lyrical side to them there was more of a balance on the bake sale now they've kind of devolved into creating an album that is is hip hop for people that don't even listen to the rapping there's less wordplay on this album and overall the lyrics are less impressive and less memorable I really only came away with a couple lyrics that to me were kind of impressive kind of I like the lyric got endo got out dough on bundle up and I also like who lyric I'm part place you're Marvin gardens hmm outside of that the lyrics just make really plain and obvious observations about fantasy situations involving girls clothes and cars a few funny similes here and there this thing is basically as mindlessly materialistic as a rick ross album but it's somehow cool because it's marketed toward the indie crowd seriously the only verses on this thing catching my attention are the verses from the features specifically Ghostface Killah and bun B from UGK because on here the cool kids rapping just sounds so lazy so uneventful it doesn't hold my attention I'm just not really tasting anything but rapping and lyricism just just isn't what makes this record and the cool kids know that because this LP focuses more on letting the instrumentals play out and repeating the hooks more than they really should be repeated because they're just padding things out there are a few spots here where there's more of a balance between lyrics and in the hooks and the instrumental like on GMC that track a little bit reminds me of when I first came upon these guys but there aren't enough moments like that to really keep me hooked on when fish ride this is basically a rap album for people who don't want Tyler the creators goblin to be the only rap album on their iPod it's basically come to the cool kids producing beer commercial rap or Mountain Dew it's a nice album to just kind of have on and do other things to you know soundtrack to a beach party soundtrack to getting baked in a Brooklyn apartment with 30 other people if that's your thing then by all means but me personally I'm kind of feeling a strong 4 on this album didn't like it could see other people liking it more than me definitely but this this is not for me and in a real letdown but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the cool kids went fish ride bicycles forever you 
xiS0XwgBmmA,do 10 more hi everyone Anthony Fantana you're the Internet's busiest uh music nerd its album review time Touche amore parting the sea between brightness and me now if you guessed from that title that this California 5 piece has a lot to say you guessed correctly this is the band sophomore LP and with a lot of improvements on their sound production mixing just recording quality these guys have put together what to me is easily one of the most open honest and therapeutic cathartic albums of 2011 and this music is of a style I don't usually cover on the channel mostly because my love for it really doesn't stray too far into the 2000s whether or not you want to call it post hardcore scream Oh emo core whatever so because I'm not into a lot of recent stuff from these genres I was surprised to catch myself enjoying this but where to start because there's a lot to say about this LP despite the fact that it is only 20 minutes spread across 13 tracks first off I think the production is the easiest thing to touch down upon it's most likely the best thing this album has going for it the vocals are mixed really high but for good reason the guitars are really grating but equally harmonious and the drums just really pump they drive this record those crashes are just so bright and just so harsh and the bass is just really warm and thick and a very nice counter to a lot of the more aggressive sounds on this LP overall with the recording this album is really on point the band sounds like there they're playing this stuff live in the moment together it doesn't feel rigid it doesn't feel plastic it's very mush loud in a live album now as far as the style goes this very emotional brand of rock music don't take the volume and the screaming as just anger this is not an angry album if anything this album comes off more lonely fearful stressed and depressed if this album is angry it's only anger fueled by those emotions and you hear about these emotions and the stories behind them through these very ultra poetic flowery flowery lyrics and do they get corny yes they do they get very corny I actually think most people would be too cynical not to laugh at these lyrics if they were just written down on a piece of paper really the only thing keeping me from laughing is how sin  sear the band's vocalist is when he's saying this stuff and that's really kind of a part of the appeal of this album I mean the vocals and the lyrics are just so overpowering and so prominent I found myself listening to this thing a lot like I would a hip hop album with the lyrics kind of taking precedent over the music behind them and these words are always delivered in a very serious and desperate tone and some of them go over better than others for me I do love spots like and for my final trick I will make everyone who loves me disappear but I won't know how to bring them back there are so many spots where I really feel like I can quote this LP they really sound like the kind of band who would play at a basement show where the air is so thick with heat and sweat it's difficult to breathe and where 75% of the people attending know all the lyrics and they're screaming along but there are other lyrics like not picking up my phone driving a low damaged goods damaged goods damaged goods rain clouds those spots I could really kind of take or leave so yeah this LP is kind of overly emotional it's a little sappy it's a little achy but I wouldn't charge it as being weak or soft because of that the words feel very vulnerable but the music behind them isn't the music really charges the words on this LP and kind of makes this whole thing feel like a very relieving experience like the vocalist is empowered by saying all this stuff and just letting it go these guys have a serious Punk spirit kind of flowing throughout this album and they know that their style is best suited in small increments which is why many of these songs are pretty brief and to the point but in a lot of these short tracks these guys still manage to throw a lot in take the song artificial building drum rolls that segue into booming chords the band breaks it down in the halftime then they just go full-speed they break it into a climax it sounds like three different things in itself I'm always impressed by how much these guys throw into their music but that can be sort of a default sometimes because there are spots where these songs do come off more disjointed than connected kind of like the puzzle pieces are really being forced into each other and as long as I'm kind of hopping on the complain train I guess I could have used a more variety on this LP especially in the vocals a lot like that  up album I reviewed earlier this year hearing the voice not just do the same tricks over and over and over but basically settle into these mid-range screens throughout the LP kind of wears me down a little bit as exciting as this album can be on a lot of these tracks still as I was repeating this LP again and again to try to get to know it then review it I was giving myself get a little bit of a headache we'll admit it some narrations would have been nice some more harmony and melody would have been Ace even if it is loud the only real change in color on this album is on condolences where there's a soul piano with lyrics screaming of course that kind of asks the listener if they've ever fantasized about their funeral and what music would play which we've all done still despite all the positive things I have to say about this LP I don't know if a lot of you are really going to be into it and I think it mostly has to do with maybe your perspective versus the perspective of the people creating this album I mean this LP is offended at how cheap and ritualistic everyday interactions and relationships are because a lot of people are so fake and avoid honesty at all costs for the sake of being accepted getting along and all that BS most people have been worn down to the point where wearing a mask every day is normal but just because it's normal does that make it good or right or what should be that's the question this album asks and after waiting out my likes versus my dislikes of this LP I am not in love with this album but these guys have my respect and this album has been enjoyed feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing but what do you think of it do you like it do you hate it and why what should i our view next and why am i whispering let me know anthony fans hana to shame or forever [Music] you 
BrT6sEYrXew,sorry hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy use music nerd and it's time for an album review zombie escape velocity zombie is a duo one of my favorite duo's which is why it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that it's taking me until now to talk about their new album but now that I'm feeling this record up and down in a very sexy way if you can imagine it I'm liking what I'm hearing because the music on this thing moves in a very interesting direction for these guys zombie plays a very sound track ready style of synthesizer rock that has been changing a little bit over the course of the duo's past two LPs slowly these guys have been drifting away from their dependence on the synthesizer drifting away from their tangerine dream roots and now they're incorporating more bass guitar more electric guitar and even more acoustic guitar all of it reached a peak on the album's spirit animal which might had been too much of a change for some fans it was a thicker sound a heavier sound a more rock-oriented sound but I liked it it was a lot less Spacey but to me still very thought-provoking with zombie dishing out one long-winded and femme ik epic after another escape velocity basically throws all of the instruments Sambi has been furnishing their music with out the window and they basically get back to the basics of drums and synthesizers of course that doesn't mean this zombie LP feels empty less lush less sound heavy because Steve more just fills in all of these newly formed gaps with more synthesizers just bubbling arpeggios that are sequenced and carry out through an entire tract just wailing synth leads some synth sounds that even sound like horns at some points nearly all of the five songs here really function on an ark really slow quiet introduction to begin things and slowly the sounds get louder more instruments sort of introduced themselves more melodies phrases just repeat into this never-ending groove the grooves get harder tension builds and I like that I like that kind of stuff my issue is that some of the arcs on this album are more tense more thrilling more climactic than others like the title track for instance I wish it were a little bit more subtle and also it kind of exposes the issue that some people may have about zombie it's that you know the drums are really great AEE Patera is a fantastic drummer and he just puts so much intricacy into his fills his changes all of that but sometimes hearing him laid against these repeating synthesizer phrases that are just kind of punched into this one tempo can't expose how flat zombie can feel sometimes maybe you know just needing a little bit more of a human touch my favorite song on the album that was d-iii which is a great combination of this new stripped-down version of zombie where they're getting back to their roots and also the more ambitious directions they were pursuing on spirit animal because that song doesn't really function on one single arc there are many climaxes throughout the track it's really a rollercoaster ride that not only goes up and down but twists sideways it's it's the most multi-dimensional song on the album the last track cuts out a little early for me with a fade-out and the thing is my only real issue with this LP is that the entire album itself cuts out a little early I know we've had some solo stuff coming out building up until this point but still considering this band's last album was three years ago and it was almost an hour long to hear these guys only make music for 34 minutes is a little hmm still this is another solid zombie album for me that comes on slow reveals more detail with each listen and sounds like something that would be best fit for the soundtrack of a 70s or 80s b-movie that has some kind of storyline that that takes place in space where this space pirate has become a stowaway on this military ship and he's climbing through the air ducts and shooting people with lasers who are wearing uniforms and and basically taking over the ship he's kind of like a space pirate ninja of course this movie is loaded with with terrible effects and dialogue and acting but hey the soundtrack is good basically feeling a strong seven to eight on this album but let me know what you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana zombie escape velocity breath 
5JpGfj5H_GE,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quick little list that a few people had asked me about just shortly after I did my favorites of 2011 so far video which was very very hard to do but this video was actually very easy to put together for me I want to know what were some of your biggest letdowns musical let downs of 2011 what bands really had you excited for a new LP but they just really didn't meet your expectations what albums in your opinion this year really really missed the mark for you here are five that that really kind of did so for me number one the earliest disappointment this year for me was was easily the new wire LP um why are you guys no I just I just love a lot of that band's discography early discography to death and a lot of their stuff that they've been putting out since they've sort of reunited it hasn't been that bad but this was just this this was not not to my enjoyment next it admittedly the new explosions in the sky album I had such such high hopes for that I mean I know I didn't like the first song to drop from that LP all that much but still I thought that the other tracks would have a little bit more to offer me than than what I actually found next the new jesu LP ascension Jesu has made some of my favorite tracks and releases in you know the doom shoegaze post-metal whatever the hell you want to call it style rock that I can really get lost in but I didn't really feel myself getting lost in much on this LP not only did I feel like some of the songs a lot of the songs were weren't really much to write home about but the sounds on this release I felt were very subpar in comparison to previous jesu releases next you know it's not like this one was the worst release in the world I definitely think this band can bounce back and make something that that I love again they still have their style I just feel like you know that the tunes weren't all that fantastic on this one the new woods LP Sun and shade which I liked it more than I did but there there were some standouts that I pulled out of it especially that cover that they did on there which was really really good cover I'm sticking with these guys just gonna see what they put out next and this last one to be completely honest I mean the music video that dropped before the album was great the the single that came with it was was pretty good not the most amazing thing I've heard all year but this dude has a really unique voice sort of seem to have the world by the balls and then is album dropped and uh while I think Tyler and Odd Future can sort of add a different voice a different dynamic to sort of semi popular hip hop conversation I'm just not into a lot of the music that that these guys are putting out so let me know what albums and releases really kind of left you wanting more this year hmm Anthony Fantana the needle drop 
6mqaOPpyIsc,guess who has a new album out the horrors well hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this is the third LP from UK rock outfit the horrors and before the band put this LP up streaming for free on their website they dropped the single still life which I loved a lot got me really kind of psyched for the record now if you've listened to this band's first LP you know they were off to a very bold and eccentric start just those dissonant guitars that organ the speed the aggression the forced vocals and with the hair and the clothes just the the image these guys were broadcasting it kind of bordered on gimmicky maybe a little bit but things got refined on the band's second LP it's like the sideshow and the music finally hit this perfect balance and the group really found a way to make slower and moodier songs but still make them carry the same impact the same punch that they're louder and faster tunes do of course it's not like they were completely in the dark when they were going about this they definitely wore their post-punk influences on their sleeves now on skying things mature even more mature almost to the point where it's not as exciting or thrilling as it used to be to listen to these guys maybe and not to say this is a terrible LP it's a good enlike Abul LP it's just got some very underwhelming potholes for me my main issue with some of the tracks on skying has to do with the effects and the atmosphere surrounding some of these songs I mean honestly I'm fed up with groups lathering their music in so much reverb and so much echo it really no longer becomes about the music a lot of the effects that the horrors throw on their music on this LP don't define or tell or explain or color they obscure they cover they veil in a way that makes the horror scene kind of faceless I could think of a few groups in recent memory that have kind of made albums with similar effects and came up with something unique like no age crystal stilts women as well but in the case of skying the effects on this LP just end up taking what makes this band stand out what makes them unique and putting them on the backburner putting them in a spot where they can't really be heard or seen look at the track changing the rain if I wasn't told that was a horror song I would have never ever ever guessed and who is singing on the track is it Ferris Rotter I don't know I can only assume so because it doesn't sound like him it just sounds like every other band using this level of effects I pretty much feel the same way out dive in and and wide-eyed they're just all these really syrupy atmospheres and emotions floating around and really no pancake to go with it my favorite tracks on skying are the leaner tracks the more simple tracks the less effect heavy tracks the more straightforward tracks things on this album finally kind of pick up with I can see through you but the band finally goes for the throat on endless blue the guitars blare on that track I hear the bass the drums push a really nice beat as well everything is very defined very rigid and nothing is lost in all this murk the opening is really gentle too and I love the way these guys incorporate these horn arrangements that show up the track still life to me though is kind of this this perfect combination this perfect blend of horrors new and old selves in a way it kind of ends up having the aesthetic of what may happen if you two were forced to put some kind of spin on post-punk music really big-time and glamorous I mean that in the in the most complimentary way possible it's a pretty accessible Thun but it doesn't lose that that moody edge that horrors pull out of their pockets every once in a while the effects are here but they're not overbearing and the horns show up again and play the best arrangements they've got on the album one of my favorite tracks on this LP though is the longest moving further away with every release the horrors find out different ways to not only make their long tracks longer but also some of the most interesting moments on the album as good as primary colors is it would be a tragedy to see these guys make the same album over again I'm happy that they're experimenting happy they're doing something different but these really weak weak tips of the hat too psychedelic music on this album and and just effects are not not doing it for me they just kind of make these guys end up sounding bland on some of these tracks in my opinion I didn't love it but I did things skying was a pretty good record feeling a life 7 on this thing but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh the horrors skying forever 
w9iUTLxA2_0,there's a new album from washdown hello Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd my needle drops and it's album review time washed out within and without to change this man come on here we go relevant to the topic at hand all right washed out is the solo electronic project of music producer Ernest green who in 2009 gathered a lot of attention a lot of buzz because he was writing maybe not by his choice the wave of popularity fueling this new genre known as chill wave but by now we all know that chill wave is not real the cake is a lie the blogosphere was was very young and reckless we we didn't know what we were doing I'm sorry so let's put that insanity behind us and take this album for what it really is an album of atmospheric and ethereal synth pop tunes that glisten like the Sun on the open ocean this thing has nine tracks spanning 40 minutes and it is a very blissful 40 minutes just take a look at the opening track eyes be closed that track in terms of sound and texture pretty much treads the same water that washed out was swimming through on the life of leisure EP but here the sounds are a little deeper a little brighter a little more expensive sounding the sounds are very lightly smudged with reverb so are the vocals which are not very intelligible because of that but you know in the reverbs defense the vocals aren't very intelligible even when they're not smothered in echo earnest doesn't really like to articulate his lyrics all that well and not that it's terrible but it kind of ends sounding like angelic moaning descending from heaven the production and the sounds are really kind of what make this LP shine make it worth visiting and that's what earnest Greene was doing best when this project started so in a way things really haven't changed all that much maybe they haven't changed enough to really kind of keep me excited about this album even though I was enjoying the previous efforts my only major issue with this album kind of comes down to the songwriting there are a lot of songs that just kind of rely on one single light feathery groove to kind of carry the weight of the entire track and washed-out just kind of lets the melodies and the chords and the song structures get swallowed and all this reverb murkiness and haze and while I do like echoes I do like atmosphere I like something behind that - kind of empowering it and while I do like grooves you know I love great beats I love great bass lines um I like my grooves a little harder than the brand of beats that have kind of been pulled together on this LP tracks like eyes be closed and echoes sound really really good but there's not much behind the sound to kind of keep me engaged and keep me interested it doesn't really seem like something for the foreground I guess maybe more of a soundtrack maybe a soundtrack to whatever they're doing on the cover looks fun not every song is completely underwhelming for me though things kind of brighten up on the next two songs soft and amor fati where these Caribbean and these Island sounds kind of come into play with these bongos and these very bright bouncy keyboards the songs themselves still aren't blowing me away but that track is just so juicy it is a watermelon it is a whole sleeve of starbursts it's a handful of strawberries but I think my favorite number on here is easily far away on that track the haze and the effects kind of take a backseat to concentrate on the song writing the song structure it's not all lost in the hay I hear a really deep sexy bassline backed with some huge drums and shakers and Ernests voice over all of it sounds pretty sensual here I love the twinkling melodies over this track and their string arrangements in it too and their perfectly crafted mixed and incorporated showing how ambitious this project can be when it wants to be not every song here really wowed me like that one though the only other strong song on here for me is you and I and I track reviewed that one a long time ago and that was sort of an Adult Swim single I'm not going to go too deeply into it now but the track review video for that song is linked below this video you can pretty much see me freak out over the song and I still feel very strongly about it love it the title track of this LP starts off well enough the first two thirds have a nice beat the music moves really well but then all of a sudden it gives way to these sparkling sounds this sonic glitter and it does that for a minute and then kind of uses that as an excuse to just fade the song out and there may or may not be a band who may or may not have written a song which sounds a little similar to the melody on the title track here the band may or may not be Linkin Park no but at least the LP kind of ends pretty well with the ambition that I liked so much on a few previous tracks starts off as a really simple quiet soft piano ballad and with the effects that Ernest green uses the piano just has this really cascading shimmering effect that I love sounds beautiful and the song swells really nicely subtly introducing horns and all this atmosphere that I can't really explain completely it's just very envelope I'll with in and without is a very light easygoing not exactly memorable but pastel-colored album that sounds like a blurry memory of a summer day on the beach in nineteen five the blurriness is part of the appeal I imagine it is but that same blurriness also kind of makes it difficult for me to grasp some of these songs because I feel like I'm really reaching into some of these tracks and grabbing but all I'm doing is just waving my arms through clouds of mist there are some very strong and memorable tunes on here and proof that this guy is definitely trying to advance his sound his craft his style and that there is ambition here that I hope grows on a future washed-out releases I like this but I didn't love it I actually think I liked the original EP more but still looking forward to the future feeling of strong six to a light seven on this but who cares what does Cal think that's important washed-out is very important because a clean body is a healthy body and if you bathe once a day that's good you heard of here bathing breath [Music] [Music]

1nYHyZgD5zM,section 8 hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd a little stuffier than usual because my sinuses are acting up and it's time for an album review Kendrick Lamar section.80 Kendrick Lamar is a California emcee from the City of Compton a city that a lot of rappers like to represent and flash around to kind of show how tough they are and Compton does come up a lot in Kendricks case but only because his mindset is so against the mindset that usually gets tagged on the City section 80s Kendricks full-length debut he's done the tape thing he's done a lot of good feature spots this year he is getting bigger but I'm not going to say this guy's for everybody Kendricks voice is a little nasal and his inflection his delivery is little too underwhelming to be thrilling to me but he's not really going for one of these stoned or blunted personalities it's a problem I've had with his past stuff the enthusiasm is turned up a little bit more on section 80 it's not where I'd love for it to be but I still enjoy listening to this guy's music a lot and that's because he's really thought-provoking I love his flow I love his wordplay I love his his Rhymes his words what he is saying if there's one thing I cannot attack Kendrick on on any level that is substance he's always got that he's always got something substantial to say and until I looked up Kendricks age which i think is 23 I had a hard time placing his age he sounds really really young he has the hunger and the will to experiment that a young artist would have he's spitting out a lot of beats that older rappers might see as too soft too melodic or even to elect tronic like on no makeup or Tammy song or even the jazzed out spoken word track that is absol outro and from the sound of things I think he and a lot of the people who took the time to produce the instrumentals on this album were heavy into Kanye's last album overall it's just a really young album that feels wise beyond its years because considering some of the dark and abstract stuff that Kendrick raps about on this LP he's either much older than he says he is or he's put a lot more thought than your average 20-something has into just the world at large and existence I mean I kind of knew I was in for something different just from the first track alone your ethnicity which kind of starts off with this smokey deep voice narrator talking next to a campfire and he pops up throughout the album and that leads into a song that points out fighting over skin color religion ethnicity is pointless the mood kind of lightens up on the second track a little bit though hold up which in that song Kendrick kind of muses in his head about having sex with a stewardess on a plane and it's funny how he introduces himself and his personality in his worldview a little bit more even when he's just kind of joking around and in this song he actually spit it it's one of my favorite lines on the album which actually is wicked as a tea reverence in a pool of fire with devils holding hands from a distance don't know which one is a Christian damn on the song ADHD Kendrick kind of talks about drugs among other things kind of eroding the attention spans and values and and health of pretty much my generation and this theme comes up again and again and again on the album using drugs as a way to kind of - now and not in a really joyous or happy way Kendrick kind of seems unsure and uneasy about where his generation is headed rapping about how kind of reckless or directionless but Keisha's song to me is one of the most vivid and depressing on here one of the most notable stories on this album but I don't want to ruin all the storylines for you guys for the most part Kendricks flows on this album are just like the ones on those tracks really laid-back but there's kind of a lot to think about in what he says there points on this LP where he goes harder and that makes for a really you know kind of nice peak and I stand out like on the track Ronald Reagan era or rigor mortis where he's literally rapping so fast and for so long that his voice is getting higher because he's almost out of breath but I do want to talk about the beats a little bit more before I finish this off many of them are so good that even when a hook is weak I still love it I think the silliest hook on this entire help you easily spiteful chant and you know what the epic horns on that track the deep bass the hard drums just the atmosphere of the instrumental itself is just so good I can't hate the track I really love the soulful singing about screwed-up kids on Ronald Reagan era I like the synthesizers on this thing the organ sounds the bass sounds there are just so many jazzy samples throughout this LP that just reminds me of anything a Tribe Called Quest would have would have made a track out of and even though there are more electronic moments on here there are popular moments on here there are jazzier moments it all just comes together so well because Kendrick is delivering this really consistent personality and message over every song so none of it feels misplaced none of it really feels far-fetched most of the beats on this LP are credited to people who seem to be a part of this this producer collective digit phonics another producer on here credited as THC has a lot of beats on here as well and even Jay Cole has a credit on here as well pretty much on section 80 it's cut-and-dry for me I love the words I love the rhyming I love the messages the personality is great the instrumentals are fantastic better than you would expect on a project that is so kind of low-key I do have a few problems with some of the weak hooks on here I think like I said earlier Kendrick could be a little more enthusiastic on his stuff and and because he is as laid-back as he is some of his guest rappers overshadow him a little bit like bj the chicago kid an abs soul and it's not necessarily because they're technically more proficient than he is but you know he's just got that relaxed approach that isn't his ear grabbing as somebody who is more urgent I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this thing loved it for the most part have a lot of love for this album I like where this guy is going this help he lasted for an hour and it didn't bore me once he's obviously advanced past his previous efforts and I'm excited to see him do that more in the future what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana Kendrick Lamar section.80 forever you

Wp20Qxx2lOc,oh sorry well well well well well well well hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most metallic music nerd I know this album really isn't news to anyone but I feel like talking about it these guys have been rocking and reeling in Auckland New Zealand since about 2000 I hope someone gets that joke and this is the band's third LP and when it came out back in January earlier this year toward the end of that month and I first heard it I was not ready for it I was not ready for this I didn't assume this album to be bad but I was not in a mental state to kind of take on a behemoth a mammoth like this and get into its intricacies and really try to understand it for what it is you guys know from my previous reviews I love detail in my albums I love changes I love surprises and left hooks and when it comes to that this album loves to tango and not only that but it is loud it is dizzyingly technical it is heavy it is aggressive so kind of revisiting this LP to take in more of its details is kind of like returning for more punishment it's a death metal album maybe a technical death metal album not really a style I cover much on this channel but the thing is I honestly haven't loved much death metal since the genres heyday for me the Styles emphasis on being extreme has led to a lot of bitten bands and albums shooting for studio tricks that kind of end up making their music sound loud but a lot like plastic and other records try to be more brutal through technicality but end up kind of sounding like meaningless wanker II that does not resonate with me on any level even on musicianship thankfully this album is a welcome change of pace from both of those things even though destroyers of all sounds very very expensive the recording is so organic to me the way the drums and guitars bounce off of each other feels so natural and just kind of keeps me invested into every twist and turn this album makes and while it is really technical the virtuosity these guys display doesn't just get wasted on showing you how great they are individually but as a unit crafting these spiraling metal songs that are just so easy to get lost in now in comparison with ulcerates past two releases this album is a slightly easier pill to swallow but not by much it's still a very overbearing set of seven songs ulcery is turning up the atmosphere and turning down the tempo a little bit to the point where I could see even doom and sludge metal fans getting into this album I know the first three tracks of this LP can be really intense and if you're listening they'll throw a lot at you but if you manage to stick with destroyers of all into its second half it's really surprising to see how great these guys are writing slower songs as well the fourth track is a really brooding one that sounds basically like these guys are playing in an Avant metal jam and things get even heavier and Atmospheric on my favorite track of the cell pee omens where the drumming is just great it's just jumping from the left side to the right side all the Tom's all of the cymbals just sound like they're in different places it's so panoramic it's like hearing the drums dance around in this fog of distorted bass and guitar and it builds up to the more aggressive moments in that song really seamlessly - now the final track which is the title track justifies its 10-minute length and kind of crumbles the world that these guys just spend building with the previous 40 minutes of music a really cinematic ending to this album now if I were to name some some problems I am having with this LP I feel like maybe the vocals and and the guitar tones too could have changed up a little bit and would have aided with being able to separate these songs in my head plus some of these tracks are so Rubik's Cube ish like being puzzling is is one of the best traits and obviously as I listen to this album again and again and again that unpredictability kind of waned for me I guess my only other issue with destroyers of all is is just with how prominent the drums are and don't get me wrong Jami the drummer from this band is is quite possibly the backbone I mean ulcery would not be all sorry if the drums were not this detailed not this technical not this flashy but I think a little extra guitar volume would have brought the atmospheric element of this album kind of full circle plus I think the the bass kind of gets shafted on this album even though my finger isn't always on the pulse of the style of music I'm not stupid I know when I'm hearing something good the the tenants of creativity and interesting sounds still apply no matter what the genre and this LP definitely has a lot of that feeling a decent too strong seven on this album and if you are into metal music and this somehow slipped by you I recommend you go back and listen to it hmm Anthony Fantana ulcerate destroyers of all what do you think about this album and what should I review next forever you 
zEHPgX9w9R4,herman do strange music hey everyone anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and yes I know the new horrors is out there on the internet and there are other hot and very requested albums of foot that you know I will review in the future but I just spent 20 minutes talking about little bee just give me the next couple days just kind of you know just just for a few whatever tickles my fancy you know besides let's not forget about the the point of this channel me turning you on to music music without further ado do Herman dune is a French duo which insists on continuing to sing and write its songs in English yay for no language barriers for my english speaking viewers and if i'm not mistaken this is the ninth studio LP to come out of this project strange music music I found out about Herman dune in 2008 with the album next year in Zion and even though I didn't love every song from that LP I just kind of found myself falling for the charms of the duo's lead singer david herman dune kind of has that boyish oddball delivery of jonathan richman but still kind of retains the detailed and meticulous storytelling of silver jews and even though the music on this record isn't terribly original with every track trying to kind of toy with a different influence from country to rock and roll to reggae I just find David's voice so emotive and friendly and approachable and he just finds songwriting inspiration in the strangest places even like a traffic jam of course he finds inspiration and more conventional topics to like loving and done and weird conversations and drugs but he always manages to kind of put a strange quirk on all these things and make me feel like I'm I'm hearing about all of them for the first time even though I've heard about this stuff before I'll give him a chance singing about any of it and partially my attraction to this album is the personality I mentioned earlier but it's also kind of the way David sings with this really thin shaky vocal that kind of sounds like it's trying to put a brave face on in the midst of covering up some kind of emotional pain and I know it's a funny thing to like but I kind of like the way this guy pronounces his words his French accent isn't really thick or anything like that but you can tell that the fact that English isn't his native tongue changes which syllables he's emphasizing and how he says though what do you mean like how does he say to sang rang like how does he pronounced the words in the same I hate god you're just I'm not in love with this album and that basically kind of comes down to the songs themselves it's not a bumpy ride it's not the most memorable ride in the world but it's a smooth one the thing is albums that have kind of this boyish charm aspect to them can wear thin for me a little bit and there are a few tracks on here where I think this album kind of dips a little too far into that trough relying on that to make the songs interesting for me the song the rock is kind of like that and the song be a doll and take my heart is like that as well but what kind of makes that track even worse specifically is that David as much as I like his voice he pulls out his worst singing on the entire album on that song he's so off pitch and maybe just not as a motive as i would have liked him to be and it's not a hard song not a complicated song I think it just might have been able to get fixed with a second take or something they're definitely more highlights on this LP then there are potholes I love the opening track that kind of paints a crazy character of him and this woman that he's in love with a girl who jumps out of windows while he's kind of a guy who refuses to go down to the record store because he's frustrated with how like the band's of today sound like the band's of yesterday i love how breezy and just easygoing tracks like lay your head on my chest and your love is gold are but easily my favorite track on this album is the shortest and it's not because it's short but my joy easily has some of the best lyrics on this entire LP talking about kind of nearing death in a way I think and how I interpreted it was kind of like enjoying life up until that point even talking about dancing like Christopher Walken for me this is a pretty sturdy summer album it's not bad kind of a thing I would put on if I were skipping out on work to cuddle with someone I love all day it's that kind of album feeling a strong six or a light seven on this let me know what you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantan Oh Herman doon strange music first you 
KwTAPEe6A1A,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review now a lot of people want me to do this review and a lot of people don't so I'm kind of damned if I do and damned if I don't do so I'm just going to do what I want and do the friggin review but I'm gonna do it my way way way little B is a California rapper he's the little boss he's the bass God he's Brandon McCartney and he's been doing it for a minute solo as far as I know he's still a member of the pack and honestly I like little B I like the guy I hold no grudges against him I have no hate for him but haters shouldn't start getting mad and writers shouldn't start smiling because it's not as simple as that it never is with me I've reviewed this guy before kind of as a joke with the song I'm Miley Cyrus a while back and I reviewed his stuff again in a slightly more serious tone when he put out angels Exodus earlier this year and the thing is when this guy gets mentioned in my videos in blog posts and and news articles all around the internet people just start frothing at the mouth or just going gaga over him and this kind of confuses me why such strong feelings over one guy what about him makes this happen so in this review I'm going to take little bees music and his context very very seriously and I'm going to kind of put the final nail in the coffin with how I feel about this guy so I won't need to do a review every single time he blows his nose this guy is easily one of the most controversial figures in hip hop right now and it's to the point where almost no one is reviewing his music positively or negatively without bringing all of his backstory all of his context into the picture along with how they feel about his music in fact I'd say most of the time the back story overshadows how people feel about the music or influences how people feel about the music and the thing is it's it's almost impossible for that not to happen a little B can't even really make music these days without bringing all of his context into the picture like Tyler the Creator or like Kanye West this guy lives his drama he loves it he feeds off of it and he knows that it's kind of what builds his popularity he's always rapping about his memes his thousands of tracks his clothes his haters his fans what people say about him and let's not forget swag swag swag swag swag swag swag swag and it's funny because this dude kind of became a hot topic originally because of how terrible his music sounds I mean just muddy mixes stream-of-consciousness rhymes that don't really seem to make all that much sense really lazy flow lots of slurred words and all these songs about money bitches money and bitches and money and bitches to the point where it kind of seems like this character of mainstream hip-hop that you hear on the radio not just those songs but little B has tracks that are like these out there spoken word songs where he tries to be very poignant and and deep as well as these based tracks these cooking songs where he's absurd to the max usually kind of basing the hook around a celebrity or something Bieber Bieber Bieber Bieber just and just and the guy is kind of made a legit following off of producing asinine music and the thing is is that it's understandable I get why and and I enjoy it to an extent and it's hard to explain but usually the first mistake most people make especially when they come across one of little bees cooking tracks one of his bass tracks is that they take it so seriously lately the guy is fooling around he's doing what he wants he's having fun he's not playing by the traditional rules or standards of what it means to be a good rapper and even though by those conventional standards little bees music is is pretty much garbage there's still something kind of fun and liberating about listening to him screw with the rules now most of the controversy about little bees music being bad that's kind of in the past and other controversies about him you know making tracks like I'm god that's that small potatoes at this point this album finds little be at the peak of his newest dilemma naming his new album I'm gay I'm happy and I know this is going to sound kind of weird but this album also kind of finds that'll be in the midst of an artistic evolution where for the most part these days he's taking his cooking tracks he's taken his bass tracks where he's just kind of you know and leaving him on his mixtapes but on his albums he's getting more socio-political and and serious I'm gay is not full of Bieber's and the generous --is in fact I might actually say it's the best thing that'll be has done so far but all-in-all this album is pretty much track after track that kind of explains and highlights exactly what the bass philosophy is and what it is to be based loving life being happy and the haters and doing what you want meanwhile it's trying to make all of these poignant statements about the world at large it's just a positive and nonviolent hip hop album oh and I like that about I'm gay I like its mood I like the fact that it's trying to be meaningful but I put meaningful and it's because I don't get that much meaning out of it even though I kind of get the sense that it's throwing a lot of meaning at me the lyrics on this LP point a lot of fingers at religion hatred poverty violence racism but my issue with this LP like previous efforts where little B tries to get serious is that he executes these very weighty messages with the same lazy flow and can't be bothered to put rhymes together stanzas there are just so many like lyrical bridges to nowhere that don't connect to anything it's like he's just throwing emotional buzzwords out there relying on the listener to hear something about someone dying and then just automatically think whoa someone died that's so deep I mean out of nowhere you'll get lines like people in third-world countries don't even have sidewalks to walk on or I'm stepping in the dragon's lair there's smoke in my eyes I'm not surprised the devil is money it's not even human people dying for a piece of paper it's so stupid I mean so much of this stuff just doesn't connect I mean look at the end of the second track where the lines basically explain if you're poor you're dead nine to five doesn't make you enough money rich people die because they have money there are sports stars who make more money than doctors who are saving lives we should allocate money for builders and plumbers I might go to LA for the summer little B is just throwing a bunch of sad observations out there to see what will stick and yet it's true a lot of the stuff little B says on this album is real it's real these are real things happening outside there in the world real things but I don't find any of this reality to be put all that eloquently or flowed all that impressively or perceived in a way that makes me rethink it I've heard little B rap better on other tracks and the thing is is that he never displays a desire to wrap up to his full potential or wrap up to the traditional standards in hip hop which might make his music a little more palatable but here's the thing little be rapping badly continues to make his music such a hot-button topic if you were to just start wrapping up to the standards of the hip hop mainstream what makes his music worth arguing over would be gone and that would lead to less drama and that would lead to less buzz and that would lead to less popularity and relevancy so it shouldn't be a surprise that his articulation is off that he'll just mumble a bunch of words together to the point where they're unintelligible or he'll just pause in the middle of a line without warning but back to some of the messages on this album I get what little B is trying to do the world sucks I know but it's not news to me is it news to you if it is how do you usually spend your days do you wake up and hit on girls on Facebook all morning and then put yourself into a weed coma at about lunchtime do you ever listen to N pyaare or watch a documentary or read a book or watch CNN or log on to a news website because little B's observations of the world at large are not that novel or groundbreaking and it's not like these gems that I quoted earlier are anomalies oh he's just quoting the bad lyrics or he's just taking them out of context or you're just not interpreting them right there are only really a few lyrical moments on here that border on impressing me and I'll give an example I'm not against doing that I like the line men pimping women people losing vision given choices before she even started living to me that says a lot about sexuality and how society perceives the female role and sticks them in that role before they even have a decision about it now some of the sampling on this album is pretty good I like the sole sample on that track the game arguably one of the best tracks on this album I also like that Goo Goo Dolls sample on I hate myself which is manipulated to the point where I couldn't even really tell it was a Goo Goo Dolls sample also there's a slow dive sample on here as well as a little sample from the spirited away soundtrack the beats aren't the best thing in the world but kind of an ace-in-the-hole little B has always had is that they're usually pretty interesting samples than his songs now I do think the album kind of drags on toward the end because a lot of the lyrical themes that he's been harping on at the beginning of the album the second third of the album is well are kind of just getting recycled over and over and over and losing their flavor for me but at the end of the day I think this album is okay it's alright it's the least offensive and most palatable thing little B is done yet but that's really only me analyzing little B's music in a vacuum by itself and you can't really do that whether you like it or you hate it if you do that you're missing the bigger picture because the thing is little B like a lot of artists out there today a lot of musicians understand the musical priorities of the average music listener and most people enjoy music music is at the bottom of the totem pole with things like personality drama images music videos and memes sitting on top would Tyler the creators Yonkers catch on like it did if it wasn't released with that very graphic and very well shot music video would goblin have had the buzz building up to it if it weren't for the blog posts the drama the hate the tweets the controversy no no and if you think the opposite you're wrong and the model works across genres look at waves that guy provides a lot of dramatic blog fodder and also Tonetta would Tonetta be the internet sensation he is if he only made music and didn't make these little creepy dancing videos with thongs and doll masks or even look at the band black lips back in 2009 they were getting blogged like crazy behind their latest LP at the time and it's because they were getting in trouble on their overseas tour they were doing all this crazy crap on stage as well as getting into beefs and now the band has a new album and even though I think it's on par with their last they haven't gotten that much blog action this year because they've been less controversial now to me little B is mostly about the drama mostly about the controversy sure the music does play a role but it's more of a vehicle for that controversy and he's been very public about that before I read an article on NPR music where he was quoted saying that he really looks to and loves getting under people's skin and would he be able to do that would he be the sensation he is without these silly music videos his look his style his personality these ridiculous interviews he does other rappers are trying to beef with him but he comes off very humble one and life loving and friendly without all that stuff little B wouldn't be a sensation little B wouldn't be big he wouldn't be a hit and that's kind of what I loved about him not just the music but kind of the entertainment of following this guy's story and his antics and the thing is as much as it may piss people off to hear me say this I think hip-hop needs a little B it does it really does because whether you hate the guy or you love the guy he's exposed a very real and ugly truth and that is that hip-hop takes itself too seriously little B wouldn't be as popular as he is if the hip-hop community wasn't so easily offended and he knows this so many rappers out there especially in the mainstream are trying to look cool look smooth look rich look sexy look like all the girls want them and little B has gotten popular mocking that image mocking it and that is kind of the true genius of it that's the genius of little B his art is this social experiment kind of now a lot of people say this guy is killing hip-hop and I don't feel that way at all I don't think so I think he's displaying how one-track minded it can be he's all over the model and getting big anyway passing out other rappers lapping them and you know other everybody's confused and just freaking out and getting angry I mean to me if anything is killed hip-hop it's pretty boy goons like 50 cent who glorified violence now despite how great it is that little B is getting huge with no label while kind of taking a wrecking ball to the hip-hop establishment I don't see him as kind of like a hero he's a little bit more of like a wolf in sheep's clothing I mean it's not like this guy's controversy is is accidental it's marketing I'm sure some of its natural but he knows how people are going to react to him little be named this album I'm gay because it would be controversial who knows that I mean yeah sure on some level he believes that you know words don't mean anything people shouldn't freak out over words yeah but you know he knows people will if wearing pink hats were controversial that little B would make an album titled I love pink hats and there'd be a big fat picture of him on the front wearing a pink hat and don't believe all the BS about little B wanting to make an anti homophobic statement with the album title that's just a lie to me I mean little B has used gay and fag as a slur in his songs before in a kind of serious tone look at the song death of rap where he calls people gay or even the beginning of violate that bitch where I'm pretty sure he calls Kat stacks a fag like three times now I don't think little B is homophobic I think he thinks positively of all people but still he's yet to really make amends for throwing these slurs around like a homophobe would in a very public way so maybe organizations like The Washington Post and GLAAD and CNN should do a little more research and be a little more weary of openly accepting the basedgod I'm sure that little B will say or do anything to stay on the good side of the media which covers him on a regular basis and also get under the skin of the people who listen to him so if you simply think that an anti homophobic statement is the only intention behind naming this album I'm gay I'm sorry you've been fooled you're just as guilty of taking all of this too seriously as the haters so let's learn a lesson in controversy in this review I'm feeling a light Zero on I'm gay and if you're going to freak out over what someone else thinks that's not very based of you is it you're not really living the based credo are you but I am because I don't care what other people think about what I say I say what I want to say be as I feel like saying it fuck the haters 30 on my wrist cuz I'm the needle drop hoes I'm a dick cuz I'm the needle drop I'm being happy I'm loving life I'm doing what I want to do are you the thing about little B is I like having him around but I wonder how much longer he's gonna be popular because the thing is he thrives mostly on shocking people and how many times is he going to be able to do that before he's no longer shocking I mean he has proved himself to be really good at it and there's a chance that he'll always remain one step ahead of us and find new ways to kind of get us to go let's stop analyzing it and just enjoy the ride you guys are killing the ride by requesting reviews of this that's what you're doing stop killing the fun just enjoy the ride Anthony

2zmWqxEUYiE,Sam Baker album sam-i-am hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh you're the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's album review time this lp's title is sam baker's album it's the sophomore release from la beat meister Sam I am the follow-up to a CDR album rap beats vol 1 on brain feeder records and brain feeder if you haven't heard of it yet is a record label started by Flying Lotus Los Angeles Flying Lotus Kozma grandma Flying Lotus the Adult Swim bumps Flying Lotus and Flying Lotus and sam-i-am have collaborated together under the name fly am Sam and they might be coming out with an album later this year collaborative album precious cargo but honestly I'm not sure if I'm gonna be looking forward to that album I'm actually not sure if I'm gonna be looking forward to to anything brain feeder puts out in the future from from here on out but the thing is when brain feeder first came out I was really thrilled I was really excited one of my favorite musicians was going to be releasing music from what I assumed were gonna be like-minded artists who I didn't know about shed some light on some people who would push beat music to new heights of creativity and sound nearly everything that's come out on this label so far has kind of underwhelmed me a few artists have come really close to WoW me and I'm keeping an ear on them of course like Gaslamp Killer and mono/poly whose new EP was pretty awesome but so far the albums that have been put out on brain feeder have kind of fallen into two categories for me and that is they're either so odd and formless that I can't really attach anything to them emotionally or they're so straightforward plain and simple that they're just kind of in one ear and out the other they're just not memorable to me and sadly for me sam baker's album falls into that category there are 17 instrumentals on here but a vast majority of them are just kind of non descript to me no matter how many times I listen to this I can't retain much of it but it's not for lack of good production though the drums are really heavy the beats are pronounced the bass lines are very husky very chubby and thick what samples I do here are chopped up pretty well the highs are nice and the entire package is mixed so clearly it's a little saturated but it sounds fine and this thing is definitely not a one-trick pony in terms of different sounds and styles I love the sweet parliament-funkadelic influence coming out of those synthesizers on frosting packets I love those schmaltzy electric piano chords on the song turtles or that rattling percussion on understanding its how these songs are built just assembled that that kind of ends up boring me pretty much all these tracks move past a short introduction and then they run in circles for a little bit with one idea and then they just end up with a predictable fade-out each of these tracks sound best when they've reached their peak which isn't even really that high it's kind of more like a hill and maybe that's because of a lack of development or something so many tracks here just instead of evolving instead of changing instead of adapting they kind of peace out and even when a track on here sounds pretty nice that leaves me with a really kind of empty Hollow unsatisfied feeling I kind of feel like I grab ten bucks and instead of going to get some dinner or something I went down to my local drugstore and bought one of those you know $10 boxes of chocolates you know various assortment and then I just picked out on that and then of course afterwards I felt tired and crappy and unfulfilled I mean this album does have a consistent mood and style though maybe it would appeal more to beat producers and people who are looking for some thing to mmm kind of soundtrack there day maybe so I will say if you were into that Teebs album that came out on brain feeder and maybe you're looking for something that is slightly slightly more upbeat alive then I think you should try to get with this if you're an electronic music enthusiast a hip-hop instrumental enthusiast who's looking for a set of gentle giants because these tracks while they are subdued they're very heavy they've got a lot of weight to them I'm kind of feeling a light five on this album because it underwhelmed me so much I'm just on the fence with it but what do you think of this LP are you loving it are you hating it why what do you think the best context is for this if you're enjoying this album how do you like listening to it and what should I review next hey or if you little-little be next gay 
s1oof42eix8,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd stressing and going insane overdoing this list because it's so difficult for me to make lists my favorite albums of 2011 so far basically what I've done is I've taken the album's on the loved list on the needle drop calm I forced myself to split the list in half and pick my favorites among those if there is an album that is on that loved list that doesn't find itself here it's because I like listening to these more and if there's an album that you love that is not on this list it's because I don't love it but I would still like to see what your favorite albums are so far this year down in the comments below whether it be via a text or video comment all of the albums on this list I don't really think need an in-depth explanation as to why they're there I've reviewed all of them already which is why I'm linking you down there in the d box to the reviews I did of these albums so in no particular order here's my list of favorites so far this year Nickolas jar space is only noise pretty solid electronic and experimental music album that came out earlier this year loved it Dumbo gets mad elephants at the door a free psychedelic rock and pop album love it worm rot dirge I didn't think this grindcore album would continue to thrill me but it still does love it havoc time is up one of the most solid thrash metal revivals I've heard this year well it crystal Stiltz in love with oblivion love it Colin Stetson new history warfare vol 2 judges one of the most creatively recorded and produced albums to ever involve saxophones that I've ever heard in my life love it I know this review is a recent one but I think this album is so creative and interesting and mind-bending that it'll stay in my wheelhouse by the end of the year Shabazz Palaces black up Ice Age new brigade if you like noise rock post-punk no wave come on listen to this thing love it this is the first LP I've listened to all the way through from this particular artist and it was a hell of a place to start PJ Harvey let England shake wobba this next metal album left a huge impact on me when I reviewed it I'm sad that there was so much controversy around this band because their lead singer talks a lot and makes people in the metal community angry but I just love the music liturgy Aesthetica this next group in a completely different genre but equally impacting on my brain Death Grips ex-military love it battles gloss drop Big KRIT return of forever will the love them destroyer could put love it Fleet Foxes helplessness blues love it and the Beastie Boys hot sauce committee part two so that's my list very difficult difficult difficult list to make there were so many albums that I did love this year and it's not that those LPS that are also on the love list weren't worth the positive reviews that I gave them they were it's just that I prefer these I had to cut them got a cut but again what are your favorites so far this year and I'm surprised I found so many favorites at the halfway point of this year if this is what the first half of this year looked like I can't wait for the second mmm-hmm Anthony Fantana lists 2011 forever you 
-f4DyUGCg0w,should bathhouses black up hey I hope everyone is doing well doing good Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review Shabazz Palaces black up as far as I can tell Shabazz Palaces is a hip hop project led by Pallas ear Lazaro but that's not his real name he's actually Ishmael Butler who used to be in the 90s hip-hop outfit digital planets but you don't need to hear that stuff to enjoy this palace ear also brings on some collaborators for this LP but as far as I can tell they are anonymous or working under pseudonyms that I saw listed out on a sub pop Records website if anything you should try to check out the to self releases that Shabazz put out before this new LP black up and how to attack this because there are so many things to say about it let's start with the beats and the production because it's such a vital part to this album I would say more so than a lot of hip-hop albums and I say that because there are so many points where the textures and the effects and the samples and the beats basically take over and maybe drown out the lyricism a little bit and kind of make it play second fiddle but I love the way this thing sounds it's it's really something else if you don't have this LP on a big-ass stereo you're really only hearing half the story because some of the drums some of the low-end some of the kicks on this are really really nice not a lot of release on the drums they're very lean they're very kind of sharp guts but very hard clicky clicky the low-end Rumble shake the ground the the highs are nice and crisp and an atmospheric the samples are cut really well the effects are executed with finesse and this thing is mixed like a monster unless a track is going for a very cacophonous wall of sound it's very clear it's very well balanced some of the beats here are just a really nice straightforward enjoyable no-brainer like were you can you are you felt are you can you where you felt just a really nice droning string sample stuttering jazz piano chords a boom click beat a very chill laid-back flow the whole package of it all kind of puts me in a place that may be listening to Quasimodo or some other Madlib related album would but straight-and-narrow is not the game this LP plays most of the time a lot of these beats are out there you gotta trust me on this one each track has like a plethora of different sounds that I could go into very great detail with like the opener free press and curl very eerie bass hums on that track just sputtering cymbal hits flying all over both mix channels there are a lot of effects being used on Pallas ears voice as the as the song evolves and there are these vocal samples that are literally manipulated mauled I would say to the point where they kind of sound like a steam train whistle blowing it's weird another one of my favorite beats is the second track and it does this trick it does this little turn of the hand that I hear on a lot of these tracks that I haven't heard done quite like this before there's a female vocal sample on there and it is stretched out just aggressively because it's stretched and it's not pitch shifted there's all these like digital stretch marks on edges it's a noisy sound that maybe another producer would do his or her best to try to eliminate or cover up but this LP he just puts it out in the open and it's got a pretty surreal quality their tracks on here loaded with various synthesizers bleeps and bloops like a treaty dedicated and eulogy which that songs first half is basically a cacophonous wall of various sounds and noises but there are tracks here I like a lot that come off very sparse very empty luckily palace e'er has enough charisma to me to fill an entire stadium which is really what locks me in with a lot of these tracks I love the Rhymes I love this flow I just love the personality I love the delivery but I know it's not going to be for everybody if you're a boom bap traditionalist who enjoys a lot of fiery flows a lot of technical ability then this is definitely not going to be for you though there are some very strong statements made in the lyrics on this LP it doesn't really go hard while many rappers are kind of in this bragging competition this LP is more content kind of sitting in the stands and meditating and making fun of albums that fall prey to clichés like materialism and violence and swag that Death Grips album I loved earlier this year made that stuff look stupid and ugly by taking it to such an extreme that it couldn't be rationalized by anybody to be good this album does the same thing but it does it in a way that's toned down kind of in a in a studious way like it would say these rhymes after closing a book and looking over from its tipped glasses this thing is just kind of like a socially conscious full course meal about freedom and racism society at large the Internet age hip hop making music attracting girls and of course there's a bunch of abstract stuff on the menu too like actually one of my favorite verses the Knights are getting stronger and the days are getting longer the building is getting bigger outside is getting smaller the lives are getting truer and the truth is getting brighter things are looking blacker but black is looking whiter what weird but I love it the only thing I'm really kind of mixed on on the fence with is how these songs are put together we have ten tracks here but there are some songs that could easily be two because they hit a transitional moment where the track becomes something completely different it's not really an evolution as much as it is like an immediate shape shift of mood and that's fine it actually makes this LP kind of a thrill to listen to because it unfolds it surprises but there are some songs here that don't have enough track length to fully develop the shifts that they make the track endeavors to me comes off a little aimless its various parts don't connect as much as they kind of clash and the Kings new clothes just kind of ends and fizzles out for no reason just as the song sort of seems to be gaining momentum emotion and a message but outside of that I'm loving this thing it's a great reminder of how mind-altering and up hip-hop music can be but still sound great while being those things so I'm kind of feeling a decent eight on this a decent eight but let me know what you're thinking of this are you loving it are you hitting it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Shabazz Palaces black up forever [Music] [Music] 
nyrKpKxqGX8,it's track reviews it is so humid I hate it it's humid I hate it hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest and greatest and rock pop electronic experimental music of the in der major label everything persuasion but I had to jump on this opportunity this is the first time I'll be reviewing a song a piece of music anything from Bjork an Icelandic singer songwriter who's been making music for a minute and she has a forthcoming LP which this new song comes off of Biophilia and from what I understand this will be her seventh studio LP and this track has been getting a little bit of buzz because before the studio version came out there was a 30-second clip of Bjork in a van playing the song on a stereo and then we were listening via crappy camera microphone but since the studio version has come out other information has come out along with it - like this album is supposed to have a music video accompanying each song and not only that but this is supposed to be like an iPad album with each individual song kind of being its own app and all of the songs coming together into the biophilia app which is kind of like a mommy app for all the songs and I've been hearing that the apps are supposed to maybe allow people to recreate the songs on this album it's really involved and confusing when this album comes out am I going to be able to review it number one I don't have an iPad and number two I'm really more of a music slash album reviewer I wonder if I'll really have anything to say about the visual aspects of this LP or if I just simply review the music is that may be kind of pointless or maybe against the purpose of the album since maybe it should be enjoyed with its visuals much like a soundtrack as much as I appreciate the growing ambition that comes with each new Bjork album I kind of wonder if what's going on here this project is gonna kind of end up like those enhanced CDs that labels used to put out in like 1999 and 2000 and 2001 will we still be using iPads 10 years from now I don't know all I really care about is whether or not I will be wanting to listen to this song 10 years from now so let's give a listen to it Bjork crystalline there's a link below this video on YouTube where you can listen to it let's go all right let's start with the sounds on this track for the most part I enjoyed the sounds quite a bit I liked the chimes that were constant throughout the song for the most part I liked the beats how I guess shy they were at the beginning of the song and then how as the song progressed they just put more force into what was happening the percussion is kind of glitchy I liked that a lot and Bjork's voice dynamic as usual just twisting and turning in various directions creating odd melodies swelling falling changing with the song or maybe it just kind of seems like it should be the thing is I do have an issue I do have a big problem with this track and it's that there are a couple parts in this song where the beat kind of just falls out of the picture in Bjork's voice and the instrumentation kind of takes over for a moment and then the beat kind of enters the picture again like I said this happens a couple times and even though this is a change a change has occurred I still kind of feel like I'm listening to the same thing over and over and over and over for four minutes and that's kind of weird I can't really recall a song that made me feel that way where I was listening and even though there was some kind of noticeable change going on I kind of felt like I was still listening to the same thing maybe not enough progression or not the progression I was looking for the beat falls in the beat falls out the beat falls in the beat falls out when it comes back in it's not all that altered and the thing is the melody of the track and Bjork's vocal inflection to me hasn't changed all that much either to make me feel like oh the first minute of the track is definitely in a different place in the third minute of the track at the very end of this song there is a change it gets loud very loud and even though it's nice to have kind of a climax at the end of this thing I'm not sure it was the kind of climax I was really looking for I guess all these breakbeats unexpected break beats just kind of flew in and took over and created an all-out sonic assault the song just basically ends with 42 seconds of these hard loud breaks and the way they're executed the way they're put together I can't really say much about them honestly I mean they're that kind of faceless it kind of sounded like some internet DJ who is just starting out likes to upload remixes on to the internet remix to Bjork song and then put it up on YouTube and after that part the song just kind of stops I'm just kind of lost on this track it doesn't have all those things that I usually look for and enjoy in Bjork's music like growth than just that incomparable passion and emotion that she displays in her voice and her instrumentation and songwriting but that's just my opinion let me know what you think I would like to maybe hear some positive views on this track down there in the comments maybe be swayed on this and become a little more excited about this forthcoming LP because I mean honestly I haven't really been in love in love with anything Bjork has done since like Vespertine so I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this track some very likeable things and it's not a terrible song but I'm definitely not going to be returning to this anytime soon outside of the context of of this new LP which I hope I get a chance to listen to all the way through and maybe enjoy in the multimedia context and see if it makes a difference experiencing this on an iPad as an app Anthony Fantana Bjork crystalline forever 
dFa1CV4IzhM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review this request has been hanging over my head a little bit and still manages to get a ton of comments tweets Facebook messages death threats so I I figured I should do it because believe it or not I do read the comments plus maybe if you don't know this New York duo you'll you'll like them this LP comes on the heels of a little 7 inch EP that came out in 2010 some tracks off of that got passed around the blogosphere a lot very popular I even mentioned it on my favorite EPS of 2010 lists so now I've got 11 tracks in 33 minutes from these guys and I could be wrong but I think outside of the genre of children's music this is probably the sunniest album of 2011 there are a lot of things that I could talk about with this LP in terms of its style like how it tries to go for an old-school pop sound with that wall of sound technique and that high gloss finish and lots of cute and sentimental songs about friends enemies and lovers there are a lot of very very influenced melodies and chord progressions all over this thing tons of reverb pretty solid guitar tone a little piano here and there maybe some organ and this thing this plinky plinky thing which is either a little baby metal xylophone or a fisher-price piano which is just mimicking whatever the vocal melody is and hanging underneath it chirping along for what I think is every song and there are some modern beats on here like on oh my god which sounds like it could have been behind a hip hop song and there are some tried-and-true ones on here - like Most Wanted which I could see backing up a 60s girl group and there's some standout songwriting moments on the thing to like go outside and oh my god where the songs feel fleshed out they just don't fade out after a verse and a chorus and the melody feels pretty original it's memorable and it's catchy and not because it's rehashed outside of those tracks I don't really think this band's songwriting sets them apart from other groups I mean for the most part it all just feels so familiar to me its cults very bright attitude that I mentioned earlier just that sunny sunny wave of feelings that come at me when I put this album on that sets them apart from other groups the savage track on this LP might be the song you know what I mean and even on that track I just hear nothing but but blue skies and flower fields I know I've enjoyed sugary albums before this year but with cults my teeth are just falling out and it's not really just the mood of this album it's one thing piled on top of another thing piled on top of another thing for me the really cutesy instrumentation adds to how fast this LP wears thin for me and also Madeline fallens vocals which are very light and fine to begin with but how her voice is mixed and produced on some of these tracks it's like they're made to be light and fine to the max it's like they're made to be so loud and thin and echoey that when I hear her sing on some of these tracks it's like shoving a hot branding iron in my ear canal I'm really having a hard time enjoying how light young these vocals feel how cute everything is how summery the album is how happy the mood is how simple simple simple the instrumentation is and how it just kind of goes back and minds from the past in a kind of kitschy way I feel like a terrible person when I do a review like this if I'm going to hell it'll be reviews like this that send me there but a lot of songs on this LP just remind me of like what would happen if kids bop decided to do an album of Phil Spector covers young young young I keep saying that word but that's what this album feels like to me it feels so young and it doesn't feel like a teenage album like like this May it feels like this album is is yet to break into the double digits and maybe that's what well why do you guys like about it but it's it's what's keeping me away from it maybe if the songs felt a little more original maybe if the instruments were a little more interesting to me maybe if I didn't find the vocals so harsh at some points on this LP I could be swayed I could be swayed but at this point this is just not for me I'm feeling like a strong three to a light four on this thing but what do you guys think of this new cults LP are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana cults cults forever you 
6p3xVcQZuCY,hi my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's double music nerd and it's time for an album review the new subtract LP self-titled this guy is an anonymous london-based music producer whose material I could say is electronic soul all the sounds and the atmosphere surrounding this album are so clean so sanitized there's not a speck of dirt on this LP and normally that would bug me you guys know how much I like listening to something grimy every once in a while but the spotless electronic sounds on this LP are levelled out with Sam fuzz voice it's not the most powerful vocal on the planet but it is a very emotive one and that's what I like about it so much though it may be kind of corny to sing about for example on one track somebody not calling you back somebody you're into I still kind of get wrapped up in the drama I kinda feel for the guy it just goes to show that delivery is everything and I kind of dig his range too he's got a nice warm voice and he hits some highs too and when he does I can't tell if he's like straining his voice a little bit or if he's about to break out crying so while Santa's voice is kind of overheating with emotion on a lot of these tracks the electronics behind him sometimes wrapping around him like a straightjacket are very calm cool and collected sometimes the beats here are very simple and light and lean like on the track right thing to do but then again on the opposite side of the spectrum we have songs that are very lush very thick very layered and what I like is no matter what side of the spectrum these tracks are on they always work toward empowering the emotion that subtractors trying to convey in a song like on hold on where the bleak and very sparse music plays into the loneliness and the lyrics and never never where the confusing pain of like losing everything is projected on to me while I'm listening to it with how much this song builds how it escalates how it just throws so many different sounds and ideas at me at once there are several female features he brings on to the album and my favorite of them is actually you key me from a little dragon she's on the song wildfire and her vocals just have so much personality she was a great addition for this album and I love what subtract does with her voice on this song he throws all sorts of effects on her voice and progressively changes them as the song moves along and they're never too overbearing or distracting I'm always listening to her singing the other two vocal features Jessie we're on right thing to do and roses Gabor on on Pharos I'm pretty on the fence with them their voices just don't feel all that distinct or we're interesting to me they just kind of get the job done I kind of feel like I could have heard these vocal takes like like anywhere but the thing is the beats underneath their voices are so good I don't really mind it the song isn't completely ruined for me the intro and outro tracks are are all right they're not highlights for me but they're good and pretty much everything outside of those moments is is stellar for me now I've held off on saying this until now but I guess you could you could say this is a a dubstep album I know that's a kind of a dirty word for some people that either hate dubstep or hey seing things labeled as dubstep to me this album actually sounds like a dream collaboration between James Blake and Flying Lotus some of the sounds some of the really cacophonous layers on this LP remind me of tracks from flying lotuses latest EP except that had a very clean James Blake production style to them plus Sam FFA's voice kind of sounds like James Blake's maybe he's a little less depressing but he's still kind of a dead ringer having said that I love this album it's nice to hear a debut this solid I'm happy to hear another electronic album I love at the halfway point of the year I know I haven't been going crazy over a lot of electronic LPS this year I've been listening I've been looking but I haven't been binding but I'm happy that now I have found I'm feeling like a light too decent eight on this thing it's good I really enjoyed it links below this video and on the needle drop comm where you can hear some of it hmm but what do you think of this do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana subtract forever 
wgqY757V0-Y,I say new Brigade oh hi everybody Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd I'm filming this review late it's 4 a.m. it's for 12 a.m. in the morning and let me tell you this is exactly what I needed to listen to it for 12 in the morning these guys are a Denmark band their name is ice age this is their debut full-length new Brigade it just got released on a u.s. record label what we've got here is a 24 minute post-punk record that sounds more English than it does Danish these guys are noisy and abrasive like the Jesus and Mary Chain not in a not in a shoegaze kind of way but you know what I'm saying and also there's this cocky swagger to them that reminds me of Gang of Four or wire but those aren't the best possible comparisons you could make if you want to get more accurate stylistically these guys are much more of a annoys rock band maybe even a no wave band because I definitely pick up sounds that I would like into groups like DNA there are a lot of influences crashing into each other at high velocity creating this mangled orgy of metal and shattered glass hmm but still new Brigade comes together with a really cohesive sound surprisingly this thing could have jumped all over the place and it does a little bit but for the most part these guys have a style and they stick to it and they manipulate it in a bunch of different ways throughout this LP the sound is what really say is the most consistent the vocals are loud they're apathetic they feel kind of slurred but they're also kind of wild too and they have this echo um that just makes them bounce all over the mix and the bass is very warm very fuzzy and on the opposite side of the spectrum you've got the guitar which is so trebled it's so brittle every pick stroke sounds like metal rubbing against metal and the trums come in loud and clear - everything is just mixed so evenly I like that it's so loud and noisy and harsh and flailing in every direction possible but I can make out what I'm hearing loud and clear now the harshness that I mentioned about this album what I like about it is that it doesn't come from a lot a lot of effects and stuff like that mostly it's kind of coming from how these guys play they play so so raw but there is some sweetness there to kind of mat match up with the sour the songs for the most part are very catchy very rhythmic very angular very memorable in a way it actually reminds me of that women album that I loved last year there's a lot of weirdness to it it's very kind of an alienating album it's not a very accessible album but yet there's something almost unexplainable about it that is so attractive as far as bright spots go the hook on remember is almost uplifting to me feels almost positive and same goes for a broken bone maybe even the last track on this LP - but for the most part this record is is dark it is a dark album it's like a really really really cloudy day after two or three straight months of nothing but cloudy days it just kind of you know begins to itch at your sanity a little bit some tracks here just feel so tense and and feel so Jerry the track white rune just has such ugly guitars these pounding just migraine inducing drums also the title track the band is just like bursting at the scene total dredge just speeds up in spins and spins it's kind of like what falling down a spiral staircase must be like and the song never returned finds this really weird groove with these rolling and these guitars that sound like Picasso painted them and one of my favorites on here and it's actually one of the shortest count me in is kind of like this this weird combination of thrash punk and shoegaze it's executed amazingly this album for me is something that I just wanna I want to put on I want to turn it up as loud as possible and just sit back and watch something burn and not like a campfire or anything like that more like a building or a forest and I know that sounds terrible but this is a terrible album it's the feel terrible hit of the summer hmm I'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this album for me it was really thrilling invigorating noisy overwhelming and something I will be returning to Anthony Fantana ice age new Brigade forever [Music] you 
iUWICCcz9L8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing a question of the week video I haven't done one in a while I know I usually do these at the weekend but something was bothering me I had to talk about it I was sitting here and listening to the new yacht LP and wishing I liked it more it's not terrible I just wish I liked it more and I was thinking about a lot of the comments that I read today on my boney vert review and whether they were positive or negative I thank you for saying something you guys leave comments that feel really passionate to me like you care about music like I care about music we all care about music we all think music is so awesome it's the greatest thing to ever happen music right best thing ever and it just makes me want to ask do you support music monetarily of course because I know a lot of people out there are just downloading and that's it and there are people who ask me if I buy the music that I review I've downloaded albums I get a lot of promos too but here's the thing I review an album and no matter what the outcome of that review is if I find myself in my personal time wanting to revisit that LP I want to listen to this LP on my own it is it is totally unrelated to the needle drop I feel kind of guilty you know I want to support the person who made the album the label who put it out and all that jazz I'll buy a record from the label I'll go down to a local record store I'll buy from a record store online on Amazon or something I will buy digital from some place because maybe I don't want to shell out a lot of money for the album or I didn't think it was that amazing but I wanted to have a few tracks from it maybe if the band is touring through my town I'll go see a show supporting the music you love financially is important it's simple economics when you buy an album or you buy a piece of music it's kind of like it's like voting okay when I bought that album I voted and said yeah hell yeah Black Lips our pool I like their stuff keep putting out Black Lips albums when I bought this havoc CD I said hey you know what that's a good CD keep putting out more of those same thing with this Keller talk CD that I bought recently also I picked up the Fleet Foxes vinyl whoo I also have the new Beastie Boys LP coming in the mail also the battles album battles and you know I'm all for using the Internet is like a listening booth that's fine listen to something no matter how you do it and find out if you like it find out if you love it find out if it's a product that you think it's worth revisiting do you support music and if you do how and if you don't why what's your reasoning for not supporting music would you rather spend money on weed or maybe you believe the whole record label system bubble blah blah blah is you know shot to hell and it's not a good system mmm doesn't work but the thing is when you buy an album from a record label you're giving them money to invest in other artists that you may also like and the artists that they just put out the album from that you just bought are we moving into an age where all music is going to be free paying for music was dumb nobody should ever pay for music again it's pointless owning physical music is stupid just all music free forever who cares what's up with supporting music do you do it I know I do it is it a good thing to do is it a bad thing to do is there really a point let me know Anthony Fantana supporting music forever [Music] you you 
j_LB2pqybaM,Bon Iver hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Bone Iver or Justin Vernon is a Wisconsin singer-songwriter who after many collaborations in ep some feature spots and side projects has just dropped his highly anticipated sophomore LP and whether you like the guy or not the amount of musical connections he's made the amount of attention he's received is extremely surprising considering how little music he's actually released because the only other full-length we really have to refer back to his bony bear's debut for Emma Forever Ago an LP you could label as a singer-songwriter album an indie folk album or something like that but the level of desolation and pain on this LP is unmatched by most guys who try to pick up an acoustic guitar and sing a sad song but anyway the vocals and a lot of the emotions that made for Emma such a powerful release remain intact on this new LP but the most noticeable shift between the first LP and this one even blood-bank in this one is that there is a lot more instrumentation to account for on this which is something that Bon Iver might not have been able to pull off if a sophomore album came just a year after for Emma French horn trumpet different saxophones clarinet flute string arrangements piano synthesizers drums various effects - it's definitely a step up from the sparse percussion and the guitar and vocal layering that was happening on the first LP but the thing is for me these new sounds these new instruments these new textures are executed throughout this album with just kind of mixed results take two of my feet tracks on here Holocene and towers to guitar-driven tracks and not just strong and very memorable songs very emotive songs but the arrangements on these tracks surround them in a way where it complements the song it empowers the song you don't lose sight of the direction of the song because that is top priority on Holocene a shaker and some handclaps just push the song along as these tones just swell underneath the song and later these marching snares and and horns just start boiling underneath the track and get louder and louder and by the end of it it is this it is this emotional unstoppable powerhouse that to me is what Bon Iver is all about the picture has just gotten bigger because of these extra instruments and I think the instrumentation arranged around the track wash Washington is done really well to the piano the very somber piano on that one sounds like an old stone house meanwhile the strings and the vocals just kind of wrapping around our like decades or maybe even centuries of ivy growing on it just sounds so pretty it's like a place I want to live if every song here was is focused or is well arranged as those three tracks I would be in heaven but for me that's not really the case there are a lot of tracks here that feel like they've been produced or arranged messily songs where it just kind of feels like instruments come in and start making noise just to to make noise or even spots where I question whether or not the guitar the percussion or even the vocals have been eq'd like the second track Minnesota Wisconsin I love the first half of that song such warm voices such a such a beautiful and memorable melody but as soon as the falsetto vocals and the banjo finger-picking come in the instrumentation kind of loses track of itself the finger picking just continues on as the music changes these muddy drums just start pounding there are these distorted bass farts it's like three things that have nothing do with each other Misha Kant is a track where I enjoyed the song I enjoy the vocals the horns were a nice touch but I wonder if a single percussive sound on that whole track was eacute or even mixed in um Texas is another weird track for me it doesn't really feel like a song it just kind of feels like a spot of filler that exists merely to prove that there are sounds on this album that were not on the last album I've already reviewed the song Calgary in a previous video and I don't really feel any different on that song now than I did then and I don't really have any burning desire to return to it even after we're visiting it here I'm still left wondering why do the manipulated guitars squawking over this track feel so aimless like they're just there to be there why does the explosion toward the end of the track feel so flattened one-dimensional the last section of this LP has led to a bit of controversy mostly because of the instruments inside of it there's a pedal steel two different kinds of synthesizers I think some saxophone Dueling auto-tune vocals some Casio drum hits it's basically kind of like a corny instrument parade and I'm not going to get down on this album for trying to evoke a different musical time period if I came in here and said ooh this sounds a tease why I mean I would be a complete hypocrite because I did love that destroy your album earlier this year it's cool that Justin Vernon can just go BAM and do something that people don't expect of him but my issue with that track is that it feels just as claustrophobic as a lot of the other songs here to try to pour a lot of instrumentation into the mix not only that but the guitars and saxophones just kind of pop into the song whenever they feel like they're not getting enough attention when it comes to bringing a broad spectrum of instruments into a loaf i recording style which I think has been done here I've heard things that come off more creative to me over this I would rather listen to any number of Mount Erie or microphones albums I'm not saying you have to like one or the but here the sounds are so tinny they're so muddy the instruments a lot of the time distract from the song more than they add to the song or sometimes there's just not a song at all the track kind of exists to just show off the new digs so yeah I was kind of underwhelmed by this record admittedly I'm feeling a light too decent six on this shocker but what do you think of this album are you loving it are you hating it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana Bon Iver Bon Iver bunny bear [Music]

6RCLxGb4BPE,hello there I'm bad I am evil nice to meet you hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's EP review time bad meets evil help the sequel bad meets evil is a rap duo featuring Eminem and Royce to 5/9 and yeah I know Eminem mainstream why are you reviewing this but to be completely honest even though I'm not a big fan of him now Eminem was one of those artists for me who helped cultivate a love for hip-hop music in here along with some others but I mean come on it's not like I was the only kid in middle school who thought my name is was one of the coolest songs ever but I haven't really enjoyed anything Eminem has done since the Marshall Mathers LP and there are some songs on those older albums that even today when I returned to them I cringe a little bit inside but it depends on the track because a lot of Eminem songs for me have not lost their luster over the years which brings me to the 19th song off the Slim Shady LP bad meets evil featuring Royce to 5/9 both of these guys are Detroit emcees their history goes way back but for some reason their power is a duo sort of fizzled out because of a falling out so now it's years later after em and Royce guested on one another's albums and we have something very sizable from bad meets evil a 9 track EP and the result is em and Royce bringing the best out of one another on most of these tracks there's a huge sense of competition on here they really keep each other focused on these songs I'm just putting together hard fast and dizzying verses on some of these tracks the flows get faster and more intense as em and Royce or trading verses over the beat and not only is there like kind of a competent going on to see who can put together the better verse or just be a better rapper but there's also kind of a competition here this is bad meets evil to see who is more bad who is more evil who is more reckless with rhymes about smacking cops and crushing pills and crashing cars but there are a few songs here where the competition thing kind of dies down and Emin Royce concentrate more on being a tag-team and putting a story together like on the reunion where they kind of create these two personalities that are complete jerks complete misogynists and they end up meeting at the end and being one another's evil twin and the thing I like about that track is that it's not supposed to be serious it's supposed to be funny but I actually find it funny having Royce to 5/9 around keeps mm from getting so goofy that I can't handle it or I don't want to deal with it he keeps him from getting too overly emotional - and too bogged down in his own personal BS because of that it feels kind of in the moment it feels fast it feels quick it feels rushed and even though that gives this album a kind of freshness to it just a live feeling other elements of this EP suffer because of that - I think a good chunk of the beats and hooks here or either pretty bad or just really generic like I'm one of the singles to drop from the CP Fastlane that hook on that song could have been in like a hundred different hip hop songs probably has been in a hundred different hip hop songs and likening life to a fast car ride it doesn't really add to the unique dynamic that these guys have and it gets worse on a track like above the law where the chorus is singing about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer I mean it has nothing to do with what em and Royce are saying but the biggest pothole for me here is his lighters with Bruno Mars on the hook doing his Bruno Mars thing with sentimental pianos and Emin Royce rapping about their kind of love-hate relationship with Fame and I'm like you just spin and the entire EP convincing me that you guys are the biggest jerks on the face of the planet that you're bad and that you're evil and now you want me to - like sympathize with you and it's kind of the same thing with the track take from you which tries to evoke similar feelings out of me but with a slightly less corny be with acoustic guitar and piano but at least the album closes out with a great track a posse track featuring slaughterhouse which is a Detroit rap outfit that Royce to 5/9 is a part of some of these tracks are a real explosion a real chemical reaction and others are like clouds of smoke just I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this if you've been an Eminem fan I think you'll be very happy to hear him returning to something much faster much more aggressive on this EP but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana bad meets evil hell the sequel [Music] you 
WIX13DiXBe8,30k yes 30k dance 30k dance 30k dance 30k dance take it to cow 30k dance 30k dance 30k dance 30k dance which is I my because I'm so 30 K yo basedgod what should we do you should add a few or something hey review something I like it I like it blood ceremony is a Canadian rock band and this is their latest LP living with the ancients their sophomore album in fact and this brings me back to earlier this year when I was loving the album opus eponymous by the band ghosts Swedish metal band and though they don't play the same style of metal that blood ceremony does both of them do bring a very occult vibe into their metal and blood ceremony brings that vibe in a way that embraces the old-school sounds of doom metal not the sleep electric wizard I'm gonna hit the bong kind of doom metal the Black Sabbath style of doom metal just these heavy dark guitar riffs that that scream Tony Iommi very brooding and very bluesy too I will say some of the guitar riffs here do feel a little familiar I guess like they could have been on a lot of different records from way back when I'm not saying these guys are forging a new sound but this LP is not just some kind of Sabbath revival it's not as simple as that the band's lead singer Ellie O'Brien plays both organ and flute and believe me when I say she does not hesitate to break the flute out for a good chunk of these tracks I'm talking some serious flute rock here and when you're talking flute rock you got a talked all jethro tull who tony iommi actually played with for a little bit but he didn't stay with them he was still in earth who would eventually become Black Sabbath so because of that living with the ancients is kind of like this fantasy rock collaboration that never actually happened I could really tell from the way she's playing the flute on these tracks that she's listened to Ian Anderson she listens to Tull and oh she's so fiery when she plays on some of these tracks I especially loved her playing on the last track daughter of the Sun where the band brings the music to justice this perfect an overwhelming climax close out the album they just go so hard sinister melodies everywhere organ and guitar mmm I mean the track literally sounds like Pandora's Box has opened and demons and ghosts are flying out in every direction and who you gonna call nobody cuz Ghostbusters wasn't real it was a movie Bill Murray can't save you now but there are some moments here where the flute oriented tracks take it down a notch and don't Rock so much as play something that is a little bit more fit for the Renaissance Fair I know that sounds dorky but I like it tracks like the Hermit or the witches dance they totally have a folky medieval vibe to them the only other things I can really speak positively on with this album are the interplay between these guys and the songwriting I mean when this band rocks they rock some of the instrumental moments here where they're playing off of each other are just so energizing to me and the solos the improvising that I sense is going on in this album I like that these guys are playing you know an older style of metal music an older style of rock but they've also brought back that strong strong playing and musicianship that usually comes hand-in-hand with this kind of stuff the only issue I have with this LP and it's one that I can't completely ignore it's with the vocals the lead vocals I like the idea of having a female singing for this band I wouldn't like a male it's perfect with a female all these lyrics about witches and the occult it's better with a female and there are moments on night of Audrey where they've multi-tracked O'Brien's voice and just these vocals together layered on top of each other just reaching for as high as they can go and I'm just seduced I'm sold I'm into it I'm bowing down I'm joining the cult but on other moments like the Great God pan or Coventry I don't know about you but to me she's kind of like dragging her notes out a little bit longer than she she's audibly kind of strained for me and she's just forcing herself to put on this vibrato that takes away more than it adds is the vibrato there to sound dark is it there to sound dramatic I don't know it just kind of sounds like the way a lady who fronts some kind of local bar band would sing that did lets Appling covers every weekend but the thing is I love so many things about this album the recording the songwriting the musicianship the instrumentation that for the most part I can just sit there and take it and enjoy everything else that blood ceremony has to offer and it's funny because a vocal I don't like would usually ruin an album for me completely but I think this is a very solid LP I enjoyed it cohesive sound a nice bit of revivalism that sounds like a bunch of things but not one single thing kind of like the record that should have been so I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one links below on youtube and also on the needle drop comm where you can hear a little bit of this album definitely recommend that you listen to this if you're into metal old-school metal the dark stuff or if you were into that ghost album I loved what do you think of this love it hate it why and what should I review next 30k forever 
kR3sN2WTOh8,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I'm sorry I'm uploading this video late very late today because last night I was out late seeing earth play live in front of me they played new stuff they played even newer stuff and they played extremely old stuff but reworked it so that it sounds like the new stuff it was pretty good but we're gonna do an album review here of the new wooh life album go tell fire to the mountain woo life stands for world unite Lucifer Youth Foundation and they're our new band from the UK who I don't think I can review this album with at least going into their background a little bit and commenting on it since it seems to be what everybody else is commenting on and focusing on the band's early recordings and demos caught a lot of ears on the blogosphere with tracks like scissors for your hair and diamond voices and that pretty much got the ball rolling but now the band's buzz has kind of hit this straight away that many bands have before where their popularity seems to be fueled by how little we know about them they're turning down interviews they're turning down live performances they've rejected labels support for this album and they've had several music videos go viral building up to this release it kind of makes me think of the I am am I Who am I video series when that was sort of it at its peak of popularity so with this groups ominous logo the very semi anonymity the revolutionary imagery - I'm just worried that the the presentation is like here and the music is down here the thing is this band knows full well that the less you know about them the more popular they're going to get and as far as the whole denying a label thing goes you know what any band for a small sum of money and record and independently release a record a group that I like right now a lot name civil civic is raising cash to release their next LP currently and they're pretty much there I mean since bands can do this so easily the real power that labels have these days is in promotions and since life is already popular thanks to the blogosphere thanks to these music videos thanks to this buzz surrounding the mystery why would they sign with a label why put a middleman in between you and the crowd of fans that you already have that would not be a good business decision in the internet age so with the marketing strategy out of the way what does the music on here sound like well I'm I will admit that I'm not exactly gaga over it on here we've got bass drums guitar vocals and organ and from what I've read about this LP it was recorded in a church so it has this really prominent high ceiling kind of reverb just surrounding the music and it only plays into the idea that we life likes to veil themselves because to me the reverb here doesn't add to the music as much as it does obscure it sometimes this echo whether it be completely the church that they're in or maybe some added post-production it makes this album a little difficult to decipher at some points the instruments just bounce around wildly into each other and on top of each other kind of like a 30 car pileup to me it's not like whoo life uses reverb to create a unique or interesting sound they just use it to kind of make the band sound bigger and more epic and more triumphant than they actually are go tell fire definitely tries to convey those emotions throughout every moment of this LP there is not a moment here that doesn't try to be just overly dramatic and overly emotional especially with the lead singer's vocals here which are iced really thickly on top of this album and he screams he screams and he yelps like it is the end of the world but I can't help but feel like these emotions are being kind of forced upon me a part of my aggravation with this record is that the see sounds make this kind of like a puzzle but I don't quite see the point in putting the pieces together because I feel like I've seen the picture it makes before I mean it's not like wow life style and songwriting goes above and beyond anything I've heard in recent memory I mean they pull from a lot of the same African and Caribbean sounds that surfer blood or even Vampire Weekend like to flash around in their music the atmosphere here is comparable almost to a Walkman record and there's nothing here really for me that is done with as much power or emotion as as any track on suckers first EP specifically the track it gets your body moving almost every song on here reminds me of that sucker song some of the songs here are pretty decent I got to give it to these guys on concrete gold or maybe even spinning blood but what bugs me is that most of the time these dudes drown out their songs drown out their melodies with their aesthetic just turn up the obscurity turn up the reverb turn up the dramatic vocals but it's not an aesthetic I'm really into I love the fact that they try to pack such an emotional punch into their songs but it's not exactly resonating with me maybe it is with you and if it is let me know what do you think about this LP do you love it do you hate it why do you feel that the whole marketing strategy is out weighing the music on this album or do you feel the album has measured up to the hype I guess I'm kind of feeling a strong 5 or a light 6 on this it's not terrible these guys are trying to go for something unique and this album definitely does have a uniform sound to it I'm just not into the sound Anthony Fantana life go tell fire to the mountain 
1J2Fi3fiN7s,poor poor Lily hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review in yesterday's video you may have noticed I swapped a few album covers around I'll try not to make such mistakes in the future but what you may have also noticed is that yesterday I reviewed a punk album that I didn't really care for all too much but today I would love to introduce you to a punk album that I care for quite a bit poor Lilly's self-titled LP poor lily is a punk trio from the Bronx these three guys have varying levels of experience with punk music the guy with the longest rap sheet in the group is Max Capshaw who has drummed in such bands as Murphy's Law h2o sick of it all a lot of New York punk and hardcore groups but despite his experience as a drummer he for the most part plays guitar in this band the band's drummer actually has some roots in the New York hardcore scene as well and the youngest member of the group is the singer basis the youngest at 26 years old so even though two-thirds of this band of held down regular jobs and raised families they still musically sound like 19 year olds who like screaming moshing shoplifting and going to the record store every Saturday so the energy here is just very very young but the style of music of course is is not these guys cherry pick in my opinion from a lot of my favorite punk and post-punk groups throughout the 70s and 80s their spots where just New York punk and thrash crossover stuff bleed into the guitars a little bit there's some very minor threat esque narrations on the track in gravitas very tough and so time's the satire laced into this music can be as strong as the dead milkmen or even the dead kennedys the opening track just reminds me of mission of burma a lot sometimes these vocals just hit a very Roger Miller esque cord and I think minutemen fans will love just how eccentric jagged and angular this music is to it just jerks around in a really awkward and weird way there are 13 tracks here it's kept down to a very lean 23 minutes it's downloadable for free on the band's website and i got to say my favorite thing about this LP is the is the personality it's not the weirdest thing on the block but it flies a really honest freak flag like the song decide to sleep which is literally about becoming a maniac over a lack of sleep which I can relate to but my favorite is easily regular guy which is a series of mad internal ravings from someone who might just be your next-door neighbor like I hate doctors and I don't vote and I performed my own surgery with other lyrics about needles and sex and machine guns and people who kind of make you think what a shithead there there is not a dull moment on this album vocally or lyrically another thing on this album that is completely free of dull moments for me it's just how these guys put their songs together some tracks here don't even repeat themselves have like an a B C structure and then ends and even the longer tracks here where there are verses and choruses going back and forth like 800 jerks or in gravitas veritas there's a huge angry aggressive build up at the end of the track maybe a gang vocal or two or something it's like this punk as hell volcanoes just erupting and and burning down the town that live near the volcano if there's kind of a weak link in the chain of this LP though it's definitely the recording and not that it's terrible not that that's loaf I or anything like that it just doesn't really bring as much personality to the table as everything else about this album does it just kind of is some of the vocals feel muddy because of the recording are the mix here and there but luckily the band's musicianship their riffs there lyrics their hooks are just so fierce and and fun that they step past any limitations that the recording has for me it's a short solid punk album that looks backwards but doesn't feel dated has a lot of charisma a lot of things to say and I'm loving it I've had I've had a great time listening to this again and again and again feeling a light eight on this album but linked below this video on youtube and also search poor lily on the needle drop com find a link where you can download this album for yourself here the whole thing front to back and let me know what you think love it hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana poor Lily poor Lily forever but 
K-J6VwasuOg,[Music] fucked up game it comes alive hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review fucked up David comes to life fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucked up is a Canadian hardcore punk band whose latest LP is warranting a lot of comments like oh my god they've changed so much this is the biggest thing they've ever done and I'll agree there has been a change I mean just listen to their police ep they put out in 2003 just hard lean short blasts of punk music and then follow that up with the full length they put out in 2006 with these 5 to 9 minutes and I will add this LP is only a little bit shorter than this new 78 minute monster but musically fucked up has made some shifts between their first LP in this LP there's more melody there's more harmony there are more female vocals popping in and out of each track but what makes this album different than any other release fucked up has ever done before is more related to concept than anything and the concept behind the story is a long odds at a light bulb factory falls in love loses the person he loves hates life gets in a fight with the narrator it's pretty complicated it's this weird complication and this albums very poetic storyline that makes this a rock opera it's not a term I like to use but if this is in fact a rock opera then it is unlike any rock opera you will ever hear in your life I do admire that fucked up is ambitious with every album they put out and I like that on this album they're at least trying something that most bands never will but I don't like this LP sadly and to me it just kind of suffers from the same problems that I have with Green Day's 21st breakdown or even titus andronicus is the monitor the thing is this album takes advantage of a lot of things I love about punk music really aggressive vocals hard hard drumming distorted pulsating just energetic guitars but it ignores another thing that makes the genre so great its brevity its simplicity because David comes to life loses momentum for me really fast and musically I kind of feel like this album suffers at the hand of the really long-winded story that fucked up is trying to jam into the music on this album and that's something that actually makes me prefer their last LP more than this one there are just so many builds and so many riffs here that don't have time to breathe or don't have time to make sense because pink eyes is on top of them with his vocals like a Hungry Bear just devouring them so my favorites office end up being the tracks with leaner lyrics that are more straighten to the point and on some of these songs pink eyes flow is delivery barely fits into the groove of the music because the language is so flowery and he's trying to say so much against this very visceral music and I actually do like the lyrics on this LP reading along with them as the album flows I just see a lot of vivid imagery of explosions and factories and depressed workers and nails being driven into skin but the thing is I don't really get anything out of the lyrics of the story unless I'm reading along with them on David comes to life calm or the band has basically put up all of the lyrics to the album but the thing is the music is so hard and fast and aggressive and in my face and energetic that while I'm listening to it I don't want to read I just it puts me in a really aggravating place I would just sit back and relax and just listen to the music but I'm not huge on the music most of the time I mean I don't think it's out of line to say that some of these tracks if you weren't paying attention to the story would feel a little drawn out and another pet peeve of mine that really bugs me about this LP is that clearly and you don't have to take this seriously if it doesn't bug you but clearly pink eyes vocal takes are not done in full takes because there's so many moments here where he's trying to say so many things they're cutting his lines apart and editing them so that they're overlapping on top of each other so that when he's screaming at the end of one line you can hear the next one starting and it's kind of like hearing two clones of pink guys taking turns screaming each lyric of the song but man I just like that there's I'm so torn I admire how ambitious and how grandiose this album is or tries to be and there are a lot of intros on this that I love the song remember my name comes to mind where I just think of like riding a motorcycle down route 66 with nothing around me during the summer it's just got so much push to it and so much drive to it it's just so energetic and convincing and I'm thinking yes this is gonna be it this is gonna be the time when I listen to a song on here or I've just the album clicks for me this is gonna be I'm gonna love it but then the verse comes in the vocals layer on top of that the story starts playing itself through again and the guitars start trying to jump on top of that by throwing some kind of harmony in and it just loses me for me the one thing that has not changed significantly about fucked up are the vocals and it baffles me because so many things about this band have been altered in order to do this LP when the music builds Falls gets quieter louder no matter where the music is pink eyes is still screaming screaming his brains out with this growl that is very distinctive I could pick the guy out of a lineup but it's the only gear he drives and it's like he can't shift out of it I mean even Ian MacKaye knew if you really wanted people to listen there should be a spot in the song where you quiet down a little bit and there was a spot at the end of this album where I guess that semi happens wear pink guys is like growl scream narrating it's kind of weird and just know I understand that there are spots here where pink guy's vocals are not present intros outros interludes but hearing the entire story scream and to me is just not doing much for me I mean it's imagine having a book on tape where the entire story is yelled to you when you scream everything you might as well say nothing it's just like typing in caps it kills the dynamics of your message and yeah there are other bands that make use of extreme vocals some of them much more extreme than fucked up but fucked up tries to say so much on this album it's not like a brochure it's not a pamphlet it's like for encyclopedia entries there are some songs on here I enjoy a lot I did a really positive review of Queen of Hearts over at the needle drop com in an audio review I like the song running on nothing I like the song ship of fools but my issues with this LP go far beyond oh I like this song I don't like that song oh I like this song a lot I feel like I should be getting energized by this album really pumped by it but it just feels so overbearing to me and so taxing so I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing but what do you think I mean this is definitely wordy this is definitely concept heavy but to you does it have any appeal outside of that you can call me a punk purist I mean yeah I love this Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so do you love this album do you hate it and why and what should I review next anthony Fantana fucked up David comes to life forever [Music]

zWDo8gGwRfk,gradual cross-draw Oh if it's humid and you know it kill yourself if it's humid and you know would kill yourself if it's humid and you know it and you really want to show it if it's humid and you know it kill yourself hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review battles is a New York quartet recently turned trio and this is their sophomore LP gloss drop and the loss of tie and a Braxton as a frontman a multi-instrumentalist in this group bred a lot of rumors about this album what is it going to sound like why our battles continuing to call themselves battles after losing such a pivotal member and of course the first single to come off of this LP ice cream featuring Matias Aguayo on vocals featured on that track only fueled flames only fueled rumors and guessing games considering a lineup change a series of guest vocalists on this album and the fact that this is a sophomore LP coming on the coattails of a very beloved first album the cards were kind of stacked against this LP battles was challenged on this record and I'm happy to say in my opinion they met that challenge for me battles have maintained those intricate and complex and experimental elements that made their first LP so appealing but they've also taken gloss drop and used it as an opportunity to almost put a friendlier and more accessible face on their music but in doing that they haven't dumbed it down this thing is a really hyper very active album it is a high-octane non stopped experimental dance rock party that just makes me want to move move move move move move move move move move move move I just want to jump around and eat candy to this album I want to try eating the pink stuff that's on the cover I want to jump around in a clown shape bouncy castle that's as big as a house it's weird to be in my mid-20s and feel that way but this album put me there and I'm thankful for that it's just got this rebellious ly youthful feel to it and yet it's so seasoned and experienced and complex there are certain subjects I like to harp on in my reviews a lot like interplay and a live feel to a band to me that kind of stuff makes a record exciting and this album has so much of that hearing these guys bounce off of each other on these tracks is a serious tree for me because they really know how to work a rhythm each track on here moves differently in the guitars the synthesizers of the drums are always figuring out different ways to dance around the tempo and interact with one another I mean John stanner puts so much heart into the way he plays drums on this LP and just in general as good as the guitars and the synthesizers are on this album the drums are really the driving force for me I love this guy's fills how subtly he builds up to certain parts in the songs and his improvisations too but the thing is everybody is improvising on this album there's so many tracks here that don't really feel like they've been written out or realized beforehand like the band is making them up as they go along Futura inchworm wall street these songs have a certain climax or a post that the band is eventually going to hit usually like a keyboard melody kind of flies in there's a breakdown and a thematic melody plays but when the band actually gets there doesn't really seem to be decided because these songs kind of progress forward as the band sees fit with every little added extra drum hit or book on the guitar or synthesizer note the song just moves an inch closer to its final destination but there are some tracks on here where battles are a little bit clearer and confined themselves to a structure maybe a pop structure or something like that an ice-cream is definitely one of those tracks which after hearing that song multiple multiple multiple times I'm pretty sure it's it's the most fun song of 2011 the the way it opens the ooh ah ish whoosh and the building circus organ synthesizers and in that bass guitar that drum beat and Matias Aguayo vocal on that one I love the effects they lay on his voice and it just kind of acts like one more polyrhythm on top of this groove in the song it is a great job here they need to work with this guy again in the future the other guest vocalists on here pretty good as well like Gary here in my car Newman he shows up on the song my machines and Gary does a great job the guy has not lost it I think my only complaint is that maybe his vocals are are pretty high in the mix if only he could have been sunken into the instrumentation a little bit more and maybe if he was given more to sing just lay more personality into the track or something like that and I kind of have a similar gripe with the next vocal feature on this with Kazuma Chino from Blonde Redhead she's got a great voice but I feel like a little bit her voice is battling with the chirping and growing keyboards that are just causing a ruckus underneath her voice I mean battles does invite these guests on here but I feel like in a way they don't really make a lot of room for some of them and Yaman taka I is on the final track of this LP and if you know that guy if you know who that guy is you can pretty much guess what he does on that track Wow but it actually fits in with what battles is doing really well on that track he's in the thick of it and making as much noises everybody else's but I do want to say even though not every vocal spot on this LP is fantastic I love that battles is doing this they need to continue doing this on future albums inviting different guests on the LP seeing what direction their personality and their voice brings the album in its very Gorillaz ish and i like it for that there are a few spots here where babbles throw some shorties on this album tracks that are like one or two minutes long and normally i would just be like the filler but i'm actually as impressed with those tracks as i am some of the other tracks on here dominican fate is so fun with all these handclaps and just that that giant bass drum and the song toddler even though that's the shortest it has the prettiest melody on here delivered by the shyest keyboards around and the song rolls bass is one of the biggest head bobbers on here the last thing i guess i can say about this LP is the recording the production way up way up just everything sounds so clear and so loud and so in my face I mean the drums are so crisp and loud on this thing it's like I'm standing in a giant room and listening to them seeing them being played right in front of me and the guitars are always in a nice spot even when they're being layered over each other whether it's with a loop pedal or multi-tracking I'm not sure but always audible and the keyboards they're just kind of sparkling shimmering bleeping and blooping over at all the album start strong finishes strong fantastic production fantastic grooves cohesive sound the volume of this album the instrumental make up for the most part of this album isn't going to be for everybody but still I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this album really good stuff really really good stuff man despite this lineup debacle battles have maintained much of the same energy that made me fall in love with the band in the first place but what do you think do you love this do you hate it why and what do you think I should be reviewing next just with my ears let me know Anthony Fantana battles Glaus drop forever [Music] [Music] 
9_qPevj08xM,snake-oil oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd it is really hot today it is really humid today but we still need to do it as we still need to do an album review and we're going to do one of the new snake oil LP snake oil and this is actually the first time I'm reviewing a band from my own backyard of Connecticut snake oil is a collective of ten musicians from what I've been told hailing from my state and New York and Massachusetts and even though there are a lot of cooks in on this broth the band still comes together with a pretty cohesive instrumental psych rock sound for the self-titled debut it's nine tracks 29 minutes but most of the songs here do last long enough to leave an impression on me who posted that picture of me with hair was it you are you sure well someone posted it it's just I used to have hair so what is now I just shaved my head well like I said between the nine tracks on this LP snake oil comes up with a direction it's not the most original direction in the world but still cohesive now for me easily the best thing this album has going for it the production guitar face organ drums various sound effects and studio tricks all of them come through clear as a bell and when all the sounds layer over each other on some of these tracks into this sweet sonic casserole of psychedelia I just want to shove it in my ears and try to find a way to eat it that way that guitar on the song I was a total pyro the opener to this LP listening to that for me is like wearing three sweaters in a sauna just start purse parading listening to it and that's some pretty nice groove to it too and that's the thing I like about this album a lot of great grooves the track no fear all animal is another great groove on the cell p I love the way that song moves and i love the oriental esque guitar melody bouncing over that track it's like dropping a bunch of ice cubes into an empty glass all at once there are a few quieter moments on here which go over all right like I'm song hungry Z which has a tempo maintained by a drum machine and while that sort of carries on and keeps the song constant keeps it moving the van just creates a soundscape of guitar feedback and cymbal crashes but I think my favorite softer moment here is siedel in the salt flats one of the tracks toward the end of this LP and that song to me as a sense of place more than any other track here listening to that is kind of like wandering through the desert into some kind of kaleidoscopic horizon with swirling clouds and multicolored buzzards and tumbleweeds I love the beat it starts off with and when that first guitar comes in its whoa but i'm not completely in love with this LP i do have my reservations about it there are a lot of points here where it doesn't rock and i don't mean like there are softer moments here i don't mean there are quieter tracks i mean the latter songs at some moments feel way too rigid in mechanical constrained take the track can of love and the captain for example the riff on that track that drops it around the two minute mark i kind of feel like at that point a bomb should be going off but at best it just kind of sounds like a firecracker it's just the band is latching on to this really constant tempo and they're not really moving together as a unit on some parts of this album just sometimes where the drums are going and where the rest of the instrumentation is going seems like a different place so some of the instrumentals here do come off sounding like sugar-coated psychedelics like they would soundtrack a scene where a character is doing drugs in an after-school special or like I can see them going over pretty well in an elevator like a trippy elevator there are a few spots here where snake oil feels like they're letting go getting a little noisier like on the last track or go center but it's just not enough for me I want to be overwhelmed damn you still the sound the recording a lot of the melodies the grooves are all pretty good on this album and for the most part the textures here really shoot for something similar to dumbo gets mad or even black moth super rainbow without all the fuzz and weird vocals it's not amazing me but it's a solid debut there are links below this video on YouTube and on the needle drop com or you can hear cuts of this record this thing is self released the band is selling the vinyl and the digital on their website let me know what you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I be reviewing next Anthony Fantana snake oil / you 
y39aOgNMgik,Arctic Monkeys suck it in see no no no no hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music do I have anything mighty music nerd it's time for an album review Arctic Monkeys suck it and see a lot can happen in five years and Arctic Monkeys are proof because just five years ago these guys burst onto the scene with this energetic and modern indie rock post-punk hybrid that just felt really fresh at the time and now it's 2011 we've got sucking in sea and Arctic Monkeys are playing a style of rock that sounds like every Arctic Monkeys released before this one never happened not only that but every Punk album to ever exist never happened either even on humbug there were a few moments that that that slightly acknowledged the influence of the fall slightly oh you got to say I was I was a little misled on this album because the Arctic Monkeys kind of pulled a single switcheroo which is when a band takes the most terrible and untolerable songs on their album and releases them as singles before the album is out because come on brick by brick and don't sit down because I've moved your chair brick by brick sounds like an over glorified and over constricted garage rock song the only thing slightly rebellious about it is that its volume kind of hangs in the yellow the groove and the guitar leads are pretty decent but I really do not like the deep-voiced backup vocals and the lyrics about wanting to rock and roll because honestly at this point Foo Fighters who basically double this band in terms of age know more about rocking and rolling than these guys do and don't sit down because I've moved your chair hi audience Ong when it came out over at the website and honestly the more I listened to that tune since I I reviewed it the more tired of it I become at first I was pretty impressed by the volume of the riffs and the song in general it does kind of sound like working with Josh ohm home haami on their last record did kind of have a lasting effect on the band all the words have just formed around these very terrible concepts dealing with taking a risk doing something dangerous like breaking a mirror or rolling the dice or writing a song titled don't sit down because I've moved your chair I mean lyrically some of these songs are too corny for their own good let's be honest here let's be honest with ourselves now outside of those songs my two least favorite on the album the rest of this LP kind of dabbles in embracing sunshine pop circa 1966 garage rock and very sober safe psychedelic rock with mixed results the track she's thunderstorm starts off the record pretty world I love the way the bass and the drums just build the song up into the first hook which sounds really good and it's just a nice way to get that retro rock sound from a popular British band without having to go listen to that BDI record their other sunny looks back to the past like Hellcat suck it and see reckless serenade all those songs have good hooks but the problem for me is that everything that leads up to the hooks everything that surrounds those hooks is just kind of and then actually a lot of tracks on this LP are like that like the song all my own stunts the hook on there is great memorable and the song kind of falls into it seamlessly but the verses are just all over the place just kind of disjointed and not a very interesting way there if you softer moments on here that go over really well the closer of this LP is good and I like the song Piledriver waltz the verse melody is a cut above the rest on here which is in that hard and I really like the picture Alex Turner paints in the lyrics on this thing with miserable waitress and terrible food and the Heartbreak Hotel it's one of the few semi safe havens on here for lyricism the thing about this album is that there's nothing whatsoever original about it nothing and Arctic Monkeys know that and they embrace that they're cool about that they're fine with it this album is more about reliving a sound than it is creating one and I'm cool with reliving the past Bam Bam but do Arctic Monkeys make me excited thrilled to hear these sounds revived and my answer is just not particularly I just got a handful of good tunes on here a pocketful of change to shake around but nothing that I'm really going to remember by the end of the year to be completely honest so I'm kind of feeling a little strong for to a light five on this thing pretty neutral on it but what do you think of this LP do you love it do you hate it Arctic Monkeys worst Arctic Monkeys best let me know and what should I review next anthony Fantana suck it at sea forever [Music] 
CrnkL-ewcck,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I do not dress up before my video reviews because I'm about to go on a job interview I just dress up because I want to it's nice to look nice it's time for an album review Woods Sun and shade Brooklyn's Woods is a band who over the past couple years I fell for really hard abrir house songs of shame at Echo Lake every single album I heard was just loaded with these creepy depressing lo-fi folk tunes loaded with noises and effects and fronted by Jeremy Earl's very distinct falsetto vocal and i freaking loved it I couldn't get enough woods just wrote such catchy songs on those albums and to me they have a pretty original sound they definitely have some Grateful Dead love going on and they're not the first band to experiment with folk music but they have a style that I couldn't see myself getting anywhere else in the nutshell that's addiction but I think I started to worry just a little bit when at Echo Lake dropped a few tunes on there sounded extremely similar to songs the band had already released and some other songs on there just felt kind of unfinished just ended abruptly so now I've got woods latest LP Sun and shade and this might be one of my biggest letdowns of 2011 like all of my worst fears confirmed the issue I had with a echo lake where songs were kind of abrupt felt just unfinished or just kind of ducking out before I get a real impression of them is increased on here say goodbye any other day what faces the sheet and the LPS overall length is a little misleading since its padded out with 27 29 minute instrumentals the first of which is pretty good out of the I just has this really patient repetitive hypnotic rhythm and flow it kind of feels like psycho delek folky krautrock pretty cool while Soliz ambra starts off pretty interestingly very dark very soft but it just kind of ends up underwhelming me and feeling like it's really not going anywhere it's just kind of like overall both of these instrumental tracks just aren't as electrifying as other instrumental moments I've heard these guys pull together like September with Pete on top of that there are some songs on here that just sound to me to be too close for comfort two songs woods has already released like handed out and pushing only but still there are a handful of tracks pretty good tracks on here where woods does make an attempt to write themselves out of their comfort zone to broaden their horizons to have in the home and what faces the sheet are like two of the sunniest songs these guys have written beforehand I always pictured myself listening to these guys in the forest at night or in like a haunted house or something but now some of these songs are more fit for a bunch of hippies dancing in a field of flowers in the middle of July which has a very liberating vibe to it but on the other end of the spectrum the song wouldn't waste is easily one of the most bleak and painful songs these guys have ever tried to pen but you know what the thing is even this album's brightest moments to me feel kind of dull the playing is a little messy or less enthusiastic maybe and I know the noisiness of woods has always been kind of a selling point of the band's music but some of the guitar parts on here could have used a second take the vocals too and honestly one of my biggest pet peeves in music happens on this album one of the best songs on here one of the catchiest and most memorable songs is the cover there's a cover of the song who do I think I am on this album and I hate it when the best song and an album is the cover or the song that I like the most at least but it wasn't always like that these guys covered graham Nash's military madness on songs of shame but in my opinion the other material on the album measured up I mean I was excited about this I thought I was going to love this but the only thing that kind of happened for me was that all the things I didn't like about at Echo Lake were magnified and spread across this album one thing I will say I like overall about this LP is woods makes a noticeable effort to brighten their music a little bit alter the mood make music that's a little bit more upbeat and I love the idea of them doing that there are a few great moments on here some decent ones but this LPS just kind of slumped by a bunch of material that I'm just never ever going to want to return to hopefully coucher jesta can bring some kind of silver lining to this cloud of sadness no hang out nothing I feel empty inside I'm feeling a strong 52 ally 6 on this album liking it maybe just a little bit but for the most part I'm just like neutral on it very very underwhelmed and neutral but what do you guys think about it do you love this thing d hate this thing why and what do you think I should be reviewing next in the video brain talk needle drop thing vlog youtube channel forever you 
14sLvv_ykmE,banning gerak hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music and it's time for an album review planning to rock w planning to rock is the solo effort of Jeannine rostra and experimental singer-songwriter who I was turned on to last year when she collaborated with the knife on the album tomorrow in the year and I distinctly remember that video as being one of my not so positive reviews but it's not like that was a complete loss since I got to hear some tracks off of planning to Rock's first LP have it all which isn't half bad but now it's five years later and we have w sophomore album a my and and and I'm at a complete loss of words all of this is opinion but sometimes I feel so strongly about something that I just start frothing at the mouth because nearly every song on this album is constructed very very very lazily filled with half-baked melodies not so good sounds lots of off-pitch vocals really off-pitch vocals like can hardly hold a note and some of the most terrible vocal effects known to man look at the opener doorway the vocals on that track sound like that horrible effect that they would put on someone's voice in a be horror movie to make them sound like a demon or the devil or something like that if this is a single solitary effect that you could just throw on a voice and then get it to sound like this this effect needs to be deleted off of every computer across the world and then we should take the last copy of this effect put it on a USB Drive and then put that USB Drive onto a spaceship and then launch that spaceship into the Sun while it's attached to let's say maybe eight or and nuclear warheads so that it explodes on impact that way this horrible horrible ear abusing effect will never be able to harm future generations or races who inhabit other planets and this isn't the only annoying vocal effect on this album there are moments like the one and I'm your man that find their own special little way to be annoying with lots of distortion and a little extra reverb Wow it's not just the effects it's like the way she's singing on this album it's not like oh down here in the stomach and it's not you know up here in the throat huh it sounds like the way someone would be singing if they if they had absolutely no nasal passages like you know like on the track number nine or manifesto and another thing about this out the lyrics look at the track the brakes don't be surprised if I'm ripping out my eyes I'm on fire a line so great it needed to be repeated it just seems like three run-of-the-mill dramatic statements that that people throw into songs just to fill space but they're layered on top of each other in a nonsensical way for an artistic effect I mean what exactly does it mean to be on fire for planning to rock I mean this isn't the only moment on the album she talks about being on fire honestly I feel like sometimes she's just writing lyrics so that she can have a vocal part in the song and while we're on the breaks not only is this song not as awesome as the song of the same name released by Kurtis Blow in 1980 but the chord progression the way it's mixed the sounds the beat it's all pretty forgettable containing the only musical moments that hit me on this album is being good or at least somewhat beautiful we're like the horn solo and pulsating strings at the end of the one or the horns on going wrong and that's one thing I like about this album how laced it is with horns and strings I love those textures but for every good texture there are even more bad textures and why are the way these songs structured so uninspired I mean look at the track on your man the chorus and the verse first instrumentally sound almost the same why do I feel like I'm most of these tracks I'm listening to the same part over and over and over and over none of the darkness or edginess here is real it's not real the emperor no clothes none the vocal effects here are so terrible they sound like they've been scraped from the bottom of a trash can I'd rather listen to auto-tune yes and to add insult to injury this album is like such a bad fever Rea impression on some of the tracks it's like a bizarro fever ray huh so I mean I'm feeling a light too on this record strong one or light two I mean my opinion my opinion my opinion but light too and without question I will not be returning to this I mean huh it's it's taxing just to think about listening to this again so I'm going to just just stop thinking about it from now on and let me know what you think of this album I'm sure you will do you love it do you hate it and why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana planning to rock w forever 
Xa4YaYOdYAY,havock hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's trashiest music nerd here with something that's going to take you guys off no no it's not a rap review takes you guys off more than that it's a metal review Havok is a denver band that proudly relives the sounds of old-school thrash metal and I'm not a thrash expert I don't pretend to be I know my early Exodus my early big for Bam Bam Bam Bam and I also like a lot of crossover acts too like DRI suicidal tendencies and crow bags and for me Havoc's time up is just as enjoyable as some of thrash metals classics I listen to times up because I want to listen to time is up not because I want to get nostalgic and think of peace cells or Master of Puppets like any good thrash record this thing is an overwhelming dose of sonic testosterone because when this thing is on I want to punch stuff I want to run around I want to climb on things I want to blow things up the energy on this thing is non freaking stopped for the most part and maybe that's almost to a fault because even some of thrashes best records had a slower moment of to some kind of semblance of balladry you know like a breather a break but pretty much every tune here is a lean and mean three to five minute thrash fest the song DOA has some pretty nice harmonized guitar solos in trowing the song and the title track takes a little while to take off but every other song here hits hard and hits fast like a blitzkrieg or like a thrash krieg which is fitting because some of the lyrics here are about war international war and also two-faced scumbags and throwing your life away because you're living too fast during some of these lyrical moments I feel like the the frontman David Sanchez is like singing directly to me and it kind of freaks me out for a second like on time is up where he's like take a number and have a seat we'll be with you shortly not only is that awesome but I kind of feel like he's somehow figured out how to channel Dave Mustaine or something and I love David Sanchez vocals not only because of his vocal delivery but just the way his voice sounds it's like this high-pitched raspy kind of thing in a way it kind of sounds like a bottle rocket going off or maybe a more intense version of overkill and every once in a while he'll pull out this high-pitched wail that's very King Diamond desk so the vocals do come off versatile because they do everything well whether they're shouting or talking or singing or doing these really big gang vocals that emphasize the hook from time to time and as far as mix and recording and sound goes I really can't fault this record on much of anything maybe the guitars are a little too loud maybe the bass could be brought up in the mix I mean I know for example I loved the fact that the bass brought so much counterpoint on another modern thrash record vector's black future even though I don't get much of that here the guitar tone is still really nice and the drums on this thing are extremely just pounding an intricate I mean the drummer's always thrown in all sorts of fills and yet he never loses track of the groove or anything like that back to the guitar one thing we need to talk about with the guitar the solos on this thing which play a huge part in thrash metal they're all very tight straight to the point flashy while they're there but they don't devour the entire song Banshee note bends and just a flawless sweet picking and these whammy bar whales that sometimes kind of sound like a laser melting my brain my only other complaint is that there's not really a break on here so a lot of the tracks this thing can come off kind of say me say me in terms of blueprint Wow even though the tools the havoc uses on this album are tried-and-true that doesn't mean they don't use them well like you know juggling the art of juggling is ancient but if you came across somebody juggling grenades and and chainsaws would you say of juggling so old it's been done whatever I really love this album and I don't think you need to be an old-school thrash metal aficionado to enjoy it I think this LP goes far far far beyond nostalgia if you enjoy music that has really intense drumming great grooves and guitar riffs technical guitar solos and a ton of aggression then this is where you want to be I'm feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this record I had a hell of a time listening to it it was fun every single time I went through the album can't wait to listen to it again Anthony Fantana havoc time is up forever 
ANJ3E5-p8Eo,well hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review music is kind of like food because at first when I was thinking of reviewing this album partially because of how many requests I've gotten um I kind of felt like a kid sitting at a table and it was dinnertime and with my parents and they're trying to force-feed me with something in a spoon that I want to eat and I'm like mmm hmm and I'm sure there are some of you out there who can sympathize I'm sure some of you just hate Death Cab for Cutie on principle but if you're more like me maybe you fell off the bandwagon when plans came out in 2005 and to be completely honest I have not listened to that album since it came out I mean I real issen to it for this review but I really don't see why my negative reaction was so strong at the time I mean they definitely did change their sound after Transatlanticism but not in the worst way possible it was slower more mellow more baladi I guess maybe at the time it was just a change I was bored by plus on plans the band made the move to Atlantic Records which at the time was still a no-no still a no-no for indie bands they're going mainstream the mainstream should be so lucky so screw me for falling off the wagon with these guys I'm not in love with Death Cab for Cutie anymore mmm but still I tried gave this album an honest shot and why not it's been over five years since I've listened to a Death Cab album the week it was released I'm not in the same place I was back then the band's not in the same place they were back then why not so I went to listen to this album assuming that I would be pissed off and earning guard by nearly everything that I was going to hear but after many listens to this album I couldn't find a single thing that offended my ears about it really and I think that's mostly because this LP is too earnest it's too honest it's too comfortable with itself to be doing things that are loud or flamboyant just to grab attention it's a simple and straightforward album that's completely devoid of any and all cynicism it's like having a person come up behind you and say hey you're really cool and nice and smart and I like you and you know you just kind of turn around you're like what's wrong with you in your head but then you kind of realize oh wait this person's like serious they're being nice oh nice nice Ness a weird analogy I know even though Ben Gibbard and the guys are getting old this album still feels really young to me the recording is crisp and bright the instrumentation and the lyrics are devoid of the complications and adults might try to throw into them and even though Ben doesn't sing exactly the same way he used to his voice still sounds really light and pleasant now there are some spots on this LP where I think Death Cab writes some of the catchiest songs they have in a while like Monday morning and underneath the Sycamore but I think my favorite track here is you are a tourist which has this this really positive melody and vibe just emanating off of it just radiates nice feeling it's got lots of lyrics about hearts and and burning and the way Ben sings on this track and the way he repeats this simple melody over and over just kind of reminds me of like folk songs or something like that or a sing-along I just kind of in my head I see a group of people singing this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine the band does experiment a little bit on some of these tracks but the whole album is so low-key that I remember when I was first listening to it these moments just really kind of blew by me I'm thinking of a track like doors unlocked and open which is really rigid really kind of mid-tempo and reminds me of like krautrock maybe even the same direction that Magua was taking their latest album in and while we're talking about songs that sound like other songs the title track codes and keys the piano the the way the song moobs sounds little suburbs ish and while I'm complaining Ben Gibbard x'v ice on this the way he sings I guess he just doesn't have as much inflection or emotion in his voice as he used to he just flatly delivers these same vocal melodies over and over and without making any alterations to them melodically or emotionally but still that didn't really ruin any of these songs for me at worst at worst this album was underwhelming underwhelming and even though I wish these guys would stop using electronics in their songs when I hear a little sequence a little rhythm here or there or something like that that's generated electronically or in effect or a string arrangement it's not like it takes over the whole song it's not like it swallows the song all of the additions around these songs are very quiet very subtle and I like that it doesn't distract it complements maybe light 7 on this overall it's a pretty solid record Death Cab for Cutie chooses a sound and then creates 11 songs within that sound that overall are pretty enjoyable and to me that's what makes a pretty good record even though this is not going to be one of my favorites of the year I'm surprised I enjoyed a Death Cab album again this much but what do you think of this thing did you love it did you hate it and why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Death Cab for Cutie codes and keys forever you you 
SVy-uU84ApQ,London bloggers holiday I need a haircut I need a shave I need to sleep hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm sorry this video is late today you know I was just up very late with a lot of you and a blog TV which was fun you know with kouchuu chess stud and mike 555 and sad sad robot I just had to sleep late today everything is off now the website got updated late kouchuu chesta is is free so i'm going to take it easy today with an EP review of Theophilus london's lover's holiday this guy's a Brooklyn emcee this EP came out toward the beginning of this year but he actually has a new LP coming out by the middle of this summer I think mr. London isn't doing anything terribly innovative in fact it's been done before combining rap music with pop but for some reason this musical style is finally starting to catch on in the indie community with artists like Kanye West Drake and Kid Cudi but if you guys watch the channel you know that I like Kanye stuff not in love with it and I'm not really a Cudi or a Drake fan I mean while they're more upbeat songs are nice I just have a really hard time relating to them when they try to get depressing and sad and upset like what's wrong seriously Theophilus is a lot less prone to mood swings and the way he combines rap and pop is with a lot of synthesizers a lot of female backup vocals and New Wave era drum machines it's just reminding me of all these different things but no one single thing like radio pop from the 80s and early LL Cool J singles and 80s electro like Afrika Bambaataa and the soul sonic force and West Street mob weird comparison I know but it's not like rigid funkified rap music theos instrumentals are very clean very detailed very smooth they have that modern Sheen to them even though there are aspects of them that are kind of retro check the beyond the opening track why even try just these glistening synthesizers bouncing on the tempo a really nice rhythmic bass line squawking synthesizers over the chorus guest vocals from Sarah Quinn and Theo proves that he can sing as well as rap which you know is nice singing can kind of be the downfall for some rappers who want to be taken seriously as singers Theo doesn't come off in this song or really any of these songs honestly as a spitter or highly lyrical and he doesn't try to and that's that's not really the point I don't think it's more about the sentiment it's more about the songwriting it's more about the melody in the groove and the chord progression and all of those things are great I love the way the chorus on this track just escalates in a really heavenly fashion a lot of contrasts between that and the verse and the bridge is great too I mean I'm not getting a lot of songs here but what songs are here are really well-crafted the New Wave influences get turned up on wine and chocolates and Strangelove but the song girls girls money is more fit for like the club I could totally see that getting DJed and yeah the title in the hook are pretty ridiculous but it's not like the song gets so tacky it's hard for me to handle now I'm sure that you could charge the song with you know being shallow maybe a lack of depth or something like that but my favorite track is the last one here flying overseas which is easily the sexiest song on this album a nice really heavy beat this this this warm bass just you know and I love how slow this song moves and when Theo wraps on this thing man he's just bleeding coolness everywhere it's getting all over the place it's a biohazard it's gonna get on me I really like how the verses simmer before the chorus finally comes on they really string it out and when it does it just explodes it's pretty much like having sex in the dark with your ears I love where this thing is I love where Theo is going with his music and even though he's not the only person making pop rap out there today he's definitely making something I clearly clearly prefer over a majority of what I've been hearing I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this EP recommended a lot let me know what you think of it there are links where you can hear it below this video and yeah what do you think I should review next on this to YouTube channel where I do reviews with my brain Anthony Fantana the Ovilus London lovers holiday forever you 
4GngIvsARm8,My Morning Jacket hello and my needle drops it's been a while since I called you that Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it is hot as hell today I've been chillaxing and relaxin all day and now I'm ready to do this review My Morning Jacket cerca del sur kiddo circuit circuital alright so right now we're in a review that I was really really excited to do my first My Morning Jacket review these guys are a kentucky 5-piece who carry a lot of weight when it comes to alternative country music folk rock because of past records like at dawn and z but all my excitement has kind of built up to this album that i don't really love even though at first when i was listening to this thing it seemed like that was gonna happen but one thing i can say about this LP is that it has those simple but very important things that make great records like lots of interplay between the musicians just a great mix a live feel no matter what the band no matter what the style of music there's a noticeable difference between just multi-tracked separated instruments following a tempo in a band playing together just look at the opening track on this LP victory dance just as this this growing morphing evolving groove as the song trudges on and I love how huge and ambitious and in the moment the title track sounds - I might not totally be in love with Jim James vocals but that song is really well structured has tons of nooks and crannies - and things get really beautiful on my favorite track here wonderful which is just kind of about having a great state of mind I just love the sentiment of the song I love the finger pick guitar I love the background vocals I love the strings just wrapping around the song a certain points of it but I think the superlative for cutest song on this album should go - out of my system which even though it doesn't have giant group harmonies of group vocal harmonies on the track it reminds me so fitness so much of a Beach Boys song because of the the reverb on the vocals the sunny guitars and the subject matter on this track kind of reminds me of just coming of age which a lot of Beach Boys songs do for me it's a track about doing drugs stealing cars basically do anything that is bad wrong or will get you landed in jail simply because you know even though these things may get you in trouble with the law some people have to do these things have to do something dangerous have to explore do something exciting to get it out of their system or else maybe you end up growing up with a lot of regrets it's just a moment on this album where My Morning Jacket is trying to have a good time with our music and make a funny observation and it helps here it helps but what's funny is that to me it hurts on the very next track of this album the song holdin on the black metal kind of ironically deals with how misunderstood black metal is and its effect on kids and its message and Lucifer and I get the impression from the lyrics My Morning Jacket feels that black metal is kind of something you should grow out of and I think the idea of growing out of a certain kind of music is universal for all music fans I mean there's a ton of music I haven't enjoyed since like ninth grade but I can't help but feel like the message on this song is just kind of condescending just a little bit and I feel like this is the first time the irony of a song has really ticked me off and made me feel like man this this just backfired a lot of people complain about irony and music oh this is so ironic but making a statement about black metal with a kids choir and sultry horn hits and a moody melody and falsetto vocals just had my eyes rolling again and again I thought they were just gonna fall out of my head my issue with every track after that song really has to do with kind of the songwriting because all the chord progressions the melodies on these on the second half of the album are really really borrowed tried and true influenced familiar which isn't a bad thing everybody is borrowing from something else it's just that the question comes up in my head does My Morning Jacket make these chord progressions these melodies exciting for me again do they kill it slow slow tune makes a pretty funny observation but it's not like I'm dying to revisit it and moving away just drags on forever to me this LP is just extremely extremely extremely front-loaded in terms of enjoyability effort ambition so because of that I'm extremely torn and extremely on the fence feeling a strong five to a light six on this record really love to the first half and that's where I am on this record where you want it how do you feel about it love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana My Morning Jacket circuital forever 
oIR6GZakxM8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review totem 3 is the third installment of this bands totem series they are a musical collective from Seattle Washington and on this LP their seven members strong and they actually bring on seven more musicians as well to add on some extra instrumentation and even though these guys have a name that is kind of ridiculous and the name is kind of a spoof off of another group from Morocco who's hey David with moves back in the 70s master musicians of bukkake is a name you can take seriously implying the idea of masturbation in their name definitely plays into how indulgent this band and totem 3 is because really on this LP they do whatever the hell they want and considering how many people are on this album playing the music influencing it this thing goes in a lot of directions so what does this album sound like what's the style ah that depends on the track you're listening to it's really going to take someone open minded to enjoy everything master musicians do on totem 3 i'm not even in love with every track the opener is a drone a soundscape lots of chimes and synthesizer rumbles and and these swelling strings just lapping over the music over and over a new leaf texture and when I blasted the world shakes around me but the thing is even though there's a lot to hear on this track I don't really feel like any of it really comes together I don't feel like any sound here really complements or enhances another sound they all just kind of feel like they're happening on the next three tracks though on totem three things get really interesting I see these these tracks as a serious trifecta on the album tabla strings distorted electric guitar lots of hand percussion giant group vocals and some flute I think to these guys make like desert rock I hear influences in these songs stretching from Mali to India if you've heard anything from Grails or even Tinariwen tinariwen too if you've heard their music you know what I'm talking about when I hear this I just feel like I'm I'm running down a sand dune and just the hot desert wind is blowing all around me and the Sun is beating down on my bald head so the album goes from drone to this desert rock to a moving string piece on six thousand years of darkness they compose something very fine intricate and layered and beautiful it just sounds like an epic climax on a movie soundtrack the next track on here really burns me though sadly I just don't like the sounds on this track I mean what's in the background is fine but kind of let's plopped on top of it is this female vocal with this odd effect on it it just kind of sounds like someone a robotic alien rather speaking out of a megaphone from the mothership telling the earth that it's about to be invaded and that we should all be prepared to be enslaved by an alien race if the idea that interests you maybe you like that song more than me the last track is kind of an eyebrow-raising cherry on top for me though it's like this progressive keyboard rock that I would say sounds like it's from the 70s if it didn't remind me of zombie so much master musicians of bukkake even though they do have maybe a little bit of musical a DD they do everything with a lot of heart and they do everything pretty freakin well but enjoyment wise on this record I'm still kind of like I still kind of have my reservations it's a little scatter brain but the production is very good it's amazingly versatile so my feelings personal feelings are a strong seven on this I recommend it if you love the experimental stuff if you love the out their stuff the oven stuff the music that reaches out and wears its influences on its sleeve especially influences that are outside American borders get on the totem three train that's what I think about this record what do you think about this record do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana master musicians of bukkake forever you 
YR_k2n2rTaU,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a little question of the week short one get quickened to the point because we did mourn a death this week sadly but also we need to celebrate life as well while we have it and the person who celebrated their 70th birthday this week Bob freaking Dylan what is your favorite Dylan release and why why is important I know you know he he has as many lovers maybe as as haters people who don't like his voice don't like a song writing style don't like what he's things about the boo boo boo boo boo boo boo and I understand the complaints I definitely can see the other side of the aisle but I'm a big Dylan fan I'm a Dylan fan I've owned pretty much all of this guys stuff at one point you know up to like maybe 1971 or 1972 but you know I sold a lot of the records that I didn't end up liking and so now I'm kind of left with the ones that I love the most and I want to talk about just a little bit just to records from that pre 70s era that I do love while Dylan was still acoustic I think easily my favorite LP from his was times they are a-changin there are some heavy heavy stuff on this album and some of my favorite songs from him like boots of Spanish leather love that song only a pawn in their game and with God on our side oh just so just thick just ripe with the consciousness of that time much like Gil scott-heron 's music was you know things were very politically tense and for good reason so if you love folk music if you love acoustic singer/songwriter music this is a must listen I mean this is a must all right and after Dylan had gone electric while there are definitely some spots beyond 1970 where he really triumphs really came together with a great album I think my favorite electric moment of his pre-1970 as out to be and I know people go people go crazy for the highway 61 revisited and I do too some of my favorite songs on there got the album but blonde on blonde it's my favorite electric release from him I mean it's got some of my favorite tracks from here rainy day women it's got stuck inside of mobile one of us must know in a leopard skin skin a pillbox hat as well I just love so many songs on here they're just so catchy that just so memorable and especially with a stuck inside of Mobile I love how Dylan can really not only write a socially conscious song but really write these very abstract surreal tunes that you know just just don't make much sense on the surface but you know everyone's free to scratch beyond then and pull their own meaning out of it but um I just like the guy's style I just like how versatile he was in retrospect and you know he's got a strong personality that attracted a lot of people like myself but pissed a lot of people off as well and um you know there's a part of me that believes you're not making great art if if somebody's not offended take that for what you will but what's your favorite Dylan album and why which favorite Dylan song if someone you knew did not know about Bob Dylan UM's curious what album would you recommend they start with first Anthony Fantana Bob Dylan 70th birthday forever you
