hv65cRcTDes,Chris here is young he's what's hot he's what's new and he's going to be doing tonight's review whether you like it or not hello my needle drops I'm Chris Capello and it's time for an album review today's review sons the engine-room sons is a Fairfield Connecticut based four-piece band that have been kicking around the indie rock circuit here in Connecticut and the neighboring states for the past few years they the three original members were also members of a band called Midian the modern dance which is one of my favorite local bands and they are sort of on a hiatus right now but they're really great and so this sons record is sort of tiding me over basically until whatever happens with with MIDI and the modern dance next but anyway this uh this record comes on the heels of their 2011 EP be good boy and a demo that they put put out the previous year which just add three tracks on it but this is their first full-length LP the engine room so this record finds the band branching out from there indie rock origins into something a little more experimental and a little more hard edged they take a lot from 90s emo bands like sunny day real estate and mineral and also some elements from slow core and even math rock on this release the van mixes a lot of styles that should be familiar to any fans of 90s indie rock but they do it in such a way that keeps things constantly interesting and engaging and has a kind of experimental bent to it for me the real strength of this album lies in the instrumental backbone they the band was recently joined by a new guitarist Peter cats who is known for being the guitarist from the Massachusetts post-rock math rock band fugue who dis abandoned recently prior to him joining sons and his influence really shines all over this record you know he adds a lot of interesting chord progressions guitar riffs you know just elements that wouldn't necessarily be present in a typical indie rock record and it gives it this kind of progressive feeling to it as a whole cats seems to have this ability as a guitar player to balance out the other elements of the band he keeps the rawness in check and also adds you know aggression and noisy dissonant riffs when he needs to and so it adds another element to the sort of power trio sound that they had before and makes it a much more sort of engaging released it's really interesting to listen to the band you know write these really breakneck speed songs he's aggressive tracks and then go into more slow contemplative and minimalist songs you know you get tracks like the opening song repulse which is this very slow kind of page or the lion influence track and then you have songs like lover lover and I could have made time which are just these raw angry dissonant emo songs I mean really you know raw lyrics aggressive wrist this is intense riff in in lover lover that um it's like a harmonic balance between the two guitarists from the band and they just play so fast and with such intensity that it kind of sends chills down my spine but the best tracks on this record come when the band balances these two elements and combines them into the same song the highlight track for me is definitely crocodile the second song in the album it starts with this kind of soothing you know ethereal guitar riff and these you know airy vocals coming in seemingly from nowhere but then builds up to this dramatic climax before completely dropping off towards the toward the end of the song into this kind of modest mouse circa the lonesome crowded West irri instrumental part but then it all builds up back again into this angry dissonant mix of feedback and turns into kind of a cursive style song I mean we'll rutledge the frontman is just like shouting and screaming over these bursts of guitar feedback it's one of the most chilling and fascinating for me moments of any song from 2012 as far as I'm concerned they have a similar thing going on the title track the engine room it starts out kind of slow and no sad but builds up into this really anthemic chorus that reminds me of their earlier work the lyrics occasionally veer into you know teenaged conor oberst territory but on the whole I think that will Rutledge's lyrics are more developed and more poetic and have more you know lyrical merit than his previous work and so it's easier for me to appreciate them you know even though I can totally identify with what he's going for you know when he's at his most literal it's nice to have the sort of poetic elements you know this is symbolism his use of imagery to balance that and to keep things you know mature I mean as a teenager myself you know I feel justified in listening to this record because I've had you know all of the feelings that he's yelling and singing sadly about but I could see how someone might be sort of turned off by them anyway I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this one I thought it was great but what did you think did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next son's the engine room forever 
HJS6uAN23rM,how can he replace me when his name is intern Chris he's not entering Chris anymore it's full-time Chris everything's kind of tilted and I like it hi everyone Pantano here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review creator phantom antichrist and ant antichrist these guys are German thrash metal heavyweights this is their 13th full-length album and with a few lineup changes they have been steadily releasing material since they started in the mid 80s and have released some pretty notable metal records in that time like pleasure to kill especially pleasure to kill and coma of souls just really bringing that speedy fast and ultra aggressive thrash metal sound from the late 80s and early 90s together with some really kind of sacrilegious imagery and messages and though they did start incorporating some elements of a very kind of dark moody gothic rock on some of their albums that were released in the 90s they never really ventured all too far from their renren rash sound they're certainly staying ahead of some of their more slightly over produced contemporaries like overkill or Megadeth they're even sounding better than some of their fellow Germans although I will say that last Sodom record had a really raw freakin badass rough-around-the-edges sound just really but anyway this new album from Creator is a bit of a change it's not really just the the thrash and bash of their previous LP they really do try to refine their sound with more melody more harmony some really kind of epic choruses a lot of the riffs and core progressions feel much more righteous this time around system feelings of justice coming from some of these songs and to mention it again the melody and the harmony that I feel like is so much bigger of an element on this album make some of the course is on this thing feel really kind of Flowery it actually kind of sounds like these guys are borrowing a lot of ideas from the world of of Iron Maiden to bring their sound a bit more diversity on this album and even though the b-side to the new single from these guys is a cover of number of the beast it sounds more like these guys or bar borrowing a lot more from Iron Man's newer records than they are their older records it does bring an element of melodic sweetness to some of these songs and really makes a few of the courses on this record really rock it off into something kind of exciting a lot like the title track to this album but some other moments where these guys will glide from a hard-hitting thrash riff to something that's just pretty it just doesn't feel that impressive or it's just kind of passable and I think that partially has to do with these guys writing these melodic courses or executing them rather just about the same way almost every time they come up and what's worse is that some of these courses can come off really kind of overblown a bit corny and to me kind of break the momentum of some of these tracks I prefer the increase in melody on this album when it's kind of used subtly into a track that is just totally badass and balls-to-the-wall like death to the world but aside from that increase in melody in that kind of embrace of Iron Maiden sound just kind of out of nowhere on this album there's not many surprises to behold with phantom antichrist and i'm kind of on the fence with the production too while I do think the guitar tone feels okay there's nothing particularly special about it and and the drums to me feel so mechanical they feel so robotic it doesn't really get me excited or pumped to hear these guys just riff on some of these grooves on these tracks rather it just kind of makes a lot of these songs feel very paced very kind of predictable and that just kills the excitement for me because thrash is all about a journal for me I have to give it to creator for you know not just trying to do the same thing over and over and over again but to hear them kind of jump ship a little bit onto another metal band sound and then just really kind of not even do all that much justice it feels even worse than it would be to just hear that put out another straightforward just fist to face thrash metal record I'm kind of feeling like strong five yeah about a strong five maybe yeah strong five on this record what did you guys think of this thing what did you expect from it did you love it did you hate it why and what should i in your opinion review next grabber 
b6_aekrjI_k,I got your replacement right here honey in turn Chris hi everyone Anthony my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review whoo-hoo this is the second installment of instrumental beats from music producer clams casino who has recently seen a nice rise to fame but not as nice when you compare it to a lot of the artists who rap and sing over the beats he makes guys like little B and especially ASAP rocky last year with that live love ASAP mixtape have made career-defining tracks with the instrumentals this guy makes and clams casinos production style has been essential in creating the spacious and Atmospheric approach to hip-hop music that a lot of people right now are calling cloud rap this free collection of instrumentals is basically your chance to listen to clams Casino in the raw no vocalist and really just come to understand what makes him stand out as a producer on this on that on this on that on this thing you're going to hear instrumentals that have been wrapped over or sung over by guys like ASAP rocky little B main attractions Mac Miller even the weekend with - with now with all these tracks with this instrumental tape you can kind of hear what claims casino has been up to within the year or so it's been since he dropped his last instrumental tape and he showed a lot of growth since then he's working with different artists he's producing for bigger albums now generally this guy's instrumentals are very lucid very dreamy it's like swimming in slow motion through an ocean of bong water that is floating through space and while keeping with that style clams Casino looks for new hurdles to jump over he is on these instrumentals not always shooting for that same kind of hey this is pretty hey this is glossy hey this is beautiful kind of vibe the opening track on your palace is easily one of the most epic productions that this guy is put together just with all these escalating chorus vocal samples that sound like they were recorded and one of the largest cathedrals on the planet the track was up which comes right after has these watery synthesizers and just these very spectral vocal samples and together they kind of make the sleepiest song this guy has ever made but sleepy in a good way it's very relaxing it's very intoxicating and the track bass brings just that and is really heavy with the low end it's it's pretty much a bad banger just such heavy rumbles and very crisp snare hits and the track the fall is easily one of the darkest and most textured songs this guy has made with all of these sampled birds chirping and disembodied vocals to those two things are just swirled into this mess of synthesizers of various textures sometimes they're glistening and echo Ian's and bouncy sometimes they're kind of distorted and over modulated to the track eventually fades and comes back more distorted than it previously was in kind of the first section of the song and it ends up kind of sounding like a cross between a rap beat and a Tim Hecker soundscape the first four tracks on this thing alone showcase more variety than what clams was doing on his previous tape though there are positives on here and really strong positives there were a bunch of tracks that I felt were just kind of passable maybe not maintaining enough detail to really kind of be an exciting or thrilling listen with no vocalist on it whatsoever and other tracks like angels and the serving remix definitely didn't have that strong of a flavor to me a personality comparison with other tracks on here and I did not like the washed out remix at all whether it's just the pulsating and forceful beat along with that relaxing atmosphere that just kind of puts me off or the arpeggios that the synths are playing if there's just a lot of things I don't like about the track but hearing the beautifully dismantled version of Born to Thai by Lana Del Rey was actually surprisingly awesome this thing is a solid listen for the most part I'm totally and just completely in love with this guy's production style but at the same time I have to recognize that not every track on here is that invigorating of a listen I feel not a decent too strong seven on this thing thought it was great what did you guys think of this did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana washed out forever [Music] [Music] 
_Fdv0XkbgSE,I didn't mean it mr. fantail could you possibly see it in your heart to forgive me you forget yes you're fired get your own boss sucks hi everyone my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review I am am I Who am I kin finally a debut LP from immi Who am I the project that gained widespread blogosphere attention after some short strange anonymously produced video started cropping up on YouTube but once this project went semi public exposing that the person fronting kind of spearheading I am am I Who am I was in fact repeatedly slept on Swedish singer-songwriter Jonah Lee a lot of the curiosity in regards to this project just disappeared with the mystery the sudden loss of interest did not stop I am mi Who am I from 2010 to 2011 the project continued to release full-length music videos as well as a live album - and every video just had man immaculate immaculate cinematography just beautiful images surreal images brought in a pastel color palette I'm talking just costumes dances really weird settings makeup everything and of course all these videos were set to the music of immi Who am I which in video after video consistently hung within the realm of just synth pop art pop a little electro pop it's pop it's pop everybody there was kind of a downside to that because the visual side to this project just felt so overblown in comparison to the music to be completely honest I just felt like the music merely existed to complement the videos that I am mi Who am I was putting out most of the time I felt that was especially true since I felt like the music I was hearing was just a less adventurous version of what was obviously inspiring the music artists like Portishead because there's definitely a downtempo thing going on with some of the tracks here Bjork as well and especially silent shout era the knife and fever ray - who are fellow Swedes and also inspire the the visual aesthetic of this project in a big way - I tuned out big-time when it came to 2012 and this project I did not listen to a single song all the way through that they had put out up until this point and they released nine new songs with accompanying videos since the beginning of this year and those nine songs make up this album but honestly separating this project from its visual end with this album just listening to the music is exactly what I needed to start enjoying what's actually going on here because while the music on this LP does feel simple Jonah Lee does bring a very odd and enjoyable personality to these tracks but like I said before this is basically pop music with very clear influences but let's not discount it because of that because making a catchy er version of the kind of experimental music that inspires you isn't necessarily an easy thing and I would say I am am I Who am I does it impressively right from the start of this album I love the second track on here which is titled drops and and has this very throbbing beat in this Portishead inspired winding melody the track good worker is a very dark piece of New Wave and just has Jonah Lee against us very hard grooving be singing in her upper register exploring that upper register with some nasally vocals and weird Cadence's strong choruses and strange vocals are pretty much the angle that nearly every track on here takes but that does not mean there isn't variety among these songs though the track idle talk one of my favorites on here is a very dreamy sensual kind of whisk your way valid and in contrast the track in due order is very grimy it's very kind of disturbed dark almost like industrial pop and the song rascal is very quiet its atmospheric and has this beautifully escalating chorus very bare-bones but I love that swell and the extremely dancey closer has almost a disco vibe to it and with that disco vibe Jojo Jonah Lee's vocals kind of gain us somewhat BG's quality and the production on here is really great as well lots of fat just thick synthesizers they're very colorful and they layer intricately on a lot of songs throughout this LP sometimes I wish Jonah Lee and her producers would kind of take it easy on the reverb there are some moments where I feel like her voice is so in so much reverb it really distances it for me and the instrumentation is as well the reverb can make it sound a bit too glossy at some moments I can't really complain about the production too much on here I think it sounds great just lots of colorful scents like I said strong textured beats clear muscular grooves and a vocal that has some nice personality to it some interesting effects on these tracks - catchy catchy catchy catchy catchy catchy choruses and distinctly different songs I thought I was going to absolutely hate this thing to the point where I was throwing up violently on camera in every direction but I think this album is good feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing I do feel like the vocals here and just the overall style will not be for everybody but if you can enjoy those and basically get past the knife and björk worship on this album you'll hear some really catchy songs and in the future we will possibly hear I am am I Who am I grow into something more of its of its own what do you guys think of this LP did you love it did you hate it why and what should i review mixed Anthony Fantino I am in my 11 forever [Music] [Music] 
Vsb5OhJILf8,you're super late like it was a superpower like laser vision hi everyone Anthony Fantana here my needle drops the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the tallest man on earth there's no leaving now this is the third full-length album from Swedish singer-songwriter Christian Madsen the dude has been incredibly consistent so far in his career staying true to his troubadour sound very passionate singing with just a voice that is slightly raspy very strong impressive solo guitar playing he just time and time and time and time and time again write songs that sound like a dusty road going into a Setting Sun as the credits roll brought to you in bright exciting Technicolor color color now with this new LP Christian basically continues his consistency streak and mate and mate and makes another album with roughly the same sound and it's and it's mostly because this guy can pull that sort of thing off staying in one area with his music because he is so uniquely good and what he does a cut above just his finesse on the guitar is very captivating personality and his kind of moving lyrics that that are very flowery in their language but also having this feeling of being very personal and somewhat cryptic - if anything is undergone a slight change with the tallest man on earth it is the instrumentation on this album which does kind of have its positives and negatives with the cell P it does bring more variety on this album you do have your acoustic tracks you do have your electric guitar Foundation tracks you do piano ballad but you do end up getting moments on this album like the opening track to just grow away which kind of sounds like Matson's Nissen singing over a bunch of pre-recorded instrumentation played against click tracks you get a lot of layers a lot of color but the performance isn't that exciting you know there's just no momentum - and no electricity it's not bad but it's not exciting either to me the extra instrumentation on this album sounds way better when it is inserted into what sounds like just a solid recorded performance of Christian playing his guitar and singing at the same time like the really sweetly play pedal steel on the track winded whales or the extra layers of guitar the woodwind instrument and what sounds like a snare drum just galloping faintly in the distance on the song revelation blues I'm insane now what's nice about this extra instrumentation is that it hangs in the background very subtly it's it's the singing the songwriting the guitar playing that really steals the show and it should especially since between you know those several things there's so much to take in with the tallest man on earth like with the song criminals which has this very speedy finger picking and on top of the finger picking the really solid tempo that he's got going the groove that he's pushing forward and his singing he just sort of breaks down into a solo over the bridge and it's just a really nice clean transition I loved the imagery that his lyrics threw out there like going under and stuff like that - or when he directly addresses the mountain on the track bright lanterns you know the thing is about his lyrics like I said they are kind of cryptic they do seem very personal and I'm not completely into plugged into what the storyline or the progression of of the story is on a number of these tracks but still just the acting the acting that he does while singing these tracks just makes so much of these moments emotive for me jur mountain love that you know case in point the closing track on here which is really one of the more forlorn tracks the tallest man on earth has ever put out and he just cries out painfully singing during some of these verses is this album basically is the same tallest man on the earth that has made this project so interesting up until this point there's some new instrumentation popping up here and there like I said adds a nice variety to this album and it works more than a dozen so don't worry about that for me there's not much else to say about this album than just feeling a decent - strong heat on it thought it was a great album very great album you know like I said didn't really surprise me or bring this project and anywhere amazingly different but still I mean friggin enjoyable you know I can't say no you know I'm not soulless yeah I do love new directions and new flavors but there's just some stuff that basic foundational goddamn it's good gotta admit it kind of stuff what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the tallest man on earth forever

-NI4-QvHv9M,oh no it's perfect hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music and it's time for an album review re conduct on acid this guy this guy's a German producer this is his debut album he built up to this release with a few self-released EPS on a label that describes itself as a platform for deep in melancholic electronic music there eight tracks on the cell peace spanning around an hour of music but two of the songs are remixes by other artists of songs already on this album which is a bit unorthodox but we're not in Kansas anymore are we and the basic concept of this LP which is referenced in its title is to experiment with the basic sounds of acid house music alter it at its most basic elements which includes embracing beats and rhythms that are hypnotic and trance inducing and including the uniquely sharp sounds of the roland tb-303 bass synthesizer which was creating the extremely abrasive squelching sounds that were tearing ears apart years before people were complaining about all these distorted wobbling bass web webs in modern dubstep now the T V 303 was originally meant to be a practicing aid for solo guitarists but as somehow found a very cozy home in electronic music and it made a lot of noise on some pretty popular tracks including Fatboy Slim's everybody needs a 303 and futures acid tracks which is the single kind of credited with forming the acid house style the style that recondite is altering on this album and not only is his approach to acid house music very minimal atmospheric open kind of bleak simplistic but what sort of makes these tracks stand out is his use of that tb-303 how he produces sounds with this instrument is kind of surprising because the tracks sound kind of beautiful he sequences the tb-303 on this thing so delicately and and so sparsely on a lot of these tracks creating some melodies that have a very odd beauty to them almost like a fragility as well like on the track tie in which nears almost ten minutes the tb-303 sounds on that track just bounce on the tempo literally with a splash of reverb they bounce on the tempo so sombrely and the 303 phrases are even simpler on the track felicity where rekon die is kind of altering the tonality of the track but not over driving it to the point where it starts squelching or starts distorting for the most part he is bringing the sounds just short of that threshold just barely pushing it because he just wants to keep his sup on these tracks the track Harbinger sees him putting some extreme reverb on the 303 really making it cascade over itself as it's playing these sequences and the song of sultry is just that and he plays the three of three having it call out as if it were like a siren or something like it was really singing really changing the sustain of the notes as it is singing this one phrase over and over so he definitely knows his way around a 303 or a 303 mock-up or you know some kind of 303 program on a computer either way he is making really great use of it but his talents don't stop there he's no slouch when it comes to programming a beat to the beats on this thing are very quiet they're very subtle and extremely entrancing too and he progresses them very nicely across every single track whether the song's four minutes or it's nine minutes the six tracks recon back puts on this LP are very deep build and showcase a lot of finite differences between them but most importantly besides the mastery of the 303 and the very nice rhythms the extremely nice rhythms that then that are showcased throughout this album there is a very strong emotional palette coming from this album - this is very emotive electronic music it is very sad music beautifully sad forlorn slightly depressing it's very chilly it's it's kind of frostbitten overall I wish this album was longer I wish it had some more tracks the two remixes on this thing one from Tin Man and another one from scuba are pretty decent they showcase a nice subtlety to them just like recon Deitz productions do so it's not like when I come across them they really take me out of the mood of the album which is really all I can ask for while I do feel like recon died on this album showcases some really unique talents this album still just kind of feels like a collection of tracks and I feel like he acknowledges that with the remixes thrown into the mix feeling a light decent eight on this thing take a listen to it and when you do you know let me know what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana recon died on acid forever 
zhYKXT3l69Y,Oh No what are you doing back there what are you even you're not I mean I'm just gonna review with you like that hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd time for a review the new Liars album wish you woo now Liars is a group whose obsession with not being pigeon-holed and just drive to always bring the band's music in a different direction has made them one of the most well respected groups in experimental rock now despite the metamorphosis that Liars has undergone over the years across all their albums rock music has pretty much always remained a root influence but on wish you that foundation that rock foundation is dissipating a little bit and it's dissipating to make way for an album that is overtly electronic with synthesizers and drum machines coming from just about every direction although it's a very moody and it's a very quiet album kind of pulling from the bleaker moments from the band's previous LP sister world sister world which i really only liked a little for me those quieter more understated moments on there kind of clashed with the more visceral spots on the album the louder tracks on the album that just presented more energy but unwish you these difficult musical ideas run rampant throughout the entire album the song is on this LP are deceptively simple they don't carry a lot of volume they don't carry a lot of impact they repeat a lot of rhythms they repeat a lot of vocal melodies sometimes it really feels like Liars is trying to progress some of these songs as little as possible keeping things locked into the gray just everything on this album is just this endless grayscale grey grey grey just varying shades of gray everything is really dark really kind of grimy lightly glitchy at points just a lot of basic beats and musical phrases performed in this very unobtrusive way even the album's loudest track brass which is kind of punchy is a light breeze compared to songs from liars five previous albums even this album's first single number one against the rush is incredibly easy on the ear some very apathetic post-punk with with bare bones drums very smooth somewhat retro synthesizers very very light bassline I know a lot of what I'm saying about this album sounds maybe a little bad or a little overly simplistic but there is something about the grouping of sounds that liar's uses on this album just the rudimentary musical shapes and phrases the creepy vocal kroons and the eerie falsetto vocals the reverb effects on here too to me it's it's a recipe for musical paranoia it's got this creepiness to it that sneaks in when nobody's looking and it's really difficult to kind of expect it because the band presents it in this very emotionally drained way and I love how liars is able to present this same feeling the same kind of direction across a variety of sounds and and tracks though understated there is some clear variety on this LP like on the track octagon which has this really pulsating and nimble beat lots of detailing and these sour harmonies that come out from the the synths and the vocals kind of intertwining or a ring on every finger which has these noisy beats these noisy sense but still very light very easygoing and these dead tired vocals it sounds like something that would go over well in a dance party where everybody has insomnia and I guess the biggest surprise out of all these tracks is how Radiohead like some of these songs actually sound from the vocal melody to the falsetto that the vocal is singing in to the hot synthesizers and the bassline on on his and mine sensations it just kind of feels like something that might have been of Lim's inspire I feel the same way about the song who is the hunter and there are a couple spots on here that maybe kind of feel BEC like overall I do feel like this album is a more solid listen then sister world it's more consistent it feels like it has a more well-groomed concept however I don't think it's a concept a lot of people are going to enjoy hearing it's not an exciting album that you want to get comfy with if it's very much an unsettling album that is slightly tense and very cerebral I wish some of the tracks down here were longer I wish Liars dug into this sound a little bit deeper to the point where they found something that was more distinct and some of the songs on here could have been creepier because I do think that creepiness is one of the greatest things this LP has going for it but it's not something I see myself returning to unless I'm really kind of in the mood for it you know feeling a strong 7 to light 8 on this album enjoyed it quite a bit though it did take some repeat lessons to kind of get there what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana liars forever 
6j-L50IZEZg,got the internet in my hand I've still got the internet do you have a response a response to what Fantan Oh is a pay-to-play viral corporate shill for NPR and a few major indie labels he has no idea what he's talking about and reads prefabricated reviews I love you and have a nice day hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Neil Young and Crazy Horse Americana Neil Young is a legendary singer songwriter in musical adventurer having performed music and genres ranging from country music to electronic music folk rock surf music as well and let's not forget that just in general he's released some of the most significant records in rock music period and was regarded in the 90s by some to be the godfather of grunge now when I last ran into a new meal record it was for a review of his 2010 album the noise not really one of my favorites in his catalog but still one that stands out because of its unique aesthetic in his catalogue really it's Neil singing solo a group of songs both new and old and his only accompaniment is a distorted reverb wall of guitar noise just swirling around his vocals and his chord progressions and a few years later now we have a brand-new studio effort here but it's not just Neil it's not just Neil oh it's Neal with Crazy Horse the band he's recorded and performed with on and off for years they've been there for a lot of his studio albums most of his live albums and a great deal of very important turning points in his career like his first commercially successful record as well as his musical Reza rection in the 70s and his newfound relevancy in the 90s too and there now with this record working with Neil on this new project this new concept album that has a pretty simple approach but some interesting results basically assemble a group of songs with some kind of significance in the history of American music and then reworked them through these really kind of rough fast and loose folk rock jams that sound like they're kind of being played live in the studio and here and there kind of alter the chord progressions a bit alter the melodies a bit maybe even change if the lyrics or the meaning of the story subtly and while this is nothing altogether new a lot of artists have put together full-length LPS celebrating the history of American music Neil Young and Crazy Horse definitely have their own excitingly weird approach when it comes to approaching the material on this LP I mean these guys play these old tiny folk songs with a lot of swagger a lot of grit distorted guitars just blaring out of what sounds like a very kind of small amplifier that is most likely two times older than me drums with a lot of room ambience on them and to kind of take the edge the rough edge off of Mille and his band playing and and singing there is a background chorus consisting I I think mostly of females singing along some of these songs and adding you know kind of smoothness a kind of beauty to this very rusty presentation they really bring a modern sadness to the song Clementine and Neil and his band just kind of lyrically tell it the way it is and really bring out the songs dark meaning which is pretty much a tune about the death of the lover of the narrator of the song she died in a drowning accident and they'll even make sure to work in the verse toward the end of the track about getting over her death by kissing her sister which is pretty messed up and not something I remember in the song when it was taught to me as a child mm-hmm and even more defining moment as the song Oh Susanna where Neal and crazy horse really rocked the song out they bring a real kind of just swanky groove to the song and they really change up the chords too and just kind of make it sound just so just dirty like Oh Susanna because I come from Alabama with my BA and Jo on my knee the way meal and these guys play they totally strip it of that youthful innocence that I'm sure most people associate with it but I kind of feel like this album starts to falter a little bit too early in the game the song gallows pulled I feel doesn't really take enough liberties with the song in terms of just mood it feels really rigid it doesn't really bring that much fire I guess and I don't really like the baton baton delivery of the drums it's just kind of so flat for me I guess some tracks on this LP really do feel like they're played a little too straight for me and this album sort of loses view of its concept as it does that especially on the Billy n wheeler track high-flying bird just kind of seems like a 60s song thrown in there for good measure and honestly it kind of feels like Neal in the band are taking more away from this tracks Jefferson Airplane cover than they are the original however I do feel like Americana regroups and pulls together for a good ending for the last few tracks Neal and Crazy Horse definitely put together the ballsiest recording of she's coming around the mountain to ever be placed on wax but I think the most genius moment of this album comes on the final track a cover of god save the queen' toward the middle of the song Neal and Crazy Horse exposed the melodic connection between God Save the Queen and my country tis of thee basically pointing at the fact that a song celebrating the monarchy that America rebelled against was repurposed into a patriotic song in the 1800s I don't think you need more proof than that that ripping things off is at the very root of American culture I enjoyed the hell out of this record because of how well it exposes that dark underbelly of early American music I just wish it did it more consistently I'm feeling a light too decent 7 on this LP if you guys took a listen to it what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and yeah that's about it Anthony Fantino Neil Young and Crazy Horse 
u-wCVuxgRVE,pretend there's an intro here hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Japan droids celebration Rock these guys are a rock duo from Canada Vancouver specifically and this isn't a sophomore LP the follow-up to the 2009 album post nothing and if you take a listen to this album you are basically going to find a bunch of teenage angst and apathy anthems with blaring guitars and drums that take as much away from pop punk as they do indie rock and what defines this album from track one to track E is this exciting sense of just youthful righteousness it's the stuff memories from last summer are made of fists being thrown into the air and rock festivals where kids were coming of age our crowd surfing and forming memories that they may tell their kids about one day you know Japan droids is really great at conjuring imagery like this and they do it with very bright distorted guitars a lot of major scales and chords this really punked out energy some very relatable and in kind of poetic lyrics that talk a lot about navigating life and broken relationships and just the the confusion of youth their lyrics that embrace that apathy that I mentioned earlier and acknowledge that yeah things suck right now but kind of also see a brighter future ahead because even though this LP can be very negative at points there are all these really hyped up group chorus vocals screaming whoa whoa xand oh yes and all rights that on the flip side of things feel very uplifting this is an album that really sits down next to you puts an arm around you and says man I know that feel oh man do I know that feel I mean if this album was put out in the late 90s early 2000s it most likely would have been labeled as emo I think celebration Rock looks to strike many of the same chords with its listeners but manages to take all these kind of angsty feelings and turns them into a celebration like the title suggests however my appreciation of this album kinda stops there because everything else on here musicianship production songwriting variety every other characteristic of this album to me just isn't that fantastic I mean the guitar sounds on this thing are kind of plain even when they get kind of noisy they still come off a little bland for me on this album there's not an interesting sound in sight from beginning to end and these guys write all their tunes in a verse chorus verse structure for the most part and when they head into the second half of the song and repeat the chorus and the verse again I don't really feel like they change the song up enough for me to kind of kick the feeling of deja vu there's not really anything new or memorable about the melodies or the chord progressions on here and the the OO chorus is really just kind of bore me to be honest I really like the energy that these guys give off in their songs frontman Brian King talks a really liberating game with his explosive lyrics these guys definitely come off with a we're gonna give them hell kind of attitude I don't doubt their sincerity and I don't think anybody does which is why Japan droids music resonates with so many people but you know between the say me say me melodies and the songs that could have used more detail in my opinion the predictable chords and the okay production and the kind of common sounds this album really just leaves me underwhelmed I feel like in terms of attitude and just aesthetic this album would go over really well like a bonfire where it's you and all your friends on the night you graduated high school Japan droids are really great at making music that really feels like the soundtrack to a defining moment but musically there's nothing really definitive about what's going on here to me like I said some okay music with some really big feelings and that's pretty much it I'm feeling really on the fence with this album a strong five to a light six really to be honest but what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Japan droids thank you for watching forever [Music] you 
IGVvYilN48I,I have outed you I have outed you is not a music lover or a music enjoyer but a contrarian while I still prefer old music you has opened my eyes to many a music Thank You Gyo Gyo Gyo Gyo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review black breath sentenced to life this is a sophomore album whose album cover I could stare at all day visually this covers like a combination of black flags damaged and Anthrax's Fistful of metal but these guys definitely bring it in to over the top territory by bringing in a sledge hammer to get their point across now I first heard of these guys in 2009 on their debut EP razor to oblivion southern Lord Records released it and then and the EP was just a handful of songs that were a rough in raw fusion of hardcore punk and metal and around this time period southern Lords started picking up a lot of Punk and metal hybrids males all pigs must die track them the secret and black breath delivers this style with some extreme intensity now the band's full-length album that dropped in 2010 I wasn't totally into I felt like it lost a bit of personality that razor to oblivion had it was a little inconsistent in style too but it still had some great qualities the band definitely came through with thicker production this time around on out just relentless with these vocals that have become more fierce and buzzsaw guitar tones that really cut through your skull I still think it's an album that is a very nice stepping stone to what the band is doing on this new album sentenced to life on this LP just songs that are set to the speed of punk thrash riffs D beads come in every direction from the drums ferocious vocals tremolo picked death metal melodies and the occasional blast bein break down just to kind of add some variety to the album you know an LP that's this extreme can run into two issues one there's not enough change there's not enough variation all the songs end up sounding the same and it just becomes kind of boring another issue can be that it is too long and that issue becomes an even bigger issue when the first issue is an issue but black breath is able to keep things high-intensity high adrenaline while still adding some character to nearly every one of these songs just take the vocal break on the opening track feast of the Damned yes and the descending guitar lead on forced into possession feels like just being thrown into the pits of hell and I also love how the band can really kind of slow things down like on the track home of the grave or the really brooding dark intro on endless corpse but still keep things kind of interesting and while we're on the subject of endless corpse I love the syncopated drum hits that just fly in quickly to transition that track from this really kind of dark moody intro to just fast-paced and the song hits so hard the band plays so freakin fast really quick really accurate but far from robotic I love this on mother or piss off of this track too it starts off with this really fiery wailing guitar solo and it just feels like I am listening to a thrash metal song on steroids like I had grabbed a thrash metal album circa 1985 I've thrown it on the turntable crank the bass all the way up and then played it at 45 rpm now while there is a lot of just straight into the point aggression on this album there's quite a bit of detail to kind of like a spiked bat with a beautifully engraved handle there are a lot of layers to the madness on sentence to life it's just that the outside to this album is is that at first it comes off so overbearing it comes off so extreme all those details and the fact that these guys are blending so many musical ideas together in an interesting way does not become obvious until a few lessons in what does come off strong on this album is that these guys are a sheer force I feel like there are some tracks on here that could have used a little more detail to separate them from the rest like the song doomed and yeah admittedly this album is difficult to connect with on any other level than than vast spaces and pure aggression but it conjures those things so amazingly that I just have to give it up mmm kind of feeling a light eight to a decent eight on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana black breath 
yG0gp07o8fE,hi everyone Anthony Fant no here laughing like a d-bag the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question common thing this video is a response not formally not a response but a reaction to a video I saw in one of my favorite YouTube channels d dot respect run by a really cool dude but it actually was not his video it was a video made by another guy named North paw productions that got uploaded on his YouTube channel and he was talking about some stuff people limiting themselves to mainstream music and movies and television and culture and through that they're kind of squandering their freedom and not really thinking about what they're consuming entertainment wise yadda yadda yadda but I feel the problem he talks about is not really limited to people just going out to see a blockbuster or downloading some drake songs of iTunes for me the real issue is that music fans today in the Internet age during a time when you could explore any kind of music from any place from any artist or album people are still choosing to limit themselves period not just to mainstream music it happens in underground music - I see a big time in my comments people who get together in groups and they fight for and root for whatever albums are kind of big right now in their respective genres and they're like man god a lot of these same people will turn around and gripe when I review something they don't like I know it's not everybody doing this stuff but still in this day and age there's no excuse for that kind of crap are there some genres and artists that I'm not well versed in and does it show up in my reviews yes but how else am I going to learn and become semi knowledgeable if I don't try to listen and figure it out for myself because for me limiting yourself to a genre or two genres or even three genres of music is just about as ridiculous as limiting yourself to albums that only begin with the letter C I have preferences we all do and that's fine but I feel like somebody can only really be truly comfortable in those preferences unless they've explored their dislikes as much as they have their likes and I have to say there's a lot more to every genre than you think it's not just all the stereotypes that you hear people blurt out in passing without even really thinking about it and let me say through exploring my dislikes I have actually discovered that many of them were in fact likes but hidden under the disguise of a dislike I'm not trying to tell you what's good and bad all I can be honest about is how I feel about an album that's it how you feel you got to figure that out so explore explore explore explore everything explore music career opportunities alternative philosophies new places new people everything is at your fingertips right now when I was 14 all I had at my fingertips was Mortal Kombat you guys have a lot more even though finishing moves are really cool so take advantage of the morning go on Spotify hit up some classical works listen to some jazz blow your ears out learning the nuances of Noise music try some discos some Tuvan throat-singing and call me in the morning you've got my number mm-hmm love you exploration have a nice day for you [Music] [Music]

5dX5az_Sn2w,d like this do you like this you thanks haha I tricked you this is old music this music is all hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and review time Big KRIT live from the underground Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper who's been putting the south back on the map recently in terms of hip hop and not for bass heavy hooky club tunes or or trap rap but instead with a modernized version of the catchy soulful and poetic sounds with some of the best southern hip hop artists out there like outcast and goody mob and UGK Cray has kind of perfected his own sound inspired by these influences with three mixtapes he's released over the past few years he fills his lyrics with his personality and his passions like yes cars and girls but also family the trials and tribulations of making it his Southern heritage and poverty and Chris a producer as well always writing his own instrumental which has only made him sound even more unique in contemporary hip-hop and he's not afraid to sing on his tracks either and he does it well on top of all that big craze usually pretty meticulous when it comes to assembling an entire album you're not going to get a disjointed assembly of singles from this guy he's got his intimate tracks his party tracks as his conscious tracks his love songs and he makes sure to transition them all into one another in a very tasteful way really gives his releases the feel of a journey now this is big crits major label debut live from the underground and even though with this album he is sort of hitting it big obviously with the title he's still kind of looking to maintain his underdog image he still wants to be the Big KRIT that fans followed up until this point but this is a commercial record this is a major label debut all bets are off and change does come from a lot of directions on this album to start the production there are a lot of new additions on this album from the really glitchy effects in the female narrator that kind of starts the LP off the sound effects and the really short skits that kind of bring one track to another at some points there are horn sections on here guitar solos are Monica solo string sections and piano lots of guest singers and some chorus vocals too overall this album brings crit's usual mix of a very smooth melodic and soulful tracks and hard-hitting hyped up and jittery spicy southern hip hop tracks as well but with just a little more flow more sound and he definitely uses his label affiliation now to bring in some interesting guests Canadian R&B singer Melanie Fiona Anthony Hamilton another singer as well as blues legend BB King and some southern hip hop forefathers and influences as well on here like bun B and Ludacris which Big KRIT has collaborated with before 8ball & MJG - a lot of doors are open right now for Big KRIT with this LP and he's taking full advantage of them and even though this album by a longshot is not the first time he's ever brought a collaborator on to attract and something new add something different I'm not sure if every new sound on this album goes over all that well the track cool to be southern has these horn sections that feel okay they unfortunately don't really bring the thrill that you would expect from a horn section even as they are soloing underneath crit's verses and if i had to put my finger on a radio single for this LP it's got to be money on the floor and it's a really well produced track with some glistening sense and burbling bass lines however lyrically the song doesn't really add to much more than just a really tame strip club track none of the lyrics on this track really grabbed me outside of a 25 lighters references being very funny or very catchy or thought-provoking and as far as the handful of songs on here that have R&B singers on them go I just really do not care for a single R&B hook on this album and I have to kind of single out the Anthony Hamilton track I just did not care for his singing style on that song it kind of borders on like parody for me with him singing in this really kind of robust voice about coming home strong and that's another moment I didn't really care for now despite all of my complaints I do think Big KRIT writes some of his best songs ever on this album without question the album's first two singles I got this and yeah that's me are stellar both could have easily slipped into one of his past two tapes but feel completely re-energized new and fresh he's got these energetic chants this really hyped up flow and I love the really detail than just subtle vocal samples playing in the background of I got this that is the kind of layering that I expect from a Big KRIT instrumental really impressive stuff these two tracks are essentially just Big KRIT fight songs where you just cannot help but cheer him on the piano the vocal the strings and the song Rich Dad Poor Dad and the story is well are breathtaking quick basically talking about his father and relating his difficulties as a parent to the difficulties Big KRIT may face if he were to become one and from the marching snare drum to the really unique melody that leaves that track it is just a great great song I'm loving the live instrumentation on this track I wish more songs on here featured it if they were to be this powerful I love the song praying man which features BB King his voice on that track field so grainy and eerie I love the forlorn humming on the track it's just a really moody instrumental and Baker it gives this LP a really smooth finish with the last track with him singing quite a bit a lot like the song highs and lows from return of forever but with way more sounds harmonica and guitar soloing you know overall for me this is a relatively solid listen there are some moments on here that clearly move in a more commercial direction but not so far that they ruin the album really just kind of make it slightly underwhelming in some moments just kind of feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP I'm also feeling sweaty but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana live from the underground forever [Music] 
39G4QwnUOzw,do you like this it stinks do you like this it stinks do you like this it stinks do you like this you think do you like this it's day today hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review from a piece of music and album from an Icelandic band whose name and album title I'm totally going to mispronounce like an American cigars Saguna no cigarettes felt re like I said these guys are from Iceland they're a quartet and one of the most highly regarded names in the world of post-rock and in almost 20 years these guys have been around they've played some of the prettiest and most uplifting music in this style and what helps make that happen are the band's boyish vocals they're really bright harmonious layers of droning guitars moving strings powerful swells very spacious drumbeats propelling the songs towards cinematic finishes and on this new LP Val tardy Seguros definitely keeps up a lot of its trademark sounds now this is definitely not a favorite of mine in the band's catalogue but it is a significant record for several reasons it comes after hiatus also a surprisingly poppy solo record from the group's frontman yangtze and it also follows the release of what is said to be this band's most accessible album with a buzz in our ears we play endlessly which is an album that contained a lot of tracks that abandon the really slow moving and long winding song structures that have made some of this band's past efforts their most popular past efforts so great now I wouldn't say this album completely gets rid of that style it's not like one of the biggest changes of band has undergone and I would say the same for vault re which I think in a way is comparable to the band's parenthetically titled third album and the only reason I compare the two is because that album to me is the closest this band has come to making an ambient music record unless you for some reason count this as a cigarette or something like that but what I'm trying to say is if Valtteri is moving the band in any direction in ambient direction is what it is on this L port on this LP Seguros is sounding much more syrupy formless with lots of repetitive piano chords some haunting chorus vocals and very powerful strings the band goes about creating tracks that feel as endless as possible Trek tracks that really reach out into the horizon where they blur beyond the sight of the human eye it's kind of like being out in the middle of the ocean and I mean in the middle of the ocean miles away from everything on a gray day where the sky is just a perfect layer of gray while the thought of the sight of that can be kind of repetitive kind of monotonous lacking in bold variation it's still so vast and so massive to the point where it cannot really completely be comprehended even with the human eyes staring directly at it but there are some things about this album that I think are going to turn longtime fans off for one this album is not as triumphant as past efforts not as grandiose and when Ciro's does kind of go for something like that like the third track on here which is the loudest on here and has the biggest climax it doesn't feel all that developed despite the very pretty sounds I actually prefer it when these guys head down the road of a track like the second on here the first single from this album which is a song featuring this deep beautiful wall of fluttering strings and yawns ease vocals on this track are great they don't really lead the song not a songwriting or ballad kind of sense they're just there to add another texture but they feel so young they feel so close they feel so intimate as far as other highlights go the fifth track on here transitions flawlessly into the sixth which has these kind of eerily beautiful vocals on them that are chopped and looped for a pretty haunting effect and the final song on here is easily my favorite it a very somber piano piece very subtle instrumentation in the background a very slow pace lots of room in between the notes and despite being one of the quietest moments on this album it is strikingly beautiful and it kind of made me realize that even though a lot of the songs on this album are pretty and I like them very few of them actually touch me in an emotional way none of them really pack the power of this last track I think and I think it's mostly because they're so heavy they're so layered they're so thick with no one thing popping out of them in a really obvious way which i think is a cool dynamic but maybe not what I want to hear throughout an entire album but on this last track the piano is really the star of the show and because of that it feels so lonely it feels so sad it's a real tearjerker and a great finish to the album like I said I wish there was a bit more variety on this album in terms of how these guys executed these ambient pieces and as far as an album from Seguros goes this thing is a little short of breath I think though I do like this LP I don't love it I think there is the possibility for a lot of gold in a strictly ambient album from this band but Valtteri kind of sounds like these guys are just starting to dig for it kind of feeling the light 7on thus album what did you guys think of it have you heard it did you like it did you hate it why what should i review next and yeah that's it so good rows pronouncing things felt re pronouncing things album reviews iceland bro [Music] 
WSmr798qF3U,it's track review hey Anthony Fantana here the Internet's sweatiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rapaho um is of the independent persuasion the track that I'm going to be talking about in this review is from a new duo by the name of oxygen they are dropping a brand new debut EP on Jack Jack you are later this year in July July 24th it's tight tight titled take the kids off Broadway Fox's j'en is basically the songwriting duo of Sam France and Jonathan Reed oh and the multi-talented Richard Swift actually mixed quite a few tracks off of their forthcoming EP if you're into him you should also check these guys out vice versa because they do have some similarities in their styles now the first track the label jag Jaguar has thrown out there from this EP is make it known and it was really love at first listen being serious first listen listen to it first time love all the influences in forming this track were just so familiar and have hit it big with me in the past these guys definitely have in art rock and art pop and experimental rock sensibility like The Velvet Underground but their production on this EP despite the fact that it's a little lo-fi it's a little muddy is very refined and detailed and at some points a bit overblown in a really fun kind of bombed bombastic way like a kinks record but there's also that kind of Rolling Stones bravado that Mick Jagger swagger and I'm sure you could also liken some of the music on this EP to Neil Diamond you know just some singer-songwriter music that is very dramatic and nicely arranged these guys II these guys really load on the instrumentation from piano to organ and synthesizer to horns truly wacky and kooky background vocals that range from being coral and and tonal and very beautiful to just noisy and then weird some drum machine some handclaps as well as guitar drums bass all the usual suspects and like I said the production here it's a little muddy it's a little low fine has a very kind of vintage quality to it if you know this was not being released this year I would have assumed this had come from the 60s which is not surprising considering Richard Swift was in on the mixing process of this EP he too has an ear for recreating old style recordings now what's nice about this track lots of change lots of variation the song opens up with these really moody keyboards and this kind of seedy vocal melody that has this splash of reverb on it that really reminds me of like a doors record some upbeat drums start popping in and the song really begins to rock and the vocal delivery builds up with the extra instrumentation really starts delivering vocals and in a very Mick Jagger type style the lyrics play this very confessional role about one's father the hook eventually comes up and just explodes really dramatic really nice stuff the track goes back into a verse but these guys start changing the instrumentation up a little bit adding more detail so the song does not feel the same as it did in the beginning but I especially love is toward the end of the track the band takes the hook that pops up in the middle they revamp the lyrics they change the instrumentation and for the final bow they throw in lots of horns and it turns kind of jazzy it really feels like a stage show like the Rockettes are dancing out in front of everybody and kicking their legs in unison as the song comes to a close in a way these guys really remind me of Ariel pink in that they're taking all of these older sounds and mutating them into something that's just really weird but also accessible so between the messy yet detailed and very interesting production the catchy song writing the fun melodies the nice references to rock and roll's biggest names and the new youthful and weird energy that they're putting into the sounds that influence them this track is just fantastic I love it so take a listen to it let me know what you think did you guys enjoy it did you hate it and yeah why let me know phox phox oxygen hoping to review this EP when it finally drops forever fox again 
q8ZPYD3rYJc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd now doing a question comment thing a bit of a hip hop drama occurred this week and I am NOT talking about the Pusha T Drake little Lane thing what was interesting is when Lupe Fiasco dropped a new track titled around my way and when the track first hit me I thought it was a pretty refreshing departure from what Lupe was doing on his last album and for me it was kind of nice hearing Lupe Fiasco bring his usual politically charged lyrics over a classy horn phrase some really crisp drums and paired them both with a pretty nice hook but there was an issue with the track with the instrumental Lupe Fiasco always having instrumental trouble the beat on this Lupe track is pretty much a modernized version of the Pete Rock and CL Smooth track they reminisce over you now Pete Rock heard this Lupe Fiasco track and then he took to Twitter he called the song wack not only does this Lupe track revamp the Troy instrumental in a pretty unimaginative way but like Pete Rock says the track Troy has very personal significance to him a tribute to an old friend who passed away but what I'm here to say is that I really don't see what the issue is here outside of any possible legal problems that could have come from this because there was some stipulation originally as to whether or not Lupe actually had permission to do this track with this instrumental all that BS aside this is how music moves everybody we're all constantly recontextualizing things we hear and love just like Pete Rock did when he sampled that Tom Scott song today for the song Troy off of that album the honeysuckle breeze did Pete Rock sample TomSka in a much more interesting way than Lupe Fiasco's sampled Pete Rock yes but Lupe Fiasco was a new young rapper he is not only detached from the rap scene that Pete Rock originates from in terms of decade and location but loop 8 really has nothing personal that attaches him to the emotions of that song - just like you and me if Lupe listens to that Pete Rock and CL Smooth track he's a voyeur he's looking into the minds of Pete Rock and CL Smooth at that point in time when they were making that song and feeling those emotions we're hearing the story secondhand and it couldn't possibly affect us as just visitors to this story as much as it does them the creators so because of that it's impossible impossible to expect total and complete sanctity going into the future when it comes to classics like this track and it brings up the question does the new generation respect the art and the expressions of the past generation and I would say yes but the thing is this new generation is going to define respect by its own terms they're going to pick the parts of the past they like they're gonna forget the ones that they don't and they're going to reinterpret a lot of parts of it for themselves as well so now mirroring their influences they're sampling what has influenced them making the first generation of hip-hop artists sampling victims of the second haha and this stuff happens all the time it happens when Lupe did this song it happens when Danny Brown says Ryan so real thought I wrote it in POC blood it happens when he mum - racist says I'm at the pizza I'm at the Taco Bell the combination made my eyes bleed and the numerous lyrical references to it was do I think all of these references are respectful do I think all of these samples all of these revamps and visions are tasteful no but these artists are reliving what has put them on the path that they're on today and you have to let them do that they're doing it the way they want to do it even if sometimes it's not that good the first generation of hip-hop artists had to step on a lot of toes to pioneer and do what they did they made music the way they wanted to make it back when sampling was perceived as ridiculous and bad business in the music industry and they did it whether it made their influences happy or not do you think every single jazz or soul or funk artist that got sampled by a hip-hop artists in the 80s and 90s was happy about it there's gonna be both good and bad samples and revisions going into the future and let's just concentrate on praising the good and forgetting the bad so what did you guys think of this whole for a lack of a better word fiasco is this just the natural process of doing things or are there legitimate reasons for anger let me know thank you for watching Anthony Fantana sampling future next generation classics and the past forever 
uQEaJknSSXI,you cannot hate all-new music that makes no sense look here's a bunch of new music I found on the floor hi everyone my needle drops the Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music and it's time our LP cancer 4 cure LP is a producer and rapper and CEO of definitive Jux records he got his rap career started in the 90s as a member of the hip-hop outfit company Flo they released a very fondly looked back upon album by the name of fun crusher plus and took a pretty experimental and and sometimes dark angle to boom-bap style hip hop and then he did what is probably his most celebrated achievement ever producing the instrumentals for the cannibal ox record the coal vein which even after ten years of it being released has stood up as one of the most significant modern underground hip hop albums from producing that LP moved on to his debut album really kind of came into his own started making his instrumentals even more eccentric and building on his experience and company flow to make his rapping much more forceful lyrically dense and highly referential since the release of that debut LP LP has experimented with jazz released tons of b-sides and instrumentals put out a second full-length album where he built upon the sounds on his debut LP and he has now been embracing this new generation of experimental hip-hop artists out of New York as well collaborating with dass racist and mr. motherfuckin ex choir 2 and most recently he produced that badass new killer Mike record that I love the hell out of now this is lp's third album cancer 4 cure it's been years since he has released a full-length rap album but cancer 4 cure continues the sound of that album as if that gap wasn't even there this album has a slightly more alike tronic feel which comes out in full force right from the get-go on the opening track the song request denied features this break beat rhythm that totally has this prodigy smack my bitch up kind of vibe to it but the song is more of a show of production strength for me with tons of pulsating sense and organ solo and some pretty nice drum fills too now the LP that I'm actually looking for comes through hard on the second track the full retard bangin beat bomb squad noisy like version 2.0 SiC groove Fett synthesizers really grainy drums and a catchy vocal sample all make this instrumental awesome LP comes in thrown out versus bragging about his emceeing skills and he proves them with really dense tense verses referencing everything from zombie creating viruses to Greek mythology and throwing some really great rhymes at the end of every line and doing tons of internal whines they're more strong very muscular tracks like that drones over Brooklyn true story the Danny Brown and mr. motherfuckin ex choir featured track oh hell no there are a lot of high points on this album but I feel like there are some let downs to a big gripe for me on this album the hooks for example the track from my upstairs neighbor if you kill him I won't tell I just cringe a little bit every time I hear him repeat that melody and just that that lyric it just breaks the momentum of what would otherwise be a pretty intense topical song dealing in your upstairs neighbor murder and not snitching on that person sadly I was not into the hook on the song tougher colder killer either with killer Mike and despot the chorus on this thing is so long and fits over the groove so awkwardly it's one of the bulkiest choruses I've ever heard the only hooks with melodic choruses that I think go over well on this album are the ones that feature guests singers like Paul banks from Interpol Pernik diamonds of the band Islands with the song stayed down which actually has a great melody on the course it's a long melody but does not lose direction and resolves really nicely at the end of the chorus so I'm now following LP on some of these courses and I haven't even tougher time following him on some of the more conceptual tracks the song that jig is up is definitely one of the most awkward interrogation sessions where LP seems to be kind of prying into this woman's mind trying to find out why she's romantically interested in him it must be because of some other kind of subversive reason and the song sign here is kind of a continuation of that track and is just really painful I imagine for the person sitting through what's being rapped about in the track and just for me listening the last track on here a lot like the intro has a lot of production ambition lots of colors lots of sense really heartbeat tried and true chord progression a nice driving baseline however the song doesn't really have a lot of momentum to me it doesn't have a lot of viscera a lot like the ending of the song drones over Brooklyn where you kind of have these heavy drum hits and it seems like it's supposed to be really powerful and dramatic and heavy but it doesn't really end up being that way you know on this new album LP is definitely as wordy as ever definitely layering his production a little bit more than usual incorporating new elements and some really nice vocal guests too none of which who I think room in this album or take away from it in any way however it's not like this album isn't without its potholes for me on this album LP sort of comes off like an actor who only delivers one single emotional response in a myriad of different situations so for the most part the production on this thing is great the verses are are very much worth reading into and most of the time LP does stick to what he's great at on this album I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this thing what did you guys think of it if you gave it a listen I'm sure a lot of you did did you love it did you hate it one of your favorite hip hop albums of the year so far or maybe not let me know Anthony Fantana LP how nice day forever [Music] 
V4RJ0eOZiXE,no good music is bad it is not good to hear new music is good bye bye hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a tour sampler CD our compilation thing from cert say these guys are a Boston band a five-piece I believe this is the first time I'm being exposed to their music to new original songs as well as three tracks that are rerecorded that originally appeared on a split that they did with the bandolier that came out earlier this year and these guys as far as I know have not been kicking around as as certs say that is all that long I mean they came out with what I think is their debut EP just at the end of last year they've got a great recording to their music they have a nice blend of different extreme music styles some tight performances and tons of energy charisma if you wanted to boil this collection of songs down you could call it punk music but these guys blend it with so many other forms of extreme music there are all sorts of pummeling guitar riffs flying in left and right but they are usually matched with some pretty fast drumming and often it's not like the guitars are just throwing a riff out there or anything like that they usually have a very kind of dissonant quality to them sometimes will feature shots of feedback in the background or will have a very minor or dark harmony to them which to me is is so much of a post hardcore vibe and the guitars are not thin overly distorted or brittle they're very thick they're very punchy the drums change up a lot through these tracks just like the songs themselves very sporadic extremely fast rolls and fills will switch from a bb2 a bunch of riff syncopated cymbal hits for sure certs a just packs a lot of detailing some extremely short songs the longest track on here is 2 minutes and 18 seconds but they are not afraid to cut things down to just about 34 seconds and in that 34 seconds you will get a lot of momentum a lot of adrenaline and just a lot of catharsis out of this one well-crafted punch the track di D comes to mind which starts off with a pretty nice blast beat some feedback then it just gives away to some grinding guitar riffs and then it breaks down to this extremely heavy riff and these screeching vocals from the band's front woman there's definitely not any sort of guttural or lower testosterone-fueled quality to the vocals or the aggression on this album instead the vocals in this band bring this this ultra feminine high-pitched ear shredding voice that is unquestionably overpowering just nothing but just black skies and broken windshields and gnash teeth and sour milk and the lyrics really gripped me from time to time to like on the opening track or the finishing line on this sampler with the line about the poison apple and fairest overall and not completely satisfied with this EP at times I do feel like the vocals can get a little overdramatic maybe the band is in somewhat of a fetal stage and hasn't really reached that full peak of oh man this is their style hell nine line however the fact that this band blends all these Styles really well performs well has a great recording and a fantastic vocalist all of that makes these songs to me feel pretty fresh like I said not the most satisfying thing in the world but that partially has to do with this thing being so short I just wanted more but really was the band trying to do that with this thing it's really just a compilation of some tracks to hold the fans over until they put out something new Susu Susu it's great a new band to kind of be excited about feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing what did you guys think of it if you gave it a listen let me know love you Anthony Fantino certs a toured sampler of CDR thing forever 
60d5MYBMAns,I don't like new music new music is bad it is not good to listen to all music is better old music is good hey shut it up shut it up you oh man it's late because this mount jiri album has been keeping me up hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd tired but passionate still and ready to do an album review Mount Erie clear moon mount Erie is the self recording project of singer-songwriter Phil elrom who once recorded under the name the microphones and put out some of his best material under that moniker the globe part 2 the mount Erie album itself before he went on to change the name of his project and it was hot we stayed in water but under the Mount Erie name to fill has been putting out some fantastic music whether Phil is singing side by side with one of his musical influences Jew lead Warren on the lost wisdom album or if he's embarking on some directionless abstract bare raw acoustic songwriting on the album dawn right there a series of tracks he wrote while in isolation in a cabin in Norway during a winter from 2002 to 2003 whether he's doing what are doing the other he's captivating me I even followed him on his black opening EP where he was laudanum his songs with sounds from the world of hardcore punk and he got even louder on one of his last full-length albums winds pomor he was incorporating elements of black metal into his music over the years i mean phil has just become one of my favorite songwriters however it's really difficult for me to justify that to other people because he does not go by the same rules as most singer-songwriters he doesn't shoot for the same goals he doesn't try to make the same accomplishments which can be a blessing and a curse his music is just undeniably unique but what might bother some people is that sometimes his songs are extremely long or drawn-out sometimes they're very short and have abrupt endings that come out of nowhere rarely do they ever adhere to a verse chorus verse structure and lyrically most of Phil's songs are obsessed with things like death life nature like literally nature like getting down to the specifics of of rocks and streams and wind and trees and mountains fog and oceans as well showcasing this very deep emotional and and almost spiritual connection that phil has with these things some - some - sometimes talking about these things so compulsively it feels as if phil is inventing his own kind of world where these things exist outside of the rest of modern society and when film mentions these things or this other world where these things exist he does not talk about how they inspire him emotionally in a very explicit way or anything like that he keeps his lyrics very obtuse he does this so consistently that his music seems like this intentional challenge to the listener to get some kind of deeper meaning out of what he's saying and follow him down this dark wooded path into this forest like abyss and then just get stuck in this other world like like he is and what makes Mount Erie even more unique is just phil el room's production style the way he records mixes and just produces his music he loves panning the acoustic guitars left and right wildly he also mixes his very shy voice notoriously low especially when the instrumentation surrounding the vocals is getting loud and for the most part instrumentally filled deals in a lot of soft and acoustic sounds but they still manage to have a very kind of rugged quality to them but when Mount Airy does manage to put out a piece of music that is loud and is distorted and is abrasive it is going to be one of the most rough tumbles you've ever had with music period which brings me to this new not Irie LP clear moon fill al-rahman this album goes for roughly the same experience that you will get with just about any Mount URI album but approaches it from a different direction and what that overall feel of this album is that I feel nearly every Mount URI album shares is just that feeling of water tutoring with no real direction or purpose into a forest on a moonlit night this music just has a real sense of isolation and distance from the usual everyday lives that most of us live and that is spelled out perfectly with the opening track which has these really raw acoustic guitars being strummed very hypnotically playing these beautifully embellished chords some soft drums very deep bass jeroni keyboards it's a slow-growing ballad with the instrumentation getting more dramatic toward the end of the song especially with these clanging bells toward the end of the track that are a really nice touch the next track down here is even more beautifully produced the place lives where it sounds like Phil did about 12 or so takes of him strumming these guitar chords and then layered them over one another through some effects on a minute ended up sounding kind of like a guitar Orchestra like this wall of chords that really don't even resemble guitars anymore there's distorted guitar on the track with shots of feedback coming in here and there but that guitar is mixed quietly in the mix as well as the drums - and over that some very light airy keyboards just another example of how weird the mixing can be on a Mount Erie album the track house shape has a very repetitive quality to it especially with the drumming and in a way kind of feels like krautrock a little bit and I love how the since they're just kind of like a rollercoaster going up and down in volume so fast and it just makes this track feel so hypnotic the track over dark water has this really nasty distorted rumbling set of guitars bass as well and it is just a rough sandpaper rough but that kind of fades away a little bit and gives weight to these vocals both Phil's vocals and some female vocals as well later - over one another in this just beautiful chorus that is almost gospel like it is a religious experience just around the middle point of this album the title track on here is a vocally fronted drone Odyssey that lasts seven minutes the longest track on this album 50 Phil actually Auto Tunes his own background vocals and layers them with some untreated lead vocals in a pretty bony ver kind of way overall with clear moon Phil elrom manages to change things up do something slightly new for longtime fans but still keeps his style very potent very experimental and enchantingly strange for newcomers there are some surprising moments on here like the sinister saxophones toward the end of the track lone Belle but the biggest change on this album is the overall tone and the use of synthesizers in comparison with winds poem which really was a storm this is way more serene I think this is the most serene album Phil has dropped under the name mount Erie so far and it's all because of the sense it's come to fruition because of the sins which come in and thicken a lot of these tracks up to the point where they pretty much are drones I mean this album even ends with a three-minute long since piece that kind of burns things out like a dying candle nearly every track on here has a drone equality to it whether it starts as a drone or it progressively grows into one toward the tracks end as far as gripes go there are some songs on here like lone Bell that I wish had a little bit more detail to them especially with the horn phrase toward the end getting a little repetitive just a little over long and in comparison with winds poem and and then other Mount Airy albums as well this album is definitely not that urgent or that gripping I don't see myself putting it on as often as other Mount Erie LPS though it is really beautiful for I see people who are more attracted to drone and ambient music gravitating toward this I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this LP thought it was great but uh what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana thank you for watching Mount Erie clear moon [Music] 
bQ04LrK4epI,do you have a drinking problem it's worth that I bought hi everyone Anthony Santana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review best coast the only place best coast is a California indie rock and pop band duo sort of right now project fronted by singer-songwriter Bethany Cosentino in 2010 when Best Coast dropped its debut LP crazy for you the band rose to the top of the mound of all these other groups chasing after this certain sound this summery fuzzy upbeat vintage girl group and garage rock inspired sound now my first impressions of crazy for you was that it was very light it was sweet it was fun had a couple really great singles but the more I listened to it the more tired I grew of it and and and this album just makes me think you know there are reasons we have terms or phrases lying around like bubblegum pop it's quick it's easy its sugary it picks you up fast puts a little bit of a pep in your step no consequences no requirements you just chew it and then you chew it and when it loses its flavor you just spit it out but with this new LP it does not feel like a fresh stick of gum this album to me feels like that same old piece of gum that I spat out in 2010 and now for some reason I don't know why I've decided to pull the gum out of the gum wrapper that I rolled it in after I was done with it and just start chewing it all over again this album definitely is a lot less fuzzy grainy or lo-fi there is less of a rock attitude on this album and Best Coast kind of settles into a much more paced spotless and and out delivery the overall sound is clearer the guitars have more Sheen than they do Distortion there are more vocal melodies that are track where I think I'm picking up vibraphone like a vibraphone solo there's another track where I'm picking up some string arrangements but to me this album doesn't feel like more I mean I'm hearing more sounds but energy less charm less to the point where this album feels like an act it's like a compilation of best coast covers performed by the cast of Glee of course on this album the lyrics aren't really doing much for me I would actually say they're doing less for me on this LP I feel like Bethany this time around is even less afraid of saying something that may or may not sound corny the opening track on here lyrically sounds like a commercial for removing or vacationing in California with with the Sun in your eyes and in your teeth we have fun we have fun and then there are a lot of tracks on here that are basically non specific references to interpersonal problems with friends family members love interests and Bethany kind of talks about her personal life a little bit too since kind of hitting it big with the debut best coast album talking about kicking habits like drinking out the door I am picking up significantly less pot references on this album references to spending money and people coming and going in and out of your life I'm sure all of this stuff has a lot of personal significance and importance to Bethany I mean it should it's her life you know but the way she tells it and the way she describes it to an outsider to somebody who's not living her life it just feels really mundane I think it's nice that Bethany can find so much inspiration in the little everyday things friends family phone calls nature but as a lyricist she doesn't really say any about any of these things that makes them feel all that captivating to me and yeah there are reasons that best coast sounds the way that it does I have no assumptions going that this album doesn't sound the way it's supposed to even right down to the simplicity of the lyrics which mirrors that vintage girl group sound that inspires Bethenny's music so much but I still have to acknowledge that best coats does not make music that appeals to me on any level and that's it I mean I'm kind of feeling a little strong to to a light three on this album not in the light three feeling light three on this just not into it at all what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it and if you did why what should i review next and thanks for watching stay positive or try anthony Fantana best coast the only place forever [Music] [Music] 
bfeusyA-J5k,the internet the Internet in my hand I've got the Internet cow has a drinking problem hi everyone Anthony Phan 10 the tan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review dope body Natural History dope body is a rock quartet from Maryland and if I'm not mistaken this is their third full-length LP and first for the legendary underground record label Drag City records now Drag City has a very long-standing history of fronting for some pretty experimental bands in the worlds of rock and folk music as well and dope body is no different so let me try to describe their latest LP as kind of a hole to me natural history has an even blend of sounds from the worlds of hardcore punk sludge metal noise rock as well and post hardcore but the album doesn't really have the brooding and intense and just angry attitude that sometimes is tagged on with those genres because blended with these very intense styles of music is this upbeat fun-loving party rock attitude that that comes with a song like Twisted Sisters basically shining through all the aggression on this album are some really nice dance grooves and a little bit of cowbell and some really staccato quirky guitar leads it's just they take all these abrasive sounds and execute them with the most primal simplicity imaginable but then still end up making this album feel like a celebration these guys will put out a track on this album like the song beat which is slow in heavy and lumbering crashing riffs drums and guitars syncopated every hit feels like a ball-peen hammer on the top of your skull but then they'll kind of turn around and do a track like twice the life which has these bouncy guitars with this really bright sheen on them that makes me feel like I'm listening to some calypso music some kind of tropical island punk rock to go further into this good mood kind of feel that this album has the song weird mirror has this chord progression and wailing guitars over the chorus chords that I feel like I've heard somewhere else and some kind of classic rock song something that makes me go whoo yeah yeah well and the song the head of my mind has these very sludgy heavy riffs but they're surrounded in these very newly bouncy kind of silly harmonized guitar leads it's kind of like seeing the the darkest most brutal metal band you can imagine in your head this visual playing in front of you but then mid set all these balloons and and this multicolored confetti just comes raining down onto the crowd and someone appropriate do you know what I'm getting at I mean yeah this album is rough it's tough it tumbles but it still ends up kind of feeling like maybe maybe the most fun exciting sweaty take your shirt off basement rock show you've been to in a while and then afterwards everybody goes outside and starts lighting a bonfire and then dancing around it in unison and some kind of underground rock pagan ritual and every track out here is fronted with these vocals man these vocals it's like a cross between listening to Andrew W K and a cave man the vocals on this thing scream and they grown and they bellow and they go but not in anger my friends not in anger out of liberation instead I would say it's centric it's a rock monstrosity it's a rock-and-roll mutant it feels very modern in that it takes ideas from so many styles and blends them to the point where it's difficult to tell where one ends and another begins the this is made even more difficult because the band really does have a strong personality that permeates every single track but despite this modernist don't body manages to just tune into a wavelength a very primordial wavelength now even though nobody does progress across Natural History with a good amount of variety nearly every track on here functions on a basic principle find a groove that's gonna make people move and then hit it in the weirdest way possible like the song Road Dogg which has these sliding guitar noises all over the track just emphasizing the rhythm as well as in the song powder which has these guitar sounds and then they could be harmonics it could just be a weird effect that bounces throughout the track dance grooves on this record are so herky-jerky and just contorting in ways I didn't think dance music usually did if you would even go as far as to call this album that and there's some great interplay on this record too I mean on these songs it really sounds like the band is playing live they're really rocking out together and there's an indescribable energy to that on the track out of my mind toward the end these guys are really hitting it hard on the climax of the song tendineae neighbor and the track lazy slave when that ends the band is played together just so tightly and building the song into this mountain of drum fills and guitar noises and shrieking vocals the production on this LP is pretty good it pretty much just gets the job done it does have a nice heaviness to it so that when the band does do something slow and just lumbering there is that beef there is that pump to kind of really bring the track home there is also a smidge a smidge of reverb on a lot of the sounds here which doesn't drown anything out it's just an extra sound but when the band really starts jam and hard it allows everything to kind of bleed into one another very subtly the production on this thing is pretty basic but I would argue it doesn't really need to be much more than what it is because dope bodies vocals their grooves their songs and their guitar riffs don't really need any window dressing because they are so eccentric and strange to begin with as far as issues on the self ego you know I didn't really care for the first track all that much it is slow it is heavy and it does have some very interesting chimes kind of just twinkling away but the noisy guitars making these indescribable sounds at this very slow pace as well as the very lethargic vocals it just didn't do too much for me it just felt a bit directionless dragged on and the track just kind of fades out in a very underwhelming way before I really feel like it did much of anything to make it all that memorable other than start the album I guess the cellphone is just fantastic it's just fun it's just fun to me it's just freakin fun it's fine I just want to put it on and go kind of feeling a strong e2a like 9:00 on this album damn it's good but what do you guys think of it have you heard it if so did you love it did you hate it why and what should I take the time to review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana dope body 
iskjEgwj4uQ,Oh whee hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest ignored my needle drops it's time for a question statement comment thing hipster you know the word i know the word and i've received a few passionate comments asking me what I think about the word itself its usage and the culture of people it describes now even though the term hipster describes something very specific even a counterculture of people that dates back to the 1940s that actually philosophically has a lot in common with the modern hipster these days I would say the term is used pretty liberally even though you can use a quick google search and find an encyclopedic definition of the modern hipster with bullet points talking about a huge emphasis on authenticity a carefree attitude or lifestyle and a certain kind of fashion and love of underground music but your average person using the word hipster is not going back to one of these dictionary definitions to double-check what exactly it means before they use the word instead when I hear somebody say the word hipster to me to someone else whether it's online or in person it's an insult it's a cultural slur and I feel a bit bad for the kind of person that uses that word in this way because the sentiments behind a usage like that is usually pretty nasty and in most cases when somebody uses the word hipster maliciously it's 2d legitimize the said hipsters preferences and clothing music or lifestyle making fun of somebody and putting a label on them just for liking a certain kind of music in a in a very malicious way is kind of stupid to me especially since when you do some light research it's it's very easy to find information showing that someone's preferences in music has so much to do with their race their age where they come from their gender their genetic makeup in general and on someone's taste with a one-size-fits-all label to me usually says more about the insult her than it does the person who's being insulted because usually the word hipster is thrown as an insult at someone who is enjoying something the insult er can't appreciate understand or derive joy from and the greatest irony in the use of the word hipster and hipsters love irony the usage of the word hipster especially in a negative light is limited mostly to people who would most likely be considered hipsters by those who thrive more off of a mainstream culture meaning that what is a hipster is relative everybody including you is somebody else's hipster and you know when you insult somebody for thriving within the same web of underground culture that you do you're just kind of where you eat and that's not a good thing you're making things a lot more negative you're alienating people you're just kind of being a jerk moral of the story don't try and trick yourself into thinking that you can just label somebody as a punk a metalhead hippie a hipster whatever and then just cast what they value aside as being worthless you may have had a bad experience with a metal snob or a hip-hop or some shallow hipster but it doesn't mean everyone in that subculture is like that come on don't be stupid and that's it I'm sure many of you have used the word hipster negatively before and believe me it's okay the world is not going to end everything's cool let's just learn from this it's now the time for healing let's realize the real deal be ourselves and concentrate on just being the best people we can be sound cool to you sounds cool to me have a nice day Anthony Fantana the needle drop hipsters forever 
E3kvrf4mO4g,now you order some manners oh I look tired it's been a rough week my needle drops it's been a rough week time for a review LP and killer Mike rap music killer Mike is a Georgia rapper Outkast cohort and he's been putting out albums and getting some nice feature tracks for well over 10 years now he even actually put out an LP last year that I regret not reviewing titled pledge mike is such a forceful rapper he doesn't have a really intricate flow for the most part or anything like that he's very much to the point Mike is great with topical songs not only great with topical songs and painting pictures but he's one of the few rappers that I know who can just switch gears so easily without grinding the clutch from a track that is just conspiracy-theory laden just distrusting of the government distrusting of society to a love song or a song about chasing your dreams and then back to a song about some hardcore gangsta rap rhymes another great thing about Mike is that he's got a lot of charisma and for a guy like that I imagine it's easy to network because he has made some really great connections with some of the biggest acts in hip hop in the south from Ti to bun b 3 6 mafia paul wall gucci mane as well but his connections very obviously reach outside rappers with a southern style because because this new project is an album length collaboration with hip hop experimentalist rapper and producer LP best known for his solo work is her ship accompany flow and his beats for the project cannibal ox LP has been really successful in the underground just like mike has for sure these guys are both very aggressive and very visceral artists just looking to make music that grabs the listener shakes them and just warrants some kind of very fast and adrenaline pumped reaction but they both got their different ways of going about that mic NLP do make some notable changes but the biggest surprise on this thing is how natural this collaboration feels it was just a match made and you know for the most part on this LP Mike is himself maybe there are a few more stories and there are brags on this album but this thing is still a pretty even mix of not only hardcore and gangsta style Rhymes but some very socio-political and personal tracks on here as well even when Mike is doing something very aggressive and action-packed like on the track don't die where he's sort of on the run from the police and bullets are flying by his head he will drop some personal information like how his father is a cop now not only is Mike making some minor concessions but LP is too because some songs on this album as far as production goes have a very southern style to them with the clickety and clackety trap style snares and hi-hats like I'm don't die big beast southern-fried a few other moments too Mike brings an entirely different brand of aggression to lp's hard-hitting beats the track big beast paints the Atlanta landscape where he's located with gunshots cocaine wolves grimy streets and bun B&T I dropped by to kind of put together the lyrical puzzle the track untitled has Mike showing this this fear of death being singled out and killed for rapping about what he raps it out and leaving his wife a widow whether he's rapping about his their roots or telling a story about a guy doing some airport drug trafficking Mike is always tough as nails sometimes he's busting at the government with conspiracy theory specifically the Reagan administration but kind of fast forwards to the Obama administration and just kind of sees them as a the puppet for a corrupt government it's not the first time stuff like this has been wrapped about obviously sometimes I wish Mike was a little bit more original with the story brought a different perspective to it but I will say he is a bit more grim than most when it comes to talking about this stuff and the title track the final track on this album which which is amazing is this hard-hitting and personal painting of what rap music is to killer Mike to make a long story short the genre is basically Mike's religion and he raps like it which is what makes him such a captivating emcee throughout this album now as far as LP goes his instrumentals on this album just bring Mike's style a completely different dynamic a different angle for the most part LP has built a reputation on his production as having a nice combination of not only hard-hitting sounds but kind of kooky sounds to which is portrayed perfectly on the track big beast we're matched up against these huge base hits and in southern style rhythms are these kind of silly and and farty synthesized hurts it's gritty but it's also kind of cartoony it's it's kind of like reading a hardcore hip-hop comic book or maybe better yet a graphic novel and as if it wasn't already a surprised LP showcases some really great versatility on this album - whether he is putting together a short and just straight to the face banger on the track go which has the skipping vocal samples the track don't die explodes and just bangs even on a higher level and makes my story about just being on the run from the cops feel kind of like an action movie and that tranquilly Berkshire would that I mentioned earlier the instrumental on that just hits the perfect sad chord that the lyrics do I mean there's just a range of emotions that are approached on this album successfully tastefully without any major hitches as far as issues go on this album for me there are some pretty hooks for me on this LP starting with the song ghetto gospel I just do not like how the chorus transitions to the verse on that track it just feels kind of awkward for me and just slightly out of place just rubs me the wrong way and even though the instrumental and the verses on the track butane are pretty hard-hitting the hook on that track really underwhelmed me and the song anywhere but here right after that track has this guest vocalist on it and she to me just does not have that powerful or passion or charismatic of a voice and I feel like she's slightly off pitch but still those those are my negatives and the positives far outweigh these negatives far outweigh these negatives on on rap music for sure like I said this album is very tough it's very hard-hitting it's like chewing on a burnt steak kind of feeling a decent too strong ate on this LP I mean it's just a really solid listen a great hip-hop album one of my favorites of this year push Oh what did you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and that's about it Anthony Fantana LP killer Mike rapped music oh forever [Music] 
zxs4h0ABJMI,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review a real-life actual review not Chokin marilyn manson born villain this is the latest LP from the band / songwriter / singer frontman musician Brian Warner and a lot of people may look at this review and ask Anthony why do you even bother you don't usually cover music like this you are someone who has a huge crush on on rock pop electronic experimental metal and hip hop music for the most part of the Independent Business Assistance or suasion don't you have some kind of natural hatred for Marilyn Manson deep inside you that cannot be shaken well the truth is back in the day when I was a teenage fat non music nerd guy who wouldn't know a punk band if he heard one I thought Marilyn Manson was awesome now what's his influence on me and my enjoyment of his music due to me being young and naive I would say yes to an extent but I think his music and his message had a lot of merit to it from about the 90s up until the year 2000 I think at the time when he was at his hottest he was writing some of the catchiest industrial and alternative metal out there and even though I wouldn't ever say one of his albums topped the music of one of his biggest and earlier supporters Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails Marilyn Manson's place in alternative metal and industrial metal is not going anywhere for a while because he definitely had his own approach to this stuff sonically and philosophically albums like Antichrist Superstar were a nice mix of just abrasive hard rock elements and electronic music - most time the selfie is extremely raw noisy and just grim and if you could see yourself getting past a Marilyn Manson stigma I would definitely try checking out this album because if you really look into it it is a very well produced and extremely textured album and is very much powered by Marilyn Manson's greatness as a front man he is just the high priest of everything offensive on this album from his really low gothy kroons to his throat shredding screams he is just a great singer on this LP though the darkness on this album is kind of melodramatic and it always has been with Marilyn Manson the production and the songwriting makes up for it in a big way for me now the only thing that I think could potentially overshadow Marilyn Manson's music into the future if it hasn't already is his image his message because Antichrist Superstar was not just an album it wasn't just music it was a slap in the face of religion of censorship of conformity you could boil it down to shock rock but Marilyn Manson definitely had contemporaries that were trying to push buttons as well like Mudvayne and Slipknot Rob Zombie - but Marilyn Manson definitely proved to have stronger tunes on his side thanks to the collective writing abilities of him and his band and you can argue that there are plenty of artists out there who pushed the boundaries further than he did whether it be just visually and aesthetically or just philosophically or politically I would say a guy like GG Allin definitely went a lot further than Marilyn Manson did in terms of lyrical content and stage antics - but Marilyn Manson understood that there is a balance here if you're going to affect a widespread audience there's only so far you can go before you just start alienating people he just found this pocket where he was able to throw atheism and war and violence and sexuality drugs into the public consciousness with this weird white-faced lanky lipstick wearing image but was still appealing and catchy enough from a musical perspective to appeal to an audience large enough to just keep his message into the mainstream now Antichrist Superstar which which gained I think the most attention out of all of his albums was easily the freakshow in his discography his next LP mechanical animals was somewhat of a retreat still push buttons but was much more of an introspective look themes of conformity Fame drug addiction sonically the album had more since was more palatable catchy er a lot less noisy and some people would even call it his glam rock album it was an interesting transformation and to me after this album comes my favorite in Manson's discography hollywood on this album anthem goes back toward shoving all of these taboos and everyone's faces but with a bit more refinement definitely not as harsh as Antichrist superstar but in a lot of ways just as grim and dealing in death Fame and again religion but once we just cracked the barrier of the new millennium I fell out of favor with with Marilyn Manson personally for a lot of reasons first off Marilyn Manson's next album the Golden Age of grotesque was so repetitive and filled with so many bad and just fluffy pointless hooks that even his most hardcore fans had to recognize there's a bit of a fall from grace going on here not to mention it really lacked the variation and the ambition of his previous three albums it seemed like his crusade to shock in his fight against censorship was kind of dying actually I would I would say it kind of succeeded because people in general and even in the mainstream media were just no longer repulsed by Marilyn Manson's favorite buttons to push kind of wore off which really took away Manson's bread-and-butter maybe his his muse the album's eat me drink me and the high end of low definitely tried to fill these gaps with tracks that that described violent sex fantasies or maybe some hoax that had more profanity in them musically Marilyn Manson was definitely revealing some some personal music influences a track would pop up and had a strong blues influence that would be songs that had an even stronger New Wave influence maybe even an old-school post-punk influence to them Plus around this time I had just gotten into punk music and had decided that it was just nothing else in the world worth listening to instead and I don't think that it's any coincidence that Marilyn Manson's fallen popularity correlates directly with most of his core audience graduating from high school and going on to college but born villain Marilyn Manson's new record and his first since being let out of his contractual obligations with longtime label partner Interscope Records is not really sitting all that well with me and the biggest and most obvious reason right off the bat is that with Interscope Records leaving so did Marilyn Manson's production budget it's not an unlistenable album but Marilyn Manson has not been sounding this raw since portrait of an American family he continues on this LP to kind of show his love for very early goth rock and post-punk it most definitely shows up on the track the gardener which has this this dance beat this groovin bass line as well some shots of guitar noise and Marilyn Manson doing this very kind of cocky spoken word piece I actually think it's pretty great and the song murderers are getting be every day has a very harsh ministry style industrial metal quality to it that is just very abrasive however there are moments where the stripped back recording quality does not do this album any favors whatsoever like on the song pistol-whipped you hear fingers sloppily rubbing against the guitar strings as they go up and down for riffs and the song no reflection I'm surprised it's a single off of this album because it is just so badly edited and produced it just feels like a really nasty demo and there's not much subtlety or detail or variety on this album outside of a few slower ballads toward the end that may feature keyboard or acoustic guitar I mean Marilyn Manson has really really reverted back to a simple structure of just drums vocals and guitars and that would be fine if I felt these tracks for the most part had that energy and had that Drive of early Marilyn Manson but it doesn't so it just ends up making these very simply built songs that last four to five minutes each dragged on especially the song slow motion Manson's usual melodrama and his trademark kroons are on here but I'm just in no mood to deal with it with all this weakened production and undercooked songwriting there are moments on here where I think a track will emulate his older style and it will feel pretty good like hey cruel world badass riffs and Manson doing this insane vibrato on his vocal and that is one of the things that I would say actually advances and becomes interesting on this album Manson's voice he's still a great screamer and still a great crooner but he's also experimenting with doing some shrieking doing some whispered vocals singing in different registers more vibrato spoken-word like I said - he still got personality but this record just does not feel all that pleasing I like some of the post-punk vibes coming off this album but it feels like the further we get away from the 90s and and the further we get away from Manson's relevancy as a crusader against censorship just the more off the mark his music kind of feels I think eventually like Arthur Brown or like Alice Cooper Marilyn Manson will go down in history as one of the greatest shock rockers to ever dominate a decade but still if he keeps putting out albums like this I think what I mentioned earlier will most definitely happen and his image will just drown out his musical contributions kind of feeling a strong three to a light four on this album but what did you guys think of it if in fact you listened to it it was - it was Anthony Fantana Marilyn Manson born villain

tAXqMlMoyg8,my Death Grips tickets hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review absol control system absol is a California rapper this is his second full-length album it's out now on rapper Jay rocks label Top Dawg entertainment and he's also a member of the rap collective black hippy which is kind of just his cohorts on top dawg dawg including j-roc schoolboy q and my favorite Kendrick Lamar now I first caught absol like I'm sure a lot of people did last year on the Kendrick Lamar album section 80 a fantastic conceptual mind-bending hip hop album that you must check out if you have not one of my favorites of last year an absent one of my favorite verses on the entire LP on the track absol doubt row and I thought it was funny that a guest rappers verse pretty much summed up the entire emotional package of section 80 in one single track I had to check the dude out and I found out that his debut full-length album long-term mentality was dropped earlier that year so I took a listen and overall I thought it was decent it wasn't really impressing me to any great extent and I guess my biggest disappointment about this LP and this is just from hearing him first on Kendricks album it didn't feel as deep I guess as what I heard him spitting on on Kendricks album now control system is out absol sophomore album release 17 tracks on this thing and overall more length more energy more variety and more topical songs too as far as rapping goes I feel like absol is coming off way more passion on this LP whether he's telling a heart-wrenching story getting wasted bragging or attacking societal norms he just sounds just upfront Center attention demanding relentless there are just too many sides to his personality on this album to attack in one brief review sometimes he's clever and cocky and blunt blowin and rapping in this upper register vocal delivery that actually reminds me a lot of Danny Brown he actually resembles Danny Brown so closely at some points it's almost impossible to tell the difference between him focally and Danny Brown on the Danny Brown featured track terrorist threats now when AB is kind of on this trip I feel like his personality pretty much boils down to a line from the hook on the second track to this album track to abyssal abstract asshole an abstract asshole it's pretty much a perfect depiction of the personality that he displays on control system but just when absol may seem like he is the most egotistical guy in the world he will spit a line about how poor he is or just say something proving that he doesn't take himself too seriously now the free range tracks on this album are really great absol just brings one unexpected juxtaposition after another but the topical tracks on this thing are pretty great too absol can tell a story or really getting the gist of the meaning behind the track or his personal philosophy the track terrorist threats with Danny Brown is kind of about personal freedom and achieving that through some kind of the Warriors style gang collaboration revolution the track double standards is about exactly that but in relation to gender and kind of having this personal desire to respect women but then realizing that's not exactly the societal norm that we're dealing with here and the book of Sol is is one of my favorite tracks on here comes up toward the end and is about this really long time love interest who had a huge impact on his life but then of course she passes away and not only is this track about the personal story of him and her but just the emotional terror the aftermath that comes with losing that person now the production to me isn't amazing it's for the most part a lot of traps Stiles snare drums and high hats just clinking and clicking away against some really refined samples and then glassy keyboards again it's not something I would rave over if this were an instrumental album or something like that but I do think absol sounds great over these instrumentals the Aries string sections on track 2 are really great I love the muddy jazz sample on the song bohemian groove the very pretty piano melodies on the track double standards are a perfect foundation for that song there are a few surprises kind of like the track terrorist threats which gets especially dark bleak and kind of weird the instrumentals on here go hard when they need to they get very pretty and emotive when they need to but still despite the subtle detail there is something about these instrumentals that feel kind of messy feel kind of rough around the edges something that kind of gives this album a street vendor soul mixtape grittiness to it overall I feel like this album's greatest asset is personality just add souls personality and lyricism - to me there's no extremely strong concept or narrative that brings all the tracks together into a tightly packed punch the intro this album would have you believe that this album is about control systems mind control wanting to live your life the way you want to live it without the influence of laws or societal norms and while those themes are on here I feel like the biggest theme is just the many sides of rapper absol the features on this thing are pretty great for the most part it's it's just the top dawg entertainment crew and friends that appear on this album there's a great black hippy pasa tract on the end of this thing I wish the album had a bit more originality to it you know there are definitely contemporaries of absol that you could easily compare him to that he just has a little bit of in his style like Kendrick Lamar like Danny Brown and there are even some spots on here where he will embark on a swag rap track like little B or ASAP Rocky I wish there were more topical tracks I wish the production was a little bit more adventurous too but still despite all of that I felt that this was a really fun and engaging listen kind of feeling too light too decent eight on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why what should I be reviewing next Anthony Fantan oh absol forever you 
jUYWMOOUY08,all right I'm gonna take this I'm not gonna thank you and I'm gonna go listen to it hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of an album whose name I'm hoping I'm pronouncing correctly Square pusher move pabulum Square pusher is electronic music producer and multi-instrumentalist Tom Jenkinson this is definitely not the first time I am reviewing work from him over the course of his pretty lengthy career he has created some of the most notable albums in not only drum and bass but IBM and the guy prides himself on being an experimentalist fusing these electronic sound hunts mountains mountains mountains with the musical modes of jazz fusion and sometimes in a really mind-bending way especially on the album music is one rodded note and I feel like Tom's career as of late has been loaded with more personal adventures and self-indulgent projects than ever whether it's an LP of solo bass works or an album influenced by a daydream by this futurist electronic rock band or actually trying to make that rock band happen by leading a full band with a different project Shoaib leader won all this experimentation just a little bit has drifted tom away from the electronic roots that his career grew from and while his ventures outside of that box have always been pretty interesting rarely has it been exciting at least for me but I'm happy to say that this new LP goes back to the more electronic side of square pusher in a big big big way and tom is definitely not sitting back in comfortable territory instead he is sort of molding his usual sound as usual style to the modern electronic music land scape tom actually tries to incorporate some elements from the world of dubstep in his music on this LP the tracks dark steering and tracks to the to lead tracks on this LP both feature some pretty heavy distorted and to my ears wobbling synth bass and so does the track unreal square but that song resembles dubstep even more to me simply because it has this heavy heavy and and large drop so square pusher basically kind of grabs this dubstep bass and combines it with his his trademark intense and intricate drum sequencing very glitchy very detailed and I like what tom is doing with this combination of sounds on the tracks where this combination of sounds appear I think these deeper bass tones are kind of giving Tom a darker edge on some moments with this LP dark steering is a monster on this LP so overwhelming with how many sounds how many rich sounds are flowing throughout that track just such heavy bass and heavy electronics and meanwhile there are some very strange metallic tones hanging in the background in the atmosphere their wailing but very softly and it's it's kind of very dark omen the song dracs 2 is dark as well but it has a lot more space it is it is but some songs on here are pretty cacophonous are very noisy I would say even uniquely noisy and especially noisy foursquare pusher the track 303 scope and heart has these metallic tones on it the sound like a train kind of rushing to a stop screeching to a halt but it's repeating everywhere just flying in at every direction I think it comes from a cymbal though it is such a great and just exciting track for me sounds are just everywhere but the song still manages to put forth a really great groove everything comes together and works in tandem and that's what I feel like Tom Jenkinson's power as a producer can be sometimes he can really create a mess just a flurry of different sounds but a groove a direction will still read through just all of this density every track on this LP that I love though actually comes in the second half of this album the first half of this LP is is a slightly rough ride for me I thought the production on the first half of this LP like you know usual square pusher fashion very fast very nimble very detailed tracks but I thought the chords and the melodies were a bit too much alike the very pleasant and agreeable tracks from just a souvenir and show beliar one especially with the track stadium ice although I will say it does sound to me more palatable on this album than it did with those other releases I felt like the track read in blue was a bit underwhelming this very icy and and minimal synth Odyssey which I just don't find its place in this album to be all that fantastic I guess an unreal Square has this synth solo at the 3-minute mark just about there that is so out of place it's just impossible to ignore unfortunately for me this album feels like a mixed bag of songs of various styles and qualities the combination of IDM and dubstep is the most notable and consistent thing that this album has going and while I do think it's interesting and I do think it's really good I have to admit that passion that interest in me stems from being a fan I do have to say that I don't feel like what tom has done here necessarily adds to the world of IDM or adds to the world of dubstep more just adds to his discography but still I say this in every square pusher review if you have not tried this guy's music out especially his early releases mm-hmm do so please I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this album I thought it was likable fall short of being fantastic to me still there are a handful of tracks on this thing that I did absolutely love especially on that second half like I said second half killer all right what did you guys think of this thing did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana square pusher forever 
S9Up_xgbZaQ,I've been dying to review that record show it to me ah yeah my needle drops hi Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and review time beach house bloom these guys are a Baltimore duo and they play some of the most dreamy and seductive pop tunes out there hmm and the centerpiece of their music is the vocal of frontwoman Victoria Legrand it has a very soft quality to it it also has a very nice range it's not just one of those voices that hangs in the upper register while Victoria can get up there and just belt out some really high and an emotional notes I feel she is at her most haunting when she's kind of hanging in those really deep smoky lows backing up that vocal is Alex Scalia tar which is usually played with a root note octave being very pleasantly bounced back and forth sparkling with reverb and against this guitar and the vocals are layers and layers of synthesizers whether they're cute little arpeggios atmospheric droney synth chords that that sound so blissful or some pretty deep resonant bass notes that that are very subtly giving thing a nice fleshed out feel now the band used to be back to simply by some pretty old-school sounding drum machines but the band now kind of broadens the rhythms on their albums out with some acoustic drums which they started doing quite a bit on their last LP teen dream and they continue to do it on bloom but the rhythm is still hanging in the background very subtly and allow the guitars the synths and Victoria's voice to just enchant now sound is very important to beach house really important there are a lot of bands out there right now working with a similar sound just writing catchy pop or rock tune slathered and reverb slather an atmosphere and to me beach house is one of the few groups that despite all the effects that are clearly a pivotal part of their music they still come off very warm very loving in everything that they do very intimate not distant not obscure to the point where they feel alienated if you throw a ton of effects on a song you're essentially putting a barrier between the listener and the song and of course I mean song and a more traditional sense notes lyrics chords but even with all the effects beach house still comes off very potent very melodic and showcases some fantastic songwriting they have a personality that I think would ring true if the effects weren't there but the effects are important if they weren't I don't think Beach House would be working with roughly the same sound for four albums now and I would actually say that there are less differences between bloom and its predecessor than there are in the two other gaps between Beach House albums I'd actually say the band experiments a little bit less with this LP bloom is definitely not the surprise that teen dream was with its extra instrumentation and and a few left hooks as well especially with the track ten-mile stereo with its throbbing pulsating rhythms and in fast pace was a pretty standout track for me so while I do not find bloom all that surprising beach house does make a clear difference between this album and team dream with songwriting not necessarily better but different songs the track the ours is is a standout for me and has a slightly lightly fuzzy guitar or a riff that kind of shows beach house just rocking out very gently Victoria's vocal melody on the verse is catchy enough and for me it gets even catch here on the chorus don't care about me it has this really nice descending quality to it that I think is just it feels like a lullaby and yet it just kind of sucks me in the opening track myth on here starts off with a pretty simplistic rhythm like a lot of beach house songs do but they managed to change things up just a little bit with this metallic clang that is pretty sharp and attention-grabbing and I just get this field from Victoria's voice that I'm being sung to directly the groove is great but I love the way the track just changes pace and explodes with the sparkling guitar cort toward the middle of the track it actually reminds me of the way the blondie song atomic changes up from its verse to its chorus not only is the change very musical but it's also very emotional it's a huge mood change for the track it's impressive and the thing is with beach house especially on this album I especially get this feel here there's nothing on this LP that's all that loose or thrown to the wind or just left up to chance a lot like a Beatles album or a Beach Boys album to me everything feels so crafted every note every rhythm every chord though I did say beach house sticks to their guns on this LP that's not to say that there's no variation on this album certainly each song is different melodically but there are differences production-wise to the track wild easily has the quirkiest drum machine on the entire album the track lazuli has easily the quirkiest synth on the entire album troublemaker is one of the sadder tunes on here new years one of the faster tunes on here on the sea is a beautiful piano ballad and Irene the closer on this album is if I'm not mistaken the longest song beach house has has written which builds up to a really huge just emotional climax for about six minutes there are more differences to be noted but the thing is you have to kind of dig those up for yourself because yeah they are here physically and musically and emotionally those differences but most importantly those differences between this album and Teen Dream for you have to be personal if this is your first time listening to Beach House great this is a great introductory album everything I said in the introduction about the band's style if that appeals to you try it out but as far as the personal thing goes again though some of Victoria Legrand's lyrics do stand out it's more the emotion of these tracks that appeal to me and that's why I think it's kind of easy to forget beach houses songwriting and just kind of let your ears glaze over and just listen to the very atmospheric and hazy tones however I would say somebody that feels that way is maybe missing out I'm not trying to tell you what you should or should like but each houses means it can be very engaging if you just dive into and actually think about what's happening these guys are dream pop but they're the last band you should sleep on honestly though I do wish beach house ventured out into the unknown a little bit more with this album experimented more surprised me more it is a great LP because they are kind of working with a perfected formula and the songs on this album don't feel like deja vu to me in fact they're great songs and I would say all the extra instrumentation that beach house has been using for their past couple releases is executed with a bit more finesse with a more tasteful ear this time around with another record for me beach house continues to kill it with this style of sound there are a lot of bands out there playing gentle dreamy pop and rock music that appeal to me on the level that beach house does so I'm kind of feeling strongly to a light 9 on this album what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next and what did um ah I think I think that's all my questions yeah it is should I ask another question let me know Anthony Fantana beach house bloom [Music] 
b6Vouov5uo8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd and making a short video letting you know that I have four short audio reviews below this video that you can listen to and sort of get a grasp of these albums the following albums one did a review of the new Lord mantas album pervert er this is a blackened sludge metal band combination black metal sludge metal and it is every hope and dream that I would expect from a record that combines these two sounds next the new here we go magic album a different ship a band who I have been enjoying quite a bit since their sophomore LP pigeons they go down roughly the same Road on their new album I talk about that in a review down there the new orbital album wonky IDM techno dance music veterans orbital new album first album in eight years down there and the new author and Punisher album Ursus americanus and industrial noise and and metal album that is created from what I understand completely by instrumentation designed and engineered by the man who wrote the songs giving the album a pretty unique set of Timbers of textures so if that if this that this that that that is your thing you want some noisy industrial heavy punishing music then review down there check it out and that's all cool cool Anthony Fantino for reviews

XZ3LM0xjcPA,I got you allowed noisy over experimental pretentious piece of ham where did you get a copy of noisy pretentious piece of hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd time for an album of album review me without you ten stories these guys are a Philadelphia band and if you've ever kind of sat alone thinking to yourself hey I would really love to get into some passionate melodic and poetic post-hardcore with with heart wrenching storylines and lyrics if you said that I would recommend this band's first three albums keep in mind this group's material gets more raw and aggressive as you go backwards through their discography incorporating more elements of hardcore punk but me without use 2006 album brother-sister is really the crown jewel in the band's discography easily their most blended effort right here showcasing a variety of different styles from indie rock to post hardcore to folk rock and just folk music slathered in horns and accordion and even though there is quite a bit of variety it all is held down through this common thread frontman Aaron Weiss's vocals he's very overly emotive on a lot of me without using material and will morph quickly from this just impassioned aggressive scream to these whisper quiet murmurs and verbally he will always be doling out these very sad and personal ultra personal and sometimes extremely painful and detailed lyrics now the band's next LP it's all crazy was a pretty big change for them stylistically basically me without you allowed the full keyer side of their style to just overtake themselves completely not only was this album much more acoustic but the lyrics changed a bit too borrowing a lot from folklore to develop its storylines and using some really funky rhyme schemes as well now after the shift with it's all crazy we now have this new album ten stories it's a self released LP and I think a lot of older fans are going to see this album as a little bit of a return to form for me without you it definitely rocks out way more than it's all crazy but does have its shots of folk music just like brother/sister but the storylines feel nowhere near as heart-wrenching or depressing or really all that personal an Aaron's vocal delivery to me for a a great deal this album is pretty subdued Aaron does have his really aggressive and passionate moments like on the opener February 1878 but for the most part on this thing he is either straight singing or just delivering these spoken word vocals in his trademark murmur a murmur that reminds me a lot of like listening to slit a bit of a detour but whatever now another thing besides some folk influenced that me without you maintains past its previous album is just simplicity simplicity in its song structures most of the songs on here are pretty straightforward you do have the occasional change in direction the occasional surprise like on the end of the track nine stories where the track really changes completely and I love the lyrics in this spot of the song if the weather withers up you're fine Jacob knows a ladder you can climb for the most part this album is very hooky like on the track grist for the melody mill and Cardiff giant that folky simplicity is not really completely lost on on me without you and that would be completely fine with me and it in fact it is completely fine with me what ends up bugging me about this album is that like the title implies the lyrics the story side of this album is pretty pivotal pretty front and center but the story lines for me with this band are just not that great on this record the track eastenders wives for me is a prime example there's lots of very pretty and flowery language being thrown in every direction and the lyrics are telling a pretty esoteric tale I would say but I know really get all that much out of it and and I feel that way about a lot of tracks on here it's it's a very wordy rock record but so many of the words are just not resonating with me and that's it to me a lot of these Tunes are just poetic middle-of-the-road folk rock that is sometimes likable and sometimes underwhelming I like that some of the tracks on here transition into one another and it makes for a very holistic listening experience with this LP despite the fact that I am not liking a lot of the Tunes or the stories themselves there is most definitely an arc a progression but honestly I only came away from this LP loving just a pocket full of tracks February 1878 is definitely one of the most riveting tracks on this album and a fantastic attention-grabbing opener the guitar riffs are great aaron Weiss's vocals are great and this track and the track outside of Fox stream are about the closest to those post-hardcore roots you're going to see me without you get to elephant in the doc is a full croc tune on here that has a big big finish and I love the storyline on this track which I will not give too much away with but it involves an elephant a courtroom a judge and injustice it's one of the few moments on this LP where I actually get something great out of the storyline and the song bears vision of st. agnus is another folk a tune that has a big finish as well the end of this track is just a mournful display of chorus vocals violin and horns it's a tearjerker it is a rocked out version of a funeral march and I love the last track on here too really the perfect closer for this album all circles talking about how all circles assume that they're going to end up in the same place but but that does not happen without some stipulation for me this album is not bad but it's it's definitely not winning my heart to me this album just kind of feels like me without you took indie rock and they took folk music to genres these guys have been playing in different capacities for a while but they combined them but it just ended up kind of removing the guts of both styles and just kind of drawing up a pretty bland combination of the two I guess I'm feeling a strong six on this LP unfortunately what did you guys think of it I know there were a lot of people including including me looking forward to hearing this album but you know let me know you love it you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana me without you forever 
53BsdCokZ0A,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion sometimes metal and hip hop is well and after many many comments many radio edit requests asking you to do so I'm going to touch down via video the new animal collective single honeycomb / Gotham as many of you may remember back in 2009 the New York experimental psychedelic and electronic music outfit animal collective dropped its breakthrough full-length LP Meriweather post pavilion and between now and then a lot has happened to the group they released a full-length feature psychedelic experimental art film titled odd sack they had an EP come at the end of the year after the release of Meriweather post pavilion that was pretty great also there were two Animal Collective related solo records released by panda bear a navy tear unfortunately I was not really that into either of the albums both of them felt kind of underwhelming for me I caught a lot of flack for really not being on board with these albums but to me they just kind of felt like Animal Collective records but with with less and when I say less I mean the elements that the other members would have brought to what this one member created in his solo release so now this outside of a record story release that the band had out recently is the first major piece of material to come from the band in a wild it's got two tracks a side honeycomb b-side Gotham and I'm really enjoying both of the tracks actually I'm enjoying honeycomb the most i love the track and what's so great about this song and just animal collective new material in general since Animal Collective blew up with the album's strawberries Merriweather Post Pavilion there have been a lot of copycats coming in and just biting their sound and with this song at least Animal Collective has managed to stay innovative fresh new and fun honeycomb starts off with a peculiar vocal sample and then it just erupts into these rhythms that feel faintly African but also kind of Caribbean there are these shouting group chorus vocals in the background that are usually featured and Animal Collective tracks that kind of harken to that of the Beach Boys you know some kind of experimental weird Brian Wilson production which is a more relevant comparison than ever since those smile sessions came out last year and even though I wasn't totally in love with them now head over heels with them like a lot of people were it was interesting to see the musical madman inner workings of Brian Wilson's head around that point in his career the vocals are really fiery and really impassioned all these noises are just so rich and bright and fun I love the addition of the horn on this track and there's this synth line over the hook that kind of sounds like a pan flute or something it's really fun noisy upbeat track and the drums on this thing had this interesting effect on that makes them feel like they are maybe it's some kind of strange phaser they are being stretched and then sort of returned to their original shape it's like I just see this multicolored field with with all these shades and hues and tones just bleeding into one another and then over this Hill is this kaleidoscopic sky and it's just changing colors and shapes and Merriweather Post Pavilion was definitely animal collectives most accessible effort to date but they went down an accessible route by making an album that really kind of bordered on overproduction really glossy hi Sheena on this LP with honeycomb I feel like the band is reverting a little bit back toward that more mm simple chaotic feel of songs on strawberry jam but they're definitely being a bit more straightforward with it production-wise this does not feel huge or over-the-top it's at a really nice middle ground as far as goes on this single definitely the more chill of the two tracks the grower of the two tracks it starts off with this sun-baked introduction that feels like just being left for dead in the middle of a hot desert and then these very simple drums come in and they are playing in three and the track kind of progresses into this slow psychedelic Waltz the vocals on this track have these short little bursts of of screaming in them too and I'm not even screaming but just gruffness of aggression of just intense emotion but the overall emotional package of this track is much different than honeycomb honeycomb is an upbeat this is a lot sadder especially when you start catching little whiffs of what the vocals are actually saying and in regards to not being given feelings you're saying goodbye this track is in a lot of ways just as sound rich as honeycomb but it doesn't feel that way at first because it's so much more spaced out it's not as dense but sonically there are just as many strange things going on I do think the vocal melody rings through a little clearer on this track and while it does not feel as fiery as honeycomb it's just as pleasing but in a completely different way so what did you guys think of this single did you love it did you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana honeycomb and Gotham forever 
eboBBDS-Klw,you went to the record store what did you buy yeah what did you buy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd time for a review b.o.b Bob Bobby Ray strange clouds this guy is an Atlanta rapper producer and singer and this is his official full-length follow up to the 2010 album The Adventures of Bobby Ray which was a huge introduction for him went to number one in the u.s. sold gold had a really big Bruno Mars featured single with the track nothing on you and on this album Bob Hurley built himself up to be a really versatile artist who kind of reaches across genres and this kind of played out in the features that he got all over his debut album with Bruno Mars Lupe Fiasco Janelle Monae Rivers Cuomo of Weezer Hayley Williams from Paramore and Eminem and Bob continues that trend on this new LP with a really diverse set of features coming from Ti Chris Brown little Wayne Nicki Minaj Taylor Swift even Morgan Freeman does this really dramatic monologue to open up the album the array of artists this guy attracts is really impressive but you know the thing is that the music to me is not just the 15 tracks on this new album pretty much add up to a lowest-common-denominator pop rap album that does not really focus on anything except just trying to create a load of carbon copy tracks tracks that follow the blueprint that usually gets songs played in heavy rotation on pop and hip hop crossover radio stations nearly every track here kind of has its own little modern radio pop motif that it appeals to the track so hard to breathe has these really vague notions of being drowned in the pressures of life with this bursting rock chorus singing it's so hard to breathe there's a track on here with a Taylor Swift chorus acoustic guitar in the background not a bad song at all but Bob kind of goes in wrapping on this track asking sincerely I think why people are so greedy why they're so shallow good question question worth exploring but a question that kind of baffles me because Bob will kind of turn around and do a track where he's talking about poppin bottles or a pretty girl or money or cars there is a little wayne feature on here with a lot of corny punchlines coming in left and right and kind of further that Young Money brand Nicki Minaj comes in on a track on this LP as well a song where Bob is going crazy and the mantra seems to be out of my mind him and Nicki kind of have fun with the track and and I do like the very wobbly beat on the song it's it's got a weird groove to it that I think is pretty interesting and a lot of the other tracks on here just kind of have okay hip hop beats but then we'll kind of shift gears into a very bright pop or R&B chorus tracks like castles just a sign or chandelier where the hook is like my heart keeps pumping heart keeps beating shining like a chandelier yeah but I like Bob's positive attitude and his fast flow on the track there's a lot of personality there sincerity I thought I think the outside of some corny punchlines and some corny hooks I don't really take a lot away from Bob as a rapper because he has a great flow for the most part art art art I just don't like how this album consistently doles out one spoonful of sugar after another after another after another I seriously don't like my coffee or much of anything that sweet to kind of make matters worse Bob will do a track that kind of throws out a vague love song story like on the track circles one of the more personal songs on this album though that I did think was great was the closer where are you Bob versus Bobby gray where he raps from the standpoint of an angry fan who kind of perceives him as selling out sounding different losing touch with his family it's it's a good song but the thing is I guess Eminem totally did something like this better who would stand for sure that because everything on here feel so formulated for wide consumption the overall taste of this album is just really really mild and you know that's Bobby's goal this album pretty much does everything in its power to avoid anything lyrically musically that will require a second listen to understand pretty much what Bob does on this album is use the colors normally found in mainstream pop rap today and then just kind of uses them to paint a portrait of himself and I do feel like it's easy to kind of sit here considering the kind of music I usually review and usually enjoy pointed this and then say oh this is mainstream ooh this sucks but really I didn't find too much on this album that I hated or just enraged me so to me this thing is just kind of really middle-of-the-road just middle of the road so I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana b.o.b forever [Music] [Music] 
6fW1KL8qmzs,I'm home from the record store hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review loan galaxy garden loan is the recording pseudonym of uk-based electronic music producer Matt Cutler this is Cutler's fifth LP and a lot like another electronic music producer featured on this album Machinedrum his LP last year rooms I refute it a lot like him color has toyed with a lot of different electronic music styles on past releases everything from house to acid house and instrumental hip hop and glitch hop wonky downtempo to but I feel like his last album his last collection of tracks in a full-length capacity city struck an interesting retro nerve definitely a 90s House vibe coming off on some of these tracks with really bright punctuated synth chords and melodies definitely music I could see playing against some sort of video montage promoting an all-expenses-paid vacation to some kind of a beachside resort but I do mean that in a good way and had a few points on the echo locations EP that loan dropped last year he walked down that road as well but with some some glassy er sounds and now this new LP is out and to me it's it's an interesting spot in the evolution of loan there are still flashes of that really fun upbeat dance floor ready hard-edged and let loose 90s house vibe but the sounds on this thing are produced with a much higher Sheen everything on this album is so shiny and so rich it's like a color gradient of classic cars spit-shined - spotless perfection all kind of lined up and parked right next to one another going on in this line and it looks like it goes on for infinity or you could liken it to a really massive laser lightshow or being about 12 or 13 and 1996 and first laying your eyes upon some Nintendo 64 games these are pretty much images this album draws up for me experiences that this album reminds me of and it just has an immense emphasis on funky grooves and tons and tons of synthetic colors the since on this thing really do glisten like sun rays shining through an island waterfall it actually reminds me a little bit of that rusty album glass swords that drop last year but does not overdo it it does not get so bright and so sweet that it starts to kind of give me cavities and like that rusty album glass swords and and like that machine drum album two rooms this LP incorporates some elements of footwork and future garage music into its rhythms it's a clear influence on a good chunk of these tracks and it's led to some really intricate beats as far as I can tell this is relatively new territory for a loan to be this rhythmically dense and I think this is just what he needed in order to produce a new album that felt fresh that felt fun and I think this new direction this change in direction is implied with the opening track new color the title another kind of sound or just feel that kind of pops up on this album for me is just this sense of being really sunny and tropical and yeah it does partially have to do with the sense but I think it has a lot for me to do with the Jerome's not only the poly rhythms they're playing but the tambour of the drums listening to the drums and a lot of the grooves on this album to me it just feels like calypso music on steroids and just sped up immensely this sound does not come out too strong on some of the harder tracks on here like crystal caverns and 1891 but if you take a listen to the second track off this LP the animal pattern it's really strong and of course it does not help that there is an array of sampled sounds playing in the background that sound like they have been ripped from a jungle so I mean I've pretty much laid down the influences and the sounds in this album and for the 12 tracks that it lasts with the exception of a few interludes it pretty much plays with varying combinations of these sounds of these styles but there are some highlights along the way producer machine drum has really nice not even a production credit but a vocal feature on the third track there's a nice stuttering synthesizer on the song too that I think is pretty great and Machinedrum has featured a second time on this album on the track of tulu toward the end of this LP and while I do like the track I don't feel like it adds as much to this album as the first feature did the tranq lying and reeds is definitely one of the slower grooves on this album and when it comes up it it comes up it's great because it really hits me just how fast a lot of the tracks on this album go crystal caverns 1991 easily the hardest track on this album I love these synthesizer chords when they start hitting in the same the same this really aggressive way in today dude it's really punchy feels so much like an old-school house track and I really love how lone we'll start layering these really sweet synth leads over that rhythm the track Earth's Long's has one of the fatter heavier synth bass lines on this entire LP which really makes a stick out for me a really spacious introduction to and the album ends off with a nice vocal feature from anikó which is one of the more soothing tracks on here did not really hit me as being as fiery as some songs on this LP but it is a track that I do think will grow on me more as I revisit this thing there were a few tracks on here like radiance and dream girl that I thought were okay but didn't really add a new dynamic to this album for me I mean Dreamgirl skysurfer but overall this album is just so right and just so intensely fun that it's hard for me to take my eyes off of it it's hard for me to take my ears off of it but not really bright or flashing in in a cheap or simple way because the production chops and the detail is here it's here in spades just great tracks great grooves fantastic production nice variety between these songs and just a style that I'm very much into feeling a decent - strong 8 on this LP if you guys have heard it what do you think of it love it hate it why and what should i review next thanks for watching anthony Fantana loan 
JdckE1BTB4M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd short video making you aware of for short audio reviews linked below this video of the new santigold album the new logic mixtape the new Rex album as well as the new it's on the tip of my tongue da hacker LP just sort of talked about these four releases in short via audio like I said link below this video just click and you will hear the short review of the album that is of interest to you I hope you have a good day oh yeah I plan to do these more in the future because I don't like doing the why you know reviews anymore trying to short review 20 or so albums in one sitting makes me want to kill myself but we're not gonna do that berna keep on living is a soft word yet no all right gonna end this video 
RqwXttWKaAU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy and it's time for a review album review off self-titled this is a California punk band featuring vocalist Keith Morris best known for his roles in the band's Black Flag and Circle Jerks I reviewed offs first released a few years ago first for EPS which sits proudly in my collection and was definitely one of my favorite releases of 2010 gave it a glowing review but this project has a bit of a catch to it not only is it punk music but it's an intentional throwback to Keith Morris's days in the earliest years of Black Flag's specifically you know around the nervous breakdown EP time and everything from the riffs to the vocal style to the cover art to even the band's name points in reference to that point in Keith's career and the first impressions on on this LP off is definitely keeping things raw it feels and sounds like they recorded this album in half the time they recorded the first four EPS sometimes Keith's vocals hardly even sound eq'd on a few tracks here they are so much louder than everything else that when Keith screams everything is just drowned out sometimes the drums are really buried - I can hardly make out what they're doing the guitars feel kind of muddy here and they're just just from time to time but but the energy is still behind these songs they're still performed with a lot of intensity those somewhat thrashy California skate punk riffs are still there they're still all over this record but the overall package is definitely not as bright or as crisp as it was on first for EPS it's very claustrophobic album there's not a lot of space between the instruments in this mix some things drown out other things but it kind of has this very overwhelming charm to it at some points I guess and yeah maybe I am being a little nitpicky about the sound of this album but to me it kind of ruins the momentum of these songs to not hear the drums and the bass really shoving the tempo along like they should on the cell P off sometimes will deliver tracks that feel like slight variations of ideas that were on the first four EPS like the intro track wiped out which is this rock-and-roll riff that is sped up to a punk rock fury or on the song cracked actually this happens on a lot of songs where the drums the bass and guitar riffs and Keith's vocals will all kind of syncopate in unison off is one of the few punk bands to use this technique as much as they do and sometimes I guess even though it does kind of bring them a distinct flavor I do feel like they can be a little heavy-handed with it sometimes with his vocals Keith will come through with a really snarky and personal message that is so just nasty and and focused but vague in in some ways I'm just dying to know who or what he is singing about like on the track I got news for you where he directly addresses someone who thinks they're the the king of the scene of course keith has tracks they have a really strong political message behind them to like borrow and bomb or toxic box and sometimes they'll throw in a bit of very dark humor into the song - like on vaporized baby punk may not be your thing you may think Punk is dead you may think that this album does not add anything wildly original to the world of Punk but you do have to admit that over the years Keith really has maintained his his charisma musically I feel like off tries a bit to be less one-dimensional this time around Keith has some points where his vocals are narrated or he's singing a little bit these can be kind of hit or miss for me especially when I don't feel like his vocal is mixed all that well but I do appreciate the variation there is a really nice slow-building guitar intro on the track King Kong Brigade and I like the heart dissonant chord hits in the middle of jet black girls that really kind of breaks the song up and adds some really ugly colors to the mixture this album does not really where it's welcome and it's it's difficult to pull tracks out at first at first when listening to this because it's all just this flurry of varying degrees of just intensity for 16 tracks that run roughly 16 minutes the style of this album is so close to the blueprint of the first four EPS that if you missed the first four EPS and check this out you will probably like it maybe even love it and think it's one of the most badass punk LPS you've heard in a while but if you really loved first four EPS like I did it may be easy to like this but maybe difficult to love it mostly because this is so similar it's impossible impossible for it to make the same shocking impact that this sound first did when first four EPS came out there may be some mixing issues on this LP for me but the tunes on here are good and I think Keith's vocals are still great kind of feel them a decent too strong seven on this thing what did you guys think of it did you like it did you hate it why what should i review next and thanks for being awesome love you see you later bye 
dizEEBtIpCc,"[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd my needle drops and it's time for a question comment thing quite a few people this week actually asked me what I think of Spotify and just music streaming services in general and it's funny why this didn't dawn on me before to kind of do a topic on on this because PSP I'm talking about music streaming services where for the most part people are legally legally streaming new albums and songs or or their favorite albums and songs from the past now I mean I actually use Spotify personally when it comes to reviewing albums sometimes if a new album has come out I haven't got a promo for it or I haven't picked up a copy of it myself I will just go try it on Spotify if it's available for streaming and then maybe even go listen to their past records on Spotify if those are uploaded as well and even try out some artists that influence that artists or similar to that artists and of course there are other similar services like Pandora Last FM has kind of a streaming radio feature as well and Grooveshark there's a lot of different sites out there that are trying to provide a similar service to Spotify and let's not forget that I also think YouTube itself is kind of a music streaming platform you guys know that that there's a lot of music streaming on YouTube that I have streamed that you have strained artists and record labels even upload songs and music videos to YouTube to just tease toward forthcoming releases or just give fans a taste of what an album is going to sound like now I'm not against the streaming music model I'm not against the streaming platform I don't think it's going to destroy the music industry I do not think it's going to destroy the physical side of music either but it could definitely give mp3s and downloads a run for their money if services like Spotify become as II easy quick and simple as just kind of going into your iTunes folder and then just grabbing a song that you have bought or downloaded and then just listening to it right there and as the internet speeds up and these services become faster and programmed more efficiently of course that's going to happen unless some kind of legal issue gets in the way but the thing is stuff like free music streaming services that are legal is something people kind of want people don't want to have to pay to try music anymore and part of the reason this is because there's the sheer amount of music out there right now there's so many artists that are price gouging their albums letting people sort of pay what they want and then get them or just giving them OI entirely for free and of course all of this competition to the bottom just to be heard just to get some buzz and get a fan base and get people listening to your material has gotten people to overall value music a little bit less now even though the government has been strong-arming websites like megaupload and other sites similar to megaupload have been restricting access or just shutting down completely piracy is still rampant the government can't even stop drugs from being trafficked into the country how can they stop ones and zeros from being trafficked across the internet now the beauty of this new system though this new streaming music platform system could be a solution to actually getting artists paid okay look at this this high on fire record I bought this record with my own money but the thing is high on fire only gets paid one time when I buy this one record and some in the current state of the music industry would even argue that the amount of money that they make off of this sale is not even that much now if I take that high on fire record and I listen to it once a day every day for the rest of my life high on fire does not make any more money they just make that one record sale and that's it but if I'm listening to them on a streaming service if I listen to that on a streaming service every day for the rest of my life they get paid for every single stream that I make now even though there have been articles that show that the amount of money artists get paid from streams on Spotify is horrible something around 10 pounds 10 dollars or so for around 100,000 streams there will be a lot more options out there if we embrace this model and allow companies other than Spotify to do this kind of thing if there were other legal streaming services out there then they could possibly offer competitive rates to artists to have their album exclusively streaming with them premiere streaming with them whether it be through in advance of money or through a higher pay per stream rate so yeah even though at this very moment the whole pay artists side of this model sucks there are lots of ways this system can work and we're not going to find out a way to actually make it work in favor of the artists if we just sort of reject it and stamp out the spark before it even becomes a flame and even if the record companies sort of take their medicine and then just spit it out it's not going to make a difference because if we get rid of streaming services people are still going to pirate music the best thing to do now is meet this compromise and actually create that listening booth experience that people are always likening piracy to streaming an album off of a website where you don't technically own the mp3s and maybe the artist gets paid every single time you stream one of the songs that is more listening booth like to me of course the revenue for this money will come from ad sales it will come from subscription payments and that's just the model that we're facing at the moment like I said I want artists to be paid but you know we're just gonna sit back and see how it pans out do you use Spotify or music streaming service is do you prefer them to downloading music pirating music have to go look for music whether you're torrenting it or you're sort of downloading it off of a mega upload esque website do you find the audio quality on these streaming services to be to your liking do you see yourself using them more in the future if they become more popular are you subscribed to a music streaming service and do you enjoy it are you happy with your subscription is this kind of platform the future of the music industry let me know Anthony Fantana music streaming

BtV3qoHqVkI,I'm home home from the record store Guinea I got you this Huey Lewis and the news LP but hi everyone Anthony Fantino here you know what hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the self-titled dweller on the threshold album dweller on the threshold is a rotating cast of musicians from the New England area and this is their new LP on enemies list home recordings and if you already know about that record label you may kind of be able to predict what this album may sound like the label is masterminded by musician and producer dan barrett who between his personal musical projects on the label light novel ear and have a nice life and Giles Corey in addition to other artists he has released music from Lex Astor and mammal eek Dan has a really short and sweet catalogue a very dark moody atmospheric and slightly tortured music and dweller on the threshold grounds most if not all of those bases and does it with a combination of sounds and styles I'm yet to hear on any record their tracks on here that have a very acoustic singer/songwriter style to them with influences coming from the world of full in country and Americana then there's a bit of bludgeoning post hardcore with huge bass noodling guitar leads really aggressive vocals tornado force drums then there's some very heavy distorted thick and sludgy riffs that are very akin to doom metal I'm very hesitant to use that word with this album then there's a bit of shoegaze and drone the thing is every guitar strum drum beat vocal bass line and riff sounds somewhat cohesive somewhat cohesive because everything is fed through this really kind of ultra atmospheric and slightly low file ends it's just a series of sounds that reminds me of a whole range of artists like Earth Mount Erie as well as that last women record public's trained you know the combination of ideas like I said on this album is pretty surprising it's attractive it's interesting but the combination is one thing I feel like the execution on this record is a totally different monster for one I'm not a really huge fan of the vocals not only do they feel too distant which I feel like could have been overcome if they had a bit more personality to them I just don't find the vocals to be all that good I guess on a lot of tracks who they just feel kind of flat and kind of lifeless and I just end up feeling no emotions for them whatsoever sometimes to me some of the more singer-songwriter based songs just feel okay to me on here as well like the track the woods electric the atmosphere is really pretty but the song itself they're really meandering vocal melody the repetitive guitar arpeggio is another huge complaint I have with this LP is just overall the flow of it I mean this album doesn't flow so much as it just kind of detours from one distraction to another that more post-hardcore influence track crumbling house coming right after the very quiet the woods electric the change was so different that I actually thought I was listening to a different band and I had to go back and just double check and make sure that I was actually on the same record and I did that more than once the track the drone itself is a contrast in that it builds up to a very abrasive and doom riff Laden finish but the end just cuts off suddenly in a very kind of Abbey Road sort of way and just gives way to this very quiet acoustic tune right after dweller on the threshold definitely succeeds in bringing a lot of very sincere variety to this album meaning that none of the styles that these guys embark upon really feel all that cheap or just placed on here for a thrill very rarely did some of the more quiet or acoustic moments on here move me there quite a bit of shorter quieter tracks on here that that kind of meander like I said the two tracks toward the end on this thing are pretty great cantos nine eighty four starts off very quietly and has a slow and subtle build toward it's very apocalyptic end and the track bell when it stops in the middle and kind of transitions into a completely different thing is is a nice little segue too but the song to me doesn't really get all that enthralling until it really starts rocking out you know I think these guys have pulled together a nice equal mix of of quiet soft and pretty sounds combined with some very heavy abrasive and extreme sounds but I think dweller on the threshold definitely has more prowess when it comes to one versus the other but if these guys continue to maintain this array of influences as I will definitely be checking out their next record and be very interested in where they kind of take this varied style into the future kind of feeling the light too decent six on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why what should i review next oh and if you want to hear this it's kind of a for a pay what you like kind of deal over at the enemies list website so keep that in mind Anthony Fantana dwell around the threshold forever 
M4yjv2a4Pt4,it's be making time hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and time for a review The Flaming Lips and Hedy Twins The Flaming Lips are a psychedelic rock band with plenty critic and fan acclaimed albums under their belts they're a band that's kind of built a reputation on making music that is in a lot of ways fun very colorful sometimes very accessible and catchy especially in the case of the soft bulletin or Yoshimi battles the robots but the band is also wildly experimental now while most bands tend to kind of settle into a sound or an idea or a style in their old age The Flaming Lips are doing the exact opposite after about 30 years of making music together instead of trying to maintain their career by being as predictable as possible to their fans they are embarking on all these strange projects that make me wonder whether or not any of them are suffering from the beginning stages of early onset dementia ever since the release of embryonic great album by the way Wayne Coyne and the band has just been focused on not really putting out full-length studio LPS but just doing things I'm not sure they would be able to sustain if it were not for the fact they have so many great albums celebrated albums and their back catalogue like an album length cover of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon these short collaborative releases including artists like Neon Indian lightning bolt Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band and a 24 hour song encased in a mini harddrive encased in a gummy candy skull but out of all the band's latest exploits this The Flaming Lips and Hedy Flynn's is the most sort of approachable somewhat accessible and album like thing that they have released but it hasn't really been garnering that much attention outside of hardcore fans for several reasons in a way it's sort of a compilation featuring tracks from these previously released collaborative EPS if you want to call them that that featured artists that I mentioned earlier and this thing was pretty much a vinyl only Record Store Day release which from what I understand is sold out right now so good luck getting a copy plus I'm sure some of the collaborators on here just the sheer number of them might have intimidated some fans not only because of who they are but because of how an album like this might be perceived oh it's filler it's just a bunch of crummy songs why would the Flaming Lips have this person on this record and how do they even get this person to agree to be on this album and perform to their specifications in this given track lots of guests on this album raised those questions not just a few Biz Markie Kesha Erykah Badu Chris Martin of Coldplay essentially this album is 13 tracks with a handful of interludes and each song has its own little special musical guest and like I said some tracks on here have been previously released but others are entirely new but but but Flaming Lips really structured this album to flow as a very cohesive project and all the guests on this thing appear on these tracks in a very Gorillaz album style capacity where they kind of play an actor role and The Flaming Lips are doing their best to direct this person through the madness they have written and overall I think they do a great job of that because there's not one single song on this album where I feel like the star power or the image of the guest taking part in the track overpowers the song itself believe it or not I think Kesha is actually fantastic on the opener she adds a really kind dark and sinister vibe to an already dark and sinister song 2012 where the lyrics are kind of about becoming obsolete and maybe the world coming to an end the track just seems so apocalyptic especially considering how noisy it is just these guitars to sound so freakin distorted and abrasive I really would not recommend turning this album up to loud because to me just the guitar sounds especially on this opening track are like razor blades getting shoved directly into your ear canals but the groove and the melody and the hook on the song are just kind of so fun and catchy I can't say no despite the the very slight pain there's this very jungle primal garage rock beat to the song and these very kind of psychedelic ah whizzing by in a very colorful way the bony bear track right after this one I thought was great too I love the the muddy drumbeat on the song how it felt so obscured and and just the very airy atmosphere of synthesizers that are slightly distorted to kind of just coloring everything surrounding the lyrics and the song itself and Boni Vera forces is locked in the background kind of vocalizing in a very slightly auto-tuned kind of way and I like the emotion that he adds to this track kind of about a romantic relationship where one person has up and so is the other person but one person just happens to be up in a good way while the other in a bad way the track helping me retard it to find God featuring Edward Sharpe I thought was okay I didn't really feel like the song itself in terms of the chord progression or the melody or anything like that was was all that unique the sounds surrounding the track were certainly strange certainly quirky but the tune didn't really hit me as being all that fantastic I guess I kind of felt the same way about the tame impala track on this album while I am pissing and moaning the Yoko Ono tract to me felt a little too repetitive in the Erykah Badu tract though very beautiful and pretty with her vocalizing in this in this very distorted sea of ambience is little daunting at ten minutes in length but really those are my only issues with this album the track supermoon made me pee featuring preview 73 is really awesome and how it builds up in this very intense way they're these shakers kind of splashed with it with a nice touch of reverb buzzing guitars and since lo-fi drums kind of playing this very fast roll and I love how everything is so obscured by this lo-fi and grainy recording and yet it is so just enthralling and exciting and colorful the track that ain't my trip with Jim James from My Morning Jacket is heavy and just kaleidoscopic with color and the lyrics are hilarious right at the first line he's singing about this person who is singing to wanting to shave his balls but batting his trip I love Nick caves mad man's style rant on song you man human he just comes off so intense and attention demanding as usual it's to be expected from the guy and the lightning bolt feature on the track I'm working at NASA on acid has a very nice David Bowie Space Oddity esque intro where it's kind of funky kind of psychedelic very spacious and dramatic but then lightning bolt kind of interjects right in the middle to build things up to this really epic explosion the track becomes hectic and pummeling just as it sort of fizzles out the same way it kind of started the track is David Bowie dying which features in the on Indian has this heavy guitar on it that twangs and echoes like something out of a spaghetti western it's kind of like tripping on acid in the middle of the desert and the track girl you are so weird with new fumes is I think one of the most fun songs on here I love the way the keyboards kind of dip and out of tempo on the verse but then when the chorus comes around everything tightens up and just explodes in a really aggressive way and the final track on here with Chris Martin is actually kind of hauntingly beautiful his voice sounds so just pitch perfect and shellack I would say sort of reminds me of something off of that first perfume genius record overall I thought this thing was really great listen I know the other collaborative releases that Flaming Lips put out recently did not go over too well but taking all of these songs released an unreleased and placing them together on one album has made all of them really really potent I think you don't really get an opportunity to have a dream fantasy of what you think of Flaming Lips collaboration with a certain artist should sound like so it's definitely easier to go into this album without any kind of preconceived notions and just sort of enjoy it for what it is there are lots of variety among these tracks tons of highs and lows beauties and uglies and everything in between but kind of feeling as strong I wish time machines existed so that I could go back in time and force myself to buy this on vinyl like I should have on Record Store Day what do you guys think about this album did you love it did you hate it why was it surprisingly consistent considering the sheer amount of guests and varying musical minds on this LP to you let me know Anthony Fantana The Flaming Lips Eddy Flynn's 
KonQ_39B0uU,Hey still mad yes what you did was unforgivable hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a review billy woods history will absolve me billy woods is an elusive DC MC and according to his label backwoods studios this is his second official full-length solo album and his first in 8 years of course between the releases of these two albums he spent a good deal of his career being one half of these super cron flight brothers but now he is back at sort of a lone wolf capacity with this album and i would say a lot about what Billy woods does has progressed since his last LP the chalice pretty much everything from the recording to the beats to billy's personality and flow it's it's really an improvement on all fronts now even though this album does have great great production ultimately it's Billy what attracts me to this LP he's got this really tough as nails persona but it does not feel like pointless posturing throughout the album which I really hate but he doesn't really spend all that much time bragging anyway where I get all this toughness from it's just the really gruff and raw vocal delivery that he has in his rhymes he's just really attention-grabbing to me as soon as I heard him I just figured man a guy this angry and emotive has got to have something important to say something interesting to say and thankfully that is the case between the 20 tracks on this album there are some songs on here that are kind of loose in terms of subject matter just kind of all over the place throwing out lots of just sharp criticisms lots of punchlines and plays on words and these days when a lot of MCS try to embark upon that kind of thing I end up kind of tuning out the MC and just vibing with the B but I don't really feel that way with Billy woods because even when he is all over the place lyrically he's still dropping gems like the opening line on the track crocodile tears which is clearly aimed at other rappers 32 bars and how you rob and kill your neighbors and still have the nerve to ask God to save you and the problem with the army is they want to be the boss the problem with secret police is they're like a dirty gun you can't toss so yeah there is some really great smart free-range lyricism on this album that that ranges from being pretty hot to good but for me Billy is at his most potent when he has a subject matter he's focusing on and there are a lot of odd about tracks on here doing that like the track cash for gold which miracle II paints a portrait of strip clubs strip club life these women who are kind of subjecting themselves peddling their bodies for just chunk change and then kind of talking about the guys who go to these places and depicting them as just being soulless apes with no compassion who are kind of there to just pretend they're rich and make it rain and and put their child support money into g-strings or the track Bill Cosby which is about this father who shouldn't have even really been a father in the first place and wished he never had kids or gotten in this relationship and now he's just growing to be this bitter freakin jerk the track DMCA is really sharp criticism of the music industry and music fans and the Internet age kind of just downloading uploading and then deleting from their computers every piece of music that they listen to kind of this really disgusting purge cycle the track Pompilius is really intense track talking about just war crimes and military violence and injustice now billy has this flow where he doesn't really ride the groove the track he's on too hard but he is on tempo the Rhymes and his verses just kind of come together like part rapping part ranting making him sort of a combination of an emcee and just an all-out madman in a way he kind of reminds me of MF DOOM and that he has really dark and gritty personality with a very very consistent flow but Billy woods also kind of reminds me of guys like del the funky homosapien where he's very up and in-your-face making these just unapologetic tell-it-like-it-is observations left and right and he's got this really kind of forceful delivery and this affinity for very unorthodox instrumentals that also reminds me of guys like LP or projects like cannibal ox to me the guests on this album can be kind of hit or miss some of them just indulging in the kind of posturing that Billy does not do hence why I like him now the production on this thing to me is just stellar but Billy has a history of rapping over unconventional stuff on his last album he rapped over a Velvet Underground sample of all things and I'd say he's even getting more adventurous this time around with guys like Willie Green am breakups Marmaduke NASA and man mantas on the beats the opening track is really kind of dark and murky and gives the feeling of Billy woods kind of crawling very slowly out of this swamp to return to hip-hop again in a solo capacity and the track crocodile years is the ass-kicking face-punching track that this album needed to really get things started I love the skipping guitar leads on the tractor we sharp synthesizers the track body of work has this really slow lumbering tempo that goes along with the vocal sample really well the vocal sample is this woman's voice singing about breaking rocks in a chain gang and just the tambourine on the track resembles that of a chain rat in just the heaviness of the bee just feels like you're slaving away breaking rocks I love the mournful strings on the opener the really quirky piano on the track Bill Cosby adds to the comedy of that track in a big way and the track headband is just one gigantic Led Zeppelin sample there's not a beat on this thing that I didn't think was at least good the only spot on this album instrumentally that I didn't care for as much was the track pump up the volume where the singer Lorenz is featured on the track and her voice just kind of flies out of nowhere against another sample and that kind of feels like it's just thrown on to the beat in a really sloppy way though that seems to have been done purposely I still don't really love it outside of that there's not really much I could say that's bad about this album I do think it tends to drag on a little too long maybe a leaner album would have hit me with with more force but there are so many great lyrics on here and fantastic instrumentals that re listening and relisting and re listening can be extremely rewarding kind of feeling a late decent 8 on this thing what do you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh Billy woods forever [Music] [Music] 
C8P5toKtQIU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time to kind of give a round up of some of my favorite albums of this month for me April has been extremely fruitful in terms of fantastic albums let's run down some of my favorites for one the new self-titled zmuda LP produced by fronted by ex member of the books Nixa Mutoh a very fun colorful and experimental pop and rock album that sticks in the back of my head just because there are so many different sounds and textures and an abstract ideas flowing throughout but it's it's so catchy next the new high on fire record Durst family as me as me vermis mystery is says look it's it's their latest album it's extremely heavy aggressive pummeling and all the more memorable for it really great riffs fantastic guitar solos the band is definitely released one of their darkest records this time around next bad bet not goods BB ng to these guys who are Canadian jazz trio that cover electronic music hip hop music reinterpreting it in a classic jazz fashion but they have all of these really interesting production techniques that that make them more akin to beat music producers in a way not only is this thing a free download but it's also one of my favorite albums of this year and one of my favorite jazz albums for a while also released this month spiritualize sweetheart sweet light these guys are a UK rock group that incorporate tons of extra instrumentation into their songs piano brass strings woodwinds but that doesn't really suck the energy or the emotion out of their tracks in fact I think it empowers some of their songs especially on the lead single to this LP hey which ends in this really noisy cacophonous psychedelic baroque jam hardcore fans may not see it as amazing as the band's previous work but I still think it's a really solid release a noise rock album from the band Brooklyn band white Suns sinew from what I understand this is the group's sophomore LP if you like your noise always to be more noise than rock be very disjointed and intense then this is the album for you this next release may end up being one of my favorites of this year we will see Death Grips the Money Store and extremely abrasive and experimental just boundary shoving hip hop album that is very uncompromising incorporates elements of noise industrial electronic music as well as rock and hip-hop all in this very overwhelming mishmash of ideas that I have yet to see a hip-hop album create in this way with this level of intensity and finally one of the most bright and uplifting metal albums I have heard in a while torches hermanas craft these guys make metal music that is so heavy but heavenly so pummeling but also so positive I think it could make it really easy for people who aren't even really fans of metal to get into this easily enjoy the riffs enjoying the hooks just enjoy the vibe the sound the richness of the music on this album and that was quick those are my picks pretty much for this month of my favorite LPS released in April what do you guys think did you like any of these albums did you hate them and what other albums did you enjoy this month and I mean really enjoy thanks for watching recommendations you're the best 
c1LHWTKqFcI,hi everyone the Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review torch her mana craft I'm saying a torch it's how I'm gonna say it torch these guys are a florida-based doom stoner sludge metal band that I've been a fan of for years now around five years or so but this is the first time I'm actually reviewing any music of theirs torch does not really have the best or most celebrated sound in this style of music but nonetheless they are in their own lane especially on this new album hermano craft torch is a part of this new breed of metal group that emphasizes thickness heaviness just brutal rumbling guitar riffs just the kind of sonic frequencies that specialize and just reach down in your gun shakin everything up but I would not say especially these days with with this album torches style does not come off brooding or dark or overly aggressive like a lot of bands that perform this kind of music and a lot of elements add up to this feeling for one instead of very screamed or forceful vocals frontman Steve Brooks sings in a very clean delivery and he always gets his vocals mixed in a way where they just soar over the mix leaving this jet stream of of firework explosions and rainbows behind the distortion on the guitars isn't too abrasive it feels much brighter this time around in comparison with the band's last full-length LP meander fall the band pumps out a lot of songs and a very punked out manners sticking to lengths that are around sometimes one to two minutes and the hooks this LPR extremely catchy which is to be expected with torch and even though their brand of stoner metal has always had a really strong early strong element of melody in some songs that is just increased tenfold on this album and it's kind of added up into some tracks that to me feel a little bit like a power ballad or like an arena rock song something that I really see like lighters blazing - specifically the melodic bridge on reverse inverted or the introduction on the track kiss me Dooley I mean the overall mood of this album is really uplifting and just positive even the slower and heavier moments on this LP have a very positive vibe to them I think like the track solitary traveler which has these numerous layers of guitars just creating a really heavy atmosphere and the song actually reminds me of a few tracks from torches previous LP me and earth all but it uses its heaviness to be heavenly the volume of this album the ribs the solos all of it brings together this feeling of just overwhelming joy rarely is an album this loud and this pummeling is throttling joyous and I like how torch work to really make every song on here have its own personality to an extent the track letting go which is the intro on here sets the really bright uplifting tone for this LP the drumbeat on the song and the vocal melody - just makes me feel like I'm about to embark on this epic metal fantasy journey the track kicking right after it is one of the catchiest tracks on here very melodic guitars over the verse and the the build-up up to the hook is just massive and when the hook finally kicks in and just slows everything down and brings those massive guitar riffs and it's just pure ecstasy and the track reverse inverted as a fan to cook and is very much one of the slower and heavier songs on the album but throws out this off-kilter sort of groove this off time signature that is played out very naturally by these guys yeah the track sky trials is the shortest on here for me just just over a minute in length and extremely faster to the point really epic vocal part at the end and I loved how it segues into the song roaming right after even though a lot of these songs are very catchy very very poppy torch really has an obvious focus on the overall flow of the album with how one song will sort of hit just as another one meets maybe a sudden stop the title track on here is a really tight instrumental and just like on me and earth all torch saves its heaviest and darkest moments for the end of the LP the closer which it's pretty heavy in comparison to other tracks on this album but the band has definitely been heavier in the past and I think the band replaces that darker and just more brutal mood with something that is adequate for me in a way and I feel like a lot of people could come by this and say hey you know what this is just kind of a torch as usual album even though the group is making efforts to change its sound up a little bit to the point where I think people who are not even into metal and loud rock can enjoy this thing maybe I am splitting hairs a little bit and separating torch from the rest of the pack more than some people would but the only album in in recent memory for me that has taken such a heavy sound and tried to make it so easy and fun to listen to is possibly that last Mastodon record the hunter and and I was really into that record as far as sludge stoner doom metal whatever you want to call it goes torch for me is the sweetest band out there it's pretty much like doom desert not something I'd want to eat every single minute of the day this album is by this music standards pretty sugary still very pivotal part of the meal if you've got a room for it kind of feeling a light to decent ate on this thing you guys think of this LP do you love it do you hate it why I think you should try it out and maybe try to answer some of those questions for me be nice love you Anthony Fantana torch forever 
z_e1slzjAow,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd kind of reviewing something not necessarily music though rather a medium you guys may be familiar with the record label clown and sunset it was founded by and is run by electronic music producer Nicholas jar the guy put out one of my favorite albums of last year he put out my favorite EP last year and easily easily he performed my favor set at South by Southwest this past March I'm excited for what he's gonna do with this label into the future but now I'm feeling maybe a little bit skeptical now that the first big release of clam and sunset this year is going to be a cube a prism there's a picture of it here it's kind of a promo photo and just from the looks of this picture I thought it was gonna be much bigger but in fact this is what it's like in real life now the sound quality itself on this don't break my love compilation is fantastic it's really good sound but I do not really enjoy being limited just strictly to headphones I do like listening to music on my big stereo although I do like the fact that it has two headphone jacks kind of fostering listening together to the cube that's something that I wish I phones iPods just more digital mobile music devices had but still the press releases about this cute kind of talked about the importance of the medium the physical package of the music the presentation of the music and while this definitely has some kind of unique presentation to it is it really a real analog is real vinyl is real tape is real CDs and mp3s are ones and zeros and the thing is this is ones and zeros too because inside is it it's not no it's a computer chip the battery like I said I do appreciate this this new medium that Nicholas is trying to release music with although it is going to be released for $40 when it officially comes out and has just about 12 tracks on wax on wax on I have seen a tracklist for the cube online but I can't even really say if it's the one that's on mine because a lot of the material on this cube is unreleased I think that's cool but I wish this thing we're a little bit more user-friendly than it was kind of pretty I guess because there's there's no real start or any directions or anything labeled or anything like that you just kind of throw your headphones in if there's a light the button does kind of help you skip through tracks stop pause and play and when you take your headphones out of this thing as the press release says when the prism is unplugged a beam of light passes through the empty Center revealing a void someone is missing well this magical someone is missing beam of light also kills the battery on this cube thankfully climb and sunset provided this 8th inch jack 2 USB cord to plug into the cube and then plug into the computer to charge the cube making the cube feel even more like an mp3 player however I cannot plug the Cuban and listen while the cube is plugged into the computer because I get this low level oscillating electronic hum behind all the tracks ruining them completely and if I keep the cube plugged in for a while and I have other things also plugged into the USB ports on my computer I get this lovely error message telling me that the cube is sucking up too much power and that my computer is going to turn off other USB devices plugged into my computer because just this thing is just a electricity guzzler so I mean it is an interesting I do think this thing is cool but I wish more was considered on the side of functionality the cube is scheduled to come out later this year do you plan to pick up one of these musical prisms because it may totally be worth it if some of these kinks that I just talked about get worked out in this final version this is still from what I understand kind of a preliminary thing is this kind of presentation is this kind of thing going to save the future of physical music or is this just another mp3 player put into a different package is it important for labels to do things like this in order to keep people interested in buying music what do you think Anthony Fantana cubes forever 
3Fw_fariB2A,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review actress our IP actress is the pseudonym of music producer Darren J Cunningham and so far this guy's musical career has been consisting of producing tracks that play toward the the settlers side of electronic dance music relying more on interesting sounds and textures to make his songs powerful as opposed to high volumes and and really hard-hitting rhythms his music definitely has a magnetic pull for fans of guys like Nicholas Jar Pantha do prints and going back to listen to his old work I really love the the very grainy quality to his 2008 album haze evil it was energetic enough to just make me want to move but also quiet and experimental enough for my own private dance floor now two years ago the album splash that actress released had much more variety not only taking sounds from from old-school Detroit techno but also the UK electronic music scene where actress comes from as well and the project also started incorporating some heavy heavy influences from ambient music too and on this new LP actress is sounding more ambient than ever really taking it back with the drums and the Bryson's there's nothing very overt about this album much of what happens on this LP is very implied an example would be the second track on this ms/ms miss thing ascending there's this very very lightly lightly pulsating rhythm in the background against use these glistening synthesizers it sounds like listening to a techno song on the radio but you're sort driving out of the range of the radio signal so you're losing a lot of the lows and the mids and only really getting some of the highs of course there there's some sort of some rough washes of white noise swallowing the music a little bit obscuring it to me this track represents just house music that feels so apocalyptic it paints pictures of of barren landscapes and desolate cities the first track to really win me over on this album though was the song jargon which is easily one of the most ambient songs on here it lasts around six minutes and it is not as constant as some of the other songs on here not really focused or hard-hitting rhythm or anything it pretty much sounds like a muddy metronome keeping time for this very spacious open and shy piano phrase just sort of blinking around in a really meandering but endearing way and there are these very soft electronic glitches kind of keeping tempo for the song as well and they are just whisper quiet I really feel like actress is just releasing his inner Brian Eno and the track serpent and shadow from fry fry fry fry from guitarists those tracks bring the fort of the floor beads back that you would normally expect from actress assuming you've heard his previous two LPS but I would say here he does it with some much weirder sounds now even though I am going gaga over some tracks on this album I'm not in love with this thing by a long shot because to me this is very much an unwelcome kind of 180 for actress and I'm not even talking about this album being slightly more ambient than usual for actress the some of the more ambient tracks on here are my favorites what I'm talking about is I feel like a lot of the songs on this thing I think are not as developed as material on splash and Hayes evil there are a lot of great sounds and ideas on here but a lot of the tunes that those ideas are in come in and fade out so quickly they don't really leave an impression though the sounds on our IP and holy water and aerials Blackheart though those tracks appeal to me sonically how quickly they're over just does not mmm sit well other tracks on here that managed to breach that three or four-minute mark just kind of fade out in a really lazy way without having developed a climax or much of anything I guess it's great that actress wants to step outside the traditional expectations for a song you know who says a song has to be a certain length but me personally I only wish that some of these songs were longer because some of the ideas they put forward are so good and I wish that they would go deeper progress more and then I mean I'm sad to say but this LP does not really feel like much of an album to me at all it feels more like a compilation of rough ideas sketches few b-sides actress is able to pursue so many sounds in electronic music and and conjure up some really interesting ambient hybrids too but there's no real common thread bringing all of these tracks together for me nearly every other song kind of feels like a detour a departure that's that's my main gripe with this album plus there are a few tracks specifically that I do not care for at all the really slow spaced out groove on the track tree of knowledge is kind of interesting at first but waiting for that track to go somewhere is really you like waiting in line at the grocery store to get checked out and the synthesizers on marble plexus I don't like it at all they just kind of stumble across the really constant rhythm in a very clumsy way kind of like a drunk guy trying to find his footing on his walk home from the bar at 3:00 a.m. there are some highlights for for fans of actress but but but but I'm kind of feeling that a strong five to a lay six on this LP what do you guys think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next any Fantana actress r.i.p forever 
XxbkE90hv38,you are just laying there you've been laying there for a while well I'm gonna do something about it hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's white son's sinews white Sons is a Brooklyn mouth noise punk trio and this is their sophomore LP it's out now on load records it's six tracks lasts around 30 minutes and despite the brevity it is a very intense listen now despite this being noise rock noise punk it's not really your very rockin with heavy catchy blood pumping side of this style of music white Sons is much more heavy much more artsy not really looking to rock you but instead perform brain surgery on on anyone willing to listen to their music through the ear canals with tons of ear piercing guitar feedback improvised drums and some very disturbing abstract lyrics if I had to boil this album down to a phrase it's kind of like a really raw chaotic noise rock poetry slam and for a three-piece that is guitar bass they come up with some pretty interesting sounds there are lots of low-end drones feedback that flies into various pitches there are some sounds that I'm not even sure how these guys are even making them to be honest like I'm a song see know where there's this guitar kind of hanging in the left channel that's lame it kind of brought me back to the first time I heard Health another noise rock band that is much catch here than white Suns by comparison but I was pretty perplexed by a lot of the sounds they were producing too either I am perplexed by the sounds of a given track or I am just so in love infatuated with how jagged and how angular some of the songs these guys write are right right the opener of this album fire sermon just burns and in Sears with all these layers of feedback that are constantly changing the track even though it is not really putting forth any real constant drum beats or a groove or a rhythm of pattern or anything it just stays so tense and the song eventually explodes into this flurry of a very tight blazing drums and quickly strum guitars whose chords I think are like the key of Z the next track has these floor tom drum rolls that I love that are constantly speeding up or slowing down and there are these very twittering guitar noises that make me think of like metal hitting glass or like a swarm of spiders heading toward me or something it creeps me I'm just thinking about it the track footprints fill the third song on here is easily the most Rocking on this entire thing it just has these relentless syncopated drum and guitar chords hitting together over and over and over and over it is like getting bashed over the head with a hammer until your skull caves in one thing I do think is is kind of exceptional about this record is the band is always changing the shapes of its riffs or they're building a song up they're winding it down there's always some kind of shift going on they're basically saying hey you know what true traditional song structures screw courses and refrains we don't want any of that but even though these guys are really working hard to to be outside of that that structure they do organize their songs white Suns really places all of its ducks in a row on a lot of these tracks with some very clear and impressive transitions linking one section of a track to another I like the feeling of intensity why suns has that but I also like the feeling of progression of going somewhere and white Suns has that his well however I'm not saying this album is going to be a walk in the park it may not necessarily click the first time around it didn't with me but the sounds were so interesting that that I continued being intrigued and wanting to return to this album because I've been listening to it on and off for a little bit so though it may not all appear in a really obvious way at first there is a method to the madness of these songs and if you want to talk about madness the vocals on this album are pretty maniacal pretty twisted now I can't really say hey on this track the vocal delivery was was especially Minaya no I can't say that because that's the case with every single track here I do wish the vocals did present a little bit more variety either you're hearing these these really extreme ragged screams or a very kind of deadpan narration but despite the fact that I may have wanted a little bit more these two you know styles do match what's going on with this album very well the song temple picks things up with this really kind of slow crushing groove yeah I kind of imagine in my head that this is what it's like to be very slowly eaten alive by something that is around two or three times your size with these giant metallic guitar cort teeth crushing down on you with every bite the closer is great to with with these very kind of primal drum beats that to me just stopping and starting and stopping and starting and then eventually it just kind of all ends as the big fat noisy broken sounding bill kind of clang even though it is noise rock music and sounds very modern there's something so kind of ritualistic and ancient about this particular track I did come at this thing with a few gripes I do feel like the production the recording on this thing could have been better could have added to the intensity of the sound um a lot I do think white Suns is sounding better than ever their production that recording is definitely of a higher quality in comparison with their first album the sounds are definitely brighter more resident bolder but the vocals were a little more distanced that I would have liked him to be the drums were much more distanced than I would have liked them to be they kind of sounded like they were recorded with two or even one microphone placed far away from the drums just with a lot of ambient noise and everything but the guitars felt so close this album just has an incredibly dark and sick energy to it that I love that I think has made a lot of the the best noise rock records out there great I'm not necessarily saying this is one for the history books but this was definitely an incredibly solid listen with some great songs that I'm going to remember by the end of this year and a nice little detour a nice noisy detour for me in my listening trajectory kind of feel a little strong 7 - a light 8 on this thing what did you guys think of it if you've heard this album did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next forever 
vcTtK_FlGsU,you can have a carrot if you wake up look right there I got the loser edition of this be satisfaction album but I feel like a winner hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd time for a review jack white blunderbuss jag white is a detroit singer-songwriter detroit originating singer songwriter he currently operates out of Nashville Tennessee and between his record label Third Man Records and all of the artists he's collaborated with over the years released records for over the years and celebrities too not to mention the numerous bands he's been in this guy has a nice little musical Empire for himself and it's all fueled by his great songwriting and strong guitar playing and his love for blues rock and garage rock gospel and soul and vinyl records now I know jack best as one half of the white stripes I assume that's how most people know him best with the very bright and rich guitar leads that were all over those white stripes records with huge huge guitar chords just smothered and distortion as well as some really fat husky drumbeats coming from from egg white it was hard not to feel like they were simultaneously saving old-school rock and roll but also presenting something completely new after the fantastic album elephant though I kind of fell off the wagon with the white stripes between get behind me Satan the rat count tours the dead weather Jack was just not making music that I cared for but this new LP new solo LP is a little bit of a return to form that I think a lot of fans and rock writers who have followed Jack for a long time are going to enjoy tracks like I'm shaken and 16 saltines will most definitely appeal to an old-school White Stripes fan who really loved the harder side of the duo 16 saltines has these booming tough-ass drums and these amplifier on fire guitar chords that just make me wish I had really long hair so that I could throw it around in every direction as I do this and the track I'm shakin is is really tough as well that has a huge gospel trip going on especially on the vocal breaks between the guitar parts when Jack is singing it sounds like it could have been a white stripe song but it is fleshed out with these very dazzling female background singers it's it's a nice touch and that's another thing that may appeal to people about this album hearing Jack White's usual songwriting style completely unadulterated in the way that it would be in the white stripes but fleshed out a little bit more with extra instrumentation whether it be synthesizer organ electric piano some saloon piano background singers some pedal steel as well the song on and on and on has this really elegant string introduction on it and the song take me with you has this very Dave Brubeck take five piano groove going on I love love the jazzy woodwinds on the track love interruption one of the first singles from this album and of course Jack continues evolving his more experimental guitar sounds like on the track wheat themselves to sleep on the bridge there are these dueling guitar solos and the left and right channels but they both sound like they're being played out of these busted glitchy stuttering amplifiers and it has this really disorienting effect that I love jack is just a musical madman and no matter how poppy are just accessible his songs gay you can always look forward to little weird detail like that to pop up in his songs now despite some new production sounds on this thing overall this album kind of makes me feel like it's 2003 all over again spots on blunderbuss feel so close to moments and I mean specific moments on the White Stripes sophomore album on white blood cells on elephant I mean like songs I'm bound to pack it up dead leaves in the dirty ground I'm finding it hard to be a gentleman I just want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart the balance but it's close to his his old sound because I mean let's face it it's not really that old as close to his old sound as Jack gets on this album there is still mmm something about it that feels less wild less free less exciting less dangerous I guess and and kind of rehashed like a White Stripes Chop Suey with you know the occasional fresh ingredient added here and there just to make it feel different I would say Jack keeps up his lyrical game though by talking about some really strange relationship dynamics dangerous love interests and infatuations as well as some characters who just kind of live on the fray like the girl he's singing about in the track 16 saltines and the falsetto vocals on that track just kind of add to the eccentricity of the persona being sung about I love the lyrics on the track missing pieces where Jack is talking about how when someone exits a relationship with you they essentially take a piece of you with them but Jack kind of literally talks about like missing body parts freedom at 21 kind of talks about how because this woman Jack is with has freedom in in the 21st century because of the suffrage well it seems that this has made the tables turn according to Jack and and now he is is suffering physical violence from from this person he's loving and of course the song love interruption has pretty much the the idea the concept of love being very physical and violent with Jack and he's pretty much welcoming it even when I'm not really into the melody of song or the chord progression or whatever I can usually rely on Jack to continue to be clever and entertaining with his words which is great Jack still manages to you know kind of surprise me in that department but he doesn't really push me or much of anything musically on this album like I said there are some extra pieces of instrumentation here and there but to me it's it's just a little bit of window dressing because a lot of these songs that they're core don't have a lot of mm to them like the pedal steel performance on the title track just felt so plain I kind of feel the same way about the the piano playing on the track hypocritical kiss because there are more instruments to keep track of I feel like nothing is really being played in a really strong or standout way on a lot of these songs same thing with the drumming the groove and the monkey on the bed lyrics on the track trash tongue talker - I'm not trying to say good chunk of this album is bad or anything just very underwhelming but like I mentioned earlier some of the extra instrumentation that lands onto this LP does knock it out of the park like the huge climactic ending on the closing track here and then again those woodwinds on love interruption are great I guess there just weren't enough rockers on on this album for me more ballads than I would have liked but the balance to me didn't feel especially moving or anything like that nothing in in the league of of Apple Blossom or I think we're going to be friends though track like hip eponymous poor boy does come really close that is a that is a cute and pretty heartwarming song and the track weep themselves to sleep I I do love that piano is so dramatic on that track and it is a heavy song I feel like I really can't say too much about this album on the side of positivity without still having these thoughts kind of twittering away in my head reminding me that oh yeah I don't like this part I don't like this part I think a lot of the songs toward the end kind of taper off and a really Oh kind of way I feel so on the fence and aggravates me because I thought this album was going to be just great given the the first two singles to drop from it before the release were we're stellar in my opinion yeah I know especially sixteen saltines sounded maybe a little bit too much like old school white stripes but the energy is there and that's ultimately what makes it so appealing for me and makes some of these songs kind of unappealing to me sometimes the energy the passion the fire is there and sometimes it sort of seems to be fading but the thing is you know I'm not really going to stress this review or how I feel about this album and and neither should you mostly because even though we've known Jack white for a long time this is his first official solo album and in a way I see this as a new beginning for him the guitar solos a lot of the songs the guitar tone and the lyrics on this thing I think are still really great just felt like this could have been so much better I guess kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this thing but what did you guys think did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next

Sx7w_3vZ3F4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review battles dross glop records stored a just happened this past weekend hope everybody had a good record store I got a few things one of which is the new high on fire record got that on vinyl double LP fantastic pressing really great album art I got that mc5 Afrika Bambaataa 7-inch I talked about in one of my videos and I totally completed my battles remix series like a complete nerd so now that I got all four of those remix 12-inches I figure hey you know it'd be a good idea let's review the dross Club album so battles is an experimental rock band that underwent some pretty big changes on its sophomore LP that got released last year gloss drop they had just lost a pivotal member of the group and they were kind of working through the change by bringing on a bunch of guest vocalists not only that but their tracks were feeling much brighter much more playful and upbeat to me the band was just taking its trademark tight sound in a much more colorful and bright direction on that second LP battles just had the intricacy of a math rock band which is not surprising considering the the group's ties to bands like Don Caballero and links but they also jammed like an improvisational rock group but these really hard intense relentless grooves it's almost nothing but fire on every track and the whole LP is just can to me I can't say no because of all those attributes gloss drop landed in my top 10 of favorite albums last year so of course I am totally interested in hearing a series of remixes for every single song from this album no matter how bad they are especially considering the lineup of people remixes these songs few I have have done reviews for Shabazz Palaces Hudson Mohawke the Field Jacket AMA I who was a guest vocalist on the last track from the album as well as code-nine and kangding Rey but-but-but I usually do not enjoy remix albums and I usually do not review them either for one there's usually not much in the way of a flow or consistency since what you're really talking about here at the end of the day is kind of like a compilation of different artists all remix in songs in their own way there's bound to be some stylistic clashing and rarely are remix albums so good that they appeal outside of the fan base of people who are extremely passionate about the album that is being remixed aka people like me but for a remix album Dras Club is pretty consistent I don't know how most of the people on this album ended up kind of cooking with the same ingredients I guess but a majority of the tracks on this album to me kind of ended up being very deep and micro house esque tunes with very constant rhythms that subtly subtly shift and progress over periods of six seven eight or even nine minutes some tracks are so faint with their changes and their sounds they almost border on being ambient not to say there is a variety on here those Shabazz Palaces definitely comes in and does its thing as well as Yaka Tama I which I will kinda talk about a little bit later I feel like I ended up disappointed with a good chunk of these tracks individually especially given who was remix in the song my life for what I thought code 9 would definitely put something together that was more akin to his dubstep roots it wasn't a bad remix I just thought maybe he played things a little too straight and I thought Hudson Mohawke would put together a serious banger on this album but he just whipped up a version of rolls Basie that sounds pretty much like the original but less is going on less original but less and I guess my even bigger disappointments with this thing are the moments where the tracks don't even resemble the originals in any way shape or form really to the point where I wonder what the remix and and the original really have to do with one another other than the fact that they're on this every artist on this thing is going to have a different remix in process and different thoughts I understand that but this album did get me thinking what makes for good remix and for me personally of course it has to feel different than the original noticeably different but also the point of reference the original needs to be so clear and obvious in a way that you end up seeing the original the remix material in a different light from a different perspective and that's where I kind of feel like the silent servant remix them and the cluster remix fall a little short because even though I'm sure it's somewhere there either influencing the keyboards being played or being sampled that point of reference that sonic point of reference isn't really there the track dominican fate has these lightly played keyboards placed on top of these quirky quirky beats there's not really a blatant sample on this track or anything like that it seems as if the keyboards and the drum machine which are pretty much the track itself were all original but still not really seeing that point of reference ultimately the song to me kind of sounds like a collaboration between OneNote Rick's point never and beach houses drum machine but I also feel like the my machines and an ice cream remixes would feel pretty far away from the originals too if it weren't for the fact that the vocals from the original songs are so obviously sampled and executed I will give it to Gang Gang dance and Brian Brian Brian I guess I was just kind of underwhelmed by a lot of these tracks the Shabazz Palaces remix I'm not as in love with now as I am when I first heard it the beat is very spacious as it would be on Shabazz Palaces last album black up palace ear Lazaro's vocals are doubled up soaked and reverb very bouncy trippy kind of psychedelic but the lyrics aren't that mind-bending or clever to me not as much as they have been with Shabazz Palaces tracks in the past you know it's not all complaints with this album though I did think the first several tracks were pretty solid the wallstreet remix has a really great groove and some swelling strings on the refrain that really make the track feel refined and the field remix on here sweetie and shag is great he totally brought that looping state of mind sort of execution making all of these cycling sections of sound feels so hypnotic and I thought the track future it was great too with this nice constant hip-hop beat backing up the chords of the song kind of playing in the foreground the thing is I did not think this remix album was terrible I liked most of the tracks but was really really only in love with a couple the biggest problem is that this remix album brings a completely different energy than gloss drop this album does not feel high-energy it does not feel fun it does not feel playful it does not really feel all that engaging in some points it does not feel high octave it doesn't feel like the entire world is is on fire and in M&M candy shell in contrast dross cloth is is just much more chill repetitive kind of relaxed with these very heady electronica tunes that may or may not even sound like the tracks that they are supposed to be remixed in or if you're a huge fan of some of the remixers on this thing kind of feeling a strong 5-2 ally six on this to be completely honest I mean yeah I thought it was thought it was likable to me but you know really mostly as a fan but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino dross Club forever 
mK54P7VeM1g,you know there's some people are actually in comas and their faces really get frozen like that really come on man hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Death Grips the Money Store Death Grips is a Sacramento based experimental hip hop trio featuring MC ride on vocals and Zack Hill and flatlander kind of handling the production behind things and the mixtape they put out last year ex-military ended up being my second favorite album of the year when it came time to do lists and the reason this landed is as second in my favorite albums of the years because it's such a forward-thinking hip hop album I'm not trying to say that it was really socially conscious or it's trying to save hip hop if Death Grips and ex-military were trying to save hip hop they were definitely going about it in a really weird way because that album to me just takes all of hip-hop's worst stereotypes and turns them up to a deafening val/val Vallon volume everything becomes extreme from the over modulation of really heavy bass and the beats to the overuse of violence and aggression in the lyrics and the vocal delivery with MC r I just really reaching levels of serial killers psycho insanity I would say Death Grips definitely takes influence from bomb-squad style production that was put together for some of Public Enemies best releases and songs as well as the really testosterone soaked third aggression that was on wu-tang's first album 36 chambers but Death Grips has taken these things so far that what they're making is no longer hip-hop but but hip-hop blended with elements of noise and industrial music in jittery electronica yeah the money store definitely has roots in traditional hip-hop but it is not an album for hip-hop traditionalists the beats for one are so freakin noisy sharing a lot of characteristics with the solo albums that that Zach Hill has been releasing over the years since since hella has kind of cooled down and the vocals the lyrics just gets swallowed and all of this chaos created by the instrumentals and the the screaming vocal delivery of MC ride just distorts the lyrics even further if you do concentrate really hard the lyrics on this thing are slightly readable you do kind of get a grasp as to maybe what sort of being said but Death Grips is fully conscious of this and how important lyrics and stories are in hip-hop which i think is is part of why the trio continues to post its lyrics in full with every single new song that they release and their lyrics worth reading into because they add a whole different different dynamic to the aggression that Death Grips presents the aggression and the violence that's that's glorified in a lot of hip-hop music especially in the mainstream with this album is just brought to such a high it becomes a grim reality not something to admire not something to like in his lyrics MC ride kind of paints himself as this character who is very violent paranoid intoxicated nearly all the time and living in extremely low life lifestyle kind of like the cover of this album it's something that feels like it's coming straight out of a really gritty graphic novel I can see all of MC rides exploits on this LP in the lyrics being depicted and really stark black-and-white images depicting bodies and bullets and blades and blood spray it's the kind of stuff that to me people would usually label horrorcore but because of how extreme Death Grips is sonically and in vocally they totally sidestep that label because now this album has kind of set the bar a little bit higher anybody walking down that road might as well be making Halloween music MC rides lyrics do kind of function beyond just gore though like on the song get got where he's kind of imagining police going after him that aren't really there and on the track I've seen footage he raps about the police brutality and violence that you see and that kind of fuels that that paranoia the track Lost Boys sort of seems to be this really dark tribute to anybody who's lost themselves in a gutter esque lifestyle Browne baggers thieves drug dealers highlighting with the hook just how far people can fall on the track hacker the lyrics are so out there and disconnected simultaneously name-dropping WikiLeaks Tesla and Lady gaga in a way that that kind of feels really glitchy and disorienting which the the song title kind of asserts and the track system blower kind of seems to be a bit of a double entendre obviously a car system comes to mind and that is referenced in the lyrics but with how violent MC ride gets with his words on a lot of verses in this track to me it kind of feels like he's also pointing his anger at the construct of systems possibly those tracks are great those tracks are fine but most of this album is loaded with violent violent make sure a parent is around kind of content blood-curdling images of cinder blocks being tied to feed and being tortured and blades again scars bubonic plague fire war bare-knuckle brawl z-- with people who are in punk wait sitting all the way through this album can be a lot like a Clockwork Orange and you're kind of tied to your chair and your islands er peel back and your being exposed all this horrifying soul rotting imagery sometimes the lyrics can be really over-the-top like on the track bitch please where the hook goes like bitch please you must be smoked Wow but that's kind of part of this really trashy unapologetic character that the MC ride depicts he's supposed to be an unlikable bastard I can't help but compare the character on this album to like walk a flock of flame except actually scary and aggressive and dangerous not this slick money-making gangsta image of aggression but no matter how gory the lyrics get MC ride is a character he is also a narrator he can't be him if you know what I'm saying be because I don't know of many drug-addicted cold-blooded killer Street dwellers who would use the words basilisk or lycanthropy in their rap verses the last thing I want to say about the lyrics though is that Death Grips just knows how to write a hell of a I got got got got oh it's such a long way down double-double every track on here is amazingly catchy which is a feat considering how ugly and harsh and unbinding this album is if you can withstand the force a lot of these tracks are gonna stick with you it's kind of like wanting to join a gang and then of course upon entry you get hazed and beaten up and abused but once you kind of make it through that initial rough spot you're in the gang and everything's cool on some tracks here MC rides verses and flow get really fast like a song get get get get God or double helix he makes used to be more kind of normal or quiet registers and his voice too and rapping on those songs which really gives this album a lot more variety in comparison with ex-military of course the lyrics no matter what register they're delivered that would not mean much if not for Death Grips production and I would say if there's one thing on this album that is done to perfection it is to stick with Death Grips usual style without bringing me into any major bouts of deja vu in relation to ex-military or the EP that came out before get down was the first single to come out from this LP and Death Grips I think really wanted to say hey we were gonna do something different this time around here is our quietest song yet there are these swirling synthesizers that kind of bleed into one another because of how grainy and lo-fi that sound quality is the vocals feel just claustrophobic ly close to the microphone they're these kind of twittering hi-hat drums in between some of the verses some very robotic lead vocal skips I love it the song fever by contrast the song right after is just pure hell the track is like listening to an alarm go off in the middle of a an underground government-funded lab where a genetically-engineered mutinous just broke out and is on the loose Zak Hills drums sound really ragged and his bass drum patterns on the psalm are insane tons of precision and the hook on this thing when the synthesizers come in it just sounds so slick just so freakin memorable the track Lost Boys takes a much different approach from the previous two tracks and is really airy and Atmospheric emcee rides vocals are just wrapped up in the atmosphere it sounds like he's rapping from the bottom of a low life well or all the terrible people he's rapping about live the beat is so austere on this track it skips quite literally like a broken record and is really hypnotic because of it the track right after blackjack is really mesmerizing too and the vocals have these kind of poltergeist s vocal sound reversals playing behind the rap verses that gives this song a really surreal quality and with this fence and the size are pulsating in the background with with some dissonant sentence as well it just feels like something out of a an 80s beast slasher movie Death Grips works on kind of topping it's dark and heavy tracks from ex-military like tachyon with songs on here such as system blower and the cage and Death Grips delivers some serious left hooks on this album too really surprisingly just when I thought I had their style pinned down song kind of example case in point I've seen footage which is this track that I feel like kind of was made just to tease the naysayers saying the Death Grips is not hip-hop because the song while staying completely Death Grips in just being abrasive being hip-hop being just so in-your-face the way the drumbeat works the distorted riff as well as emcee rides flow all call out to Golden Age hip-hop artists like Run DMC salt and pepper tone low and the track hacker as this beat that's kind of like this very danceable 80s style electro funk with MC ride I I would say kind of rapping but it sort of feels like spoken word too because he's really screaming just a lot of disjointed phrases and more than anything more than hip hop the track reminds me of like LCD soundsystem when James Murphy would set up a track with a really strong groove and then just go off on all these really insane ramblings but you know Death Grips has already wrapped over a link raised sample on ex-military so at this point really anything goes the track bitch please feels really kind of schizophrenic one moment you're hearing this rising fat synthesizer the next moment MC Wright is rapping in a Jamaican accent every few bars kind of presents a completely different sound it is just a blender of different ideas the track fucked that by far has the oddest groove onthis and thing right up there with Lost Boys man every track here musically just has its own personality just its own set of distinct characteristics there's just so much detail in these instrumentals I think that that gets so minut it would take hours to explain exactly what's happening with every single track but despite all this detailed Death Grips music does not really sound all that studied or wholly tiny or anything like that it's very fun music it's very straightforward noisy catchy overwhelming blood pumping music it is really visceral it is really in your face but once you kind of get a grip of what's going on and you adjust to the intensity it's easier to step back and see that the album required more of this than it did because not only is this LP really heavy and abrasive but it's also thought-provoking it's extremely layered and does not give up all of its secrets in the first second or even tenth listen despite being very loud to be completely honest I listened to ex-military a lot of times but this album still managed to kind of blow my mind Death Grips material so far has been building a really interesting new sound for hip-hop I'm not saying they're changing the game or anything like that I don't think that's the intention of this album at all instead the money store looks to kind of forge something for itself this thing is sitting on a throne of its own design and nobody's watching because the picture is just too horrifying to stare at from the cover of this album to the lyrics to the vocal delivery to the production everything about this LP is just unsettling is disturbing is surreal the words twisted and unforgiving come to mind too but so does the word rewarding to put it simply this album is to me a sonic portrait of a villain villains represent evil but the thing is each decade each generation is to come up with its own brand of villainy of its own brand of evil because the evil and the villains of the previous generations are going to to the current generation feel soft feel old hat things need to be updated Death Grips the Money Store is that successfully reinvented image of the villain or just villainy in general I'm loving this record freaking love in this record freaking freaking loving this record can't really say much else about it kind of feeling a strong 9 to attend on this LP what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why why do you hate it why seriously Wyatt why do you eat it and why do you love it - why do you love it let me know Anthony Fantana Death Grips [Music] 
LmFqBFeGADM,this is amazing hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review moonface heartbreaking bravery this is the third release to come out of this montreal-based yes Montreal not you're saying Canada I promise the Canadians I would get specific and if you really look at the the buzz or the lack thereof or the took took took took to talk kind of surrounding this project it's it's not really taking off that well there's kind of been an aura of of failure surrounding moonface since it came out of the gate and it's something that I think Spencer himself kind of puts onto the project just take the titling of the first EP for example the Dream Land EP marimba and and shit drums or take the titling of the debut album Oregon music not vibraphone like I'd hoped I feel like both of the two releases that moodface started out with kind of imply that yeah this is my music but it's not really the music I want to be making but that doesn't really seem to be the case with this new LP telling just from the lack of self-loathing in the song titles an album title and from the fact that Spencer is not just going solo this time around he's working with a full band actually a finished band by the name of sin I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly he a point being I think Spencer may be making music he wants to make this time around and I'll be honest I did not enjoy those two previous moon-faced releases definitely not as much as I'm enjoying this and I think even Spencer himself would not blame me for it for me being a guy that's enjoyed Spencer Krug songwriting for a handful of years now it's great to hear him in front of the full band again especially since a lot of stuff for Spencer kind of seems to be in limbo right now this project has not exactly started off very well and the two indie darling bands that brought him to where he is today are in the midst of an indefinite hiatus right now and there's really no sign of them being sunset rubdown and Wolf Parade coming back anytime soon and if you read into the very personal lyrics that Spencer has written for this album and and really just taken them for face value I'd say Spencer just went through a pretty ugly breakup which is sad but in a way I kind of feel like this is revitalized what Spencer is doing with his music because he really is one of those singer songwriters that has a very unique voice lots of character lots of a broto and his songs and his very emotional vocal delivery kind of thrives off of off of sadness and will also draw his songs out musically in really interesting ways the kind of sidestep your average verse chorus verse structure usually a Spencer Curt track requires a few extra lessons to really get into the meat of it and I guess on some level understand it but he's still not beyond writing a track that kind of hooks me up first listen a track that comes to mind is the song paper lease which was on that Swan Lake album enemy mine and appeared on that last sunset rubbed down LP - and now as far as the sound goes on this thing it does not at first on the surface appear to be all that much different than your average album that that Spencer is involved with Spencer's voice sounds just as emotional as ever sort of bordering on being kind of over the top there's just a perfect splash of reverb on there there's lots of Airy synthesizers shimmering and guitars drums that have quite a bit of ambience on them not a lot of punch more atmosphere and Sanai from what I understand is is more of an mental group with huge influences coming from the world of krautrock and that does show up on a few tracks here tracks like teary eyes and bloody lips and shitty city both have very driving rhythms strong synthesizers very electronic textures to the effects surrounding those songs but most of what's on this LP kind of feels like the band conforming to Spencer's songwriting which cukoo cukoo could be a good thing for the fans I guess if there is a notable change because of the subject matter of this album the drama seems to be turned up a little bit more than usual in a good way it's like Spencer really wanted the emotions on this album to feel really grandiose with these great large movements and and fireworks style explosions of sound like the opener which is also the title track it starts off with these sparse piano chords very repetitive floor tom drum beat some bouncy reverb but it eventually just blows up into these glistening keyboards and of course Spencer's singing throughout the track and his lyrics are a focal point as usual he's kind of telling the story of how to me from from what I interpret he is not the bloodthirsty carnivore that his partner needs him to be in order to stay interested and over the hook Spencer starts talking about the kill the the prey if you will and it turns out that this person who is with romantically is in fact the kill kind of unsettling the second track goes for something really grand to the these piano chords there's just something so perfectly theatrical about those chords and they just it kind of reminded me of a wedding or something but then a fire breaks out and everybody needs to rush out all at once which is a terrible horrifying thought but that's kind of the juxtaposition that you're getting with with a lot of tracks on this album you have this element of love this element of prettiness of beauty but then comes the hatred and the loathing and the the very dark feelings that are pulled into place by a breakup after this track though my love for this album starts to kind of wane the very Crowley elements that seneye brings to the table kind of comes into play on the next track Shady City and I guess I wasn't that big of a fan of them I usually like the style of music but to hear Spencer kind of singing over it with the same dramatic pauses that he puts on a lot of these tracks didn't really add much the momentum of the song for me Spencer kind of goes back to the drama of the first two tracks with the next song quick-fire I tried but but at that point I kind of felt like he was just throwing the same idea out there he already had the song to me felt a bit repetitive to just not that engaging the same thing with the track far away lighting the track headed for the door one of the first singles from this LP is pretty slow but it has a lot of suspense I would say in the and the explosions of synthesizer on the track too are pretty good as well the story is okay some of the rhymes door and door are not really doing it for me I kind of feel like the story is being guided by whatever Spencer can rhyme with the word door but I did like the last track on here though but pretty much for the same heavy and dramatic reasons that I like the first two tracks overall I kind of felt like this album was was big on emotion but kind of small when it came to detail and in variation - I feel like the more krautrock elements that sentai brings to the table were the only real points of difference plus the selfie doesn't really bring a lot of the very out-there lyricism that I usually expect from Spencer however a lot of songs on here do bring a really clear and impersonal story so clear and personal that that I felt as if I was kind of bearing the burden with Spencer's I listened to at least some of these tracks this is a very likeable album but I didn't really come close to loving it I still kind of feel like moonface has a lot of growing to do and while the story on this album kind of proves to be a very important chapter for Spencer personally it doesn't really feel like an important chapter musically I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a life seven on this thing but what did you guys think about it no really what did you think about this you heard it and you have thoughts as a result of this what were they positive negative why and what should I were review next anthony Fantana moodface you 
lmaCK2mGzd0,hi hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and doing right now a question comment thing today my question is do we respect the past do you and I us music community as a whole respect the past and I mean the music of the past and I don't mean do we enjoy the past I don't mean do we like the past that's different I mean do we RESP ECT the past enough to honor it and not exploit it most importantly do we respect the past enough to not turn it into a spectacle to me the answer has always been no but I kind of had confirmation of that this past weekend when I saw a hologram image of Tupac Shakur performing on stage at Coachella and he was doing everything he was grabbing his chain he was rapping he was posing he was saying what's up Coachella performing with Snoop Dogg and apparently this performance this concept has been in the works for several months and there are now talks of possibly taking the Tupac hologram on tour either with dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg or with some more current rappers for kind of a wider tour but I have to wonder is this the way we should treat the memory of one of the most important figures in hip-hop music I guess philosophically you could say that this is really not such a big deal a hologram is just a representation of something and part of the reason this instance is such a big deal is because it's the first time it's being executed in this way on such a grand scale and when you boil it down I guess making a hologram of Tupac is in a lot of ways the same as releasing a posthumous album by Tupac or releasing some video footage or releasing a movie used to be in or something nobody had access to before or to take it further what about Kurt Cobain baby beans Diaries that have been printed and reprinted over the years I guess it's not the worst thing in the world I'm sure somewhere there is some sort of veiled intention to pay tribute to Tupac and his music of course this intention is veiled by money don't we already have tons of ways of tributing artists already through music and movies and art I'm open to new in different ways but isn't this whole hologram thing a little corny I mean watching this Tupac hologram dance on stage was a lot like watching the Fab Four dance together and play their instruments in that Beatles rock band game isn't this hologram performance kind of like a Disney World thing a Universal Studios Orlando kind of thing of course there's always the question as to whether or not to pot would have actually wanted to be turned into a hologram and saying stuff like hey what's up Coachella and maybe a slew of other things he's never ever said in his life once they decide to program more things into the hologram once it goes on tour but nobody asks those questions when there's time to kill and we need to be entertained and there's a buck to be made you know what happens when this technology becomes more commonplace are we going to see Kurt Cobain fronting Nirvana again on tour are we going to see Biggie rapping are we going to see a Michael Jackson world tour what if this technology ever becomes so cheap that some underground artists I have kind of a personal connection with get hologram like J retard and this hologram is punching people in the face on stage who mess with him while he's performing you know I'm sure this whole hologram thing was really expensive to do but it just added up to kind of a cheap thrill it didn't really bring anything for me to the philosophy of Tupac to his body of work to his greatness and his charisma or his memory I actually think it kind of tarnishes his memory because you have a ton of people now who didn't really grow up on Tupac whose biggest impression of him now is this hologram as much as I would hate for a guy like Tupac to fall into obscurity it's an issue all artists have to deal with no matter how good the music they made was and I feel like doing stuff like this is just kind of prolonging that pain in a really ugly way the best thing you and I everyone can do for music is instead create and praise art that we think is great as great as the music that we love from the past because the things we're not going to do anything that's memorable into the future if we take every single opportunity we can to be nostalgic if we're putting all of our efforts into reliving what's already happened it's a new world out there let's act like it what do you guys think of this whole hologram thing was this a tasteful way to bring up Tupac's memory are you excited about the prospect of a Tupac hologram tour or maybe even your favorite dead artists being reanimated through Holograms was this kind of a one-time spectacle thing or do you see this being more common practice into the future let me know Anthony Fantan Oh Holograms forever 
fyGK13tSjsc,good minstrel your music has touched my soul in way no other song has strong 10 hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Quakers Quakers these guys are a hip-hop collective they have a new album out on the legendary record label stones threats threats threats throw records and this thing is a pretty hefty project it has a roster of of epic proportions at the base of this project is three producers 727 catalyst and fuzz face aka geoff barrow of portishead and on top of that you have 30 or so mcs spitting on an assortment of 40 or so beats that these three producers have have put together and you know i'll admit completely that I was very skeptical into this project i'm usually not really that big of a fan of hip-hop albums in this format these producer curated albums that kind of cherry-pick mcs and give each of them their own separate tracks kind of throw them all onto the same album in a mixed bag I usually don't find albums of this style to be that consistent cohesive coherent or focused a lot of the time for me the mcs that get invited onto these things don't even bring their best stuff either I mean you'd think that all the MCS that came together on producer curated albums from Jake one or mad labor 9th wonder would would end in it in a pretty fiery rat battle but just didn't didn't happen not the case to me these albums aren't as impressive as they could be because the mcs that you're listening to your only really getting a small tiny sliver of their persona the rhymes and the personality that they throw out it's really surface level and that's what pretty much happens on quakers because you have so many mcs on one album and they only had this little tiny sliver of time to spit on this beat that is one to two minutes long these guys don't really have a chance to go deeper with much of anything so most of the MCS on here kind of fall backwards lazily on this wu-tang style caustic humor braggadocio a shit oh shit the vocal samples and lyrics on this album even go forward to reference wu-tang a handful of times for me it's important to get something a little deeper than that from an MC when I'm listening to him or her rap especially since there are so many people on this album that are incredibly underground people that only really have a few notable features or mixed tapes to their name if that there are some bigger names on here like Prince PO and dead prez and there are some Stones Throw Records staples to affiliates from strong arm steady ma Dee aloe blacc guilty Simpson but even if you're a huge into underground hip-hop I guarantee that a good handful of people on this album will be new to you and to kind of go over the tracks they're a bit of a combination of the beat being better than the MC the MC being better than the BB BB they're just not really being much chemistry between the MC and the beat and those rare moments where it just all seems to come together and function properly the album starts off with sonata wats on the song big cat and he's got this really kind of heavy forceful persona in his flow that I like a lot and matches your dishes the dark beat behind him guilty simpson comes up on the next track and while i am not really a guilty simpson fan his hefty personality over this really husky horn hit in the beat is a nice combo and the album sadly starts to go downhill for me after that John Wayne on the track smoke is decent I think he picks a really interesting flow for that track over that rhythm but the synthesizers feel a little aimless track and are kind of overpowering tone 10 comes in with this kind of messy old dirty bastard swagger on the track what you want and it's a great beat but it's just making these really terrible similes throughout the track and it kind of ruins it for me everything from there up to track 11 really hits me as being kind of forgettable until I hear Chicago MC diverse with some really nice chemistry over his instrumental but Quakers kind of puts together this issue of deja vu for me by putting out an MC with a similar flow against a similar be on the track right after my biggest disappointment is toward the middle of the LP though or I think one of the best beats is is wrecked by one of the worst verses on here I'm talking about the track dark city lights these fat pulsating synthesizers are right there on the beat I love it the drums are crispy and just relentless the whole thing kind of sounds like it was sampled from some old 80s sci-fi soundtrack but then I cringe when the first lyric comes in your boy nidhi is back like Bonjour I learned that on the streets of Perry went on tour and that's for sure but we say for sure my chica kind of curvy and her hips Kong curve it kind of makes up for it with the track raid shortly after with lyric Jones who is this great female MC I haven't heard of before she had a really powerful voice and a forceful personality and she had me going right from the first line where she was saying extra extra no time to read it all text iya she had some clever lines on there she definitely kind of broke up the monotony of the album a bit on the track chicken livers FC the truth drops this really plain kind of lazy flow I I really wondered if he was even trying and even aloe blacc shortly after sounds way more unenthusiastic than I would anticipate him being the thing is on this LP because there are so many emcees trying to hit you and run there are so many songs on here that are about nothing nothing a few tracks have very obvious themes like the song soul power which talks about soul music of the 60s and 70s and the struggle for equal rights and there are lots of really kind of cute fighting metaphors on the track chunky Balboa but a lot of tracks on here don't tell much of a story and don't really add to any overall theme of this album the production though is is great it's very mad lib influenced though it is very great Madlib influence to beat making loaded with lots of tasteful funk soul and jazz samples with the occasional break that sounds like it was lifted from a really obscure soundtrack or some record that was just found when digging deep just very deep in some crates dusty old musty crates of course I thought the instrumental side of this album was way more interesting and engaging than the MC side but even as I listened to the instrumentals I kind of sit there and wonder what the potential of them could have been if they were just more interesting lyricists on here or if maybe a handful of the lyricists were able to kind of experiment with more tracks and maybe show more sides to their persona but overall this album is not really a precision cut it's not a steadily aimed sniper rifle hitting directly in the middle of its target it's really a blindfolded shotgun blast I'm really on the fence because I do love the instrumentals but I am so not into a lot of the MCS on this thing they're either just not pleasing me at all or they're just kind of passing me by not really delivering much of anything in terms of lyrics that makes me want to come back to this thing thing thing thing thing kind of feeling a strong for to a light 5 on this I don't know how you guys feel about this thing but that's pretty much me just one man's opinion I don't know how you guys feel about this thing this is just one man's opinion but does this album make you wanna just throw it into your CD player play it over and over and over again become an MC yourself start a cipher in your backyard and hope that all the local MCS in the area come down to at battle you or does it make you want to do backflips across giant piles of broken glass and rusty nails let me know Anthony Fantana Quakers 
JBKPJ5VUbr8,sir do not get violent instead allow me to please you with the earth Oh music hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's tiredest music nerd and it's time for a review spiritualize sweetheart sweet light spiritualize is a band fronted by singer/songwriter Jason Pierce who with this band and this previous band spaceman 3 has combined over 30 years of songwriting experience in garage rock psychedelic rock shoegaze music and the more colorful cousin to psychedelic rock space rock and with albums like ladies and gentlemen we are floating in outer space and let it come down this band has gained a reputation for creating this music with a really symphonic orchestral edge just arranging rock songs with tons of strings horns piano as well and a lot of the time spiritual lives will make use of long Jam style grooves that just kind of go on forever a lot like the band Godspeed you black Emperor spiritualize knows how to make arrangements instrumentation kind of surrounding the rock instrumentation rock just because strings come in it doesn't mean that a song that spiritualize puts together loses its energy or just it's rock in NIST's usually when more instrumentation hops into a spiritualize on the intensity Rises especially when these guys are just putting together some really noisy and psychedelic drones and a lot of these really hard relentless noisy and droney jams that these guys put together are kind of leveled out with these sweeter songs that are inspired by by gospel and either orchestral or just baroque pop now after explaining that I have to say the band's past records has been a little bit of a departure the album Amazing Grace was definitely a bit simpler than your average spiritualize dal b'm the band kind of rendering itself down to mostly it's its garage rock elements playing some really noisy ballsy tracks all over this album and of course there was variety on this thing some softer songs made on here too and the album songs in a and II was definitely simpler went to but was much sweeter softer and sadder too now here we have spiritualizes latest album sweet heart sweet light and while it is not as psychedelic as some of the most acclaimed stuff or noisy or long it is still a very kickass album with a great flow the LP starts with a little bit of a return to form for spiritualize the nine minute track hey gene very simple drumming buzzing guitar leads and the story of what seems to me to be falling in love with a girl who who has a rotten soul someone who's probably bad for you the track seems like a normal guy ROG rock song has a nice groove to it but it eventually kind of gets decked out in true spiritual eyes dashing when it kind of morphs into it into a noisy jam it's like a free rock jam and then there's a stop a slow build-up and this build-up is a lot like a snowball just rolling down a hill and as it progresses it goes faster and just gains more snow aka sound strings guitars background singers just straight-up dissonance the track heading for the top now is is a bit of a return to form to me too it's very repetitious garage rock groove jammed out in this very Velvet Underground sister ray kind of way and as the song progresses these woodwinds start fighting to kind of be heard and Jason's really weary vocal is kind of laying on top of all of it and there are a lot of spots on here too where where that poppier and sweeter side of songs and A and E comes out but it feels way more detailed feels more refined the interjecting strings on the song little girl changed that track from feeling like just kind of a normal rock song to something that had a nice extra special touch to it the song too late on here which hits around the middle of the album it's a sadder song on this LP has this lush string opening that feels like it would be more appropriate for like a Disney soundtrack and the only thing that makes the song so awesome to me is that mash with these really honey kissed strings are these extremely bitter lyrics in relation to love love is breaking hearts it's blinding eyes it's burning people and ruining lives and Jason's mama in the lyrics is recommending he stays away from it but he like everyone on this planet is tempted the track is corny but it fell sincere to me so I don't know couldn't help but get wrapped up in it but the issue for me is is that later on this album there are some songs that kind of feel like this song I get a bit of deja vu especially on the song freedom which which has a different progression to it but the chords and the melody and just the the instrumental swells on the track just feel too similar I guess and while I'm complaining I guess I'll talk about the tracks get what you deserve and I am what I am where I'm not really huge on the jams on those tracks they are really noisy but the instruments don't exactly feel like they're playing off one another so it never really gets to the point where it feels fiery and exciting the background singers on I am what I am are still a nice touch though and these tracks and all throughout the entire album the production is great the recordings fantastic all the instruments just sounds so crisp and rich and clear and the album ends with a trio of songs that I think are pretty fantastic they're really sharp and depressing song marry and then after that comes life is a the track lays on this really soft bed of arranged strings and it feels so much like a lullaby the melody has a kind of gospel quality to it and in the lyrics is je some kind of begs for for Jesus to come and take sin away from him kind of because he fears not getting into heaven but the thing is he acknowledges that God and Jesus exist he acknowledges that he is a religious person but he also acknowledges that he is weak too weak to either follow the rules and regulations to get into heaven or just be a very good and pure person Jason is as accepting of God as he is his weakness and inability to do what God needs him to do a lot of the lyrics on this thing just delve into personal struggles with with good and evil vices and purity the rules of being religious and the difficulties of being human and all these personal feelings and philosophies that are kind of at odds with one another are enhanced and and painted in the music with these really rough rock tunes and beautifully arranged orchestral pop songs maybe it's an unintended concept but a concept all the same and a really cool common thread that I think brings this whole album together this thing like I said has great production spiritualize brings in lots of instrumentation without turning these tracks sterile all the instruments sound great the songwriting on this thing is pretty good lyrics hit me emotionally the vocal delivery is great really convincing like I said sometimes the lyrics can be a bit corny but spiritualize has enough personality on here to make me see past that I guess kind of feeling a light too decent ate on here but what do you guys think of it do you love this album did it make you get down on your knees and and pray for forgiveness and and think about your soul and your future and your purity or instead did it make you want to open up a bag of chips and kind of sit in front of the TV and gorge yourself on snacks until you pass out let me know Anthony Fantana spiritualize forever you 
uvHLmv_WdIA,ah I just finished watching that speech and now I'm feeling pretty based hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review black dice mr. impossible black dice is a Brooklyn experimental music outfit this is their latest LP their early stuff was was more akin to genres such as experimental rock and noise rock but these days their music incorporates way more electronics samples guitars slathered and the strangest of effects and all these sounds come together to make some of the oddest sound scapes I've ever heard black dice definitely produces music that does not hold too many musical conventions do not go into this thing expecting clear chord progressions or a lot of harmony much less lyrics or intelligible vocals instead expect some pretty noisy guitars playing very fart around riffs and leads lots of grunts and and mouth noises and grimy sampled beats pulsating in a very mechanical way considering a lot of the guitars have a very buzzing quality to them serve like a group of flies swarming around my head but the thing is the sounds that black dice chooses though they are noisy and they are strange for the most part they're very bright and and quirky almost cartoonish and and I would dare say fun there's no feeling of difficulty or harshness or massive amounts of depth that you usually get in experimental music like this instead black dice shoots for something that's way more kind of light-hearted they feel as as weird as Captain Beefheart but as playful as Deerhoof sounds on here don't feel really densely layered or heavy they're actually pretty easy to pull apart making this album very readable for an album that's that's comprised mostly of noise or what seems like noise black dice has been playing with this style for several albums now including repo and load blown and I would say mr. Impossibles is their most accessible moment yet in this vein the music isn't really subtly layered or anything like that black dice sort of puts all of the weirdness out there to be consumed on a first impression which isn't a bad thing the issue for me with this album is how the sounds black dice chooses mesh or don't sometimes to me listening to this album can be a lot like walking into a room with a cuckoo clocks hanging all over the walls in every direction all of these clocks making very different and distinct noises but they all happen to be making them on this one timed plane it's a congruent cacophony and to me there's nothing really all that impressive or memorable with how the sounds on this album clash or work together to tell you the truth some of my least favorite parts on this LP are the spots where the sounds seem like they're intended to to sort of work together like on the eight-minute track carnitas where the synth phrases and the drumbeats though they do kind of hit in an accessible way at first they get a little boring after a while other times like I said the sounds on these tracks sort of seemed to be on the same tempo coexisting but in a very separated and disconnected way there are some spots on here where the sounds do work together in a really fun way there's all sorts of tempo and sound changes throughout the track songs like pigs and the jacker those are fun tracks that I like a lot there's a lot of color and they're not long-winded by any means black dice definitely piss all over all the rules and expectations for recorded music but they kind of go a about it in this very one-trick pony kind of way all the sounds and colors sort of hit me all at once in this in this really exciting way it's kind of a rush but as I listen to this LP more and more and more the sounds really aren't complementing one another doing anything together they were just kind of abducted and thrown into this mix and they don't know where they are or who they are or who these other sounds are all they know is they just want to be left alone this record and black dice in general have a lot of personality and there's something to be said for that there are not a lot of groups that sound like black dice so I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this record but that doesn't matter what do you happen to feel on the inside in regards to the music on this release does it grab your soul shake it and then rip it to shreds and then eat it or does it make you on a hotwire a car and crash into the nearest tree let me know Anthony Fantana black dice mr. impossible 
63hrqTPY-KM,hello oh that NYU speech that'd be Scott things online hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and time for an album review Lotus Plaza spooky action at a distance Lotus Plaza is the solo project of Deerhunter member rocket hunt and after debut solo album that that covered a lot of ground in in all things dreamy glistening ambient soundscapes shoegazing pop rock tunes on his sophomore LP right here he seems to be limiting his scope a little bit kind of moving in a direction that reminded me of the last Atlas sound album parallax of course Atlas sound is the solo project of another Deerhunter member of Deerhunter with songwriting duties Bradford Cox I did review parallax and I wasn't really that into what had to offer mostly because to me it was a little less experimental adventurous and not that being straightforward or catchy is bad but the stripped-down and accessible songs that Bradford was putting onto this album just reminded me a lot of diringer songs Deerhunter songs that weren't completely fleshed out or colored in and this Lotus Plaza album to me is is kind of feeling the same way and yeah of course Lockette punt is indy rounder and write songs for deer hunter and and i think it is a little unreasonable to expect that there is no influence or cross-pollination going on but with clear production value and and more of a focus on just turning out tunes that have verses and choruses this new Lotus Plaza LP to me just kind of feels like an assembly of b-sides from the album micro Castle there are lots of hypnotically played guitar Peggy owes on this thing drums that have a really snappy timbre to them and on most of the songs on this thing the guitars the bass the drums are all kind of hitting this quarter note groove pushing these songs along at a really easygoing tempo songs like strangers out of touch or Dusty Rhodes nearly all the songs on this thing to me just end up sounding like deer hunter tracks that that would have been produced with with heavier or more psychedelic or more lush sounds if it had been an official band project maybe there would even be more instrumentation a lot like that song Coronado from the band's last LP Halcyon digests they had a really nice saxophone on instead a song like strangers just kind of repeats the same guitar and drum phrases over and over and over again until the song basically slows down to an underwhelming halt a lot of tracks on here kind of hammer out the same idea four four four to six minutes it's with really a pathetically played drums and guitars what's worse is that nearly everything on here is soaked in so much reverb I just kind of feel like it's hiding the lack of sounds and instrumentation and melodies and musical ideas this album actually has only a few tracks on this thing really stand out to me the song out of touch has a pretty blissful chorus the way the guitar is kind of shine in on the hook with that thing really climax that track the track white galactic has a touch of synthesizer and I think these really high-pitched tones matched up with these very bright guitar leads make it stick out for me a bit and I really like the acoustic approach of the last track it felt really intimate in comparison to all the other songs on here those are pretty much the highlights for me the other songs on here while they don't feel terrible to me at best they just kind of feel like apple pie a lot of people out there love Deerhunter and it makes it easy for them to love this record and the thing is I love Deerhunter but that's why it makes it hard for me to like this record on Deerhunter albums lock its songs especially on the last year after LP have so much more character to them the track don't cry from Halcyon digest just sways back and forth in this really intoxicating way that I love and there is reverb on that track too but there's also a lot of clarity to the point where you can really pull the story out of the lyrics the track fountain stairs resembles a lot of tracks on this LP a lot but the timbre of the guitars is much nicer on that they have a very Velvet Underground kind of quality to them and just lull me into a trance so much easier because of how much closer Lotus Plaza has moved to sounding like Deerhunter material with this LP I can't help but make the comparison and truth is I'm just not enjoying this as much there's a bit of variety on this album there's a piano here a keyboard there a drum machine pops up maybe a couple songs are a bit faster than others but this album does not really keep me excited or enchanted throughout still rock its songs is hooks especially are pretty good but as a listening experience from beginning to end this album just feels a bit monotonous to me to me to me maybe Cal disagrees though I don't know Cal Lotus Plaza sounds like a reason to call the exterminator and there you have it kind of feel kind of feel kind of feel kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing I thought it was okay what did you guys think of it did you love it did you ate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh Lotus Plaza forever 
n-AswG_XXXY,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd question/comment thing if you visit a lot of blogs read music magazines or read essays or books on music or visit music forums I'm sure you've run across some people saying a certain genre was dead real hip-hop is dead Punk is dead Rock is dead discos dead and maybe you yourself have advanced this idea or thought hey you know what that person that person saying that genres dead whoo I'm noticing right now he is right or she and saying something as dead is really honestly seriously no joke becoming my least favorite thing to hear when it comes to people's talking about music because I think most people say it just to be provocative or feel like they're smert kind of stir up controversy and and push the idea that that things are black and white things are either alive or they're dead and that's certainly the case with people and living things depending on how you define dead and live but genres are not people and I firmly believe that musical ideas do not die never ever never ever ever ever ever especially in this day and age and not to say things don't change they do I'm just saying that life especially in the case of art is one never-ending grayscale musical ideas do a lot of things they grow and and fade in popularity they get hijacked by other genres or or recycled some evolve and start incorporating other ideas and sometimes they they lie dormant and make a resurgence a comeback but music does not just die though sometimes it may seem that way if you look at it from a bird's eye view not really reading into the details especially if you kind always tag the death of a genre with the death of a culture disco records do not top the charts anymore but the fact that the fashion and the lingo that also surrounded that style of music have been kind of phased out too is for a lot of people further proof that the nails are in the coffin but when you look at some elements of disco key elements of disco music you got to kind of wonder did the genre ever really die you got guitars with very briskly strummed funky chords tight bass lines with loads of octaves syncopated with the drums which are usually kind of thrown out of four to the floor beat bright horn sections lead vocals that soar and are soaked in reverb all of these ideas are still in use in music today and the thing is disco didn't even invent most of them a lot of them were picked up from funk and when disco was fading away parts of it went to the more danceable acts to come out of post-punk music parts of it went on to influence new wave and a lot of pop that came out in the 80s even the lead single off of Lady Gaga's last LP had a huge disco influence on it there were some artists that kind of sat between the fall of disco and the rise of of synth pop music and they sounded like it like blondie and punk music any genre that people perceived to be dead is basically the same way but what's funny today is that we've got the Internet and it's fragmented culture a little bit people are are able to sort of indulge and whatever they please they don't need to rely on on contemporary and in popular culture to be introduced to music you've got people who say you know what screw new music I'm going to listen to nothing but but 80s pop or classical or bluegrass or Tuvan throat-singing some people take it even further and say you know what I'm going to start a Dixieland style jazz band or even a tribute band to my favorite group that broke up 30 years ago or a tribute band to my favorite group that's still active today and the thing is today nostalgic musicians are rewarded with with fans and contracts and record sales look at artists like Ariel pink or Krystal stilts or black lips or Christian mistress they're just a few but there is a really healthy world of artists out there who rely heavily on nostalgia or old world musical ideas to kind of get by just because you're not running into a certain style of music every day or as much as you used to or ever does not mean it's dead because believe me it's out there somewhere living and breathing influencing and affecting people whether it's on record or at a live show so that's it I love you I hope you have a good day you're the best always question everything [Music] 
PVvWk4Vko6Q,how did you do this do what this hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd time for review dr. John locked down dr. John is a singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist session musician and iconic figure in New Orleans music especially when it comes to blues funk R&B jazz and psychedelic rock there's been a lot of versatility over the 20 or so albums this guy is released over the years he's recently been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as well unfortunately his music is not really garnering the net it used to but this new help you locked down is receiving some really positive attention and for good reason it's a solid album which we will get into later but but part of the reason I think this LP is catching some momentum momentum is because it's a little change in direction thanks to working with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys who produced this LP and what Dan is doing for John on this LP reminds me a lot of what Rick Rubin was doing for Johnny Cash on his final albums Rick revitalized Johnny's sound not by going for something that was that was really clean and sleek slick and modern instead shooting for something that's that's much more earthy gritty the instrumentation on those final cash records just sounded so aged and weathered and Dan is basically doing the same thing I don't think the good doctor could have gotten a better production endorsement from a modern artist not only do I think Black Keys fans can very easily slide into enjoying this LP but the production Dan brings to the table just like an usual Black Keys fashion references the past which I think old-school dr. John fans will but it's got a really modern punch to it the opener the title track to this album starts with these birds squawking it's like I'm in a bird sanctuary this drum roll comes in building things up against these kind of tribal chants and then this clunky New Orleans style funk groove comes in that not only references old school dr. John but are just like the meters and Lee Dorsey - and over this funk groove to kind of back up the hook that's really metallic vibraphone and these backup vocals and and horns come in kind of giving the track a slightly lounge jazz feel I really love the sounds the extra sounds that come together on this track but the foundational stuff the guitars the drums the vocals they sound great - the drums had to have a kind of I guess ratty quality to them I want to see but not ratty in a bad way they don't sound like they're miked very close so you're catching a lot of kit annoys a lot of room noise but the drums still have a lot of crispness to them and the guitars which of course are played by Dan Auerbach have that trademark black keys tone to them the upright bass thuds away basically the instrumentation to me sounds like a beat-up old pickup truck it's souped up the engine growls the wheel wells are all rusted there's bugs caught in the grille the windshield is cracked but you know runs good and as far as the vocals go I know this gets set about a lot of aging the singers but I'm not biessing here I do think dr. John's voice has gotten more interesting with old age it is so raspy rasp rasp rasp his voice has always kind of had a raspy quality to it but now it's just more than ever and it's adding a lot of character in a very Tom Waits kind of way and dr. John still manages to carry a tune be very emotive in these songs and thanks to the lyrics on this P he's sounding kind of fed up with the world at large too there are all sorts of words on on this album referencing the present being an ice age Liars going to hell people doing drugs and losing their jobs revolution is the final solution it's a bit of a wake-up call because if you were to see the world from dr. John's viewpoint it would probably look like it's crumbling fast vocally the only spots I'm not really in love with on this album are the moments where dr. John's vocal melodies may be getting a little repetitive on the verse or the verses where he's not really so much singing as he is doing a bit of a spoken word thing I'm talking tracks like Ice Age big shot you lie but the production the songwriting and the instrumentation whether it be similarly sultry horns or a bright old-school organ oh that saves these songs from being bad for sure I understand these moments just aren't as captivating to me I guess because this album is solid enough to the point where you could just ride through the lows and it's not really a big deal because the highs are so high there is a good amount of variety on here - I like the brisk speedy tempo on the track getaway which is which isn't 3/4 and has a fantastic guitar solo from Dan on the end of it I love the slow brooding funk of kingdom of isness the balladry that's happening on my children my angels where the lyrics tried to be a bit of advice to the youth the next generation the track a leg wah really pulls up the New Orleans funk roots of this album like no other track does lots of sharp guitar leads very heavy very chunky drums and the clothes are on here God sure go takes a bit of a religious and a gospel angle to this album finishing things off on a kind of positive note overall it's a very good album it's it's not exactly new ground or mind-blowing for dr. John but it does sound great to hear and kind of revitalized restored in a really tasteful way so definitely check this thing out it's the kind of stuff that that swamps and and hard liquor and dusty old bars and and the sweat beating off the head of a lone saxophone player at some smoky nightclub where the maximum capacity is 50 people is made of definitely feeling a strong 7 on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana dr. John forever 
VpLANug-ClI,finally got my carrot back Garrett hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review kindness world you need a change of mind kindness is the musical project of singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer Adam Bainbridge he hails from England and this album has actually been co-produced with philippe zadar who has also been behind the scenes with other indie pop favorites from cut copy and phoenix and there's no reason right now not to believe that kindness could not sort of get that same sort of stature this project has had some attention on it ever since it released a debut single in 2009 a cover of the song swingin party by the replacements now if you put this record on you're going to run into a hodgepodge of sounds from the 70s and the 80s that we used to make fun of in the 90s and 2000s or or the aughts but now it's a new decade we're past 2010 we're getting deeper into 2012 and the resurgence of genres like new wave and disco sent pop funk and R&B are far under way so far under way I would say kindness is actually kind of late to the party because this album is coming after after chillwave one of the largest collective embraces of of retro recycling in a long time as well as artists embracing that disco and and danceable post-punk ideal like hercules and love affair or LCD soundsystem and the latest LPS from Toro y Moi and ariel pink have repurposed old-school grooves for some pretty eccentric pop songwriting now admittedly I was getting a bit tired of all this recycling but I think kindness is the new face that this party needs to to kind of keep things going there are tracks on here that have really brisk disco drum beats and bass lines inspired by artists like Sugar Hill Gang and there are other moments that feel like that ladies take on contemporary R&B from artists like Prince or Janet Jackson plus the songwriting in the vocal delivery on this thing can have a very sort of naive and vulnerable quality to them and for me there's no reason to believe that Bainbridge isn't conscious of the corniness he's dealing in which is why I think he put so much effort into trying to make some of these tracks some of them sound sort of unconventional progressive really working with with some linear song structures the opener on this thing morphs almost psychedelically for six minutes from one idea to the next and I see synths cape with a with a drum machine be at the intro with some pretty fiery guitar solos over it to a really beautiful horn interlude with piano there are some lyrical breaks in the middle of that saying let the music become a part of you or when we dance we're all the same and Bainbridge's sort of deadpan vocal delivery makes the the tune feel a little bit cultish I am a little on the fence with his vocal delivery there are moments on here like the opener where it feels a little flat just doesn't really have a strong personality strong anything really but then there are spots on here like that replacements cover right after the opener where it comes off heavenly sweet and then on the second cover song on this LP you take on Anita dobson's lost pop gem anyone can fall and love the vocals also feel kind of off they feel a little bit lazy and in this instance it's almost kind of a good thing because like in the way anyone can fall in love the vocal sort of give this impression that anyone can really sing this song plus the song is just wrapped in these and these really beautifully arranged flourishes of horns and and since sort of adding these nice subtle little harmonies against the chords as the song progresses the next two tracks on here boggle my mind a bit though the track G up is is definitely the most uneventful track on the album some smooth ambient synthesizer chords matched up with some very slowly played funk guitar chords and it's an okay track I wish a little bit more happened but right after that song is the most eventful song on the album G up really fast really upbeat lots of guitar leads strong funky disco bass line a really upbeat drum beat but then the track sort of fades out abruptly just before two minutes just as things are getting kind of heated thankfully it's not too long until I get to my favorite track on here that's all right the song opens up with this beautiful gorgeous awe inspiring horn and synth combo the synthesizer sounds so slick and rich and the saxophone just has the perfect amount of splash on it to just make it bounce and then when the beat hits and the synthesizer comes in that squealing synthesizer it's just magic it's intense it's heavy it's epic there's this vocal sample this guy kind of comes in the Buddhist bird strong composition hard groove fat husky synthetically manipulated baseline it just sounds so large and in charge I'd love to hear more of that from kindness in the future taking this very kind of simple meat and potatoes genres or really building them up into this epic ambitious thing kindness plays this style off really well even if he is at times kind of going through the motions following the blueprint like on tracks such as cyan or even the last song on here he still manages present something that's really enjoyable tight grooves catchy hooks it's kind of a mixed bag of style and quality still I'm kind of feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing if you have heard this album what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I be reviewing in my next video what do you think hmm kindness world you need a change of mind 
XmSktY7RhAE,oh boy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and time for a review willis earl beal acousmatic sorcery this is Willis Earl Beals kind of official label released debut album he's a Chicago singer-songwriter who's been self recording for for quite a while and just not first listen Beals musical foundation has a lot of characteristics that reminds me of artists that I already love and respect sometimes his tracks have kind of a Tom Waits characteristic really kind of clunky noisy percussion match with some really kind of bold intense and growly vocals and sometimes he has this Captain Beefheart characteristic about him where he'll be sort of doing some really abstract out there spoken word over some pretty noisy instrumentals other times he has a bit of a Daniel Johnston angle to his songs with a very DIY lo-fi self recorded aesthetic on to tape so there's that kind of warble e sound with the instruments and occasionally his tracks do kind of shoot for something that is a bit confessional like embarrassingly confessional and personal some of his tracks pull influences from blues music and gospel music whether it's from lyrical ideas or chord progressions all of these various influences really got me psyched for this LP plus there is some nice background kind of fueling the attention that he is getting sort of like Daniel Johnston or Wesley Willis or are Stevie Moore he sort of seems to be very hands on when it comes to promoting his work and creating artwork for his music as well and this really kind of hands-on and grassroots approach that he's been taking with with putting his music out there has made him a bit of a folk hero I guess but as I actually listened to acoustic sorcery I just did not find a lot I enjoyed and sadly I thought a lot of the songs on here didn't really feature lyrics I found interesting I thought a lot of the structures of these songs and the melodies got kind of monotonous I didn't think the instrumentation was was that great a lot of the time and I didn't think these songs were worth at tuneful the instrumental foundation of this LP is guitar vocals and a little bit of found percussion and all of that instrumentation is recorded onto a tape recorder so you do kind of get that tape sound and to me it sounds like then it's taken off of the tape and assembled or looped pretty quickly on a computer on a lot of these tracks the guitar or whatever is being played doesn't really sound like it's it's being performed it's just kind of cycling in a really uninteresting way underneath the vocals which I would be okay with if I didn't think the vocals were so kind of hit or miss for example the track take me away to me is actually a highlight on here it's a really riveting track with the vocal delivery Beale brings on that one it's really loud over modulated kind of rough around the edges and a Howlin wolf kind of way and I really like Beals over-the-top delivery on the song masquerade which is actually a bonus track for this LP where he's talking about going to this masquerade party and just how animated he is on that track just makes it killer makes it entertaining but most of the tracks on here like cosmic queries or evenings kiss the drama feels kind of forced the sadness feels kind of forced and these tracks kind of expose this album's biggest issue for me and that is Beale does not come off as being that great of a storyteller some tracks on here down a road that is Biel throwing out a bunch of abstract imagery that doesn't really connect in a very obvious way but I'm sure it does for him personally but the images aren't really all that out there not to the point where it would be thrilling to listen to them and they don't come off as that as that vivid either partially because of what he's saying but partially because there's no real mm behind his singing and then there are songs on here kind of like monotony where the lyrics are very personal very honest very focused on beels feelings but they're really not that revealing when somebody wants to write a song about their feelings you assume that they're just gonna kind of lay it out there on the table they are going to expose some kind of deep dark underbelly you're gonna get some kind of pure raw potent dose of this person's real feelings because a they have to bottle these feelings up during the day because nobody wants to hear about them or B they have to bottle these feelings up during the day because it would be embarrassing to share them and not to say that Beals feelings aren't legitimate on the track monotony where he kind of talks about being generally bored and not really all that sad not really all that happy kind of blase I'm sure he actually feels that way but the thing is the feelings he talks about on this album are kind of ordinary so it doesn't make them all that exciting to listen to there are some spots on here where I think Beale does come through is being really entertaining like on ghost robot or swing on low where the percussion is is really kind of loud and quirky and just over modulated and noisy and his vocals are kind of doing a spoken-word thing with some lyrics that are very fun very playful exposing the side of him that just does not take itself that seriously but those are pretty much the only spots on here that I liked for the most part I feel like this album just dragged it is just so dry it does not bring a lot of song it does not bring a lot of lyrics or personality because the influence is is so obvious I feel like I have to go back to a guy like Daniel Johnston and just point out that that the songs that that he put together especially the stories especially the lyrics in his tracks we're so dark we're just so depressing they were so clever and witty and not that I wish depression on on anybody or the kind of of mental problems that Daniel has fought with over the years I don't but this is the kind of out of box thinking that makes songwriting entertaining for listeners I just don't feel like a Cousteau Matic sorcery has it that's all so I'm kind of feeling a strong three to a light four on this thing what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Willa sorrow Beale 
5x77EWbpJnc,I'm getting my ear I'm gonna go and get it jack I just said that next time you see me I'm gonna be a real-life jab hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review chromatics kill for love chromatics is a project that's released a handful of albums since its formation in 2001 but kind of hit it big last year with an appearance on that drive soundtrack that people are really making a lot of noise about now this is the first LP to be released since that really nice soundtrack appearance and it is a 90-minute and can can dream bedroom pop opus which admittedly is kind of what got me interested in checking this group out in the first place group I never heard of before puts together this 90-minute pop album they sound like they're pretty ambitious on paper but the issue for me is that to me this album shares so many of the negative characteristics the negative stereotypes that are usually associated with with self recorded music stuff like plain melodies sounds that are by no means vibrant or resonant or even really all that pretty all the sounds kind of melt together into this stew of pastel color blandness and the performances on on this LP are kind of weak to almost feel really effortless I guess the vocals are not that interesting they're not that engaging they do not have that much personality they don't have that much pitch or range either or passion they just kind of flatly deliver the lyrics one track after another and the guitar the synthesizers the drum programming there was nothing about them on us on this album in the whole 90 minutes that it's panned that really struck me as being spectacular I would actually even say the way a lot of the instruments are played on this LP it's pretty a stick some of the guitar leads just kind of slip in and out of tempo and not even really in in an interesting or an exciting way it's not like they're slipping in and out of tempo because things are going so fast things are getting so high and heavy it's just really kind of an obvious mistake that that shouldn't be there sometimes the synths suffer from the same problem and a couple of spots on this album feature auto tune wedges I feel like the more I hear it the more I'm sort of getting this grip of ah I like auto tune used here but I don't like it used in in this particular way and in the way it was used on this album was just so aimless it actually kind of reminded me of the way auto tune was used on that flava flav single I'll never let you go this album does not have a lot I'm interested in but I would not say it's lacking an effort I feel like effort did go into this thing there is a lot of material here and a huge laundry list of instruments that were placed onto this LP there's acoustic piano and and strings and sampling and tape delay effects different kinds of guitars a theremin too but too many songs on here just sound way too similar for comfort for me like tracks 3 & 4 on here pretty much have the same exact drumbeat but played at different speeds and like I said none of the melodies on this thing or all that developed they feel a bit thrown together they feel a little off-the-cuff and as a result the melodies are definitely not helping and separating these songs I like what the project is shooting for on this thing you've got some program beats you have these guitars with the tone that reminds me of like power corruption and lies err a new order or maybe even like Joy Division something like that you've got some smooth grooves you've got vocals kind of slathered in reverb a dreamy aesthetic but just because this music is dreamy and ethereal I don't think that gives it a go to be kind of forgettable or kind of lacking in personality all these issues come up for me right from the start on the opening track to this thing which is actually a cover of Neil Young's into the black and never really heard a cover suck the passion out of an original so quickly the vocals are performed as if it's it's a chore the piano and the guitar strumming there's nothing really dramatic or emotional about them and it's such an emotional song there were a few surprises for me on this LP that I liked there were some very interesting ambience in interludes toward the middle synth Odysseys almost and the final track on here 14 minute track had some nice progression some nice changes a lot of the instruments in this laundry list show up on that track there is still that issue with me not really loving the the sounds on this album and actually thought the song lady was was pretty good too I still isn't into the vocals but the groove on that track was so smooth and and kind of dark really made me think of what would be a depressing disco song overall again with this LP it was just so plainly performed it was difficult for me to really get into it as I've already said I was originally interested in this thing because of the length thought that would bring some ambition to the table but the energy that went into making this much material did not really go into making the sounds high-quality making the vocals engaging making the melodies unique I wouldn't go as far as to say there's a lot of filler on this album I do sense that there is some nice progression that there is a nice arc to these 90 minutes that have been laid onto the cell P it just ended up feeling so lacking for me kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on this wasn't just was not feeling it but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh oh chromatics forever 
nHcJbSzns8E,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd doing a little list right now as many of you know the 21st of this month April is Record Store Day a day when music nerds gather together to celebrate music in its physical form the CD the cassette the vinyl the dat tape all that good stuff and we also celebrate record stores being really neat places to buy music and hang out and unusual Record Store Day tradition a bunch of cool limited-run releases are going to be available for that day and there's a lot there's a lot of them there's actually a huge list of these releases linked in the description box of this video and I've picked 10 10 releases from this giant list that I particularly am looking forward to and maybe hope to procure number one Afrika Bambaataa an mc5 on one single 7-inch record a reissue of the song kick out the jams ya afrika bambaataa covered that song way back in the day the covers little horrendous but it's pretty fantastic and it's being paired with it on 17 inch the next release that I'm looking forward to is actually number four in the battles dross glop 12-inch vinyl remix series and the reason i'm looking forward to number four is because like a complete nerd I've been buying all the vinyl up until this point there's going to be a reissue of ten inches in a box set of the classic dub reggae release lee scratch perry 'he's Blackboard Jungle dub look out for that one there's also going to be a 10 inch of gorillas do you thing st.

e2g9_YXxfY0,how could you think of sleeping at a time like this we can't even afford to live here because you don't have a job you already pawn my words hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here it's busy it's music nerd and it's time for a review bad bad not good very hold on your partner you're you just started the review and you're you're already saying it's big just give it a chance bad bad not good BB ng - these guys are a young trio of jazz musicians from Canada this is their second full-length album and they really are coming into this genre with an attitude and their own way of doing things they just put out there this this rejection of the old-school Jazz ethos which a lot of people take issue with because there are a lot of sacred cows and jazz that you're not supposed to stomp all over in a way I think it's kind of a good thing because constantly praising the same forefather artists over and over again and also not allowing any new ideas to seep in the intent may be preservation but the result is always decay I wouldn't say bad bad not good as a complete rejection of the old way of doing things though between the instrumentation that these guys make use of piano bass drums there's actually some some guest saxophone playing on here the improvisation and interplay on a lot of these tracks and the fact that these guys reinterpret pre-existing material I would say the Jazz foundation is pretty firm underneath these guys it's just that these guys for the most part when they do cover a song it's a hip-hop song it's B music or an instrumental it's electronic music so while the execution is ultimately jazz the source material is is what ends up making bad bad not good feel new and current and different the band's last full-length album which I reviewed gave a positive review - did reinterpretations of everything from an Oz instrumental to Gangstar they even covered some some Zelda songs from ocarina of time and the forecast this time around is much different on the last LP original material was was pretty scan but in contrast this album a quarter of it is original material there's some odd future covers on here of course it opens up with Earl and then goes later into a medley that has been kind of kicking around and the bad bad not good Canon for a while this mix of title of the creators bastard and Gucci means lemonade toward the end of this LP they cover Kanye's flashing lights they even do a couple genes blade covers on this thing as well as a My Bloody Valentine covered and the whole album the song recipe is is different the mixture is different and the presentation of these songs is different this time around - these guys have upped the production quality a lot to me the pianos feel much more resonant much heavier bigger the drums just come through much clearer they don't always have that same boom-bap texture on them a lot more sonic variety on the drums throughout this LP the bass sounds nice and warm the electric bass there's a lot more upright bass on this thing - and the saxophone that appears on a couple tracks on here sounds great as well there's even a pretty distorted guitar on that My Bloody Valentine cover toward the end and there's just a variety of different keyboard sounds on this thing as well from the grande large acoustic piano that's on Ron decay or limit for your love the fat distorted heavy scents on Earl and sometimes there are these very smooth icy synthesizers that appear on a few tracks here and of course that really sharp sharp electric piano sound that was on the band's last album it sounds even sharper now like marbles hitting glass and like I said I feel like there's more interplay on this LP - Alex for example is improving on his drums a lot more on this LP throwing little changes into his rhythms not just playing it straight and when these guys jam they are jamming a lot harder on this thing on the last album some of the solos though I did like the album I felt like they could have gone harder they could have just dug into the song more I imagine a song is kind of being like a room and when you're playing are really passionate fiery solo you're just turning the furniture over and like throwing stuff out the windows this time around bad bad not good really destroys some of the rooms that they're fooling around in like on that drum solo at the end of Earl the bass solo on limit to your love the sax solo on UWM and the keyboard solos on that flashing lights cover are so simultaneously soloing and embellishing on the chords and the odd future Gucci Mane medley on this thing which these guys have been playing for a while has developed into a whole new animal really emphasizing the contrast between the bastard section of the song and the lemonade section of the song making the bastard part really slow dark heavy dramatic and then when the Gucci Mane spot hits they just blast into it Oh shoo it was bad bad not good is just tighter than ever and I did not think they would reach this level of intensity in their playing so quickly because they're really tearing into some of these tracks and making them their own these guys throw in a reworked version of the song rotten decay which was a single that they dropped earlier this year an original song and I'm loving this reworked version I feel like it has been incubated a bit and it's developed a little bit more the track is still lumbering and heavy but the playing is more precise and what the band is trying to do I feel like comes through a lot stronger with how they're slowing down the tempo speeding it up so it feels more fluid as the tempos moving the drums the bass and the piano feel much more together so the tension the track was supposed to bring originally it's just so much stronger the song limit love which is originally a Feist song but then became a James Blake cover is covered on here but they're kind of covering the James Blake version with these really heavy piano keys and then the Tom's on the drums are kind of used to imitate the wubble and the bass on the lead melody on this thing sounds great the sixth track on here Chester kind of feels like bad bad not good imitating a future garage tune with the with the chords and the keys and the way the drum beat is performed it kind of falls into a hip-hop groove later with just bass solos galore and it's really got a nice funky and smooth vibe to it that I love the next track UWM is definitely my favorite original on this entire thing the electric piano chords on here are so dreary and the drum beat has a nice boom-bap texture to it with this tambourine mix it with a snare that's a really nice touch I love the way the groove changes suddenly too and you got these ascending descending piano chords that the player again it just builds a lot of tension in the track in Leyland widdy's saxophone on the song when the tractor sort of smoothes out falls into a more chill groove is killer is playing is really smoky really sultry sexy and flashing lights is definitely my favorite cover on this entire thing bad bad not good gives the song the the really epic smooth and gargantuan since toward the beginning of the track that that it deserves but once they get into the jam on the song they are just blasting through it and this pretty much feels like the end of the album for me right after this and My Bloody Valentine cover view made me realizes kind of tacked on to the end and it doesn't really feel like any other track on the album especially production-wise the drums feel so sharp and tinny and don't have a lot of punch to them the pianos get swallowed in the guitar distortion a little bit on that track the bass is kind of strumming along to the tempo gets a little lost in the in the chaos I think too the jazzy guitar solos toward the end of the track are pretty nice it definitely didn't become one of my favorite parts on the album though another part on the album I didn't really care for the song vices the way the drums get so much more intense and speedy just filling up space as much as possible with fills in every direction but to kind of hear the keyboard playing the same smooth chords as that is happening not hearing and kind of get lost in that progression just building up with the drums felt kind of weird for me but other than that I don't really have a lot of complaints I mean I think these guys are doing fantastic things for jazz and and whether that's intentional or they're pretty much just doing this for themselves doesn't really matter I like that bad bad not good as incorporating more original material though sometimes I think maybe they should kind of let it sit and and incubate like I said earlier in regards to rotten decay because I love the way they progressed that song and lemonade bastard medley that they do is also proof that if they work on something hard enough they let it sit long enough it's going to become fantastic and I love that they're bringing in more sounds and more instrumentation this time around - and it's not just for flash it's not just for show it's actually to the musical element of these songs and bringing a lot of character to them - I'm feeling a strong eight - a light nine on this album I think it's fantastic and definitely going to be one of my favorites toward the end of this year but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino bad bet not good forever [Music] [Music] 
tHsdqsUxR3Q,value member current resident current resident Lennon banana how am I supposed to live life with all these financial obligations crushing down myself how long have I been asleep hi everyone Anthony Pham tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review hi on fire did Burmese mysteries yeah pronunciation these guys were a California stoner and sludge metal trio that came together in the aftermath of the seminal stoner metal band sweep high on fire has been releasing albums for well over ten years now I reviewed their previous LP that dropped a few years ago snakes for the divine which I liked but because of the slightly less heavy production that that album delivered it really hasn't gone down as one of the Bands most powerful releases but the ups and downs the spans been through over the course of its career have been very very slight high on fire is it's not only known for its sound its style but consistency just one quality metal record after another showcasing tons of raw aggression and personality and I want to emphasize that word raw raw and in-your-face that's how high on fire albums feel I like how the band consistently does not use that much reverb when it is in their songs it's very subtle instead high on fire makes music that is heavy and is overpowering because of how close it feels it's like a serious invasion of personal space it's like Matt Pike the band's vocalist slash guitarist is screaming right in my face I'm like oh my god dude just back off just back up a little bit this album really gives the feeling of just being pushed being shoved being held down and no matter how hard you push back there's just no resistance the guitars are so freaking loud the bass guitar is being played so hard you hear the strings just slapping on the neck and who is helping out with the sound Kurt Beaulieu of converge high on fire this time around is sounding more full more saturated more jam-packed than ever it's a lot to take in but not just because of the sound it's it's how fast the band is playing how intricate some of the performances on this record are the drum fills on this thing sometimes are pretty insane and the guitar solos are great too it's also how aggressively these guys are playing and just Matt pikes vocals which I already talked about but man they are just so guttural maybe he wakes up every morning and just gargles broken glass I don't know sometimes between just the speed of this record and Matt's vocals and and some of the riffs on this thing high on fire just hits me like the next logical step past what Motorhead was doing in the 80s with their brand of heavy metal but what I like even more about this record is that I feel like it brings back something that death is this communion hat something that made that record great and something that I feel like snakes for the divine was was missing a little bit and that is some serious variety among the tracks the opener on this thing delivers a really grim kind of melodic chorus that that I like a lot and one of the best guitar solos on the entire LP is toward the end of this track on the instrumental bridge just tapping in there just really noodley really intense and the track fertile green kind of separates itself with its speed the snare drum led drums on this one just feels so they've got so much push to them and they switch between this really fast beating these just intense fills that are pushed against these descending guitar chords they have a really kind of dark evil characteristic to them there's a really slow head bang and riff on the track madness of an architect and there is a gorgeous instrumental interlude that comes right after that track bright almost uplifting harmonized guitar solos toward the end of the track and the band every single time they hit the fourth bar of this groove that they're playing they subtract a beat from the bar and it kind of throws the groove off a little bit in an interesting way but they play it off so naturally and after a really great solid first half and I and I know this has happened to you too you just kind of think in your head man how can how can the rest of this album not be awesome well after the first half my favorite tracks end up being the the slower ones the track king of daisies is pretty much a legitimate metal ballad stoner sludge metal ballad and there are some real notes kind of coming through on Matt Pike's vocals something I really haven't heard him do this clearly for like a couple albums there are these ooh chorus vocals in there that feel kind of angelic but kind of like black hellish angel angelic and there are these very slow heavy guitar chords that are just like lighter worthy it's a track that feels like crushing and inspiring at the same time the song war-horn the closer on this thing has even clearer vocals and the lyrics just hit so hard and are so vivid telling this story about a war zone I thought this album was fantastic I didn't think high on fire was was going to come out with an LP that punched this hard after snakes for the divine but they did not disappoint for me at all I feel like this LP has the speed and has that direct cutthroat approach that snakes for the divine did but brings forth that overbearing overpowering production that that album should've had and these faster and more extreme tracks are levelled out a bit with a good number of songs that are either really heavy really slow or very melodic and kind of pretty some of the songs on here are pretty long but high on fire still could have gone the distance pushed out a few more tracks through a few more angles in this LP but outside of that I can't really complain I'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this thing but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana high on fire forever you 
kVEV9zMcmd0,that'll teach you to mess with my root vegetables I deserve to pet the puppy hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's squeakiest chair busiest music nerd and it's time for you samu doe self-titled the zmuda Budo is a new band fronted by singer/songwriter and musical experimentalist Nixa Muto formerly of the books unfortunately the books broke up pretty recently and it wasn't too long ago that they dropped one of my favorite albums in their discography the the way the way out hold on a second there it is that was my second favorite LP of 2010 yeah and this is really Nick's first shot at putting out some official solo material ever since the book started officially releasing material now before this LP came there was an EP that got released and though I did like it I gave it a positive review I felt like after after the review still I was left with some questions what is this project really is it all that different from the books stylistically and now that I have this full-length LP in my lap I feel like I had those questions answered very very answered basically on this LP miksa Muto has taken his experimental nature just futzing with with lyrics with song structures with sounds and he's now applying it to a full band context style setup the focus has shifted away from from looped and and diddled rhythms and samples and found sounds so even though nick is not really shooting for a sound collage type of thing that books fans may be used to he still searches for avenues to do something interesting creating sounds that you're not likely to hear on on other albums and he does it with familiar instrumentation to just guitar bass synthesizers drums vocals and and some of this LP hits me with a really interesting sound right from the start on the opening track where the song opens up it's really nice hi-hat rhythm it's it's it's an interesting groove but then these vocals start singing out calling out very brightly over that rhythm and they're edited they're edited heavily to have this kind of skippy skittery effect i love the melody they're singing it's it's really bright it's really playful but man the editing on these vocals is what brings it to a whole nother level and makes it feel so different and just so new it does a great job of setting the mood for this LP and the next track grown man don't cry keeps spirits high as well track is proof the this whole album in in fact that experimental music does not need to be this serious boring thing it can be fun it can be exciting the sharp angular guitar leads on on this next track kind of reminds me of something I would hear on like a Dirty Projectors album but but much more bouncy there's a little bit of drumming thrown in throughout the track and as the song continues these synth arpeggios start growing and then getting louder and brighter and they eventually kind of fall into the mix just into place like Tetris blocks I feel like I could really express myself in regards to this song visually I kind of felt limited when when it came to words so so I just drew a quick picture and this is this is the picture redheaded boy some freckles and he's really excited to open up this book and when he opens it there's a rainbow just flying out of it crashing into his face and then it says science rules this LP is definitely something that that took some studying and some focus and some foresight to create and exploring as well but it's still just about as fun as opening up a book and having a rainbow crash into your face for reasons that completely defy all logic or if you want a musical comparison maybe you could say it feels like big science error laurie anderson writing pop and rock tunes so the next few tracks on this thing are actually from the EP that i reviewed earlier this year not going to go too deep into them because i've already discussed them the track too late to apologize actually drops a little bit of auto-tune in the mix which isn't that far-fetched considering how much a vocoder is on this LP at some points and you know even though there is this stigma kind of surrounding the tool call that the tool of auto-tune Nick uses it in a way that is a lot like the way that he uses vocoder so it's just as entertaining the next track on here hits me with something even even stranger though it puts a really great groove out there with this bassline that sounds like it was sequenced on this this eighties bass sequencer some really tight drumming on this track and some guitar playing and there are vocals over this track and I don't even know if I would call them them rapping but they're kind of wrapping there the vocals of a woman that sound like they're coming from a text-to-speech generator Nixa Mutoh had typed in these lyrics and then this robot woman voice is reading these lyrics out but then her vocals are edited so that they are rhythmically in sync with the muse so they kinda sound like they're wrapping it really kind of caught my ear and in a good way now the end of this album in usual album fashion kind of mellows out a bit it starts throwing some some gentler quieter songs out there which to me at their core are not all that different from the quieter more guitar lead and songwriting lead songs that you would hear on on a books album the track Harlequin has some really awesome tremolo effects on the vocals that make it kind of disorienting and this really kind of sad sorry descending guitar chord progression that's kind of depressing and the final song on here is a little anticlimactic but still very pretty the songs are great the sounds are really creative interesting and you know what I love the most about this album is just the production the recording though I was kind of on the fence with that on the EP I feel like I've come all the way around and I am loving the sound of these songs they just are not murd in effects like reverb or distortion or anything like that this album feels so raw it feels so crisp it feels so clean it feels so crunchy it has a bit of a DIY kind of quality to the recording but it comes through so clear this album has nothing to hide nothing to mask nothing to enhance it's just pure unadulterated loving gentle good-natured light-hearted weirdness I'm loving the sound of zum Udo in front of a full band and that's pretty much it feeling a light too decent ate on this album what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana the Muto forever 
3ocm43kZKbg,picking his nose hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our first why you know review in the news space this is just basically a collection of the singles that automatic Gucci the chiptunes Nintendo core band put out a few years ago and some tracks from the power supply EP and a few remixes as well not too much to make note of I just kind of wanted to mention this thing because I like Anamanaguchi and I like the songs on this thing and this could be a really cool chance to just kind of own all these tracks on these guys are a Canadian band this is their sophomore LP the group features Jason Collett of Broken Social Scene as well and I was really excited to listen to this LP when I heard the first single from it are you gonna waste my time the track is this old school power pop single with lots of muscle lots of melody it's pretty much like big star version 2.0 and as I listen to the rest of the LP the band crate digs for more sounds from the past sounds from the Beatles t-rex Queen I guess it's a little too nostalgic for me to get excited for it throughout the entire album I guess I'm looking for a fresher approach if you're interested in the idea of an old approach to old sounds then maybe you'll dig this because some of the songs on this thing are pretty catchy even though Cannibal Corpse is one of the longest-running bands and death metal they've never really been one of my favorites honestly I've I've much preferred the early work of more of an angel bull thrower death atheist fortunately Cannibal Corpse has never really appealed to me beyond the aggression that they put into their music the band's approach to death metal is is really basic it's really straightforward it always has been and this new record is really no different which is fine nothing wrong with a death metal record that's it's to the point gory ugly and brutal but it's just not anything I see myself wanting to return to I guess it's okay after a really solid debut album and four years of waiting gentlemen Jesse finally puts out his sophomore LP it's nothing entirely new if you've heard the debut album maybe this LP is a little more energetic a little more rough around the edges but but but but for me a little bit of cleanliness as part of what made the debut album kind of appealing not only where the songs hard and kind of tough but they were a little slick too so even though this LP is a bit more punked out I think maybe you'll like it more than me DJ Premier and bumpy knuckles collaborate and you know for to me this this is a bit of a strange collaboration I mean DJ Premier and and bumpy knuckles aka Freddy Fox do come from the same era of hip hop but both have had very different levels of success and to me different executions this is definitely not the first time the two have crossed paths but this is a pretty big intersection for for both of these guys and even though over the years Freddy has had some really great verses featured on numerous classic hip hop albums I'm really not totally into this album I do like his gruff voice but beyond that the lyrics just aren't doing it for me and as far as primo goes he's really like usual keeping that torch lit for that oldschool boom-bap sound but even this isn't the best production I've heard him do in recent years heard him put together better beads on that apathy album that came out last year that Rex album that came out last year too we were and although Sonic Youth member album that comes post breakup of Sonic Youth and I was pretty interested in hearing this thing when I first kind of found out that Lee was going to take a more traditional rock singer-songwriter approach to this album especially considering that he has released solo material before and it's been pretty experimental my major issue is that I did not know just how regular of a rock album this was gonna be because you know aside from some interesting sounds and textures here and there Lee pretty much just concentrates on the songwriting and as far as the art of songwriting goes this album doesn't really have the unique personality I would expect from somebody who's affiliated with Sonic Youth I mean to me a lot of the songs on this album just ended up kind of sounding like REM and and if you're into the idea of that kind of album then definitely check this out and if you're a hardcore curious Sonic Youth fan then do it I could say that I feel like this is a satisfactory Bruce Springsteen album after releasing a bunch of albums that were pretty rootsy the the best of all of them I thought was the Seeger sessions Bruce has been putting out albums that I feel like are kind of chasing after his old self just tracks the feature very bright loud epic arena rock sized production but despite all the the big sounds and then a slightly forced energy there's still something kind of sterile about some of the louder songs on this record to me this album feels way more and compelling when the tracks on here have that kind of country twang to them and they're delivered with with much more modesty like the track Jack of all trades and even the song wrecking ball is pretty good even though it gets pretty epic toward its end it still has enough of that natural feel toward the beginning of it where when I'm letting to the big climactic finish it still sounds pretty good there are some parts where I feel like this album over does it a bit but it's still a good Bruce album little B basedgod little boss one of his latest mixtapes a lot of people have been buzzing about this thing this 34 track to our thing which I have sat all the way through and I have to say this is the most legitimate little B has sounded thus far I mean there are actually some tracks on here where I feel like wow that he's actually kind of sort of rapping as far as haters go I don't feel like there's anything on this album that is going to change anyone's mind I do not think this album will necessarily turn you into a little B fan still this album does come forward with a good collection of some serious and kind of thought-provoking songs along with some cooking songs as well and little B does you know pretty much live up to the self given title of Rost rapper by having almost every song here sound totally off-the-cuff and very very unplanned though you can crap on little B all you want as a rapper I do think he succeeds on this mixtape and his other mixtapes too as an entertainer and the reason I find it difficult to do a review of this album is you know even even though I do like it I find it incredibly difficult to justify why I think the only thing I could really justify is how fantastic the production is on this thing oh it's it's great on almost every track I just like the character of this album I like the beats I like the attitude it's just a fun breezy listen after years of putting out very abrasive hardcore punk and power violence ceremony California punk band ceremony has fit to just kind of put out an album that is just a straight-up old-school punk album and the results are kind of hit and miss for me the songs on here to me have way less power and momentum than the tracks on the band's previous material like the song hysteria the groove on that track it just feels so kind of flat there's just no push to a lot of these songs some tracks on here do have it like the song citizen which kinda reminds me of like an off track but still gets my blood pumping a little bit but a lot of tracks on here I just feel like are performed a little plainly I guess and the change in the vocals on this record isn't doing it for me either the the kind of fake British accent that comes with a lot of these songs and just the kind of snotty damned influenced attitude that I'm getting from these tracks it's it's these guys are an experimental Japanese metal outfit combining elements of everything almost everything everything from black metal to death metal to psychedelic pop - to jam jazz progressive rock opera funk downtempo just everything but the kitchen sink that's pretty much sighs ethos on this album not a lot of their albums and I guess psy has never really appealed to me because Tambor's are always put over music I'm never really compelled by size musical ideas due on trying to throw as many different sounds into a single track as possible get operatic vocals in there get black metal vocals in there and saxophones and funky guitars and keyboards placing a bunch of instruments and and genres in a single track or in a single album that do not usually go together that doesn't automatically make something interesting to me I mean bands like mr. bungle and Naked City have already come and gone and and to me side just kind of sounds like music that would soundtrack a Saturday morning cartoon show for like blackmetal kids where the heroes in the show are just covered in black and white face paint and and studded leather belts and armbands and stuff and they kind of go on adventures and fight monsters with pagan magic to me this psy album a lot of psy albums just feel kind of kooky kind of cartoony not really all that mind-bending that's pretty much this week's y-you know review what did you guys think of these albums did you love them did you hate them why and what should I papí next anthony Fantana why you know review forever [Music] [Music] 
RE9pUpdFmeE,I like critics you know I want even create me a critic hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Meshuga colas Meshuga is a Swedish metal band this is their seventh full-length LP I've received a lot of requests to talk about this LP and it's not difficult to see why Meshuga has a pretty heavy reputation in the metal world they have a sound they have a style that has influenced countless groups over the 20-plus years they've been releasing material and part of what has built this Empire is consistency they've never really put out a terrible record a terrible record however they've never really ventured that far outside of what has been proven to work for them almost every studio album these guys have released has been a very slight variation on the same theme endlessly perfecting one single approach Jen's Kidman's vocals used to be a little bit more intelligible on the band's older stuff of course over the years with new technology the group's heaviness factor has increased but I gotta say on this new LP it's pretty much Meshuga as usual you know not much for me to report in terms of what this album really offers to to longtime fans sorry to disappoint the people who were asking me to review this but I think just constant comparisons to every single other LP Meshuga has released before this one would be kind of like splitting hairs I'm not trying to say there's not differences between this LP and others that this band is put out and we will get into a few of them later but I'd much rather focus on maybe trying to turn people on to this group so if this is the first time you're running into Meshuga or you've been curious about them you're in for a very heavy treat machetes world pretty much around the Rif which is nothing entirely new but the way the group approaches this that's what sets them apart first it's the guitar tone that these guys put out which is just like I said earlier been a result of constantly perfecting trying this one thing making it bigger making it better making a heavy hear the sound is a little more commonplace than it used to be but it's mostly because so many groups try to copycat this style the chugs that Meshuga pushes out there are so thick they're so bassy and when they Bend a string they really let it ring out it gives off this sound like one oh it's so guttural it's so thick and deep and mechanical it sounds like something being dismantled or destroyed or crushed the guitars on this LP are basically the size of the explosions in like a Michael Bay film the opener alone I am Colossus just gives me this image of a giant robot demon roaring out with fire and molten lava pouring past its jaws and all of the riffs are pretty much emphasizing just a really heavy groove and Michigan's grooves are really how they define themselves the group is always looking for some kind of odd time signature to play in or just seeking some kind of way to take a rhythm take a groove and just diddle it just throw it off and helping this out are the drums though the guitars on a Meshuga record are incredibly important I feel like in a way the guitars are there to kind of emphasize all the awesome stuff the drums are doing to me the drums usually steal the show on a Meshuga LP and this is no different the beats the rhythms are ever-changing always improvising lots of tasteful fills the drum sound fantastic whether they're doing something slow and primal like behind the Sun or kind of speeding things up and throw in a double bass drum in there like on the demons name I am it immediately a bigger fan of the slower tracks though where the band really hits just very sludgy molasses speed tempos and they let those guitars wring out and get really heavy they just feel gargantuan on those tracks now with all these guitars and drums and and Kidman's kind of mid-range growl covering every single one of these songs Meshuga kind of toys with the foundation of of what sort of groove metal new metal jump the  riffs but with some fantastic drumming some really interesting to tar tone a lot of heaviness and technical ability Meshuga is a metal band that puts out energetic tracks with heavy riffs that appeal beyond the aggression and actually make this sound this style something worth giving a second chance if you've already kind of written it off it's got a lot of virtuosity and though it is technical music it doesn't come across as difficult because Meshuga pumps these grooves out so naturally with so much ease with so much energy it's just easy to get into the track and maybe not even feel like you're listening to something that is all that complex but I did not come here to just simply praise the cell P because I do have some issues with it though there are some variations in speed on this album there's not really many variations in intensity or volume nearly every song here kind of shoots for the same level of those two things the last track is a lone guitar instrumental that's it's very soft very gentle kind of pretty but it's it's a little too late though there are some highlights on here that get me going break those bones maro dum yuge listening to this LP all the way through can be a little bit of a drag especially since the faster tracks on here feel a little bit too mechanical for me to to really get into the grooves to really feel them which is funny because that's not an issue I had with faster tracks from the band's previous material I definitely did not feel that way on chaos fear and another issue I'm kind of having is the guitar solos I know the guitar solos have never been a primary focus in meshuggaas music especially since these days the riffs have taken so much precedent but there are a lot of times on this LP where I wish the guitars would change things up at least a little bit and attempt to do something that is that is just as technical as the drums like the track behind the Sun toward the beginning of the song the guitars are just kind of playing this very lazy sort of atmospheric lead I'm not even sure what it is it's just kind of there to add another sound and toward the end of the track that's very kind of blurry and and boring guitar solo comes in and just does not really add that much and it's it's mixed solo it's buried I can barely make it out and the guitar solo toward the end of the demon's name is is not good oh man it's just tapping and it sounds like it's tapping at it at a completely different tempo it just kind of feels like tapping just a half tapping on the album because it sounds technical on on the surface but there's not really an interesting tap pattern or anything going on with the solo so as much as I do like the riffs on this thing the guitars really don't do much more than that to me chaos fear and destroy a race improve had way better solos the solo on the opener to chaos sphere is still one of the weirdest solos I've heard on a metal record and as far as style and variation goes throughout an entire album catch 33 had way more to offer so overall I did think this was a likeable LP but it will not be going down as one of my favorites in the Meshuga discography I'm kind of feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana Meshuga colos forever [Music] 
TlLz3R4O1EI,Oh punching appliances sure does tire yeah hey don't eat my carrots hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review daniel rossen Golden Mile silent our silent our golden mya daniel rossen is a singer-songwriter who's best known for his work in bands like department of eagles and grizzly bear especially grizzly bear I mean especially especially grizzly bear and with releases like this this is his first real solo effort with releases like this that are coming from musicians who are already in well-known bands you know what happens too often that the album the EP whatever doesn't really offer much appeal outside of the fan base that has already attracted to the other groups this person is involved with meaning it doesn't really offer anything for anybody who isn't already in this super special Club of fans and even though the grizzly bear Club is pretty big this is a collection of tracks I feel like I could recommend to to anybody who's looking for a new singer-songwriter to kind of dive into and it's already been made apparent that daniel has the ability to appeal outside of his membership in grizzly bear in 2008 with his band Department of Eagles the the single he wrote and released no one doesn't like you pretty much ruled the internet for the entire year and while the CP doesn't really see Daniel changing his style all that much it's pretty predictable if you're familiar with Department of Eagles if you're familiar with grizzly bear still this is the most potent dose of his style I think we're hearing so far this to me starts off a lot like an intimate sit-down with Dan and he's strumming his guitar just for me and I'm sitting right there so close I can make out the chords ease play and then like night and day the track just changes grows into so much more this warm picked bass line comes in these elegantly arranged strings and woodwinds and very strategically placed percussion all this new instrumentation just kind of appears and it's pretty heavy too but it doesn't change how close Daniel and his songs feel to the listener because even though I do love hearing arrangements arrangements are nice I love hearing this guy play guitar even more and on a lot of these tracks as he is strumming he'll he'll slip in a really quick arpeggio or a guitar leader or something like that just a just a really quick one and it had so much character to his playing these nice little additions his finger picking gets fantastic on a later song on this EP returned to form where it's just so fast and it's so precise it sounds like waves of acoustic guitars just washing over my ears and relaxing me but back to the opening track the instrumentation kind of Rises as the track moves on some faint touches of piano appear the drumbeat that was once pretty sparse has come to full form and even though the song drags on a little bit the vocals and the guitar player just too charming for this song to be bad and I get hit a lot harder on the second track with this EP silent song which to me sounds like a folk rock tune a folk rock tune that would have made it onto an album printed in the late 60s early 70s you kind of hear those trademark grizzly bear vocal harmonies the guitars kind take a break on the tracks ain't nothing which is a piano ballad the song is backed up with some really nice soft and and swelling horns I wish the track progressed a little bit more kind of had to climax toward its finish the last track kind of ties things up with a lot of energy the song Golden Mile and this track to me has the most Drive on this entire EP the drumbeat is pretty hard and straightforward the guitar strumming is intense this is basically daniel rossen rocking the hell out and there's some really sweet backup vocals that kind of introduced themselves on on this thing different than the backup vocals on other tracks these feel a lot like an embrace there so the honey flavor it kind of resembles something I would hear in an old doo wop song as usual throughout this entire EP Daniel's singing is is really solid he's got pitch he's got a range and his voice definitely has character to it his voice has this really kind of softened quality to it even when he is singing loud it feels a bit like a whisper overall I felt like these five tracks on on this thing we're great I guess I wish the quieter tracks progressed a bit more but outside of that I don't really have many complaints I think Daniel put together a collection of tracks the feel very inviting approachable but still display a massive amount of musicianship and songwriting talent it's an EP of songs that are kind of rootsy and yet decked out in some really fantastic arrangements that are complementary not distracting feeling a light eight on this EP but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana forever 
RJDxHb5bsWc,hi everybody pretty excited Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd oh and it's time for a review the Mars Volta not tourniquet the Mars Volta is a Texas progressive rock band that rose out of the ashes of a group that I like a little bit more at the drive-in but you know despite the initial loss of at the drive-in the band's core members did go on to do bigger things in the Mars Volta they became major players in the world of modern progressive rock and not just like you know copycat progressive rock that just sounds like old-school progressive rock I'm talking about like the new modern futuristic face of progressive rock and infusing it with ideas from the world of post-hardcore among other things but I was kind of hesitant to review this LP for a second it is my first mars volta review it kind of comes off the heels of one of Mars Voltas LPS that is not considered to be one of their best and if you're a hardcore fan I'm sure you remember last year Mars Volta had a bit of a struggle with their label to release this thing and you know Warner Brothers their kind of label that I'm sure is heavily heavily interested in the bottom line and I'm sure they don't want to release another record that's going to disappoint fans especially since a lot of people are not happy with the the simpler more straightforward approach that octahedron put out there Cedric went as far as to call this the band's pop record I think that's maybe taking things a little too far but this LP does kind of hang in that same accessible territory there aren't really any hard-edged lengthy dense Frances the mute style guitar jams on this thing this is definitely not the kind of blood-pumping teeth-gnashing high octane power that would make me afraid to listen on headphones I fear that my brain would just explode load load loads and just pour out of my ear canals Nocturna key is definitely a little toned down in comparison with some mars volta albums but the band is making a conscious effort to replace that volume that intensity that lengthy Jam style with some new sounds some experimentation some accessibility and some really beautiful melodies too as much as the band has changed clearly they're still kind of staying true to their roots of being a band that puts together really sound rich rock music but I think they're taking that to the next level and you can even catch that on the opening track the whip ant where Cedric's vocals are just slathered in weird mutant chorus effects there's some really bright loud synthesizers overpowering the track and they're just these little sonic nuggets all throughout the album on this track it kind of comes up in a spot where cedric is is kind of doing this lone screaming spoken word part but you hear all these vocals kind of yelling in the background just creating this layer of hectic noise underneath him the track dyslexic on is also really liberal with the synthesizers there since on here that our sputtering that our squawking that are really kind of glassy glassy and just putting a nice smooth finish on the track and Cedric is just in the middle of all this synthetic noise the synthetic cacophony and even though the band isn't really embarking on a traditional Mars Volta Jam the track still it's a really great groove the malkin jewel the first single off of this LP starts off with a real nice bluesy guitar riff this kind of banjo that has a totally different recording quality to it is just twiddling away in the background the guitar has a really nice bouncy reverb too in the way Cedric is singing it just kind of reminds me of like a White Stripes track or something but in a good way and what I like about the track is that it just gets progressively more intense as it goes along more noises kind of coming in layering on top of one another drums start getting really intense filling in every open space the synthesizers which kind of have this organ quality to them are playing some really sinister chords these sci-fi keyboards are just screaming in the right channel and it is just so overpowering I think I think my favorite track on here though might be the song Aegis one of the slower songs on here the second track it opens up with this guitar guitar chord progression that is really nasty really dark stuff and for some reason on this track Cedric's falsetto vocal when he when he reaches those highs on this song it just has this really kind of futuristic otherworldly vibe to it that I like and when he's singing about children being seen and I heard strikes me as being really kind of twisted the hook on this track comes crashing through like a drunk driver through the brick wall of the building where he's supposed to be having his next a a meeting and like I said this track in this album is not really indulgent like other mars volta LPS but the band is usually pretty good pretty consistent when it comes to writing hooks that just soar that just explode huge hooks and this album is no different because when Cedric's vocals just reach the highs on this song they fly it's just pure ecstacy ZZ but it's not long before I'm kind of getting into some tracks that I guess I'm not totally feeling the song empty vessels has some really light feathery vocals from Cedric that just feel to kind of sugary to me and it's lyrics about forgiving your your broken heart sometimes I'm really not totally into lyrics on this album the song in absentia presents way more effects than any other song on here I would say the song is almost completely carried by effects because the tune itself drums this vocal melody some guitar that I can kind of make out I think it's all hidden behind this really opaque and and muddy mix and it's intentionally muddy and slathered and reverb and just kind of obscured kind of hidden and while it is an interesting sound for a while it's for some reason the longest song on this LP I wish the band would have kind of drawn out another track on this LP instead even as a soundscape I'm really not in love with this track especially since a lot of the effects cédric uses on this vocals on on this one kind of grate on my ears but those are really the only tracks on here where I'm really not into the textures that Volta is using in their songs for the most part this thing is just loaded with really really colorful rock songs rock songs that despite how many changes this band is made to its formula on this thing still display a decent amount of guts the song MalK walker and in my opinion brings that usual jam level intensity of this band but in kind of a pared down 3 minute and 31 second package and their moments on here where I'm hearing reverse drums reverse guitar solos found sound of like a crowd talking but I do want to emphasize that I think Mars Volta is still writing good Tunes though this six studio LP of theirs is definitely heavily heavily indebted to synthesizers effects the band is really trying to explore sound a bit more and I like it the tracks on this thing are as composed of chords and notes as they are textures and and futuristic synthetics and while this thing is definitely one of the most instantaneous and accessible records yet they've still layers so any sounds into this thing you can return to and return to and return to it and still kind of pick up little layers that you might not have heard before there are a lot of subtleties in this mix and despite all the positive things I could say about this album there's still no way this thing is going to become a universal fan pleaser because it's nowhere near as intense as some of Marv's Voltas earlier records and the gorgeous moments that this album does present are not plentiful enough to make even me kind of forget that and totally fall in love with this newer straightforward direction still I think with this record Mars Volta is on the cusp of something really interesting a really awesome hybrid of of experimental sounds and progressive rock and whether they're making songs that are accessible and catchy or long-winded and difficult that is a road I would like to see them continue down the album is pretty solid throughout starts off with some really great tracks and finishes with a fantastic one-two zette into knots one of the coolest songs I think these guys have written so far basically I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing thought it was really good but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the Mars Volta [Music] 
keNmMKH9IYU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and doing a little video here talking about some of my favorite albums some great albums I listened to this past month a lot of these albums made it to my loved list linked below the first album I'm gonna mention made on their the Nuvi satisfaction album on that Jarell this is an experimental hip hop funk neo soul and sort of R&B album a real mixture of different things electronic music a little bit as well with some really abstract strange forward-thinking lyrics it's a really short but personality-driven record that has a lot of character also came out this month another record I would love to recommend to you the new soap & Skin LP narrow this is an Austrian singer-songwriter project the first album I reviewed from this project sophomore LP and Men what emotionally-charged piano ballets this album has I mean really emotionally heavy stuff not only the lyrical content and just the just the subject matters of these songs but the way these songs sound paying attention to the lyrics isn't even completely necessary there's so many simple and just shy and and forlorn sounds all over this album another album that I recommend checking out if you love your music fast extreme badass and face-punching the new unsane record rec this is the band's seventh album they've been putting out albums for just about twenty years they're from New York and when it comes to post hardcore noise rock and just straight up these guys are one of the most consistent bands you could listen to while this LP doesn't present a lot of new ideas on Sainz formula has been so bread and butter it hasn't really needed to change all that much over the course of the Bands career I'd also love to recommend to you the new men record open your heart these guys are also in New York band and this record has an incredible amount of variety on it from like blues infused garage punk to country music to krautrock esque jams psychedelic rock as well a little bit of post-punk indie rock these guys jump all over the place on this record and the last record to leave home but on this LP especially this LP the songwriting is just so high-quality it doesn't really matter that the band is jumping all over the place because even though they're not really consistent stylistically for the most part the songs on here really good and finally I'd like to recommend the new Big KRIT mixtape forever in a day this thing is a nice end to the trilogy of free albums he's been putting out since 2010 with quit was here returning forever and then forever in a day this thing is a bit of a concept album kind of taking you through a day in the life of Big KRIT and while that concept is cool ultimately the catchy hooks the great rapping and lyricism and the fantastic beats that he self produces are what makes this LP so worthwhile so those are kind of my five album recommendations for this month what albums have you loved this past month let me know thank you for watching the Anthony Fantana recommendations forever 
lQkaU6wMgaM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the shins Port of Mauro the shins are a Portland via Albuquerque pop and rock band and this is their first LP in five years and a lot can happen in five years however on this record I would I would not say a lot did you know the shins have never really been one of the boldest or most experimental or most definitive bands in indie rock and yet they've they've still managed to be one of the most popular and they're formula for success has basically been to release a blend of acoustic and electric rock songs that are very straightforward accessible their songs that kind of paint stories and in very pastel colors and I do think their first LP has some some nice energy to it that kind of grabs me but I think they toned things down a little bit on their next two LPS and you know not to be brutal about it but I think with those two albums they were moving toward making music that was just kind of ordinary and and not completely ordinary you know I know a Shins song when I hear one but you know it's close enough to that where I would be turned off despite all this change over the years this is the first time I'm listening to a Shin's album where I kind of feel like I am listening to something mature but I might not even completely mean that in a positive way the mature feeling I get from this LP comes mostly from the production while the shins have never really written music that ignited a fire in me you know got me really excited or really passion the way their music sounded had a very I guess kind of earnest charm to it you know I'm not saying it's it's lo-fi or badly recorded but it was definitely the antithesis of making music that was overblown however on Port of morrow I feel like the band is kind of pulling out a lot of stops a lot of tracks on this album follow suit with this LPS first single simple song which just kind of delivers the regular shins style but with bigger sounds and and more sheen giant chorus vocals and arena sized drumbeats that I could totally hear being played before millions of the Super Bowl halftime show or something the song fall of 82 is another track that kind of has this very arena sized quality to it the verse is very understated kind of has this bar band groove to it to it some tinny guitar leads over and when the chorus comes it just explodes a trumpet comes in to back it up and okay trumpet but overall the the hook sounds pretty nice no way down throws a hook out to that that kind of turns the volume up a little bit the song bein switch does the same but with some glassy keyboards that kind of reminded me of Coldplay or something and that track also has a very quirky rhythm underneath everything with these sequence drums that kind of make me think of like bubbles popping some glistening acoustic pianos on that track too but the end result just kind of makes me think of music I would hear like at the mall or like in a grocery store of course like usual The Shins delivers them some quieter tracks on here like it's only life where James Mercer actually sounds pretty passionate singing on the verse even though the hook is is a little generic the song for full feels a little funky on some points maybe I'd say it's a bit of all country or something like that but my favorite on this thing was definitely the final track the title track to this album which is very kind of dark you usually don't hear the shins play with something this dark Merce singing in this in this falsetto vocal these pianos just feels so heavy on the track and the vocal melody is it's just so fueled by emotional pain overall I guess I kind of felt like this album was okay the shins definitely brings some some newer and bigger sounds to the table and that may be exciting for some older fans to hear that but I don't feel like they brought a newer and bigger energy to kind of fill that space which kind of brings me back to my earlier statement about being very mature because to me this album feels like a guy in his late 30s or early 40s in a suit who just kind of forgot how to have fun of course there are people who make it into that age who do still know how to have a great time or be exciting or kind of play it loose but the shins are so far from that it just becomes uninteresting even though some of the songs on here are pretty nice once you get to know them some sweet melodies some pretty good hooks they're not really coming through with that strong of a flavor or personality so I'm kind of feeling a strong 5 to a light six on this thing I don't see myself returning to it outside of maybe a few tracks but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it Harry here you go right there why and what should I review next anthony Fantan oh the shins forever 
7rB4Qc-MRks,Bunce nuts nuts nuts hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's tiredest music nerd and it's time for a review the satisfaction on naturale the satisfaction is a seattle-based duo Stasha irons and Katherine Harris white and this is their latest LP this is not their first release but this is the first time a lot of people are hearing about them because they have really upped the recording quality of their music this time around they are also releasing this thing on Sub Pop Records and this comes off the heels of some really nice vocal features on that Shabazz Palaces album black up that came out last year and if you love that Shabazz Palaces LP I would in a heartbeat recommend this to you just without question I wouldn't even think yeah listen to it because when it comes to alternative and abstract hip-hop the satisfaction that Shabazz Palaces our are kind of kindred spirits but do not go into this expecting like a black up sequel or even simply a hip-hop album because even though there is common ground between these two artists including some vocal features from Ishmael Butler on the cell P as well these satisfaction incorporates a lot more genres of music into their tracks to me this LP features really smooth soulful female vocals as well as really monotone rap vocal deliveries that just come off very intense self-produced instrumentals using some our original instrumentation as well as samples that that build these tracks that are equal parts electronica R&B neo soul jazz funk spoken-word lots of lyrics dealing with philosophy and positivity and afro centrosome feminism as well as personal things like food preferences and and love it really reminds me of the very chill laid-back food-for-thought that groups like De La Soul the jungle brothers and a tribe called quest used to put out stuff that was sometimes very funny and clever but other times serious and very thought-provoking so take all those elements throw in some Erykah Badu and then a very clear focus on on making music for the future and you kind of have the satisfaction kind to have the satisfaction in a nutshell now there are 13 tracks on here those songs really only kind of cover about 30 minutes of music there are some tracks on here that are under two minutes very short abrupt there's some surprise stops and fade-outs at the end of some of these tracks and it becomes a little bit of a downside I wish some of these songs were drawn out a little further they would have had a better impact on me if they did but still kind of despite the length I would have liked unnatural just delivers some some really potent tracks with very strong sounds and messages one of the first tracks on this LP bitch has this panoramic hand percussion just all over the track some handclaps are in there a very nimble bassline then the lyrics come in and they kind of tell this story I think of getting with somebody really quickly kind of falling in love quickly and then becoming that person on the side and flipping out kind of going insane to me it's kind of like listening to this drum circle / Poetry Slam of somebody's own personal emotional meltdown and I love it on the next track the singing plays a bigger role as well as the jazz influences on this LP with some very angular and ominous dark and kind of difficult vocal melodies there are these really rich acoustic piano chords and a really kind of unsettling rap verse toward the end of the track mentioning things like obama militarism and rainbow flags and ashes the track extinct and some moments toward the end of this LP has some really strong jazz melodies to them to that that I love a lot but these satisfaction changes things up the song Queens which was the first single from this LP which I was not so hot on at first but now I'm completely into is like this electrified and bastardized disco groove I'm listening to this 2012 updated smooth out and glassy stoned version of like a Patti LaBelle song or something the lyrics are telling people not to funk with these satisfactions groove and the and the course also kind of post funnest swag a bit later in the album things change up on the on the instrumental juice to choose this instrumental electronic jazz hybrid that reminds me a lot of Flying Lotus and in the middle of this whole album there's this one track that it's it's titled sweat and I'm surprised it wasn't a single for this LP because I think it's the most accessible thing on here the track samples these horn and drum brakes that sound like they were recorded about 20 years ago or so and the waste ashes and Catherine's vocals lace up on the hook of this track it just kind of feels like a sweet R&B jam from the 90s these satisfaction still kind of makes it their own even though it is the Poppaea sting I think this album has to offer they still take it out of there they still put a really eccentric spin on it toward the end of this LP v album delivers two stellar tracks featuring Ishmael Butler from Shabazz Palaces on the last two tracks on here though I am a bit I don't know I guess I guess upset about they're so short and they don't feel all that developed though at first when they started it kind of excited because they a really great idea a really great groove or a sound or something that I wish turned into a much longer song but what I'm gonna do still despite some tracks on here that I desperately wish were longer this album just delivers a lot of boldness a lot of creativity some fantastic songs and just a really nice personality I did kind of end up leaving this thing feeling a bit hungry but the flavor was really strong very spicy I wish I had more but it's still a meal I'm not really gonna forget for a long time in fact I think I'll come back to it so kind of feel him a decent 8 on this thing thought it was great what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it if you do why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the satisfaction 
T2Dodo3pAtc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd Internet's most echoey in need of a shotgun mic coming in the mail very soon music nerd and it's time for a review on the seine wreck this is the seventh full-length album from this new york band they've been kicking since the 80s and when the 90s hit and hardcore punk was waning it was post hardcore and noise rock bands like unsane that we're just keeping things harsh negative and gray because life isn't just all you know sunny days and gala luncheons life is also dead bodies in the middle of fields and dead bodies on train tracks and blood and blood and blood if the album covers weren't already proof of of this end the bands logo unsane has been over the years an incredible case for consistency all seven of their albums it's kind of hard to actually see them as being made over the course of of about twenty years some of unsane albums are heavier than others more extreme or have a better recording quality better production but change hasn't really been all that necessary for unsane because their music hasn't ever really relied on a gimmick on an unseen helping you're going to hear a lot of straightforward hard and heavy rock drumming very distorted and dirty bass lines wailing guitars mid-paced riffs and Chris Spencer's very unique vocal delivery he is just screaming his brains out on a lot of these tracks but he has kind of this yellow at the end of all of his screams and this voice has kind of a mid-range quality to it too even though he is just really yelling at the top of his lungs he still conveys a lot of emotion or I guess variations in emotion he kind of switches back and forth between sound and completely pissed off or just desperate and upset and fed up with the way the world around him works kind of lost kind of no way out it's just a really simple formula that has so little tagged on to it that it's it's kind of hard to call it dated because even though there are elements of songs on here that do feel kind of 90s at the end of the day unsane is just playing really angry visceral rock music now even though unsane is incredibly consistent that does not mean there's no variety on this LP for example I really like the rhythm section on the opening track the drums just rely on the Tom's so much it feels primal the beat on this track feels so primal the bass line is going crazy and I'm pretty sure the verses over the verses the time signatures in five but the group is so hard and so fast and the band is just playing the song with so much energy I barely even noticed it I was thinking about hey let's try to find something to punch kind of punch my arm through the next track I'm here kind of slows things down brings things into a 3/4 time signature really kind of gets dark and desperate and while it is a nice change of pace the the very slow tempo of this track kind of makes the song feel like it drags on a bit for me the song no chance after though is completely badass that riff maybe some hardcore fans might disagree with how great that song is but I just love the groom on that song I feel like Spencer especially pissed off on that track and the harmonica that comes in on that song it just sounds like music I would pair with bikers beating the living daylights out of somebody like this close to death however there are quite a few tracks on here like pigeon and metropolis and don't that a don't really hit me with a unique angle or sound or like a memorable riff or a great groove or anything like that the aggression and the force is there but it doesn't really get my blood boiling I guess however the song ghost is great throws another odd time signature out there was a really interesting guitar riffs to dance around that and make it feel it was really dissonant and an angular the track stuff kind of placed with a loud soft dynamic and over the very quiet verses Chris Spencer kind of tones as vocals down and actually sings something pretty soulful I don't know if soulful is really a word I apply to this band most of the time the final track on here hahaha is actually a flipper cover and a really smoky and just sarcastic one of that and Chris Spencer has that usual kind of claustrophobic distorted vocal effect that you'll hear on earlier on same Records it just feels like classic unsane and with that added kind of cover element it makes this song maybe not one of the best that unsane is recorded but a really interesting kind of tidbit for longtime fans overall feeling like this is a this is a pretty solid record you know nothing overall terrible if you're looking for a really extreme and hard-hitting rock record record in 2012 give it a listen however I will admit in comparison with albums like this Queen or even occupational hazard this is not the heaviest or the most aggressive unsane has ever been for sure it's not the catchiest or most melodic they've ever been either but in regards to those things the step-down is so small that I still ended up coming away from this album relatively satisfied I'm kind of feeling the strong six to a light seven on this thing I thought it was good but what do you guys think of it do you love it why and what should I review after this anthony Fantana on the same forever 
HxmQFplBmSI,[Music] dot future take two hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Odd Future Wolfgang kill them all vof tape vol 2 bouf bouf before we start the video really quick I got a few comments saying that the background is kind of distracting this new background and that it shouldn't be a wall buh-buh-buh-buh but like really there's really not that much going on back there I don't see how it's Wolf's leg go away alright alright alright alright so this is obviously a new pod future mixtape at this point I don't think the California hip-hop outfit really needs that much of an introduction but I was kind of looking forward to this state because I remember when I was first kind of cruising through the mixtapes that these guys were first putting out the free mixtapes radical was actually one of my favorites out of the group which was another compilation of songs featuring verses and production for most of the members in the group so I guess I kind of took my my enjoyment of radical which was decent and thought that maybe this would kind of be a return to that maybe not stylistically but maybe I would start caring for the music that these guys are putting out again I it just wasn't that I feel like this is just kind of the regular Odd Future release that I've kind of come to expect the production is OK not a lot of sampling mostly synthesizers and sequence drums and stuff like that the synth sound really kind of plain and the music they're playing for the most part on this tape is kind of playing to like on that track forest green featuring my G hey the drums are really dry there are a few heavy bass hits here and there Tyler the Creator puts more kind of low pitch shits on his voice to make it seem so much boo than it already is there are a few tracks out here to kind of stick out the track lean has a bit of a quirky 8-bit synthesizer in the instrumental and the song relevee instrumental on that one just feels so phat and loud and over modulated and distorted sometimes the instrumentals on this thing hit on a pretty interesting idea but for the most part these tracks just end up kind of feeling very thrown together especially when it sounds like the rides are being delivered in 250-dollar microphones the lyrics just kind of end up feeling like more of the same from odd future to just lots of anger lots of angst recklessness very negative very shallow and of course all this is backed up with tons of misogyny and drug endorsements and I'm not trying to single a lot of future for rapping about this kind of stuff I can't because there are so many other people out there in the world rapping about that stuff and that's what kind of makes me sad about this tape because I kind of feel like I could stumble across rap verses like this anywhere sure some of the references that are littered throughout the verses on this thing are a little more unsettling or obscure or just weirder like Casey Anthony and Whole Foods and wet dreams and MF DOOM but when you really you know kind of boil it down is this all that different from most stuff that's out there and to me the flows on this thing feel clumsier than ever for Odd Future I was surprised to hear Hodgy Beats wrapping pretty lazily on the song real bitch he wasn't riding the tempo that hard the flow wasn't that technical wasn't that impressive you know I've come to expect that kind of stuff from Domo Genesis and left-brain and Jasper and taco and Mike G but not Haji oh man and some of the lyrics on this thing like when left brain spits out ridin with my bitch and you know she's held a chill Coachella front row baby girl pop a pill or when Frank Ocean is singing about a girl being all alone with a bottle of patron in odd futures defense they never really put saving hip-hop or anything like that explicitly into their mission statement sure they are really aggressive and really wild especially in the live setting but this whole rebellion angle is mostly something the media reinforces the media and music listeners and I can see that it's easy to feel that way and apply that because these guys are new they're young they have a sense of humor that's different than most rappers in the mainstream and they have a look that's really different an image that's really different that they love to push in their music videos you know and I'll say the music videos are good they're hilarious they're interesting and even after being disappointed by numerous albums Odd Future has put out they'll come out with a new single clip into a music video and then I'll be like oh handle maybe the album will be pretty good but to me overall this tape just kind of sounds like you know a group of young guys kind of goofing off on some beats while Odd Future isn't really doing anything that is seriously offensive that people should be shielding their children from and getting up in arms about they're also not doing anything that is seriously different or mind-bending or interesting this tape was okay for the first few lessons it's curiosity that probably wouldn't even be there if these guys weren't so popular and they hadn't managed to put out a couple tapes that I thought were pretty good even though there is a variety of different sounds on this tape a little bit of you know silly electro funk from some R&B from Frank Ocean some really hard Waka Flocka impersonation style tracks I guess it's cool that all this stuff is on one mixtape but I've heard pretty much everything odd futures put out up until this point so mmm so I'm kind of feeling out a light too decent for on this thing some of the tracks on this thing we're pretty funny pretty hilarious but I didn't get much more from this album than that what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Odd Future forever [Music] you [Music] 
Y_5jlhMZwEM,hmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd shooting my first album review in my new place I know it's not fully decorated yet I know I have a bit of a echo going on with the room ambience and everything all work in progress totally not perfect right now but going to be progressing gonna be moving toward making this room better than the older room I know it's a change I know it's different but I think you guys are gonna find that the room does not make the reviews and that this space is really not gonna be all that different from the old space hey where you doin hey hey hey what are you doing hey so like I haven't reviewed any music in about a week and I kind of feel like I forgot how so bear with me a soap and skin is an Austrian singer-songwriter this is her second full-length album narrow I've been listening to it on and off for a few weeks and just about everything about this thing is sticking with me and making me want to return to it from the emotions the songs the production the vocals and the vocals are definitely the most distinct things record has going for it soap and skin has this kind of very deep somewhat bellowing smoky womanly voice that kind of reminds me of artists like Nico soap and skin is definitely just as good at projecting emotions in her songs she just makes very simple piano bells with a lot of space very bleak somber dreary stuff so pan skin is so good at pulling these kinds of emotions together she completely transforms one track in a cover song the song voyage voyage by desireless which was once a synth pop tune from 1987 but she makes it into something that is way more dramatic and just the track starts off pretty quiet and then it just evolves really really well with these strings just seeping in subtly underneath her voice and the song to me just it gives this feeling of waving goodbye to somebody who's rowing away on a little boat into the fog and in the darkness the track doesn't really have a huge climax to it but the opening song definitely does and it builds up a lot of tension up to that point - and it doesn't just for vocals and piano soap and skin sometimes has this very kind of weary and emotionally draining quality to her voice but a lot of these tracks she will match that up later in the song with with vocals that are much more intense on this opening track Vawter the tempo starts speeding up and just before the song ends in the last 50 seconds it just explodes in this awesome jubilee of horns and strings and vocals and drums there are some very soft and and short songs on here - and even though they are so a lot like that perfume genius album that came out this year they still pack a pretty heavy emotional punch especially the song wonder which which finishes off with these really whisper quiet group vocals and it's like a really depressing lullaby I just feel like I'm being sent off to sleep in a good way I'm like a boring music kind of way though most of this album is pretty soft and quiet and sad and piano-driven there are a few left hooks which is good the song death mental takes in industrial turn for the album just need this banging clanging percussion in the track these since that feels so rigid it's kind of like listening to a hellish assembly line but soap and skins vocals are still there which kind of take the edge off a bit and still kind of keep the enchanting quality the last track on here kind of goes down the same Road with with some hard drums some buzzing in the background - the sounds are a bit harsher but that element of piano ballad jury is still there so it's it's a nice combination my only real gripes about this LP and I think a lot of fans of soap and skin may be feeling the same way as I do on this one this album is just painfully painfully short there are a few tracks on here that are just around two minutes and I'm totally fine with that those songs kind of have an abrupt charm to them but I just wish there were more tracks on here more material and there's nothing particular about the flow of these songs either as an album that that makes me excited to listen to all of them from beginning to end but still I can't really say anything negative about the songs themselves when I take them away from the album and look at them because I really enjoy each one the songs on here are consistent they've got really tasteful production great vocals I think this album delivers you know something that's very personal very quiet very emotional it's an album that may make you without a few tissues wipe some tears if that's the kind of thing you're looking for I definitely recommend this kind of feeling on a strong 7 - like eight on this thing but if you guys have heard this why do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantan oh so good skin forever

6GnasLp4iZU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd I know you can't see me right now darkness because i'm not talking into a camera i'm talking into a microphone because i'm going to narrate holiday snaps style over a bunch of videos i shot during my South by Southwest 2012 band seeing adventure my girlfriend Dominique shot a lot of this footage that you're going to see in this montage as well over the course of the week I met a lot of people who watch the show I want to give a shout out to them I also met some people who I watched and followed and I also spent a lot of time driving on interstate highway 35 but the most important thing this week is obviously the band's the first artist I planned on seeing that week and did was our Stevie more self recording legend and madman r Stevie Moore and he played a madman set and even through a Daniel Johnson cover in there it was very strange a little bit of spoken word mixed in there but it's it's pretty much everything you would expect from the guy after that Kenya Dawson was scheduled to play but by surprise Jeffrey Lewis kind of took the stage and and did his thing and shortly after Jeffrey Lewis and Kimya Dawson started playing material that they had written together and hadn't played for several years and then shortly after Kimya Dawson played a few tracks and that was a pretty nice surprise for the for the night the showcase was running late more unexpected guests and I kind of had to go if I was going to catch Danny Brown which i did over at the double XL freshmen live showcase Kendrick Lamar was supposed to play after but that ended up running late as well and we just ended up going because things got a little dicey over there but that was kind of our first night our second night was filled with way more music we ended up over at the consequence of sound showcase that was hosted by Sami guru shove the rocket out blog we ended up catching the men first just before that we caught a band name bleached all-girl rock band they were awesome after that we saw a little bit of screaming females but was kind of too far away to catch some good footage titus andronicus played back inside after they were finished and Cloud Nothings finished up the set they played pretty much every song on the new album which was fantastic after Cloud Nothings we ended up catching the Virginia band we are trees they were pretty decent live and then after that kind of the cherry on top of the night was am worried over at the Presbyterian Church a little far away for this one but the acoustics and the church were fantastic which made us pretty excited for the two other shows in the week that we were planning on catching and ward played a little Daniel Johnston cover 2 and afterward we ended up seeing high on fire but it was too dark outside to really get much good footage of their set but still they played really loud really intense the second night was pretty awesome the day after we ended up catching the free mint records óleo festival light organ South by Southwest Day party we came a little early saw some cool bands including mode modern and after that came the evaporators you know the the band that Nardwuar fronts and shortly after and this was kind of advertised during the day party andrew WK came out and performed with them there was even some awesome crowd surfing and some dancing it was a very small venue over at headhunters but people filled it up and it was just awesome definitely one of the more fun sets i saw South by Southwest that week now keep in mind this point in the week was Thursday and that's South by Southwest the further you get toward the end of the week the more bands there are the more people there are in the streets the busier the bars and the venues are and of course street musicians come out and you're seeing them basically everywhere and this was easily one of the most interesting of them they were playing 1920 style jazz right there on a street corner I didn't catch their name but from what a local friend of mine was telling me they're a side project of a somewhat bigger group in the area called white ghost shivers so definitely check that out if this is if this is your thing after that we went back to the Presbyterian Church and caught Fiona Apple playing live she was fantastic really awesome stuff her band was really good too we left thinking that we would be able to try to catch this showcase that Kendrick Lamar and big krit were playing but that showcase was running late as well all the artists were playing out of order and I had to leave because I wanted to come back to the church and catch nicolas jaar playing live we got there a little early ended up seeing grind set for a little bit and then after that Nicholas played and I wish I had video footage of it but when he started playing this is just some video of them getting ready to play just just getting stuff set up the lights were turned down so low you really couldn't see much of anything with a camera still I think it was my favorite set of the week they played so much material from space is only noise but varied it so much that it felt kind of knew they played material from the 10-inch that they just put out in some songs that I'm pretty sure were new and just not even printed anywhere yet we ended the night with a live set from the classic California hardcore punk band fear perfect way to end the night and that was kind of our Thursday Friday is when i went to the terrorize showcase where we were kind of doing a little needle drop meetup thing ended up handing out a lot of stickers had an awesome time and saw a lot of bands we caught ganglions playing a live set down there and they were nice to see live since I really liked that album monster Headroom that they put out a while back after that Blackie performed pretty abrasive live and I do have to say my girlfriend would kill me if I did not put this footage into the montage set where he is throwing the beer of a poor soul onto the ground but it was it was free beer so you know no harm no foul after that zex Marquis came out and played they were pretty nice they're pretty nice in person and then we caught the drum keyboard duo zuhr CH who I was pretty surprised was only two people as they were making a lot more noise than two people would would normally make delicate Steve played after that as well as an afro pop group Jack and a bay they were pretty freaking awesome as well and then we had to get out of there in order to catch magnetic fields playing over at the ACL venue we came a little early and we ended up seeing the war on drugs live and they were actually pretty good as well very dreamy and ethereal in person just as much as they are on record but it was just awesome seeing them just play a stage that that large after that magnetic fields came on played a very solid acoustic set sadly it was maybe a little too quiet for the crowd because a lot of people were talking which was a bit upsetting but still many of the songs came through magic and then we rushed over to try to catch the zoo set that was happening right after that we only got to watch them play two songs sadly but they were two very good songs and then I think I caught my favorite set of the night with Thundercat him in his band fantastic musicians and they were just so tight playing so fast the grooves were so hard and even though his new album has kind of an electronic edge it translated to a live band setting so well oh it was just awesome we ended the night with a very short set from das racist main attractions came out and played with them for a little bit they played like three or four songs but it was still pretty fun on our last day of South by Southwest we decided to take it a little easy since we had an early flight to catch we went over to the terror bird showcase where Emily wells played check her out a very awesome one-woman show beats keyboards drums violin everything looped into some pretty nice tunes right after her came Beach Fossils they played a very energetic set and then the band we came down for Deerhoof who played a really awesome set third time I've seen the band live and this was easily the most energetic performance I've seen them give of those three times bus driver even came out toward the end of the set and wrapped over one of their songs and of course that was awesome and that was my South by Southwest for 2012 driving into the night saw a lot of great bands of course could not see every band I wanted to see sadly a lot of artists that I wanted to see were playing at impossible times playing at the same time as other artists that I wanted to see playing on showcases that were either early or late it's kind of the downside to a festival like this that has so much going on at once but I caught so many underground and unique artists in some really interesting small or or just very intimate spaces and it just made that little con all the more insignificant because I did catch some really amazing shows this week I want to thank everybody who's been watching the show and supporting me and made this trip possible I'd like to thank all the artists I caught live and here's to next year thank you for watching Anthony Fantan Oh South by Southwest forever 
vBEcmPd9pzs,what hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd um second-to-last day of South by Southwest now some interesting people never try to see today I want to try to catch Thundercat want to try to catch um who else the magnetic fields today I want to try to catch hmm maybe LP maybe oh just so hard to plan because there's so many people playing I know like the satisfaction is also playing at the same time Thundercat and I want to see him and I'm going insane but sorry as if you couldn't already guess yesterday was you know almost completely not as planned you know because crazy things happen my girlfriend and I tried to go down and catch the magnetic fields but the line to go in and see them at the parish was so long we couldn't even get in we went around three o'clock they were supposed to play a floor mat for we even ran into somebody later who try to get that same line at one o'clock and they still couldn't get in so I don't know we didn't catch the magnetic fields yesterday which I should have figured because I tried to catch wild flag last year the same venue and the line was too long then to try to see them so we ended up leaving and we were just like you know looking online it shows and we saw an evaporator show that featured Andrew WK and they were like hell yeah let's go to that over a headhunters a very very tiny place and then we went down the evaporators took the stage with Nardwuar they started playing songs from from this I can't even remember the title of the album I used to have it when I was in high school and half of the halls on it and I don't need my friends tell me who my friends are honor they're playing songs from that album just like from beginning in and then andrew WK came out and they played a couple songs together they played the song party hard then they played an original song together called I hate when I'm late especially when I'm early and that was an awesome set Nardwuar was like half naked and people were jumping around and screaming and singing along the songs and it was just an awesome set then after that we headed over to the presbyterian church early just to try to see if we kind of secure a spot to see Fiona Apple play live and we did and we totally got like front row in the balcony and we saw her play and it was awesome she was intense she is a musical psychopath I love her she's great and her band was awesome to they put on a grace set and we decided to leave because I thought in my head hahaha that I would be able to go over to stage on sixth and catch koenig lamar and then big krit right after because they were playing you know in order but of course like the previous two hip hop sets I tried to see earlier where I also tried to see Kendrick Lamar and big krit the set was not on time people were not going in the order that they said they were in fact they didn't you really have a specific order people are just kind of going on as they showed up I guess and you know when people weren't showing up they were just kind of throwing DJs on and just like killing time you know that I had other people I wanted to see and so I just left um after seeing three mc's who I the 3 m's they were supposed to 5 fc's playing Stalley MGK smoked as a big krit Kendrick Lamar I stayed for three mc's and Kendrick Lamar and big krit were not any of the three MCS that played and then of course like I leave and then I see big crits I forget his name he's on his album one of the MCS on bigger it's out he sees me he's like oh hey thanks for the reviews and then I go further down the alleyway and then Kendrick Lamar's there and he says okay thanks for the reviews love the reviews and I'm like okay thank you you know of course I met the guy was nice but like I wish I could see him you know reform and then after that you know and even though it sucks that I couldn't see and in big crate I'm glad I left because we went back to the church where nicolas jaar was playing and he easily performed my favorite set of South by Southwest so far it was awesome he played songs from spaces old noise played songs with a 10-inch that they just put out and they played a little bit of new material as well and every single song they played from you know the 10 inch of the album it was totally reinvented so it sounded brand new you know they didn't play anything that sounded exactly like it was on the album I loved it you know it was just so engaging so awesome and non-stop to he just like really continued the whole set like it was a house set or something you know like he was playing to a club and it was great was so good and um yeah then after that Dominique and I went down to the red seven patio me caught fear California punk band fear they played a they played a pretty fun that was a nice way to end the night so so yeah that was yesterday tried to explain what's gonna happen today a little bit but you know of course maybe it'll go awry at some point and you know more fun will be had in the process so I'll let you guys know tomorrow what's up today I also have that needle drop meetup thing going on itself lamar boulevard over at the terrorized website link below this video you can find out where that's going on um and who's playing that's three o'clock today have stickers and uh and yeah that's it I'll be shooting some video over there too

4X8MvSNS1j4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet stuffiest music nerd and it's time for a review the men open up you open up a little bit of the men are in New York band who I reviewed last year when they made their sacred bones Records debut with the album leave home and the album had some great tracks on it but it didn't end up being one of my favorites of the year for a couple reasons for one the album didn't really have one consistent style or sound it felt stretched a little too thin because there was never really one angle they kept attacking so I never really felt like I got to know the band all that well I got to know their influences though the band would trip through the sounds of noise rock and post-hardcore and maybe even a little doom metal and punk garage rock psychedelic rock as well it's like the band had all these chips and they just kind of let them fall where they may instead of kind of playing them strategically the men seemed too in love with the world of rock music to just settle down with one single sound and like I thought this new album displays an array of different styles of music on it they even managed to toy with a few sounds I'm yet to hear them play with there are moments on here that just are rowdy garage rock with just a tinge of Blues in there country music drone acoustic ballads indie rock ballads instrumental jams stylistically the band is all over the place again but I can't help but feel like this time around they went into this album with a much clearer game plan like if they were going to play with as many styles as as they wanted to they were at least going to organize them make them so that they didn't feel like they were in disarray segue some of the tracks into one another put the songs that are stylistically similar closer to each other so the album has a bit more of a flow the album opens up with these garage punk songs that I told you about with these shit kicker guitar riffs and these baby girl lyrics the guitar riffs are all fuzzy and distorted and and damaged and over driven in lo-fi and just badass it sounds like they're being played out of amplifiers that are on the fritz like I'm seeing the band live and their amplifiers are just catching on fire because of hot and cold tubes and bad wiring it sounds a little generic but the band delivers it with enough energy to the point where it's it's pretty entertaining the second track is is the same way for me except there's a little bit more of a blues edge in that track it's got a very country and rootsy feel to it a little bit the song sounds like what would sound track a southern bar fight where beer bottles and pool cues and stools are our weapons and bodies are flying in every direction smashing tables getting thrown out of windows but right after that the album kind of chills out into this very slow and pretty and guitar led country instrumental which eventually slides into this guitar drone using the same tremolo effects that were making the song feel so country right at the beginning and it does this transition pretty well and an even better transition is is right after that it uses the tremolo effect to bring things into the next track where the BAM pretty much creates a guitar rock jam that is pulled straight out of the NOI playbook very kind of krautrock esque but it's got some really modern punked-out guts to it I mean the segues on this LP really make this thing feel like more of a journey more of an adventure the indie rock tune that breaks in right after this Jam kind of feels like an extension of that song and then after this the band kind of settles into a sweet spot with a trio of a very short and cat she tracks I feel like the band kind of breaks off stylistically at this point the album kind of loses its flow of it but the band churns out three of the most memorable songs that ever heard them rice so I'm really okay with it the LP ends with some solid jams and I feel like this album a lot like that Cloud Nothings album that came out earlier this year I just get kind of a really solid rock record that's memorable it's catchy fun enjoyable and just difficult to say no to even if it is a little derivative because the energy is most certainly there and the energy and the passion is really what's attracting me to these songs feeling a strong seven on this LP I feel like it's a huge improvement over leave home overall yeah it's a little less aggressive less noisy less abrasive and that may have attracted some people to the men originally there may be some fans that are disappointed to see those sounds kind of move away but I thought this LP had a much better flow some really nice catchy and positive vibes coming off some of these tracks and I don't know just overall it was a more enjoyable experience for me I just came away from this album wanting more whining repeat listens and just really looking forward to what these guys do after this so let me know what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it well why and what do you think I should review after this anthony Fantan oh the men forever 
6xc2uTO9v_Y,trying to just keep it together trying to just make it make all sense try to just laugh cough hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the magnetic fields love at the bottom of the sea mad mad mad mad mad magnetic fields is an eccentric singer/songwriter project and band fronted by and founded by stephen merritt and over the years the band is kind of defined its sound with songs that feature simple instrumentation simple song structures but big personalities characters storytelling strange occurrences despite the simplicity there is still a lot of ambition coming out of the magnetic fields especially on prolific projects like 69 love songs which is actually 69 love songs it's not just a title or their previous three LPS where they kind of abstain from using synthesizers in any of the songs which were usually a mainstay in the band's music or maybe even the the first of those three albums I which all kind of have I at the beginning of the time a lot of the magnetic fields releases kind of have an interesting angle to them but I don't know to me maybe it's just not obvious but I don't feel like love at the bottom of the seed pushes the band creatively in any kind of interesting direction or create any kind of challenge the synthesizers are back and I'm sure a lot of older fans are excited to hear the return to the magnetic field songwriting process but I'm kind of on the fence with that incredible advancements have been made in the world of synthesizer technology and MIDI between the release of 69 love songs in 1999 and love at the bottom of the sea in 2012 but from the sound of this album you wouldn't know it than kind of embrace newer sounds the magnetic fields have kind of reverted back to an older sound and I don't mean like get lost or 69 love songs and older sound I mean more like the wayward bus an older sound but the thing is the old old stuff these guys have put out kind of has a charm to it because of the recording technology and the instruments available during that time love at the bottom of the seat doesn't really have that advantage it is an album that was recorded today it sounds like it was recorded today but it sounds also like it's trying to be as if it were recorded yesterday I'm not completely sure why but the weird and and and kind of playful synthesizer sounds and sometimes noisy synthesizer sounds at the magnetic fields incorporate into their songs just don't have that endearing cute charm to them for me on this it makes the tracks that I dislike on here even more dislikeable like infatuation and in the horrible party and it even semi ruins songs on here that I think are pretty good like your girlfriend's face I guess on older albums where synthesizers were back in regular rotation like 69 love songs and like it lost the synth sounds just felt so much less obnoxious it's not even just really the synths on the album it's also kind of the recording quality in the mix of these songs for me because things just sound so dull I guess and kind of claustrophobic like there's no breathing room between the instruments and there's just not that much fidelity and the vocals feel a little buried in everything as well which is kind of sad because I love hearing Stephan Meredith's kind of deep in husky voice you could say what you want to say about realism and distortion and and I but I feel like those LPS in comparison with this new one had much more fidelity and acoustics that were pretty rich and beautiful I know sound is not really the magnetic fields biggest selling point but I'm not really enjoying the sound of this album at all I did like some songs on here though but overall the songs did end up kind of feeling hit or miss for me I didn't find a lot of tracks on here to be all that funny or or witty or clever or maybe even that strange my favorite track on here was the first song to drop from this album and ruin dragged that track is pretty much a picturesque magnetic fields track that will always keep me coming back to whatever a new magnetic fields album is just in case there is another song that is that great on there the song has got a catchy melody a killer hook some nice quirky instrumentation it's all very memorable and the story is is killer it's about a guy who falls in love with a woman who's not actually a woman but a guy in drag but the guy dressed in drag is kind of a joke so the kicker's that this guy doesn't even had the opportunity to date a gay guy in drag who he's fallen in love with these are the kinds of strange character portraits that you catch on a magnetic fields album the song God wants us to wait features a woman kind of singing to her boyfriend just as they're on the threshold of making love but she's like oh wait God wants us to wait you don't want us to live in sin do you on the track your girlfriend's face a jealous woman hires a hit man to take care of this guy and his girlfriend being in love with a machine and the secret bachelor pad of some woman's husband are a couple other subject matters that I thought were pretty fantastic on this thing but there are other songs on here that don't really hit me with an interesting story or angle that I find all that memorable or whittier clever kind of like going back to the country or the only boy in town or born for love or even the horrible party which was definitely absurd but this thing was only a 30-minute album but for some it just felt so much longer to me every single time I listen to it I just felt like I disliked it more and more and more and maybe that's because I got a hold of the tracks that I liked and I dislike pretty quickly you know this album lost its mystery for me really fast but the thing is the songs on here that I have really strong feelings about positive or negative aren't even really that many you know most of the tracks on here I just feel like are alright you know not that horrible that I would hate them but not so exciting that I'm rushing back to listen to them I think it's easy to accept this album as being really great really fantastic because a it's in a way a return to form the synths are back the songs are kooky they are short as hell all under 30 minutes and and B this album is coming off the tail of realism which was not a well-received album so I really can't say this was doing that much for me it did not give me the emotional charge of albums like get lost or I or 69 love songs especially 69 love songs because that album is just so raw so memorable so full of character and just so great but it feels so effortless so effortless that it will probably make you feel like you could pick up a guitar and write 69 love songs yourself if you're yet to hear it so I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong five on this thing but what do you guys think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana the magnetic fields forever 
mbmpyvyIj3A,on the mend today hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd time for a review Big KRIT forever in a day Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper who's been bringing back the classier side of southern hip hop in a big way for the past couple years he's been making mixtapes for a while but a little bit he really started making waves in 2010 when he put out his album crit was here and he gained even more ground with a Def Jam signing and return of forever in 2011 and the dude's output so far has just been incredibly consistent just really solid stuff he raps on his own stuff he sings a little bit as well and he produces his own instrumentals he is in complete control of everything that goes into his music so rarely do his tracks ever take an unpredictable turn not to say that there's not variety on here it's just that I rarely hear a Big KRIT track that I find out of character whether crit is gone for something really smooth and soulful like on the track highs and lows or really hard-hitting and energetic like the song country he's always throwing production out there that has this really smooth resonant bass crisp eyes and a real strong southern flavor the dude can produce and he's proven himself as a songwriter too because he puts some great infectious and extremely catchy hooks on his tracks too I think the weakest link in his chain for a lot of people is his rapping his flows on his records crit does not display himself to be the most flashy spitter out there though if you did check out the double XL cypher or the ve T cypher last year that he was involved in he definitely held his own against the other emcees that were there tons of technical ability isn't really what Big KRIT shoots for if you want to understand what big crits appeal is listen to the verse he dropped on that roots album that came out last year undone vivid imagery storytelling passionate emotions and it's all displayed in a way where it's extremely extremely easy to relate to for the listener whether big Cree is rapping about the worst things the world has to offer being successful or even just a fantasy car he really tries to put the listener in the passenger seat TT a lot of the time this gives Big KRIT songs really kind of uplifting and inspirational quality to them especially when he's rapping about how far along he's come in his career because he's really putting a real picture of success out there because it's not like climbing to the top is all money models and expensive alcohol success can be really fleeting especially in the music industry and unless you're completely clueless or really egotistical you're going to have a natural hunger to self-improve or maybe just have some feelings of self-doubt here and there that feeling is kind of displayed on the first track to drop from this album boobie miles which is a song titled after a high school tailback that was looking at a pretty promising football career just before it was ended by a knee injury crit takes the track through a series of sports analogies and ends up turning into a word of advice that if you're ever going to make it to where you want to be you've got to be focused you've got to be a relentless because you never know when your competitions gonna creep up those kinds of feelings play as big a role in crits personal story as those high end blissful feelings that come with success I actually think on this LP those feelings play a little bit bigger of a role it's almost like the further Crick gets away from the ways life used to be the more he gets nostalgic about it me personally when listening to this thing I was catching maybe a little bit more referencing to his family and his friends and his girlfriend as well especially on tracks like yesterday and red.i it's not a night and a change though because crits usual subject matters and lyrical topics make it onto this LP too but this overly sentimental attitude kind of comes through on the instrumental side of this LP to do here Big KRIT is sampling just a little bit more smooth jazz R&B and soul and it's given a lot of these tracks a really strong emotional foundation like the tracks boobie miles and yesterday are just built on that Hot Buttered Soul of guys like Isaac Hayes Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye the song handwriting actually samples a sultry cut from Annie and Peebles handwriting is on the wall it's actually a track woo Tang Clan sampled as well on their 2001 album iron flag the track red eye has some really somber piano chords on it and that's not the only track on here that just has maybe a little bit more atmosphere around it some shimmering instrumentation some prettier sounds just some more high gloss Sheen the track me in my old school even has these reverb soaked flute solos kind of fluttering all over the place in between these cascading layers of string sections I think it's definitely the prettiest instrumental big Critias put together so far crit even invites guest musicians onto this LP to perform on on these tracks the song wake up has some are some more familiar sounds on this thing though like the track forever and a day the title track which sounds like a variation of the title track from big crits previous album same with the songs 1986 and country rap tunes those songs also kind of feel like different takes on crits usual sound but different enough to still kind of be enjoyable especially 1986 which has a really interesting change up in the beat toward the end of the track it's almost like it changes into a totally different song toward the end but one of the most exciting songs on here or maybe the most affecting songs on here for me is definitely packaged store the opening bar on that track about the preacher trying to pick up a prostitute with collection money from the church is just so dark and and twisted especially when it's kind of backed up with the light about snakes in the grass too in the last track on here the closer the alarm is kind of like this really just fiery intense philosophical wake-up call there's this really kind of operatic vocal toward the end of the track and this instrumental swell that's that's pretty gorgeous overall the album is great but if I had to get a little nitpicky with it some tracks did kind of pale in comparison to others definitely tracks like wake up and yesterday could have developed a little bit more got a little bit more detail into the instrumental as the song progressed some spots here felt maybe a little bit too lovesick I felt like the last track could have used a lot more lyrics but still I enjoyed this a lot this was great and between this Return to Forever and chritmas here this guy has been on an incredible streak it's only kind of making the build-up to his kind of major label debut live from the underground even more intense to me just feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing what do you guys think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Big KRIT forever and a day forever [Music] 
u1dDaYvhQCs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's sickest music nerd and I'm here to do the most painfully awkward segment that this channel has to offer why you know review coast by Cal Church esta a Cal Cheech esta will announce the artist and album title and then I will go through a quick spiel Frank Grass interstellar this thing is a pretty dreamy pop and rock album that just refused to stick with me no matter how many times I revisited it it wasn't thrilling enough to keep me excited and it wasn't pretty enough to kind of keep me seduced I felt like the singing was kind of indifferent and even though the production was pretty good overall interstellar just kind of felt really breezy to me I guess buds driver both syros this thing is an experimental hip-hop album that challenges norms and blends genres and I would expect nothing less of bus driver however on this LP he sings a lot more and I'm not a huge fan of his singing voice it just sounds really strained and ruins the LP for me honestly though I do have to admit this is a very creative an eccentric album her visual delune this album takes inspiration from the 1902 silent film of the same title but I didn't feel like the music really matched the ambition of the concept though air goes in a lot of different directions with the music here psyche rock and being pop some orchestral elements here and there krautrock as well but I feel like this album would just be labeled as a random assembly of tracks if it wasn't for the fact that this thing through its title and its concept is tied to a trip to the moon gymnast in' genius this is the debut LP of an experimental underground R&B prod that just felt way too much like the weekend for me to really celebrate the production the vocal stylings even the subject matter of these tracks just scream weakened to me and it's not even that its influence it's that it just kind of sounds like a less amazing version of something I've already heard if you're a die-hard for this kind of sound and you want to hear more stuff in this style I would check it out but as for me I'm pretty much on the fence shit-shit always this is a new shoo-shoo album which goes in roughly the same direction as the last shoo-shoo album which is my least favorite shoo-shoo album so of course I wasn't that into this shoo-shoo album BJ is the Chicago's kids pineapples now later this is the debut LP from a Chicago R&B singer which I was pretty excited to hear because of this dude's ties to guys like Kendrick Lamar however I didn't feel like there were enough great songs or fantastic vocals to carry this album for the entire hour that it lasts there are some bright spots here but I just felt like there was some filler that kind of killed this thing for me die Antwoord $10 I add well this is the second die Antwoord album and the scripts image continues to be way more interesting than their music which partially is intentional Dyanne word would not be where they are if it were not for their visual aesthetic and they definitely love throwing an image out there but even though some of the rapping and some of the flows on here are pretty great the production and the lyrical content the subject matter just felt cut out yeah been hailing a different kind of truth pretty much here van Halen makes a van Halen album for Van Halen fans and that's it these guys are still trying to write songs like as 1978 which would be fine with me if this album felt as fun and arena sized and detailed and youthful as the old stuff to me ultimately this thing just ends up kind of feeling like van Halen pared down but it's definitely something I think hardcore fans will be into young magics Millette debut album new york neo psych pop band a lot of people have been excited about this album but I'm having a hard time just really getting thrilled about it because to me it just kind of ends up feeling like a less bold variation on something Animal Collective or Yeasayer would have put out in 2007 if you're seeking out more stuff in the style I would say check it out but for me it just sounds to like what influences it for me to be excited I guess dr. dad PhD B voids I thought this album was a decent enough release for dr. Dawg it pretty much has their usual blend of of indie rock Falken and Beatles inspired psychedelic rock and pop but this LP just does not feel as fun or as catchy as the band's old stuff for me asked the Potala t s potala t this is a New York indie pop band that sings songs about things that New York indie pop bands sing songs about like college and friends in New York not every track on here was all that memorable or a hit for me though but if you're an indie pop addict I recommend this highly mr. Roger Glasser experimental black radio this latest LP from jazz musician Robert Glasper is a combination of hip hop beats jazz instrumentation and a slew of vocal guests including Lupe Fiasco most death and even Erykah Badu I had really high hopes for this thing but I ended up being a kind of rocky ride because some of the beats got pretty repetitive and and some of the vocal features got kind of iffy it just felt inconsistent but is definitely worth a listen for the smells like teen spirit cover alone at the very end of this thing is Lance sleeping forget this is the latest LP from the singer-songwriter project of of Nicolas Thorburn ex member of the unicorns and when I heard this thing I kind of realized that I haven't enjoyed a nylund's album ever since return to the sea arms way felt really overblown vapors felt way too simplistic and skeletal to really be all that memorable however this album feels instrumentally like a very nice and tasteful middle ground but I don't know the songs and the singing just weren't that engaging to me I guess so the album just ended up feeling kind of flat twilight's adds nobody can know this is the third album from this Glasgow based indie rock and shoegaze outfit and I keep trying to get into their music and I just can't and this time around it has a lot to do with the production none of the sounds on this thing or all that vibrant or bold sonically this LP just feels kind of dull and and plain to me and these tracks have a serious lack of momentum to them too considering that these guys are rock band I just wasn't that into this thing and I don't see myself being into Twilight's ad albums in the future either unfortunately but we'll see lamp chip mr. oom this is a baroque pop album that you should definitely definitely check out if you love hearing your songs slathered in beautifully arranged instrumentation however I was not into the vocals on here at all they felt too quiet too choked just not that captivating to me but still there is some really good songwriting on this thing so check it out every deluxe Queens the wave I've been listening to this LP returning to it and returning to it and I'm sure for a lot of people this is going to be difficult to make heads or tails of and because of that for a lot of people it's going to feel exciting and adventurous and strange and new a lot like the band mr. bungle Pepe deluxe really works to incorporate as many sounds and genres into this record as possible and the final result kind of sounds like a James Bond movie soundtrack just loaded with surf guitars and break beats and there are some pretty moments on this album that I do like some masterful arrangements too but some tracks like supersonic and Hesperus garden the vocals and the songwriting are just so corny I can't enjoy it like on on any level I do enjoy some nostalgia so schmaltz eNOS here and there and some Kitsch here and there as well but this just went too far down that road for me to really get into I'm sure a lot of you guys are loving this thing and though I do see some ambition here I have to just say hey you know I can't be with you on this one sorry hagee beats um title on the new Haji beat CP there is some improved production for sure and of course that makes Haji sound a lot better with Flying Lotus on the production credits on this thing here how could he not sound better however I'm still not that into Hajis lyrical content and his flows are really blown me away either I just felt like you know this is okay fun period some night this is fun sophomore LP and this time around the band is really shooting for this theatrical rock sound inspired by bands like Queen in an attempt to kind of evolve past their indie rock roots and the tracks that do that are pretty fun and interesting but then again there are some songs on here that kind of just end up feeling like a Matt and Kim tune with autotune vocals flying at me from every direction even though it is an inconsistent album and it has a janelle monae vocal feature on it that you can barely hear there are some good tracks on here napple death a tellurian on this LP napalm death roughly plays with the same sound that they've been toying with since 2000s enemy of the music business here greenways vocals may sound a little bit more extreme the guitar riffs may sound a little bit more thrashy than usual the songs may feel a little bit more catchy but the differences between this LP and napalm deaths previous few to me are just very very slight napalm death does try to break things up though with some cleanly sung vocals and some deep dark operatic vocals and there's even a saxophone solo on this thing a saxophone feature with John Zorn bringing the whole grindcore napalm death John Zorn naked city influence cycle full circle however there's still not enough new material or ideas on this album to really make me feel all that thrilled or excited to listen to this entire thing again and again still a decent effort though from napalm death and it's pretty amazing that they are putting out music this aggressive and in this overpowering after all these years yeah that's pretty much it what do you guys think of all these albums do you love them do you hate them why and yeah that's my why you know review for this month I hope you all have a nice day hope I feel better soon 
NwLERkr_SPM,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time to get these monthly album recommendations back underway it's February its 2012 and I have some albums that I would love for you to check out because I think you would like them one one recently dropped on relapse records the new Christian mistress album possession these guys are a Washington metal band kind of a metal throwback bringing back the sounds of Black Sabbath Iron Maiden and Judas Priest and one really tightly tightly produced metal record that has some great enchanting vocals and some awesome guitar solos to the new perfume genius LP put your back into it Mike had rias is the frontman for this project a singer-songwriter project and on this record he has improved the recording quality of his songs and it's given his Tunes a serious emotional punch just really resonant pianos nice strings beautiful guitar it's some slightly depressing stuff so if you're in a bad mood maybe you want to steer clear but maybe you don't 3 the new Portico quartet album these guys are a Glasgow band they have an awesome awesome combination of electronics and jazz together on this new self-titled album it's one of my favorites of this year I love the way these guys bring these sounds together in such a creative way another album that I love this year I actually have a copy of it right there's the new Loma Prieta album these guys are a California band bringing back an old-school scream oh and hardcore sound with some really abrasive abrasive guitars and vocals you've really gotta brace your ears on this one but there are some really beautiful and melodic guitars that give these really abrasive Tunes an element of beauty that that really sticks with me as I listen through this thing and finally the new John Talbot album Phin this is an electronic album kind of toying around with with different sounds in the world of house music from deep house to micro house to Balearic beat just lots of really constant grooves on this thing great sounds some awesome glossy synthesizers just washed in reverb some nice vocal features on this thing too though though it has a lot of variety jumps all over the place a little bit the quality of these songs is very consistent those are five albums that I would love for you to check out links below to reviews of those albums underneath this video and some music from those albums as well thank you for watching Anthony Fantino recommending albums forever [Music] [Music] 
OfNsxzM4yRM,doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo p DD DD - dammit how many times do we have to run through this before you just get it right alright hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review evie in Christ kings and them this thing is a compilation of beats from an up-and-coming electronic music producer Joshua Leary I posted about him on the needle drop com back in January a lot of sites were posting about his music and people didn't really have much to go on other than this bear looking anonymous a YouTube channel with these really great instrumentals uploaded to it and it's an interesting set of sounds on this thing it's really a hybrid of hip-hop ambient music of shoegaze effects as well and some current sounds in electronic music future Garage footwork now it's definitely not the first time I or probably you have heard something like this the atmospheric and just lucid and rainy effects surrounding these instrumentals is in a lot of ways in line with the material that clams casino has produced you know his beats the beats that he's made for little be ASAP Rocky I suppose if you wanted to take the link between ambient music and hip-hop back even further you could listen to clouded the first track on this thing that is a highlight for me is the song my D which is very mellow has a haunted melody that opens up the track that sounds sampled and looped and it's manipulated so much I can't really tell what it is is it a synth is it some strings and horror like some work kestrel elements that are just heavily obscured it does kind of sound like I'm listening to an orchestra of some sort but I'm in the hallway outside of the auditorium hearing them play through the wall the bee starts picking up and it has these handclaps and these planks and these really heavy BC hits that are not are not hard or not punchy they're very dark and deep and resonant the sounds that Evie in Christ is using to make his beats with they sound like they're coming from the Roland 808 they kind of come off like sounds that were made to emulate the sounds of that old-school drum machine classic and then when the vocal sample hits may go down as may go down as another ballast the song goes absolutely just it just goes hard it goes hand at first with this track the images I was seeing were just blue skies and and rivers and serene forests and now all of a sudden I'm seeing like snapback hats and gold chains and chest tattoos and little be doing the cooking dance a couple tracks down the road is the song fucking on the all don't rap and that song is great as well it kind of samples that taiga tune snapbacks back and the song grooves really hard but still has this very Spacey vibe to I don't know whether to dance or to just like chill out it's got this chopped and screwed vocal sample and this really busy busy snare drum it kind of sounds like a combination between like a trap music instrumental footwork and just ambient music another track sporting this kind of future garage in footwork aesthetic is the song horses and motor it's got this nice female vocal sample on it kind of chopped up and the synthesizer sound like this lower slower version of some of the sense that I heard on that subtract album that came out last year some of avian Christ's vocal sample choices aren't really that hot though because you know as I continue through the album I'm hearing him sample entire verses from that Tyga tune that he sampled earlier on the LP and some songs on here the synthesizers are the beat just kind of meander and come off a little bit too repetitive they just feel hardly is developed as my Dior none of y'all don't wrap the whole thing kind of sounds like the soundtrack to a dream sequence in a rap video the last track on here is really the most ambient out of the bunch on this compilation and though it is really pretty I can't really think of much else to say about this LP it's clear that these tracks really weren't conceived as an album because a lot of them kind of feed off the exact same samples and ideas it's to the point where some of these tracks just sound to like one another I guess still I think this thing is a great effort it's worth checking out and it's free so there's not really anything for you to lose there are some great tracks on here it's just that putting them all together it becomes really apparent that some of them don't have as much detail or as much progression if this is Evie in Christ kind of at the demo stage of things I can't wait to see what he does when he kind of takes it to the next level so I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing what did you guys think about it did you like it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Viet Christ forever you 
FnA5YRQwvRk,please don't smell please don't stop I don't want it to smell please don't snow hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review wizard wizard wizard is a new project fronted by rapper singer and multi-instrumentalist Kid Cudi and it also involves doctor genius a multi-instrumentalist and producer as well and dot is a guy that Cuddy has worked with before so this is definitely not the first time they've pulled material together and what makes the site project so different interesting and worth talking about is that it's real change in direction for Cudi Cudi is known primarily as a rapper and even though he's put out a couple albums so far his releases have pretty much been labeled as being hip-hop even though consistently he's been a guy who has led other genres of music influences stuff too because conceptually this is really Cudi's and indata geniuses rock record now rock music has been divided into a lot of different sounds and styles over the years but I would like to think that no matter how fractured the world of rock gets all the best albums in the genre have one common characteristic and that characteristic is fire it's passion it's just high intensity emotion it's not a tangible thing it's not really something that you can measure all that accurately with numbers but you know it's there when you hear it you hear it in the guitar leads the Jimi Hendrix plays on the opening to Purple Haze you can hear it in Joe strummers voice his voice that's sounding so breath you just gasping for breath on the track London Calling and you can hear in the build-up and the impact of the hard heavy distorted guitar chords on the Nirvana track litheium passion that when you hear you just get sucked in you lose control it's that passion that has made rock music such an important force over the years and this kind of passion or any kind of passion is exactly what wizard is missing 11 tracks and an absolutely no fire my issue is that wizard is trying to relive these rock sounds with absolutely no guts whatsoever and it's said because the album actually has a really good intro with these just rumbling synthesizers and these dark muddy guitar leads I thought I was going to hurt I thought it was going to hear like this combination of of progressive synth rock and and doom metal for some reason but then this programmed drum machine beat comes in and it actually sounds pretty good it's an epic combination but the album drops hard after that track with high off life the track starts with these handclaps and this generic guitar riff there's this beat that sounds like it was finger tapped on an on an MPC and Cuddy starts doing this weird stuff with his vocal delivery and he starts singing about his house in the hills or singing to his mom telling her not to worry about him it's just so unimaginative and there's no momentum whatsoever the guitar riffs on this thing just lay really lazily against this paste paste drumbeat that has no Drive to it it's just rock music but like neutered I don't even do drugs and and Cuddy's song about a drug-free lifestyle made not doing drugs sound really boring this flatness this lack of Drive this lack of excitement is an issue that pretty much every track on here suffers from the song love heart tries to get it up with this quarter note bass drum beat really kind of push things along but it just ends up flaccid and the song doctor pill sounds like a bit of an attempt to chase after this grunge rock sound and the message behind the song is fine kind of talking about prescription drugs and people expecting them to fix their problem but Cuddy's vocal delivery just kind of ruins it feels so ridiculous and he's just going around it sounds like something he heard on another record but then he just figured he could do it on this record and it would work even though he's putting zero energy into it I got a say on this record Cuddy does not sound like a guy who has put out two albums and been featured by Ti and jay-z and Kanye West instead he just sounds like a random dude who listened to a bunch of Nirvana and blur and then said I've got to make a rock album but in this albums sort of defense not every track on here tries to rock you know there are some songs on here that slow things down like I'd like the dream time machine but even that track fails to be even pretty I think the one track on here that was decent was teleport to me Jamie and and the reason that track works out so well is that it's a pop song it's more familiar territory for Cudi this really introspective song it's a little sad a little forlorn it's about a relationship but it just stops short of being fantastic and I think partially that's because of Cuddy's voice I never thought I would say this but I don't think Cudi is is that great of a singer and the reason I feel like I I never thought I would say this is because out of all the rapper singers out there today I thought he was one of the better ones whenever he would sort of take a break from his rapping to sing he was much more on pitch than most rappers who attempted singing his voice had some personality to it too but not enough to hold an entire album on his own I guess take the hook from high off fly for example his voice just sounds really strained really all over the place on that song and it's just smothered and distortion to cover it up the problem becomes kind of even more obvious when you take a track like where did you sleep last night which is an old traditional folk song but this version of the seems to be pretty heavily inspired by the Nirvana version of the song I don't want to say Cuddy's voices worse here than on the rest of the album but the fact that it's not that great combined with the drum machine B and just the muddy guitar and the the really plain bass line it sounds like something I would hear pumping out of the PA of a local bar during karaoke night some of the lyrics on this thing really make me cringe too and I really didn't find much of anything that appealed to me on this record it's it's definitely something for the fans definitely for the fans kind of feeling like a strong two to a light three on this record but what did you guys think about this thing did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantan Oh wizard forever [Music] you 
llsGRWq4K8M,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time sorry that was kind of forceful and it's time for an album review christian mistress possession these guys are a hard rock band from olympia washington you can call it metal if you want to use the n-word and this is their sophomore LP it's their debut album for relapse records and these guys don't exactly play a new sound of metal a new style of metal their music kind of rejects all of the harsh and abrasive and overly aggressive sounds that the genre has evolved into over the years if you want a more simple explanation it's more like what would happen if metal as a genre had stopped evolving around 1982 the thing is these guys managed to incorporate sounds from metal music before that decade - yeah they have the really driving hyper melodic and accessible sounds of like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden but also they've got that really heavy brooding darkness of groups like Black Sabbath there's a little bit of rush in there too and and rush is a very minor minor part of this album's recipe and it's only a comparison that I make because of the vocals it's not like there are any insane or technical progressive rock time signature changes on this thing it's just the voice of frontwoman Christine Davis she's got a really smoky dramatic vocal delivery and it's got a very very light raspy nough stew it - and the cadence of her voice reminds me a little bit of russia's Geddy Lee I do think it's kind of an unintended similarity though now sometimes on this LP Davis is really not as aggressive as I would expect a metal vocalist to be aggression is not really her strong point but it's not really something I think she emphasis anyway her voice is much better suited for bringing feelings of darkness and enchantment and tortured miss she does have some nice versatility though there are spots on here like the track pentagram and crucifix where she's pretty forceful and on the flip side she can come off very dreary and forlorn like on the title track here now even though the vocals are sort of not going to jump out of the shadows and tear your face off like a starving Wolverine this album is definitely no slouch it's not a wimp some of these tracks have a lot of momentum to them like the song over and over the opener lots of Drive lots of punch on that song hard riffs a very fast beat - and the song black - gold has kind of the pedal to the metal - it feels even more intense with these harmonized guitar leads kind of galloping across the groove but there are other spots on here maybe those are my favourites where things are slower much more brooding heavier I guess you could say the title track feels that way to me that song to me just feels like pagan rituals pentagram dry out on the ground and blood candles everywhere people are wearing cloaks or maybe it's even more like a swamp and Davises vocals kind of like the the fog creeping out over the water with all these Tony Iommi guitar leads just wailing over the music I mean for a group that pretty much sticks to one style of rock there's a lot of variety here in in volume and tempo and mood the band even makes sure to change up its song structures as the album progresses the opening track is just really hard hitting just over two minutes kind of wham bam thank you man lots of energy as the album goes on the songs are getting longer and by the end of this thing lots of changes lots of different parts acoustic interludes that are really funky and and beautiful and build up into these heavy and feminine get our leads that sing out epically into the Starkist night so yeah the tracks kind of get little more progressive as the album continues you can see that I like this album but I still have to admit that this band is doing nothing new stylistically you know if you're on the hunt for a hot new band with a hot new sound or if music that kind of lives in the past usually makes you roll your eyes you're probably not going to enjoy this but then again there are some groups who are heavily influenced by bands or musicians from the past but still managed to drum up their own style or sound in a genre that most people thought was just done innovating the metal band ghost kind of comes to mind and you know if you don't think Christian mistress is is putting their own spin on this style of old-school metal then I would argue they are at least very close to doing so I think this album still manages to be really fun really energetic and catchy and really strong musically like the instrumental bridge on the track pentagram and crucifix is so intense it's camping yes oh that and the way the tempo slows down on the track conviction it creates a really passionate break in the song and I really love the Sinister guitar riffs that open up the song the way beyond between the great guitar solos and the pulsating riffs the fiery leads the bass lines that that hit the groove in all the right places the vocals and and the very good drumming I think Christian mistress is an old-school metal machine they're hardly amateurs who are just trying to copy for me they're more like connoisseurs trying to rekindle trying to find a lost connection I really think these guys were just faced with the unfortunate situation of being born too late so bluntly feeling the light eight on this album enjoy the hell out of it really fun LP really fun rock album and yeah what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Christian mistress forever 
e6NEZa-sXjw,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review track review where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music arena and it's a track review of one of the most interesting tracks to drop so far this year probably ever will drop this year a collaboration between guerrillas james murphy and andre 3000 the track is do you think the music on this track makes the song interesting of course but each of these guys are in interesting spots and their careers to guerrillas for one is just hot off the release of their third full-length LP Plastic Beach one of my favorite albums of 2010 and LCD Soundsystem released its third full-length LP as well in 2010 this is happening and that album actually managed to be my favorite album of that year and to make things even more interesting James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem after putting out that album pretty much ended the band an andre 3000 rapper producer member of the seminal southern hip hop outfit Outkast hasn't released an album with outcasts in years but their music has done so much for hip hop people are just starving for new music from them even if it's solo stuff now the radio cut of this song was dropped last week and was kind of curated to be a part of this three artists one song series that converse shoes puts together it's where they kind of assemble some unlikely collaboration between some musical minds and just kind of see what comes out and I really have not been huge on the previous three artists one song tracks some of them featured collaborations from the best coast Kid Cudi and Ross stem from Vampire Weekend as well as Andrew W K Matt and K and Soulja Boy and to me the previous tracks in this series definitely had entertainment value but it wasn't so much because of the song be really great it was interesting because these songs just kind of brought a head-scratching collection of artists together collaborators that would turn heads and this track is no slouch when it comes to that Andre 3000 James Murphy guerrillas each of these artists have put out seminal albums and they all have their own strong eccentric and unique styles and I think they really set the bar for these converse collaborations on this track and also the bar for just unlikely collaborations in general and I am NOT talking about the four-minute radio cut that dropped of this song I'm talking about the recently released 13 minute version the extremely ambitious reputations of these three artists have built this track into pretty much a Frankenstein monster of their respective sounds and influences none of these guys feel underutilized they all get their spots on this track where they have a very heavy influence and sometimes their sounds blend together so well it's hard to tell which one of them has more command over a single section of this track and it's almost like they were conscious of how well it was going and how great it sounded they didn't want it to stop so they dragged it out and dragged it out and built on it and just turned it into 13 minutes the track starts off with these really kind of quirky synthesizers that feel very colourful very light kind of simple maybe even dorky and it's got that really cynthy plastic feel that you'll catch if you listen to gorillas Plastic Beach it's like gorillas is still on that plastic synthetic kick underneath this track there's really nice buzzing synthesized bass line and the drums set on this thing just the drums in general just a really nice cake to them lots of snap lots of crack lots of punch and damon albarn of gorillas kind of comes in starts singing in this really listless vocal delivery that you'll be familiar with if you've heard other gorillas LPS and I'm liking the lyrics to one of my favorite spots on here is when he's saying I'm a light at the mall when the power is gone I'm a shadow in the corner just playing along no matter how much I try to dive into his lyrics nothing really comes together or makes sense and I don't think it's meant to it's just a collection of disconnected thoughts and images that are as unlikely as this collaboration but it somehow manages to function and in this hook that kind of flies in James Murphy is right there in the thick of all of these vocals and the overall hook just sounds so cartoony but even though it feels slightly ridiculous you can't deny that the production is there it's great the hook is really catchy the beat is infectious it's like cheesy without the cheese and when andre 3000 comes in right after this it's almost like he sings a second hook when andre finally starts rapping after he sings this spot in the hook he murders this track that's an understatement he doesn't just murder this track he kidnaps it and he ties it up and then he brings it to his van and then he drives it down to his evil lair where he tortures it for like three weeks and then chops it up into little pieces and tosses it into the ocean serial killer style his spinning is so freakin fast it's hard to keep up and he's dropping some really funny and clever lines too I think my favorite line is the one he drops toward the end of his verse he says and if it aint hipper don't hopple then hush man they sound like man they stole your man they look like no bidding us and there are these robot vocals kind of coming in on his voice toward the end of that section of the song and it just gives the track this nice little extra texture actually while we're on that subject a lot of little extra noises and textures are popping all throughout this song a lot of detail into this thing but after this the track really changes the beat stays almost the same but the sounds just get harsher the groove is more driving it kind of sounds like a noisy post-punk tune sort of inspired by the fall something that I can see LCD Soundsystem producing these guitars are screaming and there are these electronic really abrasive electronic noises just wailing like it is tough as nails and Andre just starts getting really cocky but also kind of self hating he's really going bipolar as this track progresses talking about I'm the shit yeah I'm shit wow this track to me or at least this point of the track is almost like James Gorillaz and Andre had this like mixing board of emotions and they just just decided to turn every emotion all the way up into the red and just force all of them down the throws of the listeners hey love depression happiness excitement these guys took the most inaccessible part of the song and made it the longest part of the song perfect now the final spot of this song is kind of like the the depressing hangover after this all-nighter of emotional outbursts of the most extreme capacity there are these really weary background vocals just move and even though this spot to me gets kind of repetitive it still comes off as very dark I love this track I freaking loved it and I mean I know it's a pipe dream to want more material from these three guys collaborative material but I will just leave this track saying the obvious it's well produced it's catchy it's really an emotional rollercoaster tons of progression tons of character overwhelming engaging I've run out of words to describe this thing so I think the best way I can sum it up is this track just really bland dipping that's pretty much it what do you guys think of this track do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana guerrillas andre 3000

m3vJf5nPLAE,Hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion sometimes hip-hop in middle too and in this track review i'm gonna be talking about a track from wisconsin trapper milo and he has a new mixtape out titled milo takes baths now you guys may remember that last year i reviewed a mixtape that this guy put out titled I wish my brother Rob was here it ended up being one of my favorite mixtapes of last year and stuck with me mostly because it was just a very funny witty underground hip hop with lyrical subjects ranging from friends passing away to homophobia and hip hop the internet message boards lots of references to nerd culture mmm it made me excited to hear whatever this guy was gonna put out next and I was especially excited after I heard about the concept of the mixtape which is basically Milo rapping over nothing but instrumentals created by the experimental beat music producer baths now thanks to that review I did last year a lot of you guys have already been listening to this thing and enjoying it but I have to be honest and say I don't think I am as thrilled this time around as I was with I wish my brother Rob was here and I think my enjoyment dropped the hardest when it came to the track I'm gonna review in this track review for Prince ABBA kaliki of Nigeria needs your help now the song is about a topic that Milo hasn't covered in this much detail yet in one of his songs in Internet relationship but not just simply the act of loving someone or trying to love someone over the information superhighway this song actually kind of covers the sexual side of things and delves into the idea of seducing somebody online and trying to bring things to a physical level when the person you're in love with isn't anywhere near you it could make for an interesting song but I think Milo gives this track a sour start when he tries to experiment by singing the hook singing is always welcome if it's done well and I didn't think it was done well here at all it just feels so weak it feels so off pitch it feels kind of mumbly not all that emotive and for me this misstep the song never recovers from it and we're just getting started things get even worse when you think about what the hook is actually saying I've cried in my room on the nights when my girlfriend wouldn't show me nudes there are so many weird things going on here and this chorus to me just feels like too much information why would you tell me this this doesn't feel entertaining it doesn't even feel like a joke and it's hard for me to even sympathize he really paints a picture throwing in images of kissing the screen typing aggressively covering up pimples and unflattering things in these nude photos and the flame wars that would ensue on the message board that he frequents if anyone found out Milo even references his needle drop review as something impressive to tell this girl to kind of grease the wheels of seduction I know that last one is real and the others feel like they're in the realm of possibility but the entire track just kind of feels like a fantasy and if it's gonna be a fantasy why not get the news why be the guy crying in your own made-up world the track to me just kind of feels like shooting this online sexual encounter through a really intimate and sort of sexy lens when the whole thing really doesn't end up for me being alluring at all and and nothing I want to get intimate with so I didn't like it but in a way this is not too surprising for Milo because his material up until this point has been built on this really personal brutal honesty that sometimes leads to some embarrassing moments some awkward moments I feel like Milo is kind of obsessed with being humble in the same way little Wayne is obsessed with being conceited so obsessed that he kind of comes up with humble fantasies for himself well overall I thought Milo takes baths was pretty decent didn't exactly end up hitting me with the same strength my brother Rob was here did but I'm still gonna be looking for what this guy does next what do you guys think of this track what are you asking this tape do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino milo forever 
5n5X5kQmnBw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review pallbearer sorrow and extinction pallbearer is a name that not only brings me back to my younger years where I watched a lot of Pro Wrestling but it's also the name of an Arkansas band in Arkansas metal band this is their debut LP and there's not too much backstory to give on these guys other than that they landed a deal on profound lore records which is one of the best underground metal labels out there right now based on some of the great song writing on a three track demo that they released in 2010 and though this demo who was good the studio recording on this band's new LP brings their traditional doom metal sound to new levels of heaviness and melody I said traditional doom metal where low end frequencies reign supreme and when it comes to riffs the slower the better I'm talking about bands like Candlemas trouble and of course Black Sabbath but obviously making music in 2012 pallbearer has the ability to reach low heavy sounds that these groups could only dream of making when they first started releasing albums well the production the recording on this thing is fantastic the riffs are massive they're crushing kind of like Giles Corey the man not the album getting smothered to death by rocks placed on him by colonialists accusing him voyage craft the riffs just had this really grinding rough quality to them it's like hearing a never ending monstrous roar only having volume and only having having this is not going to be enough to you know get your album buy and keep it interesting when other sounds come into the mix I think that's where pallbearer really puts their own spin on this stuff really pulls together a personality and creates a style of traditional doom metal that I think will even appeal to people who are usually not into this kind of music the sounds of psychedelic and progressive rock make their way onto this LP and for a doom metal band pallbearer is incredibly incredibly melodic to the point where the melodies being played by the guitars on these tracks take the spotlight more than the heaviness of these songs the melody and the beauty of this LP comes out right at the start of the first track with this a acoustic guitar intro which is very somber very pretty then this wave of feedback kind of jumps in and then the heavy riffs start they are so gargantuan they're just panoramic sounding just surrounding me as I hear them the sound is almost tangible rumbling but over these heavy riffs these harmonized guitar solos just soar it's like sunrays peeking through all these dark storm clouds that's not all because the riffs that are being played under these really great guitar solos and guitar harmonies guitar leads are pretty lengthy not your average doom metal riff not down now now the riffs are as interesting to listen to on the opening track as the guitar solos themselves and there's some really nice drum fills on this track too I love the way the drums sort of play around the riff I love the way they syncopate with the riff from time to time there's definitely some good interplay going on another thing I think is great about the track is just the vocals there's some very cleanly and have a lot of drama to them they're a little strained here and there but there's some well and sometimes this harmony will pop in and it just sounds really moving especially when it's just escalating to its limit it's almost as if I'm listening to a heavier take on progressive rock acts like King Crimson or Jethro Tull and keep in mind this is all just in the first song which is 12 minutes long and really engaging from start to finish the following track though devoid of redemption is much more straightforward the riff is more repetitive but the band kind of throws a curveball on this track by throwing some psychedelic elements into the song after the second track the album hits kind of a dry spot I guess because the third song on here while it is heavy it doesn't really bring anything the previous couple tracks didn't already be and there's just something about the vocal delivery on that track that just felt I guess a little forced that time around though I know I am kind of making a big deal out of just one single song it is one of just five songs on this entire album and spans to almost nine minutes the next track on here an offering of grief doesn't really expand on the ideas of the previous two tracks either but at least has more variation than the third the final song on here continues to break things up a little bit more quiet interludes there's a keyboard on here that sounds a little bit like a Mellotron - and even though it does sound different instrumentally just kind of felt like window dressing I guess because of the core these songs are written essentially with the same exact intentions as the previous tracks pallbearer just kind of ran out of new ideas to introduce me to which just kind of made this album feel like it dragged on like it was longer than it it needed to be which is silly because it's not even 50 minutes long it drowns in its influences a little bit runs out of ideas a little too fast but still adds up to a very listenable debut album that I would recommend to anyone who's into this style kind of feeling a decent too strong 7 what do you think about it if you've heard it let me know love it hate it why and what should I II review next Anthony Fantino pallbearer forever 
X-VSXW3qthQ,Slappy's hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review sleigh bells reign of terror sleigh bells is a new york poppin rock duo and this is their sophomore LP the band is pretty much singer Alexis Krauss and guitar player Derek Miller and I've been getting a lot of requests to talk about this LP not only because this band has been getting a lot of buzz this year but I have kind of a troubled past with sleigh bells I think I'm gonna come out and say their previous material has not exactly received glowing reviews from yours truly but it's whatever I wasn't huge on this band's debut LP treats but I will give it to this album for just being extremely extremely loud a really brittle ear-shattering style of loud it was just a combination of these early tinny distorted guitar riffs matched up with shouted female vocals and some really really compressed heavy drum machine beats all the melodies the emotions the songs just felt really really simple and in a way they had to be because I can't imagine a complicated or detailed song translating all that well through the extremely loud and low Phi recording that sleigh bells subjected its music to on trees this helped me definitely reached a new threshold of volume for pop music but I wouldn't really go as far as to call it experimental or trailblazing or anything like that because a lot of the songs on here were just so so shallow that the volume and the recording style just kind of ended up sounding like a gimmick it was really the only unique thing it had going now the sophomore LP reign of terror is here and I definitely commend these guys for tweaking their sound up a bit they have pulled their recording a style out of the lo-fi doldrum they've created a set of tracks that actually tries to stand past the sound that defined the debut album from these guys and really kind of prove their worth but overall I think sleighbells pretty much just ended up with a better recorded version of their last album a lot of the melodies on these songs even resemble melodies from the previous album and the sounds they're working with are still roughly the same the distorted tinny guitars the really cheap heavy drum machine beats the light breathy girly vocal delivery one of the few sounds on here that I caused being kind of new kind of fresh where these shouted background vocals kind of like in a chorus or in unison they kind of sounded like vocals a group of cheerleaders would scream their samples of roaring crowds just screaming as if sleighbells is like indie Pop's answer to arena rock and in a way I could see them being that because they definitely go for a loud bombastic over-the-top sound a lot like bands such as kiss did in their heyday and like kiss sleigh bells really tries to push an image to the last thing I was catching on here that felt kind of new was just all these layers of guitars because the mix is less lo-fi less claustrophobic this time around there's just more space to throw in harmonized guitar solos a little bit of riff counterpoint I guess some whammy bar solos though it is clearer it's still loud too loud and abrasive for commercial radio but still tries to shoot for that same kind of candy-coated accessibility this album is pretty much abrasive only because of the guitars and if you replace them with synthesizers or something like that I don't really see any reason this album couldn't get played on any commercial radio station even like Radio Disney even though I think this LP is just a variation on the previous album I did end up liking it more and it let me see sleighbells music in a slightly different light it's not exactly winning my heart or anything but the noise and the beats and in the hooks on this album in a way actually kind of reminded me of Nine Inch Nails a little bit you know except it's going for something that's a lot more gum-chewing hair twirling and shallow the whole thing to me just ends up sounding like a beer commercial you know it just feels as flashy as a beer commercial when I listen to this I just see bikini models and hot waitresses and guys shotgunning beers and like a bar band rocking out the only difference with sleighbells take on this is that the bikini models may have some skull tattoos the waitress may be wearing gold spandex American Apparel tights and chain-smoking the beers that are being shotgun der Pabst Blue Ribbon and the band that's playing might be wearing some Wayfarers and Ramones t-shirts still the new recording that sleighbells is working with in my opinion though it kind of takes the uniqueness away from this duo it does make their music a lot more listenable the beginning of this LP to me just kind of felt like usual sleigh bells but the end of this album cooled off a bit tone things down and I ended up liking it which isn't too much of a surprise since from the previous LP songs like rill rill were my favorites songs like DOA which is kind of like sleigh bells attempt at a valid and then road to hell which was pretty repetitive but very kind of alluring and sexy those tracks to me come off waist sweeter than the ones with just the the insanely loud guitars and it's not even that it's loud it's just that what the guitars are playing on tracks like born to lose toward the end of the track or demons the riffs just sounds so immature they sound like riffs that you play on your tiny little practice amp but the distortion button turned on and turned all the way up there are some improvements that I'm noticing with this LP and that is making me like this album in this bands music a lot more but not so much that I'm just totally head over heels for it sleigh bells has their own style and as long as they have that it's going to attract fans it's going to catch ears and it's going to stop people in their tracks and that's always a good thing I'm kind of feeling like a strong five to a light six on this but what do you guys think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana sleigh bells forever [Music] [Music] 
GBp40M6WMxA,perfume genius hi everyone you have to be Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review perfume genius put your back into it perfume genius is the singing songwriting project of Mike had rias this is his sophomore LP his debut album came out in 2010 on Matador Records it was titled learning and it received quite a few great reviews but it was just a few things about it that was keeping it from really I guess resonating with me the album has some really pretty piano I felt like the voice was there the personality was Lizz Lizz there the songs were there but the production the recording just felt really lacking I guess wasn't really doing much for me it was low five but not in a really flattering way I thought the cavernous reverb that was inescapable with this album really kept these songs just feeling distant kind of alien which were definitely feelings and emotions that we're looking to be portrayed on that album now with this new LP pianos mics very unique voice which kind of sounds like it's on the verge of weeping literally and reverb are all still a part of the foundation of perfume geniuses music but most of the kinks on learning are pretty much completely ironed out and though this album does have more going for it I think it's greatest quality is the greatest quality of learning as well and that's simplicity you know on some of my reviews I do get comments that are like oh Anthony Fantana hates simplicity this is too simple for Fantana and the thing is that's not always the case of not an enemy of simplicity on some albums less is more and I feel like that's the case here the elements that build the songs this LP are very simple and though there is progression there is change on these songs these alterations are usually very quiet very subtle and very minimal and that really works in this album's favor especially considering that there are so many feelings of loneliness and sadness and introspection being pushed by these songs the fact that you have mix that just has so much space so much room to think and feel and react it just reinforces those feelings the instrumentals on this LP just feel really skeletal and musically the album is is really simple to the chord progressions on this LP travel through really easy to play and kind of familiar territory there are moments on here like the track sister song which is the last track on here that borrows straight from an old full chord progression the song hood totally has a doo-wop thing going on with its chord progression and that track really takes advantage of that sound of that style with the lyrics to kind of going for this very heartbreaking confessional angle and a couple songs on here note ear being one of them have a bit of a gospel spiritual thing going on with the chords this album is not filled with flair and and mind blowing technical proficiency it's very straightforward it's very simple very quiet very raw very emotional and I'd say visceral so not only are the sounds on this LP pretty simple very beautiful but played very gently on most of these tracks as if they're afraid to make noises if they're afraid to to be bolder and be louder in fear of they might lose their composure like they're just trying to hold all these feelings back there are a few spots on here where the song sort of has this emotional outburst the floodgates really break open like on the song hood which gets pretty loud with some drums and piano breaks down and gives this really passionate loud vocal performance but most of the time on this thing and the track note here is an example this album is looking for ways to just handle all of this heartbreak all these really distraught feelings just looking for a place to put them or just a way to deal with them that though it's a problem a lot of people have had and that to me is where this album kind of finds humanity finds relatability now as far as the production and the instrumentation goes on this LP the recording is so much better Mike's voice now is right up front and center you can make out all of his lyrics for the most part and he does a great job of just projecting his emotions on to me whatever he's feeling whatever social sort of idea or emotion a song here is trying to portray I just feel it instantly a lot of the time on here I'm just kind of left speechless and choked up by some of these songs and what I find so funny about that is that some of the tracks on here just so freakin short one of the shortest on here is just one minute 49 seconds and Mike manages to pack a lot of song into just a small sliver of time not to say you get lots of sounds and lots of melody in one single track but Mike sort of builds these songs to be consumed in a short amount of time the verses are short of the choruses are shorter the endings are very simple and on most of these tracks despite the fact that they are a little short of breath Mike always make sure to pack into them an intro kind of a build up a climax and a very simple ending to me it's kind of like thumbing through a book of just short stories of musical vignettes or like of poems it just ends up feeling really passionate really emotional very intimate - and I think a great deal that is because of Mike's voice which just has this insane vibrato to it not even really a vibrato he sings really well has some great range but as he is delivering these vocals these lyrics he just sounds like he's holding back tears it sounds like he is shaking it's a strange delivery not everybody is going to like it but I do think this guy's voice does have enough pitch to keep the melodies going to keep me interested his voice isn't too monie or to breathy and the instruments the production on here does a great job of carrying the emotions along as well and brings some nice variety between these tracks too I love the really wery low-pitched background vocals on the song note tear it kind of sounds like Mike took his own vocals and then just brought them down a couple registers like digitally I love the very airy synth scape created in the background on the track all waters the track hood is is by comparison to the other tracks pretty upbeat and pretty loud and has some nice poppy piano chords and the song 17 has these very kind of ominous strings just lightly kissing the track they do interject a few times but most of the time they're just creating this very soft but eerie texture in the background it just adds to the tension of the song the opening track on here has a really nice noisy wall of sound that kind of swallows the track up toward its end and normal song is kind of a change of pace just because of its three-four timing and introduction of an acoustic guitar vocal delivery personality emotion songwriting and just memorable hooks great production I feel like this album is a triumph over learning in almost every respect I didn't come out of it with at least a few gripes though there are some moments on here that I think and a little bit too abruptly for their own good the track dirge on here is a little bit too repetitive and the track floating spit has a nice bed of synthesizers in the background just like all waters but the vocals are pulled backwards like they were on learning just to be really distant that track is a bit of a step backwards stylistically whereas all these other songs that are kind of upfront and painful and bold and loud and in-your-face just feel so good and memorable and and hard-hitting and I suppose another gripe that I could have on here that I think other people may have is the lyrics can lack some detail from time to time I know that I and a lot of people are into lyrics that really tell a detailed story really get into the Nitty Gritty of a situation and though Mike does display a lot of emotion and there are tracks on here that lyrically I think give good reason to be emotional especially hood which is kind of about knowing something or having done something that if your lover knew about they would just not want to have anything to do with you I'm sure most people have a moment in their past or a thought in their head that if everyone knew things would just not be the same and though the lyrics on hood are simple they just paint that picture perfectly I think the lyrics like the rest of this LP do a lot with a little but still you know it'd be nice to hear some words on here that I guess are a little less vague so I did love the hell out of this album actually feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this it's definitely one of the better releases I've heard this year and I'm really happy to now kind of be appreciating the music this project has to offer but what did you guys think of this thing did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana perfume genius 
mwX3u3tG9bQ,grinds visions hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd review Grimes visions Grimes is the montreal-based synthesizer pop project fronted by singer/songwriter Claire Boucher this is the third full-length album from the project and in a nutshell it's kind of the shorter and much better produced sequel to the projects last album Alf AXA and I guess I say sequel because I feel like Grimes is going for roughly the same sound on this LP but there are some notable sonic improvements but aside from the previous Grimes record there were a bunch of other artists that this record reminded me of as I was listening to it for one nearly every single one of these tracks is built on these really quirky old-school very rigid and rudimentary synth pop instrumentals that remind me a lot of artists like OMD Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark or Depeche Mode just just and Claire's voice over these instrumentals it's really light and feathery very breathy and high-pitched in a way it kind of reminds me of a really artsy goth doubt Madonna the vocal just really reminds me of Madonna's first two solo records but the vocals are sung at a pitch that is sort of just shy of the pitch that you would normally hear Vogel sung at on an Alvin and the Chipmunks record and then the vocals are just slathered in so much reverb you can't really make out what they're saying and they have the resonance of whale calls now I know that combination of sounds and influences sounds kind of weird maybe like a joke maybe something that you're wincing at thinking wanna listen to that stop it but I actually think it's an interesting idea an interesting combination of sounds it's really clear if you listen to Grimes first LP listen to the second and this one that she's been slowly developing this style she's just been chiseling away just perfecting this aesthetic my issue is that I just wish the songs on here felt as refined felt as planned or developed or as unique a lot of the songs on this thing just feel really thrown together there are some tracks on here that don't even have a chorus you know they just kind of had this one single idea and then they end just shy of the two-minute mark as if there was just no possible way to progress the song past this one idea as far as the other tracks go some of their hooks just sounds so identical to the verses they might as well be the same part because it's not really like the synths or the beat will change all that much most of the time a lot of these tracks roughly are pretty much one instrumental idea with Claire kind of vocalizing over in a handful of different ways it's a kind of basic set up and it's something that I could definitely see myself getting into if I felt like I was more in love with the elements that make these songs up like the synth work and Claire's voice I think the vocals on here just feel so distant I never really get to know them and at first I was kind of turned off by the really high pitch that they sing at but I don't know after a while it just didn't bug me anymore and I kind of grew to like it my only real issue with the vocals on this LP now our spots like the track vowels equal space and time where it feels like Claire is kind of singing out of her range or something really stressing her voice or just not hitting the notes that she wants to when she's essentially soloing with her voice and as far as the synthesizers go there are just some bad synth parts on here just for lack of a better word just some bad arts it feels like some of these synthesizer phrases arpeggios melodies whatever were played by someone who had just learned music theory like at the end of the song Genesis where you're just kind of catching this scale like been in it in it in any been in it in it and there are other spots on here like the arpeggios on be a body or the synthesizer solos on the track of Bolivian or night music especially night music the solos just feel so aimless they're literally just kind of clumsily stepping up and down like a scale it doesn't sound like keyboard playing it sounds like keyboard practice some of the beats on this LP are pretty good though I do have to give it to Grimes on that especially with tracks like Genesis and Oblivion they have this old-school retro dance-pop feel but they don't feel too dusty or nostalgic and the track eight has this really hardcore robotic vocal sample in the track and these really hard-hitting rhythms and these high pitched vocals just swarming all over the beat I really like how hectic that song is my only issue is that is just criminally short the song sir commandment has a really great groove too and tracks like color of moonlight kind of show off this LPS versatility how Grimes can go from this hard-hitting catchy dancey pop song to something much more atmospheric slow and spacious and still sound pretty decent I'm really not sure what to make of this LP I feel extremely on the fence with it it has so many great ideas and yet there are just some melodies on here that I don't like at all some keyboard playing on here that I think is pretty lazy some songs just kind of end without doing anything or developing or going anywhere it's an album that I guess I thought was pretty easy to listen to but also pretty easy to forget kind of feeling a decent two strong five on this thing but what do you guys think about it do you love it do you hate it and let me know why I am actually as to what is attracting you guys about this album sonically musically let me know Anthony

VuFWZmcH-nY,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment thing but a real life question not like one of these you know kind of semi questions real question so this past week I watched an interesting documentary that you yourself can watch I linked it down below in the description box called press pause play and it's this documentary analyzing various forms of artistic expression art film literature especially music and how these forms of expression are being changed in the digital age change in terms of creation consumption distribution and exposure and the documentary shows the upsides and the downsides of this new digital age using interviews with people from across the artistic spectrum from creators to people who cover the creation like journalists and there was one particular downside that they mentioned in this documentary around the 25 minute mark and the reason I found it so interesting is because I strongly disagree with it and this critique was pointed mostly toward the music end of things though the movie kind of foreshadowed the other forms of art going down the same path and that path would be that in music right now we're kind of reaching this point of saturation there's just too much music there are too many musicians the idea is that there are so many songs out there right now put out by record labels indie and major and from do-it-yourselfers just uploading their songs onto the internet that all of this music is just creating this gigantic blob this gargantuan cloud of noise that's drowning out art that's worthwhile that should be heard so not only is great music great art getting drowned out by this cloud of media Kirti but people are accepting the mediocrity as being great people are actually enjoying these clumsy guitar stars and these tone-deaf singers and these copycat rappers and all the people accepting this mediocrity will never know what great music is I think the voice that's missing from this argument is the voice of the listener I mean I know through this YouTube channel you guys get exposed to a lot of music and you probably use websites outside of this YouTube channel to expose yourself to even more music do you yourself feel like you are being exposed to too much music are you accepting mediocrity is there just too much music out there right now and do you feel like you're finding it difficult to find stuff you actually like because there is so much stuff out there I mean did record labels before the digital age prevent mediocre music from being released is the digital age really destroying talent and drowning it out are we on the verge of a cultural Dark Age because music and art on the Internet are being democratized through clicks and hits and comments and likes it's not like music before the digital age wasn't democratized in some way shape or form it's just that what made for great music was being measured by chart position and album sales labels used to use those numbers to figure out what artists they should promote and what kind of music they should be releasing so do you personally feel like there's too much music on the internet right now if they're somehow managed to be twice as much music on the internet in the next five years would that be too much do you personally feel that there are too many musicians let me know Anthony Fantana music forever [Music] [Music] 
Wjc0FV3AAgM,well well well well well well well well well hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Goatwhore blood for the master these guys are an extremely blasphemous metal band from New Orleans and this is their fifth full-length album and the tracks on this LP just like go whores previous material contain a combination of sounds from the worlds of black metal and death metal now black metal and death metal started around roughly the same time in the 80s but death metal caught on first I mean really kind of caught on as a strong trend and as death metal as a trend was hitting its peak in the mid 90s that's one black metal the Scandinavian sound popularized by artists like mayhem or like Burzum that's when that stuff started catching on of course there would be musicians out there who would just combine both worlds now there's no single way to make blackened death metal over the years groups have experimented with with various combinations of the double bass drums the death growls the retched vocals the tremolo picked guitars the chromatic riffs maybe some keyboards too at the Styles roots sits artists like necro phobic but blackened death metal though it has always been pretty small it's never really gotten bigger than the two genres that make it up it's never really died out either and today there's a new breed of bands that are keeping the sound alive like anaal nathrakh Azarath behemoth portal as well and go whore is one of these bands now over the course of this group's five full-length albums the sound and the production and just the way these songs are written it's just all been getting tighter and catchy er almost making this style of music kind of accessible just like goers is album carving out the eyes of God the production is really punchy and the riffs are starting to get a huge huge thrash injection into them and I would even say on this album the thrash elements are getting even stronger I would say the hooks play a bigger role on this LP to go horror is just reaching this level of of just straightforward pure adrenaline simplicity that reminds me of that skeleton which album that came out last year it's aggression for aggressions sake which I can't enjoy oh that can be pretty appealing for people who are looking for an album that has virtually no BS whatsoever and even though this album doesn't really offer up anything but anger and anti theism I can't really help but get caught up in it whenever I put this thing on and really listen to it it just gets my metal face going you know the face I usually make them listening to a metal record or all the vocals are great really charismatic you've got some black metal wretches on here which sound like a wolf with it's just teeth showing and it's growling and you've got these death growls - they have a fantastic rasp on them really nasty stuff the riffs do have their upsides and their downsides the downside for me is that some of them feel kind of played out kind of generic like I've heard these riffs in just about a hundred different records but on other tracks on but with some other tracks on here like in deathless tradition and collapse of eternal worth there's a strong element of just melody of harmony in the riff and I really feel like that's where the black metal influence here shines through and kind of adds to the memorability of this album but memorable is not really a word that I would use overall to describe this LP because so many tracks here are so similar and execution so relentless that by the end of this 38 minute LP they all become kind the blur for me but there are a few spots on here that do kind of stand out past the wreckage like the really heavy slow intro on in deathless tradition there's an acoustic interlude that opens up the song embodiment of this bitter chaos not to say the riffs on here are notable it's just that they're so similar in in purpose that really pulling a riff out of this album to critique it or analyzer or describe it is kind of like sticking your hand down deep into a jar of assorted color thumbtacks to pull out the red one some spots on here feel a little more black metal more consistent with the blast beats and the tremolo picks other spots on here feel a little bit more death metal but a majority of this album is spent kind of toying with sounds and ideas that appeal to most metal fans kind of common ground for the extreme metal world and that makes this album really easy to like I liked it every single time I listened through it even though I did enjoy it I don't really sense this pull with this album to return to it this thing came nowhere near blowing my mind and the only risk this album takes is the risk of pissing off God pretty much with some of these lyrics because these guys might just catch a lightning bolt on their next tour still go whore has energy charm good production good riffs and hooks and a lot of consistency - over the course of their 5 LPS these are all great characteristics characteristics pretty much all bands want to have kind of feel in a decent too strong seven on this LP what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantino go war forever you 
_OccjaZSDHI,heated man heated hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Titano here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review tennis young and old tennis is an indie pop duo this is their sophomore LP the band's debut album was actually one of Cal Chester's favorite albums of last year but you know I wasn't too big on it which kind of explains why I didn't review it it just felt too sugary to me overall the vocals were kind of all over the place for me kind of weaving in and out of pitch the instruments just felt really kind of of loose the performance was loose they really weren't coming together all that cohesive way a lot of the time the recording was extremely low fie and not in a cute or endearing way and on a final note with this LP I guess the album's attitude is just so relentlessly bright and upbeat and kind of cheery that it becomes almost a little creepy it makes this album feel kind of weird and hard to read kind of like a cult member who's smiling all the time and you just don't know why just a really sunny disposition and all these sounds that pull from the worlds of pop and rock circa 50 years ago and lots of lyrics about the Sun and the beach and the ocean on a few tracks I just felt like this LP was just trying way too hard to grab a surfboard sing some Shalala lyrics and then just ride the wave of sunny Beach rock bands like Best Coast even though I was not huge on this album I have given this LP an honest listen and I'm noticing some decent improvements though it's roughly in the same style as the last album I do think this LP is noticeably better the production has been improved in a big way the instruments actually sound clearer now and feature just a nice splatter of guitar bass drums some keyboards and vocals and the instruments come together pretty tightly to the performance is there you can really feel the grooves on these tracks and even though I am not in love with this album it does not feel thrown together though I think the instruments sound better here what they're playing is kind of a different story take the song origins for example with this track it just feels like even though tennis has made some improvements they're nowhere near ready to kind of give up this addiction to very shallow simple Beach Rock Beach rock that kind of suffocates in the nostalgia of old school Beach rock and the nostalgia of when the resurgence of Beach rock actually used to be kind of interesting two years ago and it's not even really the throwback status of this album that kind of turns me off you know it's it's also that these tracks just lack so much detail it's like tennis just wants to make songs that are so simple they just have no flavor or character to them I just don't think this album does anything that the previous acts toying with this sound haven't already done I think it might even do a little bit less if it wasn't for the fact that I thought the production and just the recording and the sound of this album was pretty good I would probably prefer that cult's album over this you guys probably already know I'm not a big fan of that album so I'm still kind of on the fence with Elena Moore's vocals too on this record but I will say that her her singing since the last album has been improved I'm not saying it's amazing throughout this entire album there are still a lot of points on here where I feel like the vocals are just kind of one-dimensional they're dumbed down emotionally and melody wise too I kind of feel like I'm listening to a vocal performance set at a school recital or something but the song my better self is actually pretty emotive and in kind of soulful it takes a break from the beach rock sounds on the other tracks the vocal on the song petition to has a little bit of bite to it as well there's still that overly sweet element of tennis kind of hanging in the background with those piano chords but it feels like with the bassline and just the vocal and in the hook there that a little bit of Motown influences creeping in on this track and I like that direction a lot more but still some of the biggest issues I had with the previous LP are still here just that simplicity simplicity simplicity to the point where there's just not much to sink my teeth into with this album it's not really an album that I would put on the record player and then sit down with a cup of tea with no distractions and just listen to it because there's just so little going on melodically lyrically emotionally I'm feeling a strong four to a light five on this LP I can't say I'm into this album I can't even really say I'm into this band but I could see why they're popular what do you guys think about this record if you give a note listen do you love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana tennis forever 
roeyTQmPbWw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an EP review burial kindred burial is a london-based electronic music producer first time i'm reviewing music of his psyched for that especially since i know his work has basically helped to define this alternative form of dubstep and and future garage that a lot of people see is just the antithesis to artists like Bassnectar or skrillex this is too loud and this is too noisy and this has too many drops Kells into it though doom check check Adam wobb wobb wobb wobb wobb wobb wobb wobb wobb doom check check and do my blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you know for me it's it's mostly apples and oranges you know I just wish most people would just listen to horsepower productions and be done with it so this EP new EP kindred is a follow-up to an EP that burial released last year on hyper dub records as well and as you may know it's been a while since we've heard from this guy full-length album style burial seems a little elusive only surfacing just to kind of throw a little bit of new music out there oh I'm just going to leave this here and then just flies away but with this new EP kindred we might be good for a while because the three tracks on this thing are whoppers and add up to 30 minutes of new material now the first track on the CP is an epic it's really one of the most wondrous electronic music songs I've heard in a while listening to this 11 minute song unfold and progress is a lot like watching a flower blossom and takes just as long once the groove gets going on this song it starts off with just this choppy dubstep beat as to to be expected and then we get a little bit of basic splitting bit of the old were in the background underneath the beat but it's got kind of a low five quality to it it's purposely muddy and gritty and just grimy now the vocal sample on here is gorgeous I'm usually not that into burials vocal samples but this is a huge exception this woman's voice is incredibly emotive baby you and I love the subtle little edits that burial makes on her voice it just really pushes a progression of the song he makes similar edits in the rhythm too on this track the synths helped that progression too and burial has soaked them in just this huge larger than a larger-than-life reverb it's so panoramic it's universe large it just feels so huge but the the scents are kind of light too like smoke or something it's just all around you can see it but it's not tangible it's just surrounding me but I can't get a hold of it and the chord progression that pops up behind this track as it kind of goes along is kind of uplifting it has a nice ascending quality to it and another kind of sound that this track has going for it is just this light ambient noise in the background it's kind of a record crackle style sound or maybe even kind of an electronic static and this static is kind of the gray cloud and what would otherwise just be a another normal and beautiful day and while it is a great cloud it adds a lot of character to this song now the second track on your loaner is a bit of a change in direction away from the first track it has a beat that is not really a dubstep or two step or per beat whatever it's really more akin to house music really straightforward and driving the song is is just caked in this same gargantuan just galaxy sized reverb and burials usual vocal editing style is there too but the track kind of progresses like a house tune as well with these synth arpeggios kind of popping up as the song is building and building song just hits this groove continues on making slight edits just like the first track enough to keep things interesting but there's this one spot on this track that I have to talk about it's kind of like this drop in sound this quiet interlude and the way this track gets into the interlude is by literally just making the sounds in this music sound as if they are crumbling they are just disintegrating they're disappearing there's dissipating in in every direction so I love the first two tracks the final one on here is where I'm kind of on the fence it is about 11 minutes just like the opening track but it does not feel like one hole complete song or idea like the previous two songs instead it kind of jumps around between these four different phases maybe four different mini songs rather the first two got to have a straightforward 4/4 beat just like the second track loner but they just don't have all that much detail or character to them just not as much character on the third phase of this track I get pretty interested it has a nice little mouth pop inside the beat of the song and the vocal sample on that track is different than any other vocal sample on this EP it feels so young and so light and so fragile and this third phase takes the noise and the static that was previously on this this EP and just ups it to another level to the point where at a few points it really just swallows this section of the song overall I just kind of felt like the third song on here was just kind of disjointed while I would love to hear a new full-length LP from this guy this will do for now very happy loving this thing feeling a strong eight on this no question and yeah I'm basically wondering in light of this what do you think about this EP do you like it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan out burial forever [Music] you
