oL-_u9IKQfc,I don't even know okay hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd before we get into a little bit of album review action sorry it wasn't supposed to do that someone in the comments told me not to crack my knuckles that hurts their ears anyway before we get into this I want to tell you guys that there is a link in the de box to where you can see or hear an interview that I did with Keith Kenneth of course the creator of such projects as Helios and Goldman there's no Goldman to album out now called famous places very great easy breezy pretty light beautiful piano music check it out alright review you know most rock bands are really looking for something to rebel against some bands repel against societal norms some bands rebel against the government it just sort of seems like refusal to conform is just at the root of rock music in general and the war front for Tara mellows Albia a small one is with time signatures and tempo consistency to tip two I mean on last.fm these guys do have math rock as their number one tag for a reason even though that is a pretty broad term considering that these guys and by the end of tonight and hella and battles all fall under that umbrella and there are a lot of groups that shoot for a similar complexity but aren't called math rock like Naked City or Mel banana or ruins but when it comes to assembling dizzying guitar riffs and unintelligibly complex rhythms Tara mellows is doing it with way more ambition on their second LP right here patagonian rats each part each riff on this LP is more confusing than the next four a lot of people I could imagine this could be like handing a kid a copy of Warren piece right after he's finished reading green eggs and ham for the first time in other words this album really will test your listening level because if you're not focused you will miss a lot this is sober sobering music but Tara mellows is a little differ then a lot of the bands in the math rock gauntlet in that they always leave room for a hook something sweet a moment where everything just mellows out a little bit those catchy ER parts those sweeter parts are actually like a release of all the tension that builds up with just one angular guitar riff after another doing cartwheels all over the mix but some tracks get me going on here a little bit and others don't for example the track skin surf has some really cheesy guitar riffs in there and the track frozen zoo actually had some moments that sound kind of like they came together through copy paste paste paste paste and I'm a little on the fence with the vocals though I do have to admit they are the sweetest thing the music has going for it they're doubled up and they have this sort of indie rock aesthetic that makes me cringe at a few points I guess some of my favorite moments on this LP are actually when the band gets quiet it sounds really eerie to me especially when it's just guitar and vocals very memorable like on the end of the track and Citrus Heights or a few moments in one of my favorite parts of the LP the nine-minute party with Gina in general for Tara mellows right here there's just a lot of progression a lot of maturity passed there untitled LP they've just really shown a lot of progress here they're really trying new things for them anyway and this really does feel like a follow-up LP this is a sophomore album so even though I like bands like by the end of tonight and I certainly would recommend hella to anybody if not only for the experience of hearing that kind of music I can't really get down with this album all too much math rock has never really been my strongest suit it's not something that I see is unenjoyable but it's not particularly something that I would spend money on these guys are selling this thing for ten bucks on their labels website and you can actually grab the digital version over at their band camp for just seven where they're streaming the entire album all the way through can't go wrong there you guys are gonna hate me for this score but you know I'm feeling like a strong five on this thing I can't see myself coming back to any of these tracks though I did enjoy this album for the amount of times I listen to it all the way through that score is a sign of indifference I don't hate this LP I don't really like it all that much either but take that with a grain of salt because it's not reflective of whether or not a tear mellows fan is gonna like this thing it's reflective of someone who's not really a big fan of this kind of stuff it's hard-hitting its complex its upbeat and its technical if that's what you look for in your music then please seek out tear mellows sophomore LP patagonian rats on Sargent House records I believe you have any Fantana the needle drop tear mellows forever you 
HQx-nFyc0So,I have a little bit of a headache my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching this is an album review and you know what else it's it's Labor Day why am i doing an album review on Labor Day well this is not Labor this is love forever this is the latest LP from the Swedish black metal group wah dein lawless darkness it is their fourth and easily standing at almost 80 minutes it's their longest these guys got their start in the late 90s and since then have really maintained a sound that acknowledges thrash metal as an influence not only for them but for black metal in general and as far as the black metal lo-fi stereotype goes these guys banished it to hell with every single one of their LPS even their live releases are pretty good in terms of sound quality this is my first LP that I've heard from this band I've listened to their older stuff now - and I'm just noticing a lot of proficient musicianship some good production watching just really hits this sweet spot where they are loud they are abrasive they are grim but they still primarily make rock music but they don't step anywhere near overproduction kind of like that Cradle of Filth stuff that yeah it's abrasive yeah it's intense it's kind of like Hollywood for me maybe a little too Hollywood Wallis darkness is hard-hitting and relentless at many many many points but no matter how loud and crazy things get here there's always an interlude or a solo just around the corner which is partially why this album and its songs one of them being over 14 minutes are so long just a lot of instrumental passages a lot of progressive song structures because of how long this LP is it's kind of hard to just sit down and enjoy it in just one full sitting but you can pull these tracks apart and really enjoy any of them separately overall the LP holds to a particular sound but it's not weighed down in concept or anything like that as far as some highlights go the single reaping death is fantastic just the hook on that song is great it's just the perfect length some really strong playing the title track is an instrumental and has some very very good solos and song after song after song the drumming is really really good great fills the blast beats are on tempo rarely slipping behind or slipping ahead of the tempo it's just a really tight delivery without going for that triggered sound that I don't really like in my metal music the vocals well performed well mixed and in terms of the guitar it's got that nice burning-hot distortion that I love and whether it's riffs tremolo picking soloing whatever the guitar is doing it's usually pleasing me but something's keeping me from just freaking out about this record and saying it's great even though there are a lot of impressive aspects to it I've listened to this and come back to it and come back to it and come back to it time and time again but I just don't feel like it's impressing me more than it did the first time around when I heard it I do think it's great that Joaquin don't want to repeat themselves with their last album and in some ways are kind of repeating what Iron Maiden has been doing with their most recent stuff they don't want to copy themselves so they're getting more progressive they're making longer songs they're looking for ways to kind of just draw things out after thinking about it a lot I think what's keeping me from loving this LP is that it is pretty long-winded and it does have maybe too many similarities with a lot of the black metal that I already love and even though I'm not smitten with this thing as a whole mal feature pronouncing correctly and reaping death are two of the greatest black metal tracks I've heard all year you know I'm not digging it I think longtime fans of this group and people who are looking for progressive black metal in general will see this as somewhat of a masterwork very ambitious somewhat of an odyssey in terms of black metal I'm kind of feeling like a light to decent six on this some tracks I do enjoy and would totally take away from this I may even pick up the single of this LP but let's talk money you know what the thing is everything is great when it's free I'm not so much in love with it that I'm about to lay more than 16 bones down on it on the band's website but for someone else that could totally be the case if you've heard this band's new LP what do you think about it and how do you think it compares with their earlier stuff what would you score this thing Anthony Fantana watt teen lawless darkness forever you 
5QPBbc5PmAQ,all right my needle drops it's time that was douchey it's time to do an album review Miami whore the illumination Miami Horror is an electro project from Australia and was started by a mr. Benjamin Plant and what caught me about this LP is just it's really interesting mix of influences there are some aspects to it that would make it fit right in on the dance floor maybe even appeal to these guys but it doesn't really use a lot of the harsh sounds the buzzing bass and just the hard-hitting beats that a lot of house music uses if you're on the lookout for another cross this is not it so you've got all of these house and electro sounds throughout this LP but also there's quite a bit of disco influence on here to people like ABBA totally have an imprint on this album some Bee Gees flavoured falsetto vocals you got bumpin bass and a lot of drumbeats that emphasize the hi-hat a lot of subtlety and there was some decent song songwriting going on here too it's not just one lyric repeating over one beat and just kind of going on into oblivion because people aren't really paying attention they're either drinking dancing or screwing considering that and all the nicer sounds this thing doesn't feel too out of place either on a set of headphones and it's quite possibly one of the finest mixes of electro and disco I've ever come across because Miami horror works in the for for beats the fluttering electronic blips and bloops and the flange building up right before to when the beat kicks in it's kind of hard to tell where all the disco stuff starts and all the electro stuff ends it's kind of seamlessly pulled together it's like sped up CFCF it's like Crystal Castles but more radio-friendly it's like chill weave but with less nostalgia and speaking of chill wave Allen palomo of Neon Indian actually guests on one of the tracks here holidays however you slice or compare this LP it all adds up to some really essential dance tracks for 2010 I guess we're gonna come down on some major gripes for a dance record it's kind of Airy but in general this is an really a varied album almost every track just ends up in a similar dance beat but Miami whore works to at least introduce all these tracks differently so that you get at least a little bit of a sensation of a difference between all of the tracks whether it be the acoustic opener on moon theory or the narrated female vocals on Echoplex it does get a little cheesy here and there and it's not the most bold statement and dance music it's not anything that labels like Ed Banger or DFA records haven't brought us before and they could have done a lot more to change things up but I think that would have taken away to how much of a dance record this really is here and there the sounds on this LP do get a little generic but it's very nice to hear dance music of this style not just in all these loosely place mp3s uploaded and downloaded throughout the blogosphere but instead on this one easy to listen to album this is a really popular sound in electro right now and I think what Miami whore has done is put together an album of songs that are very definitive when it comes to this style I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a life seven on this thing it's okay it's good as a whole but I'm most likely going to gravitate just toward that neon indian collaboration and the singles which isn't necessarily a bad thing but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it and why anthony Fantan oh miami horror the illumination forever you 
ND3kDfBP9n8,hmm it's too hot out for a sweater hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do a little segment that I missed last week but still question of the week last week's question of the week what's your favorite sound you guys gave me some great freakin answers I wrote them down let's see cats purring double double bass drumming violins less Servier feedback distorted bass distorted guitar distortion distorted distortion distorted distortion that is distorted opening a can of beer Jack Stanley writes that his favorite is whomp whomp whomp whomp whomp then he says his favorite salad is silence a lightsaber turning on hairdryer rain 8-bit music and a busy restaurant says his favorite sound is you know that he only makes these random ass videos so that you idiots will rate comment and he'll make money stupid fools that's not a favorite sound it doesn't really understand the situation um the reason I make all of my videos is so that you will comment and rate and so that I can make money mwah bunny I just got paid yesterday and I guess that brings us to the question of the week which makes me want to kind of start with everybody has heard that new Justin Bieber remix the Justin Bieber slowed down to eight hundred percent but what a lot of people are freaking out about you can hear this remix down in the D box is that it kind of sounds like sigur rós take a Roth's sigur rós and I will admit it sounds very ambient sounds very explorative kind of like Brian Eno and Robert Fritz no pussyfooting so it got me wondering what is a remix I guess I kind of know what a remixes and so we have the remix Wednesday segment on the blog every week where you can download and stream various remixes link in the de box but what are some of your feet remixes and why is this remix one of your favorite remixes what does a remix have to do in order for it to be entertaining to you and love remixes and guys like girl-talk do this all the time where they take a section of a song and recontextualize it over something else making it sound completely different and where do you think the world and the music industry currently stands on remixes I mean we have kind of come a long way since the grey album since then people are remix in and mashing everything in sight ironically it's kind of because ami freaked out so hardcore the fact that the grey album existed stupid record companies sometimes they just thanks to you is there any real art to re mixing something do you hate remixes are they just boring and indulgent or are remixes quite possibly the greatest thing our Lord and Savior Lee scratch Perry has ever given us let me know what you think y'all let me know what you think Anthony Fantana remixes forever 
nu23M18PwPE,Interpol's self-titled well hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I got to do an album review drink time refreshing cold water it's one of the few things I like more than music let's look at a comment machinee says chirp chirp chirp chirp whatever could he be talking about Interpol's fourth LP is their triumphant return to Matador Records after being on Capitol for a short stint of one album and if you put your ears on this thing sound wise Interpol really isn't throwing too much at you that they haven't before in some ways it's pretty much what you've come to expect from the band of course that very eerie hallow sound of course that very eerie bleak hallow atmosphere is on this LP to the sound that's been kind of following them since their first release their critically acclaimed turn on the bright lights and I guess another depressing thing is that this LP kind of follows suit with the trend that has been happening on Interpol's music in terms of Carlos danglers bass lines just getting turned lower and lower and lower into the mix here they're kind of quieter than ever but still they're pursuing that moody rock sound that is influenced by bands like of course Joy Division and I love that about Interpol I'm glad they're still working with that aesthetic it works for them it's earned then the fan base that they have thus far and made their music the treat that it has been for the past four albums the biggest change you'll find on this LP is how the band is structuring their songs this time around which is exemplified by a track like let's say lights the band is really pursuing a lot of building and a lot of repetition in their music on this LP instead of changing up sounds when the verse comes or the chorus comes they switch in between a bridge or something like that the whole song just kind of builds instrumentation and builds instrumentation this is kind of shown up in the form of lots of horns strings piano tremolo Pickett ARS lots of reverb - I wouldn't say Interpol has gone orchestral or shoegaze or drone or anything like that but I would say that they're sounding a lot less like a rock band there's not really any raw energy or power to this LP for me it's all safe and a little dreary - there are a few spots on this LP though where it feels kind of like the old-school Interpol kind of like on the track barricade great dance beat good hook and Paul banks vocals for me are a little off but still very emotive however a lot of the extra sounds a lot of the experiments on this LP don't exactly go over all that well you've got these sequences electronics with the track try it on a very droney and theatrical atmosphere with all of the waves and the album closes with the undoing which features singing in a different language I don't know which one I'm not a linguist and some vocal samples - which were kind of disorienting it's almost as if most of the time the band is like oh let's do this weird sound let's throw in this weird repetition let's just try this new thing which isn't necessarily bad trying new things however I'm just kind of sitting here thinking man I just kind of want you to write a good song and that's where my number-one gripe and kind of my verdict for this album comes in a repetition like I mentioned earlier a lot of repetition on this LP with the building of the tracks and repetition not necessarily a bad thing but in this instance it's for me very underwhelming ah I'm sure a lot of people have been but I can't say I'm really all that angry or offended by this album it's not disgustingly awful I think hardcore Interpol fans may even enjoy this probably even more than Paul banks solo album that he came out with last year so if you're diggin it all the more power to you I have nothing against you but when listening to this maybe for the exception of two or three tracks I am so bored by the lack of contrast in most of the hooks and just the monotony of these songs so really I'm feeling a decent too strong on this one yeah but if you disagree let me know in the comments and what would you score this LP and why are you loving about and what were you eating about it this is Anthony Fantana Interpol self-titled forever you 
dJ2hPTt1Rkc,it's track review hi hi hello hi hi hey hey hey there hey hey hey there Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you're my needle drops how you doing and this is Trek reviews where we talked about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and whether or not it's good hold on one second okay before we get into this track review we have a couple things on the agenda number one MacOS or many of you may know him as MacOS or FM wrote a very nice article on our blog about a new LP from this solo project at a Chicago young man mm-hmm head over there in the D box read the article stream the album and also down there in the D box vote for a South by Southwest panel that the rocket out blog and I will be on about music vlogging it'll help us out a lot and the third thing on the agenda you're awesome we're here to talk about the new CeeLo green song you know CeeLo is a songwriter a rapper and entertainer he's just everything and the guys collaboration list is endless from gnarls barkley to danger doom to TLC of course what made him famous his work in goody mob and also he has solo rap albums that really showcase his eccentric personality CeeLo does have a new album coming out later this year called the lady killer covers not out for it yet but this single came out hit YouTube and man it must be like a blessing to him because it is chests gone viral let's give a listen CeeLo with there we go Dan side comment here Michael Jackson's off the wall listen to it that trash was just fun as hell just fun as hell and what I liked about it is that it didn't hold back and you guys know where you guys know where it didn't hold back in the lyrics in the verbiage if you will but the song is just this genius cocktail of different emotions you have these really bitter bitter lyrics bitter story being told and just nasty abrasive words being used but you've got this really sweet soulful music that recalls the seventies the bass line is doing backflips the drums are thrown in Phil after Phil after Phil the organ and the background vocals are totally holding a sermon and there's some piano in there too and some fuzzy just fuzzy low end and guitar just adding little splashes just a little coarse Ian and I love the bridge when CeeLo is doing this like little Tina Turner emotional breakdown in the middle of the song and just going wow not only is it the sweet melody is just the great vibe of this song how fast it moves just a really nice pace too but also we all know the lyrics the lyrics the lyrics lyrics and yeah you it's a very catchy phrase but but a lot of people may even react to this and say oh well is that language really even necessary don't assume that this track is lowbrow just because of the title a lot of the lyrics actually are clever like when Cee Lo compares himself to an Atari and compares the guy that his girlfriend left him for to an Xbox and when he talks about begging and lying and cheating and stealing just to make her happy along with mentioning that the change in his pocket just wasn't enough to keep her around it's funny it's sad it's angry just hits you with so many different emotions and that's a part of the entertainment that this track offers I know we've all felt the way that this song does at one point or another and this track is just a reminder of how much of a life can be but that doesn't mean you can't take the negative experience and turn it into a viral video and song that everyone falls in love with I'm gonna give this track a few but I want to know what you guys are feeling on this thing are you love an area and why and yeah if you get a chance in the comments tell me what your favorite song is that has an expletive in the title okay Anthony Fantana CeeLo you forever 
87H2nRX0Ya8,kids why-why-why Oh guys I'm shooting this video for the second time and it's because I erased it by accident the first time let's do an album review of the new magic kids album Memphis magic kids I love magic kids like the Harry Potter I hate Cal Church esta these guys are a Tennessee band and my first exposure to them I want to say was from downloading the tracks summer off of gorilla versus bear and you guys may remember I did a track review of that song on this channel enjoyed it quite a bit but the low baritone esque vocals kind of reminded me of the band girls and considering that them and girls are on the same record label and girls that debut LP was so huge in the indie community girls and magic kids certainly have things in common with girls they pull from a similar vintage California sound they're very summery very blissful but I would say magic kids are way way way more influenced by the finely tuned orchestrations and production of the great Brian Wilson I mean hardly a track goes by where there's not a just very present Beach Boys influence maybe one of the strongest tracks that exemplify this is the song hey boy that sounds a lot like these speedier parts on the song wouldn't it be nice with that romping organ but even when the band is really just worshiping the album Pet Sounds they still sound like magic kids they still make it their own whether it's with an interesting interlude or to go back to the song hey boy with a really great background chorus just sounds huge and I read a bio about these guys on true Panther sounds website and they were likened to Electric Light Orchestra and Belle and Sebastian a little bit too and I have to agree but I will warn you Memphis is extremely cheesy schmaltzy and a little corny - it's just unapologetically upbeat it does not care if your bad mood doesn't care if you've had a crappy day because it is completely absorbed in the good time that it is having I know this sounds cliche but I really want to say that this is one of the most feel-good albums of 2010 and that shows up in the songwriting in the melodies but especially the arrangements the horns the strings the piano it's just like candy for the ears really the production made me feel like I was listening to something that was just a little bit more than a pop album something kind of fancy it's kind of like the difference between fine aged wine and grape soda and magic kids sits somewhere in the middle maybe a little bit closer to grape soda but I love how straightforward this thing is it's 29 minutes light easygoing and I believe it's about 12 bucks for a CD I'm sure Panther sounds website eight bucks for cassette 13 for an LP not a bad price but seriously this LP is something that you don't ask for a lot from but gives a lot anyway it's an extremely impressive debut album and my only real gripes are some songs don't really develop as impressively as others in terms of production this is going to vary from person to person of course but the sweetness of this LP after a while around the time when I'm getting to the last track I just feel it kind of wearing on me a little bit kind of like it's giving me a cranial cavity I'm digging the hell out of this thing and I also hope that you guys get a chance to just let me know if you're loving this LP hate in this LP and why I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing add a lot of points it amazed me I just love the sounds on this thing just maybe one or two songs were Anthony Fantana magic hits Memphis 
h3L42McXVnE,okay okay okay hello my needle drops ball Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching thank you for subbing thank you for being supportive and thank you for being amazing we're gonna do an album review of this new Mogwai LP special move in case you don't know that Magua is a Glasgow band they're one of the granddaddy's of the genre post rock one of my favorite genres of music and after six studio LP is tons of EPS and 15 years of being a band right 15 yeah seems like 15 after all of that I imagine it's hard not to want to mark all the progress that you've made in some way shape or form and for me compilations can get a little cheesy to me they're almost like a band admitting that they have written music that's worth glossing over but instead of going down that road Mogwai has done one better and come out with this live album special moves the sound on this live elk he is fantastic though there are a few moments few flaws here and there when it gets really loud really distorted and extreme it could sound a little flat making everything kind of drowned out and every once in a while it sounds almost as if Marc Bullock the drummer is hitting not big resonant drums but kind of very tight hard pieces of plastic these are very very minor flaws on the record there is a much bigger picture going on here a much bigger much more beautiful picture the most impressive thing is that Mogwai has really brought the dynamics the loud the soft the tension the very in the moment feel of their music to this live recording like it was nobody's business and that's no small task I mean we've all heard live recordings that are very bad but here everything translates so well like on the track to rights make one wrong the song the music the instrumentation everything just swells so beautifully and another example on the track like harad Mogwai they have such big they just have so much control over their volume on this album it's amazing they just get so so so quiet before they just finally explode into a frenzy of just everything performance-wise Mogwai are pretty straightforward on this thing not really doing reworked reinterpretations of these songs I think the only moments that I didn't really care for were the track Cody which of course you guys remember from Magua second LP the vocals on that live version of this track were a little flat for me weren't really working just felt kind of off the other track that I didn't really care for was I know you are but what am i but that's simply because I'm not really a fan of the Mogwai album happy songs for happy people consuming of course there are songs that aren't played in albums that have more tracks on this LP than others but still special moves is a great document of all of the progress Mogwai has made up until this point and a show or some proof that Magua is going to be here for years to come thank the Lord like the new Sufjan Stevens EP if you're gonna go digital on this thing you can't go wrong you get the CD you get six extra tracks plus you get the documentary burning that live show of them shine very stark beautiful black and white all for under 20 bucks you just cannot go wrong that is the nice price if I was listening to this album just as is the 11 tracks only that I may give it a decent too strong 7 but there's so much added stuff you get extra tracks you get all this plus plus plus plus it's just bang for the buck and because you get all of that I have to give this thing a decent - strong 8 if you only download or stream this album and expose yourself to simply the 11 tracks you're cheating yourself but that's pretty much how I'm feeling on this thing what about you guys are you loving it are you hating it and why and let me know what your favorite Mogwai album is yeah Anthony Fantana Mogwai special moves forever you 
xjVzCXICeuA,Klaxons surfing the void I salute you sergeant whiskers of the seventh kitty astronaut division hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd about to get into an album review Klaxons surfing the void this band isn't too unlike their UK contemporaries like foals or these new Puritans very experimental songs with dancey beats but Klaxons sophomore LP is a lot louder and a lot beefier to the dance aesthetics that made their 2007 LP so immediate are here but this thing is a little more serious seriousness here guys whether it's the sound quality or just the really compressed mix keeping most of the instruments just at the same volume the overall feel here is very very smooth there are some really great beats on this LP but the volume here does not give you any room to dance or breathe for that matter and it's not hard to see why because producer Ross Robinson was behind the board's on this one and he's of course also done production for corn and beer factory and and Slipknot but don't get me wrong Klaxons do not go new metal on this LP but the sound is a lot more aggressive from pitchfork to new Musical Express tons of critics have said Klaxons are difficult to define many of them kind of being maybe a little lazy and falling back on the new rave tag that has been dubbed to them and I wouldn't really say Klaxons are reinventing the wheel they're definitely not what's so good about Klaxons is that they never drive down one road or stick to one style long enough to let it define them so if you're looking for an album that refuses to be pigeonholed then this may be where you want to look because you've got really heavy grooves distinct vocals psychedelic effects abstract lyrics about cosmic claptrap and when I list out these things I'm just thinking in my head damn sounds like an awesome album let me have that album but truth be told I don't like this album yeah some tracks are real winners for me like the opening single echoes or the track of anusha but most the production is so heavy that it literally kills off the dynamics throws a plastic bag over their head ties it off and just suffocates them to death which is sad because it's clear Klaxons worked very hard on writing verses and choruses that have a lot of contrast to them volume wise arrangement wise but when this LP actually gets loud most of the time for me it just sounds like a big bowl of mush with maybe the exception of the track flashover which embraces the volume of this album with some really heavy distorted riffs I just feel like Klaxons on this album have written 10 ninjas but they ended up with like nine and a half sumo wrestlers I've read in numerous places that this LP is actually a rewrite of an album that Klaxons handed their record label Polydor and then Polydor was like no way bro that's way too experimental I'd like to hear those tracks and if they come out in the future I will let you guys know whether or not I dig them but as is this album I really do not care for it and it has nothing really to do with the experimentation and the adventure of it in fact that's kind of why I respect Klaxons and that's pretty much where my ears are on this album but let me know where yours are on this thing are you loving it are you hey Ned and and why I'm feeling a light for to a strong three on this thing and it's not necessarily because I feel like Klaxons are the worst band ever or I hate them or ooh I don't like new rave and wonder what couch your Chester thinks about a new rave nore seriously don't you know it music marketing ploy when you see one I hate couch Oh Chester I'm gonna have to chalk this up to just not being my cup of tea just not my cup of tea whoever Klaxons target audience is for this music it's most definitely not me and that's pretty much how I'm going to leave that Anthony Fantana Klaxons surfing the void forever 
8TY2SJEq3SI,so percussion and bat most treasure state okay hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review treasure state this LP is a new collaboration from a duo who I hold in very high regard Matt mos matt moses music usually is heavily based on electronics and samples i haven't reviewed this LP but have some appraises of it 2008 supreme balloon that thing is just amazingly colorful and kaleidoscopic that LP was entirely based on synthesized sound but if you go into matt moses earlier stuff you hear everything sampled from semen to water to surgery and though 2008 supreme balloon was amazing to me I kind of just awaited these guys to come back into the fold with sampling live acoustic stuff again but actually going out and recording ice thawing or something like that seems hardly necessary on this new LP because of who they're collaborating with so percussion which is a New York percussion ensemble because of them I'm sure if there is anything on this planet that makes a noise when you hit it it is on this album bells chimes pipes would oddly shaped pieces of metal on the second track what sounds like water being wrung out of a towel into a bucket you could literally spend hours trying to make out the sounds on this thing sometimes I think I hear shells or pick up sticks but now I'm just getting really into it the results of this racket though are pretty musical most of the time there's like the opening track treasure which is a minimalist dream just lots of layers and little instruments just little instrumental sounds all doing their own tiny repetitive part to make something much bigger which is pretty much the story with most of these tracks just starting out with something little and building up into something a lot less little because let's face it the song here even at their most lush and busy are not really that loud or overbearing everything's pretty easygoing and soft and quaint and though I keep talking about these stranger sounds on this LP there is normal instrumentation on here too of course you're gonna pick up drums you're gonna pick up acoustic guitars they're horns on here quite a bit of horns sound wise pretty much all the bases are covered there's really too much stuff here to process in even three sittings what really does end up bugging me about this LP though is that it is really really lacking in variety when it comes to structure and style seriously I'm no expert on so percussion I mean I know some of the people they've collaborated with but this collaboration in particular really doesn't sound like Matt mos or so are going too far outside of their comfort zones instead kind of just indulging further into what they do best because each group is kind of working with someone who is on the same wavelength as them hey you're really in the sound we're really in the sound let's just make some wacky sounds it's really difficult to ignore that almost every track here builds into just a quirky wall of noises but don't get me wrong there are some interesting melodies here and they do change it up every once in a while like on the track needles which stands out just because it really goes overboard with the overboard in a good way and the track cross which is almost unintentionally a hip-hop instrumental here and there I'm just catching some deja vu some points are a little too reserved for me and it just comes down to liking some tracks and not liking others before I end this review I want to tell you guys that there is a link in the d box to where you can hear a new track from the new Blonde Redhead LP on the needle drop calm and thank you guys want for many of the nice nice nice comments I got on yesterday's video where my girlfriend and I reviewed the new animal collective movie you guys are so nice but all that aside I'm feeling eight decent maybe it's strong six on this thing there are some standout moments some tracks that I would definitely take away from it and just be like oh I like these these are my pretty little favourite tricks but this album in no way is another supreme balloon for me which is just mind-blowing all right guys if you've heard it what do you think of this LP xi do you hate it and why and also I hope everyone's having a good day yeah Anthony Fantana Matt Mo's so percussion treasure state forever you 
DPRnDY0jZ4I,there are a lot of points of like really really good like visual composition you know the scenes are shot really really really interesting Lee I'm still processing it like I'm thinking about everything we just saw it's all kind of jumbled together but um yeah there's a lot of interesting stuff there and that's the pair we start this video hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and with my girlfriend Dominique and we are fresh off of watching the new Animal Collective movie odd sack yes we just watched this 55 minutes of new visuals and music from Animal Collective collaborated with Danny Perez I imagined mostly on the visual side of things the movie pretty much thrives on just being a sensory overload I feel like that's where most of its power comes from I would in the end there were moments like this in there I was just waiting for maybe more moments where oh wow this is just so beautiful and taking this in I'm just like it's just so consistently just non stopped gorgeous but they never really give you a shot of anything to long to really concentrate on it know you're constantly taking stuff away and throwing new stuff in yeah I mean and that's what I was seeing more about like um the surrealist element of it um there's definitely some elements of Leggett absurd absurdism you have like all of these very supersaturated images kind of juxtaposed to this like really earthy and scape yeah and I thought I was really enjoying that when that was happening mm of course you don't get too much of that but pretty much you had two sides of the movie I mean you had these very very like you said earlier very nicely shot live-action images and then you had these very very psychedelic visuals that they would kind of segue in between each live-action shot with they never really went from live-action vignette to live-action vignette there was always some kind of weird visual or edit in between some of the editing reminded me of my edit and in it there's this one point in the film where there was that guy in the blonde wig and it just reminded me of black metal just like seeing pictures of black metal people like in the woods yeah like this coat in the blonde wig and he's like walking across very awkwardly these these stones yeah he's sort of bringing a drum set to one of the larger stones and then when he starts playing the drums it gets very loud but even before that as he's walking over to the stones you just like see this very closely shot image of him and meanwhile under that when it pops up did you feel toyed with you know I did kind of at the beginning because I felt like the beginning started off kind of slow it did and I was kind of like unsure of what I was going to expect if this was going to be like fifty five minutes of like a really long link but it wasn't I mean is it I mean I guess I'm still kind of stuck on kind of I'm I'm a kind of lighting junkie so I have her a lot of dark shots yeah and they were like I said before just these really interestingly composited shots um my favorite scenes were scenes in the boat on the water yeah I thought those were very beautifully sure he was kayaking and actually uh you know we're even yet to talk about the music that was actually one of my favorite songs throughout the whole thing I mean there are a lot of really strange noise pieces and you know for you people who are into mers Bell and that kind of I mean this is like straight-up noise very disorienting very relentless very heavy and very distorted but Animal Collective does throw elements of you know stuff that would be I guess traditional music to your Animal Collective fan in terms of the music and the visuals kind of playing with each other seemed like either it seemed almost as if maybe with the exception of the very last scene the music if it was a live action shot was merely just kind of sound tracking something that was being shot live action very surreal and when a visual came up the music and the visual were just you couldn't separate the two yeah I mean whenever the music would make a shift in sound the visual would make a shift in color or just jump or just you know bubble up something there are some elements of this that kind of seem like monster movie then that was the other thing about this um I don't even know what to make of that still I'm still kind of processing that kind of I almost want to call it like an homage to like 1960s like plist horror yeah it was very I mean there was that I mean you can't you can't ignore that one scene but this family is sitting and you know by campfire in their camping meanwhile the character who is in the canoe who seems to be a vampire is kind of creeping through the woods to come get them and you know you sort of think something is going to happen between them but meanwhile the family is eating marshmallows and then all of a sudden like you see them start like waving their mouths and like looking weird I'm like are the marshmallows hot are they hot are they burning their mouths but like the marshmallow instead starts just pouring out of their mouth what seems like I don't know some like off-camera hand would like keep like taking marshmallow fluff and putting it in their mouths meanwhile then they would shoot them just like they're just like spitting out marshmallow and like like marshmallows spraying everywhere and then meanwhile the vampire like grabs one of the kids and like starts munching on them the last thing is the only part that really didn't work for me I felt that dragged on a little bit and to me neither was it sonically interesting or really all visually yeah it sort of seemed like at that point they were just making everything so dark to kind of maybe hide a little bit yeah how shoddy everything really was at some points but I really did love some of the like that that really wide back shot from the house that yeah I saw it in the middle of the woods it was the strange red glow coming out of it that was really eerie you know that there are really a lot of beautiful shots throughout this film I guess my main complaint with that is just I wish maybe they stuck on one just a little bit more um than they did throughout the rest of the film like like I said to go back to that whole canoe sing which is whatever yeah you know it to me it's not so much um you know having them stick on one it's just maybe having not so much of a heavy hand with it and I felt like a lot of the scenes were kind of heavy-handed overall did you like it I did it really needs a second viewing though it really does I liked I liked the video uh yeah I'm still the jury's still out on whether or not it's genius yeah yeah yeah that that's that's the thing I mean certainly if anybody works hard enough at something and you know cuts and pastes and changes colors and layers things over layers things over layers things they can give you a sensory overload you know I mean if you throw enough down the wall there will be a lot to look at you know and that's the thing with this movie there's a lot of to look at to go back to kind of what you said earlier it really doesn't feel like a holistic thing yeah you know and I feel like maybe even with a third view it's not going to feel like a whole listed thing I mean it really does kind of feel in a way like a bunch of short stories mm-hm and you kind of just pull out of those whatever you want whatever meaning that is it's very open to interpretation yeah which I think was completely intentional with the almost complete lack of dialogue people should go and see it should they yeah would you recommend this yeah so what kind of person would you recommend this to one on drugs mm-hmm for starters what kind of sober people would you recommend this to I don't know the type of people that want to see something that's going to freak them out a little bit you know make them scratch their heads they like scratching their heads at the end let's go traditional do you give it like a thumbs up oh yeah totally okay sometimes I give a thumbs up a lot of people of course after Merriweather Post Pavilion were like oh Animal Collective are going pop they're going mainstream they're getting really catchy I feel like this film throws away any ideas of them getting rid of their experimental side so that was our reaction to odd sack thank you for recommending it Anthony Dominic Animal Collective odd sack Danny Perez forever 
LCixPRPXCb8,Oh Oh I need air cut my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh dear Internet's busiest music nerd going to do an EP review here of the new sub John Stephens all delighted people not that he really needs an intro but in case you don't know sofyan stevens is a detroit singer-songwriter whose main asset can be boiled down to one thing ambition everything this guy touches just reaches for extravagance whether it's his live shows or his songwriting or even the instrumentation that backs it up and this release questionably attains EP status I said questionably because it is an entire hour but what actually makes an EP is it less than ten songs as twenty minutes as a who knows you know what the fact is I'm just going to let it slide because this guy has written a two hour Christmas album and when you've written a two hour Christmas album pretty much everything shorter than that or less weird than that is an EP and possibly the best thing about this EP that isn't musical isn't the cover I actually don't like the cover it's the fact that you can buy it online for five bucks but getting into the music this thing is based around its title track which is a massive 11 minutes which justifies its length with some very breathtaking horns strings and a backing chorus too many times I've heard arrangements and just additional instrumentation ruin a track take away from a song but unquestionably the horns just everything in this EP just complements the music so well doesn't really just kind of do its own thing in the background but is very reactionary to what is going on in the song in the foreground it's really cohesive and it really empowers this opening track especially at the two third mark and at the end when just all the instrumentation is freaking out getting really loud and noise and dissonant it just sort of gives you a idea of just how gigantic this thing is and there's a reprise of this track later in the moon and it sort of dubbed a classic rock version of it and that thing numbers up to eight minutes and it's pretty indulgent to expect people to want to hear an eight-minute version of an 11 minute song but still they rework this track just labor over it to the point where it hardly resembles its original version outside of the chorus this revisit to the track just has a mesmerizing Floyd Ian groove and some really trippy ask guitar soloing closing up shop going into some other tracks the band camp description of this CP actually sites may single Paul Simon track as kind of a an influence and I'm just delighted to death to hear Simon and Garfunkel getting at least a little bit of talk just don't know why they're not that popular with my generation but that influence cited on the band camp page is most definitely not a lie the sound of Simon & Garfunkel in the harmonized vocals the very skeletal quiet delivery and also the elegantly picked acoustic guitar shows up in the second track and the third track of this EP but things get even quieter and creepier on the next track the owl and the tanjur which is this very very atmospheric piano ballad which almost sounds like musical theater at some points you little boy you little boy but I do have to kind of nitpick here and just say I don't really like the reverb on that track it just seems really synthetic just really out of place it is a great song but that sound just kind of puts a bad aftertaste on it you know any problem that I had with that track the EP most definitely redeems itself on its 17-minute closer where the band gets even deeper into the Floyd Ian ideas that they flirted with on the reprise of all delighted people the build on this track is gargantuan just lots of psychedelic guitar soloing lots of warm bass just drums soloing and drum fills that just sort of tease toward the next bar just sort of we this ocean of space in between when the band just kicks in again for another heavy riff I know a lot of people may get down on Sophia and Stevens for maybe not being there vocals style maybe you're not into the indie pop thing if you're not into the indie folk thing but still listening to this listening to the Arrangements on this listening to the detail in this music you have to at least come away from this thing appreciating something something just a little bit of something I'm feeling that strong not a light but a decent eight here so sprinkle down a little decent eight on this thing of course maybe I feel like it could have been a little bit longer like maybe there could have just been a little bit more versatility there a little bit more adventure but as is this thing is still a powerhouse alright guys this this review is over you're the best let me know what you think of this thing if you love it if you hate it and why and yeah you have any Fantana Sufjan Stevens all delighted people EP forever 
Vng4RQPCZYA,it's track review my needle drops it's Monday Monday and I have a few things on the itinerary before we get into this very pertinent track review number one I went to a Battle of the Bands yesterday where I was a judge I was invited by YouTube user Caligula 138 I hung out with him what do you think of that you're wrong I'm right leader and there were a lot of badass bands there an artists including this one in months I voted for them they won I was so happy live they were intense as hell I've heard their demo I got a hold of it it was a little rough didn't like the recording as much as the live show but the numbers sort of won prize of the little battle was 15 hours of recording time in a professional studio so hopefully they pulled together a fantastic fantastic recording that really complements their doom II as hell sound on the agenda rocket out blog hit twenty thousand subs and jumbled chunky music became a partner good job guys and there was a YouTube user down there in the D box by the name of eight the chosen one I've been watching this guy for a long time he does a lot of horror movie reviews really eccentric guy wears a mask he has come out with a rap album he's been promoting it like hell basically just passing around for free all over the Internet give it a listen he's got a lot of personality not exactly rapping about the song subjects I'm interested in but still he's a personality I like let's stop plugging and start track reviewing because this is where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it is good and up on the chopping block today new fever ray track mercy Street it's a cover of a Peter Gabriel song and many of you may remember that fever a self-titled LP was my favorite album of last year more favorite than Sun more favored than Animal Collective more favorite than the new mono yes fever Ray was my shining star in 2009 so I'm kind of excited to hear the fever ray is I think going to be pumping out more music through solo work let's give a listen to this thing fever ray Mercy Street ok this track after listening to a multiple multiple times it is just not clicking with me like I've wanted it to and I think it's for a few choice reasons and of course that all has to do with the production which is really all that I can talk about in this track since fever ray didn't really write the song fever ray here in terms of the sounds that she uses the effects that she uses it's kind of like a generic version of what is on her self-titled LP keep in mind I didn't hear the original before I actually heard this song and for some reason as I was listening to it I just pictured it in my head to be much more subtle much more stripped-down even more understated and I just wish that's how the fever ray version was and then I said well let's listen to the Peter Gabriel version and lo and behold it was that stripped-down more minimal more simplistic version that I was looking for of course those eerie chorus vocals are there on this track throughout the whole song which is part of the what attracted me to fever ray initially I mean it's really one of the most distinctive elements of her song creating process just the vocal effects that she uses but I can't help but feel as if they're hurting the track this time around almost as if the song would have been a lot clearer or maybe a lot more interesting more dynamic if she didn't use it or if she sort of used it on and off in some places but not in others and I don't know what the mixing process on this track was but the song just doesn't feel as lush as previous efforts nothing sonically really stands out for me as being a great sound from Peter Gabriel's perspective I'm sure it's extremely flattering that Fever Ray went this far to cover one of his songs from a fan perspective I'm sure it's great that Fever Ray has said hey look he is one of the artists that influences moi but I just don't see myself coming back to this track it just pales in comparison to the other stuff and just kind of takes the blueprint fever race sound and just applies it to this Peter Gabriel song as mean as this may sound I'm feeling kind of indifferent on this track believe it or not it's really not making me rethink how I feel about fever ease music and production wise it's just a little dull for me the only thing I really love about it is the songwriting but of course I can't attribute that to fever right but what do you guys think about this track do you love it do you hate it and why are you liking the production as opposed to me fever ray Peter Gabriel mercy Street forever

NouYDsQHC3Q,hey it's track review I really want to do track review but I want a different article of clothing who dad yeah my needle drops before I get into this review I have a couple things that I want to say want to mention want to bring up number one this is the new animal collective visual album odd sack 55 minutes of new music and visuals package with a 40-page hardcover artbook I have been eating a lot of messages asking me i will be doing a review / kind of reaction video with my significant other dominique Boxley love that girl next I want to say there is a link down there in the D box where you can hear a review 90 review and interview that I did with this joker right here you're wrong I'm right if you watch this guy if you're a fan of this guy if you don't know who the hell that guy is go down there in the d'box and have at it give a listen ok my needle drops this is track reviews where we talk about the latest and rock and pop and electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good and the band that will be reviewing today actually fits most if not all of those categories the California noise rock duo no age in 2009 these guys whipped my ass with the album nouns and i highly recommend it to anybody who is into noise rock experimental rock post-punk if you have not listened to this you are losing out on life you're yeah thanks they've got a new LP coming out this year where the band has released or Sub Pop has released the new single from it glitter let's give a listen and see if it sucks okay Wow okay okay all right first thing that hit me about this track being a fan of of course no ages nouns and their earlier stuff on weirdo rippers the seven inches the EPS stuff like that uh this track and you know of course it's not a show of what the new album is going to sound like who the hell knows what everything in between is going to be like holistically but compared to pretty much all of the songs except the more ambient ones on nouns this track is surprisingly not pummeling it's really not abusive it's really not hard it's not hard hitting it's not in your face however it's still very noisy it still creates a raucous and what I like about no age and noise rock in general music of this variety is that brings the mystery back into rock it brings the question ability back into rock music it's like man how they did they do this I don't know that's the mystery that high-pitched squeal what is that I don't know the sound of that is maybe you could make that sound if you took an AM radio turned it all the way up plugged it in and shoved it in the microwave maybe then you would get that sound but I can't confirm that no age is very much not just simply an experimental you know let's make noise let's be really weird kind of bad these guys are really in to songwriting and I could tell that they're prioritizing this on this track considering that they've made the chords and the vocals apparent as to they were very much buried on nouns the vocals really did sit behind all the noise all the feedback all the reverb part of me wants to say that this track was maybe a little uneventful for me like I was looking for maybe more of a sensory overload just more things to happen kind of like maybe in action movie with no explosions after it was over though there was some action there were some karate kicks some people did get their jaws knocked off I was just like where the explosions man something needed to blow up that's all I'm saying but still an enjoyable track i'm feeling a white to decent most likely a decent 7 on this thing i am liking it like it like it like knit but it didn't blow me away not exactly what i was looking for but that could totally change once I sort of get a grip of this track within the context of its entire album but how are you guys feeling on this track and are you looking forward to this new no age release do you expect big things is it gonna be as awesome as nouns is it is it it's sorry that was creepy but let me know no age glitter forever 
W86MneOdcW0,teen days four more years I really want some toast man y'all ever have like a good piece of toast like a good piece of toast mm-hmm we're not here to talk about toast not here to talk about to us we're here to talk about the new teen days EP four more years teen days is another one of these solo bedroom electronica projects that are popping up all over the internet these days and my introduction to teen days was through remixes remixes of twin sister Yeasayer local natives blackbird blackbird washed-out Ono Yoko and more which to me is a pretty genius way to spread your name around he clearly likes the artists who he's remix and he's not just doing it to get his name out there because their influence really shows up on his new EP considering that he's remix washed out there is a lot of chill wave influence on here so much so that people are actually calling this EP and calling teen days chill wave left and right but I don't know if I would go as far as that for me teen days is sound is a little cleaner and a little less nostalgic than a lot of his chill wave contemporaries I just won't want people to get the impression that this EP is kind of a one-trick pony there are tracks on here that remind me of baths remind me of crystal castles remind me of the postal service and to put it simply all you can really expect from this EP is for it to be a summary positive dance record sure there are points where it dips into that eighties new wave sound but this is this is a contemporary album not an exercise in reliving the past there's some nice vocal samples throughout these tracks one of my favorites is located on the song Savior and there's actually a vocal sample from an old Christian sort of kids show called Kolby on the last song of this EP maybe he got it from every is terrible website that I love very much that is basically you know sampled and played and put up videos of that show just as kind of a joke but uh yeah weird vocal samples on this thing my main gripe with this EP my main and only gripe is that the sounds can be a little little generic a little vanilla a little plain some examples for me include the first track the last track just some of the sounds whether it's the drums or the keyboards or just the effects being used on vocals or a sample or something just sound like completely unaltered computer generations just whatever setting or equalization came on the sound to begin with whatever don't change it just throw it in there I would have liked to have heard maybe some more unique textures maybe an example of this is maybe the mat most album supreme balloon one of my favorite electronic music albums of all time very very interesting sounds on that thing and actually you're wrong I'm right reviewed it today what the freak coincidence coincidence but even though I would have liked to have heard maybe some more adventurous sounds on this thing the songs were still pretty decent the melodies were fun the beats were really grooving this really is all in all a dance record that is light it's straightforward it's relaxation with a beat I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing it didn't blow me away but still the songs are there and maybe you could just pick up this LP put it on and just say goodbye summer goodbye summer thanks Anthony Fantino teen days four more years forever you 
-DkT8NwxAQA,I made the battle frontier yo what up my needle drops it's Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd live before I get into this review I want to say there are a couple links down there in the D box new video from the super humanoids a review I did of the new Arcade Fire album on another website and also a picture of a flyer of a concert where I will be a judge it's a battle of the bands it's in Jersey City go okay so did you think I was actually gonna go through this year without talking about this album did you what's wrong with you I would hope that after 15 albums and being one of the most familiar faces in heavy metal that Iron Maiden would need no introduction and I'm not going to write an introduction simply because I want to be brief I remained as a band that takes its themes takes its concepts its lyrical content very very seriously and this LP no exception this album runs a gauntlet of songs about space whether it's exploring it or being stranded in it and they're also a lot of themes about going home missing home missing loved ones just kind of being away from where maybe you're used to being and Iron Maiden takes their sweet time talking about this stuff to this LP is almost an hour and 20 minutes which I read on wicked wicked wicked entropy dia is the longest Iron Maiden studio effort to date there is a reason for this and it is not extra tracks there are 10 songs on this thing Iron Maiden following 2006 as a matter of life and death have fallen deeper in love with the concept of the intro only several songs on this LP actually kind of get on with it so if you're looking for Iron Maiden kind of lean and pared down and straight to the point you may be sadly disappointed with this album but if you're patient Iron Maiden actually goes through some pretty interesting intros whether it be interesting musically like on the first moment of the LP satellite 15 with just this really electronic futuristic sound then there are also some moments where seems like Iron Maiden is just doing an intro for the sake of setting up the story that plays itself out in the lyrics doorbell so even though it may take a few minutes for these tracks to get started there's still a lot of pay attention to this word a lot of vitality in the songwriting Iron Maiden hardly shows any age in this respect when the band needs to they use their speed when they need to they use their solo power there's still flash to this music but the band really is emphasizing songwriting and progressiveness over just showing musicianship the slower moments aren't bad either though like the track coming home has a really fantastic hook and that song sticks with me every time that I listen to it and some songs overall I'm really just not enjoying and I'm sad to say it's mostly because of Bruce's vocals I don't know if they were outside factors involved in this but Bruce sounds a little bit strained on some of these tracks when he starts to reach in his upper register could have been an offseason could have been maybe a lack of studio time but I think some of these songs could have done with some extra takes one more gripe I have with tracks like Mother of mercy or star blind it's almost as if Bruce isn't really singing but kind of trying to channel his inner thespian and kind of acting out the song but I'm still happy to say and report that I feel Iron Maiden is still making music that is powerful that means something they're definitely showing some signs of aging a little bit but I still think they've got it the band still has good taste but if I'm going to be honest with you I have to say that this album still is in no way as thrilling or as riveting as peace of mind or power slave or even killers there may be some really hardcore metal fans who say that oh Iron Maiden isn't making any good music anymore they should stop they're all over their legacy I don't think that's the case Iron Maiden is still making music and because of that they're still relevant as a metal band their music isn't lost in the past it's not forgotten and it's because every so often we have something like this to talk about I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing yeah I'm a little past being on the fence it was okay there were several songs that hmm had me going but I wasn't anywhere near really hating this what do you guys think of this LP I know there are some Iron Maiden fans in there somewhere so let me know what do you hate about it what do you love about it and why Anthony Fantana Iron Maiden the final frontier you 
eqmp86d17fM,my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and yeah yeah I missed you guys this weekend it's Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday and a lot of great stuff happened this weekend i saw james bond saw my girlfriend worked broke eight thousand subs and I also listened to this the latest LP from the New Orleans band though these guys are gaining a lot of respect within the worlds of doom and sludge metal if you're wondering what they sound like you can actually go down there in the D box and hear this LP the same way I heard it through a stream on NPR music and also you can go to their website where you can pretty much download yeah download most of this band's discography splits ep's 7 inches entire albums pretty much all up there to just throw on your hard drive courtesy of the band which is something I have to respect got a respect that really nice it's just kind of giving away their music so some is out right now I'm chiliad media 11 bones up there right now I got to throw down on this thing for a nice gatefold CD and this album is not your average doom and sludge LP it's not your trippy psychedelic kind of Black Sabbath or 70s blues rock influenced stoner metal this LP is much more ugly and much more unforgiving it's a lot like just coming face-to-face with a wall of concrete very harsh vocals on this thing for the most part the screams are pretty unintelligible and I'm pretty much only reading the passion off of these vocals and though there are riffs on this LP I want to say there's more of an emphasis on you know not bow nothing like that it's more like seismic chords casting out these long sonic waves just these chugging chugging guitars so the high volume the feral vocals these things are important but what I find to be the most intense about this band is their pace their tempo these guys basically have two speeds it's slow and very slow I personally would have liked a little bit more variation in that department but I do have to give it to these guys for sticking to their guns the mix could have had a little more clarity too it's kind of dirty in some spots maybe a little muddy but if you turn this thing up it is a rum blur and I guess another thing I do like about the sound of this record is that it reminds me a lot of the metal shows that I would go to when I was fifteen at like VFW's in the area just how raw and just how loud it is it does kind of have the ambiance of a live set or just music that's being performed right then and there this thing is pretty much devoid of studio I've heard a lot of doom wreckers that just throw reverb all over everything in the mix and post-production just to kind of make things sound bigger I'm really happy that thou didn't go down that road on this LP this thing is very raw very dry and just pretty much uses its sheer volume to make the music powerful for about 75% of the time volume really is kind of the name of the game the band does find a few spots where they kind of change things up instrumentally whether it's with a violin or a piano or some acoustic guitar or the last track that I was impressed with a lot which was kind of actually a drone just really really dissonant guitars just ringing out lots of feedback very noisy I saw MacOS or FM gave this thing a nine I've read a lot of rave reviews of this LP I loved loved bands like earth bands like Sun I can appreciate Harvey Milk and I really dig on Jesu if you find yourself enjoying those same groups even a band like Isis I highly recommend that you put some ear time down with ow I'm feeling strong seven on this LP I wasn't completely blown away I'm not in love with this record but these guys really did impress me with just how as I said earlier intense they are on this thing and in the several years that they've been putting out music they have been prolific as just tons of material and I have no doubt that these guys will most likely put out something that I'll enjoy a little bit more in the future until then I'm watching them I'm listening to them and finding what they do pretty interesting but the link to listen to these guys is down there in the D box and tell me what you think of this record once you spend a few minutes with it okay Anthony Fantan o thou summit forever you

X5fhQd3JGuc,hurry up okay my needle drops listen I'm a little busy I have to go to work I'm really kind of rushing right now and so because of that I'm going to kind of just get through this album review as quickly as possible the title of this afrobeat Airways West African shockwaves from 1972 to 1978 from Ghana and Togo and what makes this compilation especially interesting is that you know I've heard a lot of Afrobeat recordings a lot of stuff from Fela Kuti a lot of stuff from Soundwave records and a lot of stuff from the label that this compilation comes from analog Africa but this is the first time I came across a compilation that even in some kind of way focused on the country of Togo which is this skinny little country right next to Ghana which both of those countries are on the west side of Africa so what makes this so special so important so interesting well for one the recording quality of these tracks is fantastic I've heard a lot of recordings of this style of music from this area of Africa and you know a lot of it is kind of cruddy just really low fire really messy just doesn't really do justice to how many players that are actually in the band but the recording quality here is just superb the bass lines are really warm the drums are all really crystal-clear just a lot of clarity um there might have been some remastering I have no clue but yeah the the quality of these songs really high there are a lot of psychedelic wah-wah guitars and very sunny guitar solos and if you love percussion and you love grooves and this is really something to behold there's a ton of hand percussion on this thing there maybe one maybe two tracks where you actually hear a full drum kit but the rest of the time is just pretty much palpable most of the tracks have these really classic old-school electric organ sounds on them too which is a little cheesy but is kind of the prevalent sound in Afro B because these are the organs that were kind of available to the musicians during this genres heyday many of the tracks are really long kind of tipping the scales at eight minutes or more and when I'm listening to a song with a deep groove for that amount of time I just get hypnotized which is really a pleasurable experience and these recordings are just so in the moment just so they're there they're happening there they are happening now and at the time there's the musicians during some of these recording sessions were just freak it out and screaming at the top of their lungs and just having the time of their lives and it's like it's it's hard not to feel that same way too when you're hearing these people just having a ball recording this plus there's all sorts of improvisation Xand little subtleties that you just don't get out of canned music heavy heavy funk and jazz influences on some of these tracks too the fourth song on this album the bass line and the horn arrangements that open up the song are so Western I'm just waiting for James Brown to come in and start screaming on the track I know here in their compilations can be a little bit shoddy there are a lot of potholes but I can assure you on this one there are not this is just one strong track after another from a dozen different bands documenting an interesting style and time in music look this thing up on analogue Africa link in the D box I assure you that if you're into this style of music or if you're just curious about this style of music this is a fantastic place to visit I'm feeling a strong strong strong eight maybe if some of the tracks didn't really blend together I'd be feeling maybe a light nine but still they're strong eight on this thing I recommend it as highly as that pomegranates compilation I reviewed earlier this year but still mmm this thing damn anthony Fantana afro beat airways forever 
uqY4vTcKTjg,all right my needle drops no time to lose you've got to do an album review but one thing before that the band women who have a new album coming out this year public strain I recently interviewed these singer and guitarist from the band Patrick flagel you can go down there in the D box and find a link to where you can go listen to that or go just check out our tumblr account it's there Auto Lux is a West Coast trio who is often overlooked in the world of art rock and shoegaze simply because they don't really have the heavy weight discographies of bands like Blonde Redhead or Sonic Youth Auto Lux is debut LP future perfect didn't exactly reinvent in the world of our rock but its songs are really catchy really snappy visceral but there's also enough experimentation and guitar noise in the mix to make it feel like a little bit more than just your average rock record and auto Lux really likes to do things pretty much at their own pace that debut album actually came out in 2004 and now six years later we have its follow-up transit transit and on this LP for the most part it's pretty much Auto Lux as you remember them they're really building on their past sound drumming up some interesting guitar effects but also incorporating some newer elements too like drum machines some piano ballad ree Loops Arrangements multi-tracked background vocals drum machines a lot of different ideas being incorporated on this album and some real stylistic shifts to this thing really does not stay in one spot for a lot of the time I hear elements of 60 psychedelic rock there are a few moments where this van actually sounds a little bit like Mercury Rev to me especially in the falsetto vocals in the very detailed studio production and track 3 high chair with its drum machine room I me a lot of maybe what black mouth super rainbow would sound like if they didn't have so much low-five fuzz on their music Shh so Auto Lux is trying new things on this record but it's kind of led to a sound that overall is a little less menacing than their debut which is really what I dug so much about it it did have these sweet pop sounds but then again there was this kind of danger to it much of the loudest sounds on transit transit are kind of just sitting at the back of the bus this thing really kind of wakes up I want to say round of track seven there are some rocky songs before that track but yeah around there is when this thing really starts to get voluminous the title of that song is audience number two and this song is really kind of the Auto Lux I remember it just seems like the music is happening right there in front of you and you're just being hit with so many different sounds it's kind of like a sensory overload but it's combined with really strong songwriting I can't see this record scoring extremely high with me mostly because there were some pow holes there were just some tracks that I didn't care for I want to say just about half of the LP underwhelmed me either the tracks didn't go far enough to produce an interesting sound or a lot of the tracks I felt were kind of hindered by all the loops and the canned instrumentation it depends on the track but there are some moments where it'll sound like maybe the guitar or maybe the drums aren't actually being performed in a take but are kind of just being cut and pasted cut and pasted which for me leads to a sound that is not very dynamic and is really not an aesthetic I liked in my rock music overall the LP didn't really grip me but I could see how hardcore fans who have just been dying for this thing to be released will appreciate it and I could see people digging it if they're kind of looking for a friendlier side of this genre of music something that maybe is a little bit easier on the ears I'm feeling strong strong beefy six on this record like it could almost take down a seven if the seven had its back turned or something like that just come up right behind it headlock but other than that I'm really not mm-hmm but that's pretty much where my ears are at on this record where are your ears on this record are you loving it are you hating it and what would you score this thing Anthony Fantana Auto Lux transit transit forever you 
rUrhOERq7mE,it's track reviews got a wish right up you gotta wake up gotta wake up gotta wake up gotta wake up hot hotness hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's Wednesday god yes it's Wednesday Wednesday aka hump day aka the day that you want to die in the middle of the week but fret no more because we have something to ease that Wednesday tension a little bit of remix Wednesday action if you go over to the needle drop calm or go down there to a link in the d box there are not only five remixes of awesome songs that you can download but there are two remix albums that you can get ahold of to the King meets the president which is a full mashup album of Michael Jackson and Fela Kuti songs and a new are Stevie Moore tribute album just

website scene magazine you can head down there and watch it if you like and also find a link down there to the new no age single glitter I was going to review that today but instead on track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good we're going to take a look at the new track from Weezer that's the album cover Hugo from lost yeah and Weezer is going into you this time around they are releasing this thing on epitaph records this September not even a year after they put out what R attitude and what I love about Weezer at this point in their career is what it makes them so interesting to me one of the most interesting bands out there they just do not give it about anything they don't give a they'll just do whatever they want do this do that if it's funny do it just spur the moment impulsive who cares just do it I figure that Weezer is going to need some more album cover materials so I please do ask I do ask next time you're putting out an LP or you know next time you're scrambling for something to put on the front of one of these things please use Cal Church esta Cal do you want to be on the front of a Weezer album well if you got a problem with wheezing you should probably get an inhaler a picture of me is not going to do any good I hate culture Chester let's give a listen to this new Weezer single memories well this was a young vibrant rocker it opened up with these string sections I really was not had no clue what was going to happen was very mmm let's just say I was anticipating something that maybe wasn't going to please me all that much because Weezer's newer stuff their more recent stuff has been a little more polished a little too polished in fact for my taste to really wow me to really get me going but this track as soon as the guitars hit as soon as the base hit as soon as the drums hit it had a much more aggressive much more distorted sound than anything that was on ratah to which had some good singles had some decent tracks on it but still had those moments like the collaboration with little Wayne for example that kind of just felt really out of place and just sort of seemed like the band kind of experimenting with their audience experimenting with what they can do on the album as opposed to Weezer making a song to the best of Weezer's abilities and that's what this song kind of acknowledges it kind of feels the same way a lot of old-school Weezer fans do I wish I could go back there to that time I wish I could go back there to all those memories back when all these things were still fresh and not just something that I missed Ouiser brings up things like I miss when Rage Against the Machine used to be actually raging as the machine an audio slave I miss when we would be on tour there all these live show recollections with journalists rivers brings up just the unwanted transition that everybody has to make to being an adult I think a lot of people are saying this kind of sounds like Andrew W K this could be an Andrew W K track but I mostly think that's because of just how relentless the song is in terms of heavy percussion just being ban-ban if you can appreciate a hook if you can appreciate some pop magic then damn this track give a listen to it of course it's not going to blow your mind it's not going to change the way you listen to music but it is a good and enjoyable song man if you're just looking for something light and sweet to put into the T this is it I'm feeling a strong seven on this and this track actually has me looking forward to see what Weezer is going to do on this album I mean come on let's not get too excited let's not freak out Weezer is not going to write another Blue Album they're not going to write another Pinkerton but this thing with the changeover to epitaph with all of the nostalgic desires that are inside of this track we could be in for something that is maybe a little less commercial a little more vulnerable who knows Anthony Fantan oh the needle drop Weezer early forever 
JIOuOK7sUV8,the Buddhist band great friends music lovers needle drops its Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd you already know that and it's time to do an album review the Buddhist band is a New York funk outfit who's creatively named past records include titles such as the Buddhist band the Buddhist band - and the Buddhist band EP but here's their latest album and it's named the Buddhist band 3 so it's kind of like a trilogy and if you guys are familiar with other trilogies like the matrix and jaws and Jurassic Park maybe you already know how this is going to go the Afrobeat insall sounds that made the Buddha span such a force to be reckoned with inside of instrumental music are still in full force on this new album so there's really no reason to worry there this album features a lot of heavy horns some decent grooves and a plethora of percussion but you know almost every track just has something on it that maybe feels a bit off it is a real change in mood for the Bhutto's band way moodier a lot darker using a lot of minor scale melodies a lot of dissonant chords it's really just not a sound that I'm vibing with and the organ which I know has always played a vital role in the Buddhist music has this tone on it this effect just this sound it's like something out of an old silent horror film oh it's kind of creepy but also kind of kitschy it's a sound that the vamp just refuses to distance themselves from on any track of this album every time the organ shows up it sounds like that so not only is the slightly darker mood not doing much of anything for me but there's also a lot of recycling on this album and I mean a lot of recycling tons of songs just start off the exact same way many of the openings just being based on maybe a dark guitar chord or a tinny our riff just these really repetitive guitar phrases that are giving me deja vu and in contrast especially on the Buddhist band album Buddhist band two maybe two tracks on that LP start the same there's a ton of variation throughout those songs whether it be in terms of instrumentation or just the style the band is shooting for on that given track but it's not like this LP doesn't have its breaths of fresh air the track crimson skies has really even mixed with a lot of atmosphere and space between the instruments it's really easy to pull apart and just kind of enjoy the sound that each instrument is creating as opposed to a lot of tracks on this LP where the horns are just really overbearing and just blaring over everything just drowning out a lot of vital instrumentation and I've dug the fifth track nature's wrath a lot mostly because it was just a nice change of speed from the mid-tempo that much of this album seems to just be locked in and refusing to move away from this track was one of the darkest on the album and really where that emotion kind of hit home for me and just worked I don't know but a major gripe a major gripe about this track is that the guitar melody sounds shockingly similar to a track off of the Buddhist band's second album origin of man what the Buddhist band does is really defined and this LP is an example of how that can be a double-edged sword it can be great because when you hear a band with a very distinct and defined sound oh you know who it is right off the bat it feels familiar you're pretty much going to go to them to get that sound however you kind of look for them at the next go around to kind of change things up do things a little bit differently and not repeat themselves over and over and yet still maintain that familiarity I could see where they're trying to distance themselves from their previous efforts by sounding a little bit darker but only through doing that they've kind of ended up just repeating themselves on their earlier work a couple times and repeating themselves on this new album a lot of times I don't want to feel this way I don't want to say this about this album but I have to be honest I have to say what thinking I have to say what I'm actually feeling though the grooves are great the funk is good and the Afrobeat elements are still there the exploration and the variation that brought me into the fold with the spend simply isn't here on this LP there earlier LPS have much more variety and if you're going to start with the Bhutto's band I highly recommend either the first two albums or the EP is really great too this thing is okay but it's really not at the same level as that earlier work for me but you guys know this all boils down to opinion and if you are Bhutto Spann fan and you are loving this album hit me up in the comments because I really want to know why it is that you're loving this thing let me know what you're loving about it and if you're hating it tell me why - I'm feeling a strong 5 - a light 6 on this thing not hating it but just very very on the fence just on the fence but there you go the Buddhist banned the Buddhist band 3 forever I just interject into this review and just kind of say hey you know what you should really listen to the Buddhist band because if you don't you just kind of thanks 
Z5ODIutKoNs,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd on a monday Monday day money my monday and i'm pretty sure i got some mail mail time alright gonna open this up real quick real quick for the novella all right afrobeat airways West African shockwaves ghana in togo 1972 278 picture ever right there this will be reviewed this week this whole get a review this week I've been listening to this and enjoying it quite a bit but you can you know let's do it before I actually do the review of it it's pretty freaking good and you know what else is pretty freaking great a music video down there in the d'box from the band Holy Ghost if you're in a dance rock if you're into bass lines and drum beats than it is a must listen thank you very much this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good and remember you're the best you're the best up on the chopping block today on track reviews is the picture album or track from the album seeking love from the Oakland garage rock band bare wires and I want to account your Chester thinks of garage rock well i usually don't keep racks in my garage I hate couch a chest that the track we're going to give a listen to is the new single off of this vert wires album link down there in the d'box bare wires with I love you tonight that thing blitzkrieg like a Bop a straightforward pop sensation that's pretty much boiling this thing down too as much as you possibly can boil it down it had a really nice fast quick instant star instant highlight that word instance start just nice guitar riff and what really struck me is this song is like a couple minutes long a lot happens in these couple of minutes it's a nice dynamic tune it has this really fast build up right at the beginning but then quickly goes into these you know softer shorter strummed chords and talking about Colin on the phone when the verse kicks in I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's some cute little lovey dovey I have a crush on you kind of sentiments in this track is basically what I'm getting at so you have these two or three changes before the hook actually gets there and these guys really are not stingy with the hook they hand it to you as fast as possible I love you tonight do do do do if you like your pop instant this is what you want this is instant pop just add water doorbell I think my only real gripe is with the production which I'm kind of on the fence with there are some elements of atmosphere in the track digging that especially on the drums there's some reverb on there but there's a little bit of muddiness here to the vocals seem so buried like they're behind the wall but I still feel like the song was the song shine shine through all the gloomy muddy production the thing is really too simple and straight forward to hey it's just in and out it really doesn't even linger long enough to say you know this is really kind of bad I've listened to this record all the way through several times and a little bit it kind of reminds me of Jay Reatard not his newer stuff but that point in his career where he had still a rougher sound but was making much catchy or much popular songs maybe sort of like his 06 07 singles collection and I think fans of another band that J actually championed before he passed away fans of the band box elders could totally get into this group if you're looking for something light papi something that you could just sort of put on and enjoy and have a great garage atmosphere in whatever setting you're listening to this in then I highly recommend spending some time with this album I'm kind of feeling a decent too strong 7 on this track like I said with the production elements I am a little on the fence but I still thought the song was really good and this track is in fact what hooked me into listening to the rest of the album which I can't say was a waste of time but why don't y'all tell me what you think about it yeah tell me what you think about it do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana bare wires seeking love you 
dL6rLx14D-k,okay gonna try this thing again gonna try this thing again of course this thing being question of the week where I ask you a question you guys answer it because you're good little needle drops your great needle drops you're the best needle drops I've never seen better never seen better in my entire life first there are a couple things that I want to mention on the blog right now there's a fantastic track from a solo effort from the guitarist of the band ponytail his name is Dustin Wong go over there picture of the album go over there give that a listen it's pretty good track link down there in the D box but this week's question is about recording quality yeah reporting quality because you know I see a lot of low Phi artists this year aren't really in the spotlight like they were in 2008 and 2009 and even artists like let's say waves actually came out with an album of really really well produced songs and in that particular instance would you say that the better production on waves part with that album actually made you enjoy the LP more than you would have if it were low fine do you enjoy lo-fi music more than high fidelity music is there really any merit to a low Phi or self-produced recording or would you rather listen to something that was produced in a studio and sounds good it's my theory that something that is somewhat bad quality in terms of recording whether it's video or whether it's sound anything like that can be made better by it's crappy quality let's take this for for example okay we have a shot a scenic shot that everyone is used to right here and here we have couch esta who I hate very very much now if I wanted to improve this shot right here let's just remove some of the color make it a little difficult to see add some that some of this and see now it's no it's a perfect perfect shot it's a lot better because you don't actually see Cal Cheech esta so you know what does recording quality really even matter does it matter if something is high fidelity or low fidelity or recorded in a nice studio or in somebody's basement or do you just kind of want to hear a good song whether it's recorded well or not let me know you needle drops you're forever 
gHJrGGBcP0E,okay this is an album review of the new daughter's album itself titled their firm Oh Thailand and at 27 minutes this is easily their longest studio effort this band has been labeled numerous things mostly genres that end in core and have garnered comparisons to bands like the locust some girls and I think fans of early and Albatross can appreciate daughter's music too but this self-titled album is a completely different headache when compared to their earlier releases a lot of changes on this thing for one the vocals instead of screaming instead of shrieking it sort of seems like just this really shouting forced yelling talking maybe like an angry auctioneer it kind of reminded me of Nick Cave especially his work with the birthday party which isn't really a surprise since this band contributed a track to a birthday party tribute album released the Baths daughters music on this LP is really no longer thrashy or sporadic like it used to be instead the band uses a lot of low-end a lot of distortion and a lot of compression to create this massive bone-crushing sound which is really more my bread and butter as opposed to the whole trashy thing not to say that those earlier releases aren't worth their salt aggressive playing has its strong points but I just can't believe the guitar sounds on this LP the guitars on this thing sound like an electric evil church organ really if you get this thing out of big pair of speakers you had better get ready for a punishment another big change on this LP is daughters have work to make their songs a lot longer the longest of them just kind of inching over four minutes but I wouldn't say daughters have lost their taste for brevity because even though there are longer songs on here the band is constantly throwing different sounds at the listener whether it's guitar noise scraping against strings feedback or some other sounds that I really just can't explain the ban throws some left hooks on certain tracks just kind of break things up some piercing feedback on one song a dance beat on another song there was one track where I heard a guitar riff that was distinctly close to something that ZZ Top did on the track La Grange and there's some chants and some keyboards on the closing track too unless you have a DD nothing really sticks around long enough for it to get old and yet things repeat just enough times for them to be catchy this thing is noisy it's heavy just like I like it and I don't really have any gripes other than that it made me enter in a place here and a place there a lot of high scores this week and I'm very happy about that I'm very happy about that I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing which is a score I got from jumble junkie music borrowed that one from him maybe if it were a little more diversified this LP maybe a little bit more diverse it would have wowed me a bit more but still as is this thing is like a punch to the jaw with a brick how can't you how can you not appreciate that but what do you guys think of this thing are you loving it are you hating it and why daughter's self-titled [Music] you you 
r5JLOjog1E0,"it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good thank you very much now there's a couple things that I want to get out of the way number one the mod box on the YouTube channel I changed the question in it simply to what is some of the music of this year that you're diggin not what should Anthony review next because you know what what makes it to number one in the mod box is kind of a little one-sided and I've kind of discovered that people tend to just thumb down things that they're not even familiar with not even necessarily that they don't like and this is mostly because you have to thumb things up or down in order to scroll through the mod box and look at things which is a little disruptive and a little time-consuming which is why people are just kind of thumb it up and thumbing down random things so because it's not all that good of a gauge of what is hot or what is not just rather kind of what's popular I'd rather not just kind of bend to every win that the mod box says besides hip hop and metal never make it to number one in the mod box and you know what hip hop and metal if you're gonna be like that they're kind of like your veggies and you really need to eat your freaking veggies okay I know I just didn't edit there but in the spirit of the rocket out blog what I would like to do with track reviews maybe from now on y'all tell me in the comment box is possibly do a more straightforward less edited review of just simply songs just track reviews more of a raw reaction as opposed to a formal thing that I write out beforehand that I plan out that I do my bullet points like I do with album reviews kind of just let the chips fall where they may just kind of give my what's up here either whatever is on the top of my head after I listen to the track I think it's a much more much more visceral approach and it's an approach that I used to do back in the old days a lot of you older subscribers my older needle drops I can't believe I have older needle drops at this point but there are over 7,000 of you the older needle drops may remember back old school days yada yada yada all right this track that we're going to listen to comes from the hick sure the new Twilight's add EP the wrong car let me grab this these guys are a Scottish indie rock outfit with a lot of shoegaze I want to say sensibilities some shuji's subtleties some shoegaze elements they've come out with I want to say a couple albums so far and this new EP has a Mogwai remix on it it has an errors remix on it everything's remixed these days nothing's a cover but anyway this track that we're going to listen to is the title track off the wrong car let's give a listen to this there's a link in the de box where you can hear it too let's see what's up with it man guys uh I just don't get this band I just don't get nothing I don't get what they're doing but what I don't get is just how they've amassed the popularity and the credibility that they have they're not an awful group most certainly and I certainly can't understand how the UK Ireland that area they're very passionate about their bands they're passionate about foals you know that they have a reason to be passionate passionate about gorillas they're passionate about that villager's LP they're passionate about wild beasts I mean hell I just I bought this first undertones out the other day on the Internet good great bands coming out of that area but this band I'm just struggling and struggling because I see them blogged here reviewed well they're loved here saw them wide with the band mono this past year this year this year I'm just struggling for a reason to freak out like everyone else's and say yeah this is good this is right this is amazing this track gonna say the good things gonna say the good things this track was about seven minutes long and what I liked about that is the band did justify that length I was surprised they did a lot of building a lot of swells a lot of these walls of sound and not only that but they're they have a lot of dynamics to their name too it's not just loud soft loud soft loud soft there's a gradual build from one to the other but but really kind of failed me on this song was a number of things from the melody to the production to the guitar distortion to the sounds of the instruments whether it's the piano in the beginning or any number of songs sounds that follow after it to me it just isn't awful isn't offensive but just kind of forgettable I'm sure you know Twilight sad I'm sure they're a nice band sure they're nice guys but yeah this just isn't doing anything for me I just feel like what was that song again but what happened in that song I just instantly it just leaves my head as soon as I hear it or as soon as I see them it just doesn't strike me as even sounding like anything you know it's not like I can kind of attribute this sound or this problem that I'm having to oh yeah they're a ripoff of that band or oh yeah they're a ripoff of this band they don't even sound close enough to anything for me to kind of even hook them to that I mean yeah it does kind of sound like an indie rock sound it does kind of sound like a shoegaze sound but it's a very general sound a very vanilla sound it's very much like they are working with simply the blueprint of this idea but are making little to no alterations to it it's just not doing much for me what do you want to say jeez I'm kind of feeling like a light for on this which is kind of a score that I would give a track if it is something that I'm particularly not digging but I can see why other people are liking it but uh that's where my ears are but let me know where your guy's ears are are you feeling this thing are you not feeling this thing and why also I want to say quickly an album another week mount Airy's lost wisdom right here Phil elver and came out with a fantastic album under mount Erie this past year wins home I'm kind of waiting with bated breath to kind of see what this guy does this year very interested in seeing what Mount Airy is going alright this has been the needle drop track reviews the twilights add the wrong car I almost forgot the name of the track already forever you "
mHUzdIKQ5x0,squirrel ceremony Ron art park open pronouncing that correctly hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review ceremony is a 5-piece from California whose music makes me miss the days when I had a mohawk not that you need a mohawk to enjoy punk music but yeah I gave it away ceremony is a punk band on this album anyway Rotter Park is ceremony's third LP and their previous two were much more heavy dense extreme lots of relentless drums on those records thrashy riffs kind of reminded me of DRI but much noisier maybe with a little bit of metal influence too of course those earlier records also display some punk influence but this new album is the tightest embrace of that classic 80s hardcore style that this band has ever done the stripped-down and somewhat tinnier sounds on this LP homage to some of the best hardcore california has had to offer like Circle Jerks and some of the darker and more experimental elements Black Flag introduced into their music on albums like my war but what I love most about ceremony and this record in general is that when you listen to one track when you listen to just a little bit of the album you know what you see is what you fight used to get there's this really crunchy bass in the mix that sounds a lot like chewing on a mouthful of stale cereal the guitars are really thin they don't have a lot of punch to them but they are just blaring and the vocals are just sliced piss just pissed is how vocalist Ross Farrar doesn't get really poetic but if you look at his words there's some stuff to think about there and as far as the vocal delivery it's just as urgent as the music going on behind it Farrar's voice is like lighting a piece of sandpaper on fire and then rubbing your eardrums with it there are some tracks on here that sort of seemed like interludes they're called the wayside parts one two and three and most of them consist of just some slower guitars strumming maybe some soloing maybe some vocal samples playing off in the background despite the fact that these tracks aren't as speedy or as intense as a lot of the other songs on the album they sort of seemed necessary to just add some dynamics to this LP to make it sort of seem like ceremony isn't just a one-trick pony on this album so long story short these interludes do not feel like filler as far as gripes on this LP go some of the tracks do have some sameness to them sameness of sound sameness of vocal inflection but you know what that comes with the territory when you're making this style of music it's a very defined style and doesn't have a lot of wiggle room this album didn't reinvent the wheel it didn't change the way that I look at punk music I don't think that's what ceremony is shooting for but it's really inspiring to hear music like this made with this much ferocity it's just uncompromising most modern Punk records only make me really want to listen to the old stuff just turn it off put on something that's older more classic more well-traveled something that we know is good this album is one of the rare occasions where that didn't happen if this is on I'm listening to this it's not like I'd rather be listening to something else I know there are some people in my audience who are not going to be into music that is this loud that is this crazy but you know I needed something like this to listen to music like this every once in a while it's refreshing it's like taking a bowl of ice water and just throwing it on your face it's like hey wake the fruits up yeah I'm not feeling a decent not a strong but feeling a light eight maybe a strong seven I am highly recommending that you at least check this out so if you want to clean your ears out with some unfettered rage or enjoy the comeback of a classic classic hardcore sound then this is where you want to be but if you guys are into this record or if you're not into this record let me know let me know why Anthony Fantan oh ceremony Rotter Park thanks for watching thanks for being awesome forever 
zEosZUwT3aM,what's up my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and yeah we're gonna do a segment we haven't done in a long time freaking question of the week yeah before that there are a few announcements that I want to get out of the way first the blog TV last night was fun as hell thanks to all y'all who came out it was fantastic woo also I know this happened a while ago but I just thought I would announce it Drake Drake's album thank me later I reviewed it but not on this channel I recently got employed part-time to actually do video reviews for a website reviewing albums the website is seen mags dot-com it's kind of a local Connecticut thing covering local Connecticut stuff but I'm sort of in the entertainment section kind of thing I am going to be doing album reviews but also covering some local artists from time to time if you are from Connecticut and you are a local artist sure contact me I'd love to sort of consider your stuff for scene magazine for the website and you can head down there in the d box there's a link to where you can go see that album review on scene Manx comm okay guys as many of you know yesterday I reviewed the new Arcade Fire album the suburbs but it got me thinking because what is so important to that LP is its storyline its subject matter basically my question is what is your favorite concept album what is the concept of the album that you like what makes a concept album you can pretty much have a concept about anything sometimes you go into an album with a concept in your head and sometimes you write an album out and you actually end up with a concept that you didn't intend to have one of my favorite concept albums is actually Matt Moses supreme balloon this electronic outfit actually samples a lot of weird things but on this particular album they said you know what we're not going to sand anything with a microphone that is we're just going to create simply synth music but that's one of my favorite concept albums and yeah there are other ones and that's why I'm asking this question of the week what's your favorite Feist concept album unit anthony Fantana the needle drop concepts forever 
X3qyysxKEkU,Arcade Fire the suburbs hi my needle drops kit can I assume you know who these guys are can I assume that uh we're gonna do an album review yeah Arcade Fire is a Canadian band who arguably is one of the top poster children for modern indie and I understand whether this album is good or bad or whether Arcade Fire is good or bad is all opinion but I think anybody should be able to come away at least appreciating their sound or seeing why other people would like it you've got wind Butler's dramatic vocals you have the always ambitious production instrumentation plus songs that are just dying to wrestle with your emotions and that's what made records like 2004's funerals so freakin appealing Arcade Fire built on that sound in 2007 going in a direction that was more orchestral and more thematic - and I know a lot of people have preferred funeral over Neon Bible but still I think Bible is arguably a more cohesive album is it a more enjoyable album I don't know but does it have a more overarching theme yes and now we're at the suburbs which I feel has hit the sweet spot that Arcade Fire's previous efforts have missed in terms of a media see this thing beats funeral to the finish line and when it comes to ambition and concept this thing closes Neon Bible now there's going to be a lot of which album is the best album kinda talked surrounding this LP I don't necessarily see the suburbs as better but merely Arcade Fire trying to grab the best elements of all of their previous releases and just run with it while still pursuing some sounds that the band is kind of yet to try the very first thing that struck me about the suburbs is this is really Arcade Fire's most concentrated attempt at producing rock music just straightforward straight-up unfettered music a lot of tracks like month of May city with no children and ready to start art as flowery as a lot of Arcade Fire's previous work aren't so much dressed to impress but our aiming for something a lot more visceral shooting straight for the gut but despite the straightforwardness of this album the band has not forgotten their orchestral roots has not forgotten to sound huge sound big just make a gigantic production of their music the strings the keys the backup vocals are sounding more complimentary than they ever have meaning that the production rarely overpowers the songs for the sake of showing off there's some quieter moments on this LP too and what I love about these tracks is just Arcade Fire's sense and appreciation of space and atmosphere there's no struggle of space and atmosphere there's no struggle to hear an instrument stuff's not getting drowned out everything has a place and is arranged very precisely precise and in terms of concept and just the theme of these songs this album paints a pretty depressing dark dreary picture of suburbia claiming a place in the rat-race imagery of falling houses of fading past not a pretty picture and if you guys are regular viewers of the videos you know that I'm not a huge lyrics person it's really one of the last things that strikes me on the album but as I listen to the suburbs over and over I couldn't help but just hang on almost every one of Wynn butler's words just a lot of fantastic storytelling the production the sound of these tracks is extremely impressive and this LP was co-produced with markus drives who's also worked with Brian Eno Bjork Coldplay so the band is in pretty good hands here but the production is really where my only gripe about this album comes from there are several tracks on here like empty room or half light to where I feel like the instrumentation is just so cacophonous it's almost as if every part of it is just fighting to be heard everything blaring at the same volume and the result is sadly kind of a flat sound it's nice every once in a while to kind of create a wall of sound have a swell but when these things kind of drag on for the length of almost the entire track it tends to sound as if it just has a lack of dynamics of course there's a lot of variation among these tracks which is to be expected that's always the case with Arcade Fire's music and the most prominent element among all these tracks is just the sound of what we know as Americana I just hear a lot of influence coming from these great anthemic 80s rock songs from singer songwriters like Tom Petty the boss Bruce Springsteen there are quite a few spots of New Wave on this album too with just throbbing synthesizers that really keep the pace going and can I just say the track sprawl - sounds a lot like heart of glass which is not a bad thing so if you're looking for an hour-long pop and rock record loaded with ambition mournful lyrics cinematic production along with the occasional fist pumping rocker Arcade Fire's the suburbs let me know what you think of this album are you loving it are you hating it and you know what I didn't even I never even asked Cal what he thought about this LP our key fire I love video games [Music] [Music] you [Music] 
c5kn_TB90gA,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here going to talk about this album dark night of the soul dark night of the soul is a musical collaboration between producer Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse which was the creative musical outlet for singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Marc Linkous it's just been officially released this month and it's pretty much the release that it deserved last year when it was originally bumping around the internet getting a lot of hype getting a lot of reviews and gathering a lot of buzz which is to be completely honest why I find it difficult to review this album this is one of the few moments I sort of let this happen but the situation surrounding this release makes me see red blind with anger it's one of these moments where I see the old way of doing things in regards to marketing promoting and selling music just destroying the creative process destroying the link the bond the pathway of communication between artists and fans I guess to put things very bluntly I am really upset that this album had to be released after the death of Marc Linkous of course we all know that Marc Linkous died by suicide and there would be no possible way that Columbia and EMI would have known that this was coming Plus according to New Musical Express early this year while Marc Linkous was still alive there was talk about dark night of the soul actually getting a release but just talk now there's a lot of speculation as to why this release was halted the New York Times cited that it was most likely differences between Lex Records and EMI Lex Records being the label that Danger Mouse was signed to at the time still signed to I'm sure whatever the issue was this was an example of a major label standing in front of what is clearly great art I didn't love every song on this album but a lot of them are really freaking good this is just one more instance of copyright and intellectual property keeping musicians from sharing their music with their fans how and whenever they want to and this isn't a recommendation or a way that you should feel but merely a statement of my feelings but I'm not sure I feel comfortable spending money on an album that will improve the bottom line of a record company that stood in the way of its release in the first place 
0DryZn9n6po,hello lovers haters my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it's just about time for an album review hey everybody it's the books latest album the way out how you doing buddy what's that trouble at the barn oh I interviewed your creators on my tumblr account in the interview is up there for you to hear up there now there it is okay you heard the way out if you've enjoyed the way out or you've enjoyed my review of the way out then you should go to a link down there in the d box where you can hear an interview with the books that i conducted yesterday good times this album was submitted by fuzzy Tong in the mod box and it made it all the way up to number one so I should probably talk about it it's the new wild nothing album gemini wild nothing is a virginia band fronted by singer-songwriter Jack Tatum and Tatum has also worked in two very different bands some folk pop in the group Jack in the whale and also some indie rock that kind of reminds me of a Bogota or modest mouse in the band face paint but Jack being the current and trend aware songwriter that he is decided to try his hand at the recent string of shoegaze sounds that have been hot to trot on the blogosphere you know that sweet cat6 sound that's built from walls of guitar effects and keyboards that are more dreamy than they are harsh some examples would be the pains of Being Pure at heart a sunny day in Glasgow the radio department and even girls toyed with the sound of it on their debut LP cat6 is a genre that originated in the UK and was labeled after a mixtape put out by New Musical Express of the same name the mix featured loads of artists from indie labels of that time and many of them shared similar characteristics for example jangly guitars and loads of reverb if you were going to start exploring this type of music I highly recommend another sunny days London weekend the pastels sitting pretty or you could just actually look up the physical copy of the cat6 mixtape but back to wild nothing this album is most definitely a modern take on that vintage cat6 style but it's done with a lot of sincerity and attention to the original blueprint keeping the sounds soft and the structures easygoing even during the faster tracks the old-school formula is just still intact on this thing the unapologetically cheesy synthesizers the jangly guitars the wild liberal guitar strumming the lethargic vocals that couldn't even scream for help it's a very cool unaffected pop sound it's impossible to have a heart attack to this record for me a major highlight is the very sensual track a lilac another song that kind of stands out but maybe isn't a favorite of mine is boardgames has a really new wave sound with prominent keyboards and drums and I think my favorite on the entire LP believe it or not is Chinatown and that song has a fantastic oriental melody and a great groove but guys not every part of this record rub me the right way got understand that there were some tracks on this album where Jack Tatum would start singing in falsetto vocal territory and when he would start doing this the vocals were just missing their melodic mark and I was just completely distracted by that and unable to enjoy the song plus some of the vocal mixing bugged me too felt as if maybe some of the vocals were just soaring over the track as opposed to sort of fitting in with the rest of the mix on a couple occasions and I think my final issue with the LP is that it really doesn't make bold enough of a musical statement to keep me interested when it comes to shoegaze music dreaming pop music see 86 this thing kind of falls into the gray area for me but I'm still gonna give it to wild nothing and Gemini 4 flawlessly recreating the cream of 80s indie Pop's crop this most definitely is not a bad place to start if you're curious about this type of sound but I'm going to stand my ground and say you know what I enjoyed the radio departments record this year a lot more I'm giving this record of life 7 maybe as strong six but probably a lie 7 mostly because a lot of the songs on this thing are just solid just decent songwriting yeah it's not the most original LP but still the songwriting but what do you think about this album do you love it do you hate in why Gemini wild nothing Anthony Fantana the needle drop 
Om8Nh5Zw5jc,this cost hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here these are my average normal everyday sunglasses for an average normal everyday summer day every day I wear them every day I'm in a super duper summary mood so let's review the new best coast album crazy for you best coast is the creative musical outlet for Bethany Cosentino and if the girly sign of garage rock is what's making you sweat this summer then please consider putting best coast on your top five vacation spots for this year a little while back the project gained a lot of attention through a single when I'm with you as an insane music video to link over there where you can watch it and that track is a seriously perfect introduction to best coast real sonic manifesto it's sunny it's blissful it doesn't have a care in the world and it's loaded with reverb and distortion lyrics about having fun and having crushes and since I dug that song so much I was just looking for crazy for you to just kind of come and give the big payoff well this new LP serves up that same summery sound for 30 minutes with no interruptions there's some very light beach boy sounds coming through on some of these tracks surely the distorted chaos of black tambourine is somewhat of an influence and the 60s girl groups that came from the world of Phil Spector have to have some kind of impact on this music too plus I'm sure Bethany is conscious of her contemporaries too like Vivian girls and dumb dumb girls of course I can't say Best Coast is the most original thing to date but the sound that's on this record is enjoyable crashing guitar chords just booming drums and these clear vocals that just soar over the mix I'm surprised as to how just intelligible the vocals just every word is completely understandable right off the bat and in the lyrics there are a lot of love problems Bethany just asking herself a lot of questions about I don't know why do I love you why do I hate you why are you such a jerk why do you steal my weed why am i dealing with you missing home missing a particular person not wanting to get up just feeling lethargic not wanting to do anything it's a little sad but could be an interesting position to observe I know that I and possibly some of you have been in this position I guess basically to sum things up best Coast's crazy for you is just a fun album and shouldn't be taken as anything more than that this thing is not an Olympic sized pool it's a Super Soaker so don't look for depth or a standout musical statement it's not here my major gripe is that most of the tracks really follow the same pattern with very little variation same guitars same drums same kind of vocals same lalala background vocals which are just Bethany's vocals just multi-tracked over one another but there are times when the songwriting really does make that unimportant like on the track our deal crazy for you and the Nirvana inspired I think Brad evey it's a one-dimensional record but best Coast has picked a good dimension to stick to this thing is a good light easygoing summer record if you expect more from it than that you'll probably hate it but if you're coming into it looking for that you'll probably love it it didn't amaze me I wouldn't even say I freaked out there were some tracks I liked and a lot of moments that were kind of like met for me so I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP guys what do you think about this do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantan oh the needle drop best coast crazy for you forever forever 
WAX0VFfGQDo,hey my needle drops Anthony Fanta no here Internet's busiest music nerd let's chill let's be chill let's chill it out let's be chilly willy chill waves with this new album from monopoly monopoly is a California producer and this new LP the title is Paramatma Paramatma this is his debut album and the sky is a part of the growing collective of artists on the record label brainfeeder which is kind of a side project an offshoot thing for Flying Lotus but if you want to look up this album Paramatma it's out now on the record label tasteful licks like a lot of artists on the Brainfeeder label like the gaslamp killer Roz G Daedalus monopoly makes beat music with a lot of diverse influences in the case of Paramatma it's not only hip-hop but also electro dubstep ambient music there are a lot of sounds flowing throughout the hour in 10 minutes that this album spans and to be completely honest I was kind of worried at first I thought I was really in for a bumpy ride on this LP because it just started off with a bunch of tracks that I did not care for the starting tracks pull from a lot of dubstep lots of crunchy break beats just rumbling bass squawking glitching buzzing some of the beats are really repetitive but I was loving the sounds that monopoly was pulling together just high quality sounds and great production it wasn't the most immaculate thing that I heard but it got the job done but my listening experience kept getting interrupted by all of these vocal samples not just over the track but sort of vocal intros to the song and tacked on to the end of the song and they were samples taken from political conversations philosophical discussions Bates I really didn't know whether or not monopoly was trying to get me to listen to his music or vote for somebody and I was getting really afraid that this album might just thanks but this thing really makes a surprising shift before the halfway point at this spot monopoly just basically says okay you know a screw dubstep screw vocal samples I'm totally just going to explore the idea of chili abstract hip hop beats with lots of cool since why am I doing this basically he says I'm going to produce the most off-kilter hip hop beats that you've heard since Flying Lotus released Los Angeles some sputtering beats a lot of low-end a lot of atmospheric synthesizers and some moments flirt with ambient music too with no beats whatsoever with lots of our peji ating since just floating in the air sort of like you can grab them sort of like looking at dust just floating in front of your eyes it's very relaxing even the parts with beats the second half of this album really does thrive off of a chill chill infectiously chill atmosphere the beats are all going what what whoa that's like that except talented I guess what it boils down to is monopoly wears several different suits on this LP and some of them fit and some of them don't for me and it's kind of led to a disjointed debut album I can't say it amazed at this point he's kind of sounding like a mini flying lotus to me but he's clearly got good taste he's got good production chops and with those two things alone and diligence this guy could quite possibly hammer out a very distinctive sound that we're all going to be wowing at so if you like your beat music electronic slightly ambient and hip-hop influenced then this is where you want to be I think people who appreciated flying lotuses Kozma gramma the exploratory nature of that album earlier this year can also get into this dig on this thing I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP but if you guys heard it and you can because there are some links in the D box where you can do so let me know what you think of this thing do you love it do you heat it and why Anthony Fantino monopoly para mama forever you 
xId8g9JmXMw,hey it's track review hello my beetle truck strap me fan tan oh here internets busiest music nerd and thank you for watching thanks for watching guys you know what I I had a negative day yesterday I just had a very negative day today we need to turn up the positivity be positive think positively positive review positive comments positive people let's talk about what's good in life for example today I'm going to New York City to go see everything is terrible live yeah positive and if you guys go down in the d'box there's an interview with Lucas Silva one of the co compilers of a new compilation that I mentioned on this channel before Palenque Palenque I'm going to play a little bit of it on the radio show this weekend maybe review it sometime in the near future I'll try to find some time for it but there's a Great backstory to the music that is on this compilation and it is totally just told in this interview give it a listen yeah let the good times roll comment box misty 666 says what do you think of the mercury prize shortlist well Pokemon Satan reference let's take a look at it it's it's not the Grammys but you know mercury prize the list is is all right I'm rootin for villagers I'm rootin for wild beasts though I wasn't all that into the new foals record it would be nice to see foals get it a bit that least there is that you know that right you know that okay there ok guys this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and whether or not it's good and this track comes from a solo project from Italy her this song because I got an email to me personally by the artist and if this is your first time hearing it you could have heard it earlier if you visited the needle drop down to calm because this thing's been posted for a little bit but yeah link to this track inside the d'box let's take a listen dumbo gets mad with gloomy tale Dumbo gets mad with plumie tail and Italian solo project who's just waiting for a lawsuit from Disney damn that was fun as hell and i think ariel pink fans should take notice does this guy write songs like Ariel does he sound like our Stevie Moore no it's not the case but this does have a similar solo self-recorded kind of feel to it there's not a lot of play between the left and right speaker it's kind of a flatter mix but I don't feel like it's made this track any less interesting to be completely honest this thing opens up with just some strange strange Wow some dirty dirty drums that kick in to some schmaltzy organ and saxophone just really a corny corny sound but it's a good kind of corny yes it is following our some vocals that can only be described as psychedelic with some slightly tinny guitar but what I love is just that bass it sounds like I'm just sticking my head into a vat of warm mud now the chorus comes up after this and when this course kicks in it really swells it gets loud it gets really messy cacophonous the guitars get brighter there's more reverb on the vocals there are all these squawking synths some chimes and what at the end of the chorus to me kind of sounds like a submarine the vocals get even weirder in the next verse but I like it and the song falls it builds again this guy really knows how to structure a tune if it is in a simple way I know a lot of people aren't going to be into not only this song but just this style of music just really visceral just really straightforward just in your face and simple and that's what I really like about this track and pretty much what that genre has to offer if you're not into messy music if you're not into music that just doesn't give its lit you may not exactly be turned on by this track just let me say but whatever you think of this track let me know do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantino Dumbo gets mad clue me tail you 
S8HRhbucYiw,Bath's cerulean hey you stand next to me every freaking video but you don't let me get the spotlight would you mind if I butt in what just depressing I'm surrounded by so many things I hate I need something to love I love you guys thanks my needle drops fetal drops we're gonna do an album review of Bath's cerulean this was taken from the mod box and made it to number one and was suggested by east side 36 73 what a cool dude bats is the solo project of will Weiss and Feld and this is his debut under the pseudonym but cerulean isn't baths first rodeo under different names Will has released music before some ambient stuff under the name G otic and some electro acoustic fusions under the name post fetus it's the same guy but baths is a very different animal and in some respects more straightforward than wills other work with lots of chunky catchy hip-hop beats with lots of chunky catchy hip-hop beats and easygoing melodies but there's a difficult side of this music to an experimental side lots of psychedelic effects lots of pitch tape slapped echoes falsetto vocals and lots of unexplained noises and sounds just colouring the background of these tracks in some ways it reminds me of taurima's last album causers of this except better and for those of you who are actually into the last books LP there's quite a bit of acoustic instrumentation and vocal samples on here too yeah there's a lady talking about essence there's screaming kids it's all here but back to the instrumentation thanks if you're a beat man or woman if you love a really Basie crunchy crispy beefy beat then this thing is not just gonna be your bread it's gonna be your butter too let's just say it's not surprising that bats debuted on the label ant icon a San Francisco outfit whose artists pretty much specialize in left-field be making even though this is bats first LP for ant icon the creativity the eccentricity of this album rivals that of some of the heavy hitters on ant icon like tobacco dosh and even odd nos them they're a real range of sounds on these tracks to some beats like on the opening apologetic shoulder-blades sound really off-kilter kind of like a sputtering engine trying to get started and the track heart is actually this piano powered thud bap ballad with a really straightforward song structure and a nice melody it's possibly the closest this thing comes to churning out a pop song and there are some moments on this LP that are very very easy on the ears with lots of Airy synths just floating in the background and the edge is kind of taken off the beat in order to sort of make it more ambient a little softer and just kind of relaxing yes I have a gripe sometimes the falsetto vocals on this thing can really great on my ears sometimes it's okay but other times it's not like on the track your my excuse to travel really not digging it not just because the false set of vocals that I'm just kind of on the fence with are on the track but they're multi-tracked so it's kind of like listening to several copies of something that I don't like layered over one another into a musical casserole but not all the tracks are done in that high pitched manner cerulean was a little bit of a rollercoaster for me a couple huge dips in my enjoyment but still I'm feeling a light light eight on this thing most of the tracks were fantastic I love the creativity of this record about as fun as playing with LEGOs if you like playing with LEGOs it's got lots of personality lots of interesting sounds just tons and tons of color and only a few moments that to me sort of felt like unfinished ideas but what do you think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why anthony Fantan oh bats cerulean forever you 
mm7grFGcfIU,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd here and uh yeah I'm not really uh dressed for track reviews can I get a better shirt thank you also could I get a carrot thank you again my needle drops this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music sometimes of the independent persuasion but this case is not the case since it's not the case picture of the single that this track comes from it's by the band cut copy the electro pop trio from Australia who had a new album slated for the beginning of 2011 and you know what I don't even want to think of 2011 right now we still have a full half of 2010 according to the comments on my favorites of 2010 so far a lot of y'all don't even like looking at the middle of 2010 dog he barked into dancing walrus said they were disappointed and many asked why their favorite music wasn't on the list well let me say that was simply a list of I was listening to a lot simply because I own physical copies of them and a lot of LPS didn't make that list because they weren't off the top of my head and I didn't do a deep research into all the album's I reviewed because hey I was just thinking of what I've been enjoying no reason to take it personally it's not necessarily a reflection of what my end of your list will look like so in the meantime Maximus mischief cheer up and I'm sure my taste will get better or worse alright so let's take a listen to this new single Cut Copy with where I'm going Lincoln the tea box okay cut copy where I'm going so this thing lasted about three minutes 30 seconds and opened with some really chopped cycled looped jangling guitar and tambourine sounded like something that could have been on a Velvet Underground record but once it kicks in and gets loud then it's the feel-good Summer Jam of the summer it's just so upbeat there's talk of taking hands and dreams and a journey there's not much about this song that isn't positive right down to the chorus which is essentially yeah yeah yeah whoo the song sounds like a Beach Boys single with a really heavy booming chopped beat this thing really calls back to the past but definitely in more ways than one right down to the staccato keyboards which remind me of a track from the WHO and then you have these really warm milky vocal harmonies that sound way too close to the Beatles to completely ignore it kind of makes me wonder if this bands been hanging out with tame impala it's pretty derivative and might not entertain someone who's looking for something deep I've really got no qualms with the outside that it doesn't really have a distinct sound instead it's kind of pursuing the sounds of other bands that are classic but let me say this is most definitely not a rehash of what they did on their first album or in ghost colors I'm kind of feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this track it didn't amaze me but it was good nice happy song can't say anything bad about it it's like that guy that you know that you may not want to hang out with all the time but while he's around you're gonna enjoy his company but what do you think of this track do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana cut copy you 
Us2q-4BFSlA,the books hey my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd it's Monday and we've got to do an album review first before we do that I want to say I flushed the mod box because a lot of people were pooping in it but of course there were a lot of albums in there that got voted up that I'm not gonna forget about women baths Arcade Fire and I heart on this yesterday have to hark on it today to 1 million video views 1 million forever 1 million forever I hate count you Chester thanks needle drops the needle drops let's get into this the books are a New York duo and this is their fourth album the way out for the past 10 years the project has built a distinctive sound out of outlandish vocal samples electronic beats and acoustic instrumentation the band's first LP thought for food is easily their most skeletal while every album after that has kind of worked to fill in the gaps with more melodies more samples more instruments more beads it's music that's constantly looking for new ways to be catchy and poppy and accessible while at the same time looking for new ways to be incomparable this is really what has made the books who they are and this tension also powers the way out this album starts in familiar territory for books fans with just really easygoing chords arpeggiating underneath what sounds like hypnotist talking therapist self-help gurus patients scientists I'm not sure the phrases that are on the opening track of this LP are taken way too out of context to make any real sense of so it all kind of feels really deep and abstract and just strange it's clearly open to interpretation so I don't think there's any reason to get upset for not getting it like this first track the LP is just chock-full of the vocal samples that bring an emotion and a personality that literally no instrument could and neither the voices or the instrumentation kind of take a front seat they're constantly enhancing each other the sound of one making the sound of the other so much more powerful it's kind of in the same way Stein skis early remixes or DJ shadows introducing or even Godspeed you black Emperor's music are just peppered with vocal samples that add some kind of surreal level to the music but don't let me get too bogged down in the vocals the way out has to be the books most adventurous album yet not just for all those reasons I just stated but because of all the different musical styles they pursue throughout this LP there's a ton of variety on these tracks the post-rock swells on idk T there's a lot of jazz fusion bass and tight drumming on I didn't know that a lot of harsh buzzing and techno beats on I am Who I am there's cello powered minimalism hip-hop beats and some folk on here too not that the books haven't experimented with folk before but this thing is very very all over the place and yet it feels like this one big cohesive thematic thing it's an album that tries everything but sounds like nothing it dabbles in the undefinable sitting down and listening to this album is kind of like being in a Clockwork Orange that scene where Alex has his eyes peeled open and he's being forced to watch that movie of just all these random clips just being flashed before his eyes after this album you won't be disturbed but it is somewhat of a sensory overload there's just all these sounds whether they be voices or instrumentation just kind of flashing before your face it's kind of like music for the attention impaired but I mean that in the nicest way possible the books are experimental in the truest sense they are weird but not for the spectacle of it there is strange as they are because they really do want to hit upon something new something original something that is unlike any other recording that is in your record collection and I think they're closer than ever to doing that on this release this album is playful it's engaging it's fun it's a real roller coaster ride there were points where literally I was laughing and there were points where I was just feeling very very disturbed and there were moments where I felt like I was just being put at ease I think for tête fans are gonna love this caribou fans are gonna love this it's something that you guys really need to trick her I'm feeling a light 9 on this thing it's fantastic I enjoyed it throughout there were two tracks I want to say that I was just okay on but I didn't meet a song on here I hate it did not meet a song on here I hate it but what do you guys think of this album do you love it do you hate it or why and why the needle drop the books the way out forever an ever announced of forever 
J1PruMkQPDw,my needle drops we just hit 1 million video views 1 million forever 1 million forever piggy go bye-bye says in the mod box something about wanting to hear my favorite albums of 2010 so far so I've listed them out these are in no particular order but number one go into Sufis a Sufi and a killer this thing is an insane mash-up between hip-hop and everything everything on the planet Vampire Weekend's contra and I don't want to hear anything about how Vampire Weekend dresses or how they're privileged or how they act because that has nothing to do with their music number three the tallest man on Earth's the wild hunt quite possibly one of the greatest acoustic solo singer/songwriter records I have come across in a long time number four if you're looking for something that will literally beat the living Slynt out of you little woman's throat this is highly highly recommended a must listen high on fire snakes for the divine it's not really akin to the band's earlier stuff but still really great album great guitar playing very very relentless very fiery LCD Soundsystem this is happening this thing amazed me from first listen I was just in love with this record the moment I put it on the moment I just heard the drums hitting the keyboards hitting it's just a fantastic LP I know there's a lot of people hating on LCD and that's okay but I'm liking it beach house Teen Dream yeah these guys really outdid themselves on their third album and really sort of went out on a limb and tried a lot of different sounds and for me anyway it just all works no complaints with this LP and if you're not listening to this thing and you've given beach houses earlier stuff a listen and you dig it you're really missing out for tet there is loving you for tet is clearly right up there with caribou and FX twin and square pusher one of the most creative minds in electronic music today if you're not listening to this guy and you're into electronic then you really need to be here Janelle monáe's Ark Android for obvious reasons it's awesome Adam Green minor love this is really one of the tightest most straightforward LPS Adam green has ever put together sort of a departure from a lot of the schmaltzy arrangements and kind of the indulgences of his past records really trying to get into production and make things sound huge and big just big production anyway that's repetitive I really love Adam Green's voice he just croons lots of weird off-kilter lyrics but still the melodies are very sweet and the hooks are there I think this is one of the best things he's ever come out with in terms of rap releases I've listened to I've got to give it to the roots how I got over this year this thing is fantastic I loved the songs on it hearing black thoughts sing on this thing was really exciting too he did a great job I love the emotion of this album I love the sentiment of this album and for the most part the songs are just really tight a lot of guest spots but it doesn't take away from the cohesion and the theme of this record and I'm gonna list one more MGMT's congratulations I felt like this was an exciting turn of direction for the band just really going into hey you know what screw singles screw this screw that we're just gonna make a big holistic psyche rock record and even though yeah it's not the most experimental psych it's not the most out-there psych Rock the guys really do stick to the classics sound of this genre while still updating it for 2010 there you go Anthony Fantan oh the needle drop lists forever [Music] [Music] 
0je8it7hG3g,yeah I'm doing it yeah I couldn't keep away from em IAS no album what can I say I'm all talk but you know what persuaded me to do this it wasn't a review or a recommendation or an article or even the mod box or people who are subscribed to this channel begging me to review the album it was NPR I was listening to the radio and All Things Considered was having this little comments emails portion at the end of their show where they read off listener responses and this woman just chastised them harshly for even considering to play mi A's music saying that when they were reviewing her album at the time when she was listening it sounded like the radio was just exploding and she turned off the radio offended by the music claiming that mi a stands for my insane album so this review isn't just for my needle drops it's not for the MIAA fans it's not for the MIAA haters it's for the NPR moms with conservative musical tastes that's who this review goes out to mi a is a singer rapper songwriter all that good stuff she's from the UK and this is her third album 2005's our rule our I'm sorry to say I think has gotten buried in a lot of the fame that she gained in 2007 with kala because that album honestly was one of the most adventurous pop LPS to sit at the bottom of the Billboard Top 200 charts that year it's a colorful fusion of Western hip hop with elements of dancehall reggae and various forms of Caribbean music there's tons of electro influence on there too and at the time the music was sexier I had to fan myself off on a lot of these tracks there were some cheap lyrics here and there but it's excusable this LP is about having fun you don't need it to be deep now as experimental as that LP was in 2007 maa got even weirder with kala and with samples of new order and references to the modern lovers this record caught my ear in a lot of places the LP kept up a lot of the international influences that were found on its predecessor and the beats were a little more hard-hitting to m.i.a as an MC was just as in-your-face as ever but I don't really know if she had a reason to be the beats on this thing are really really really really really really really repetitive monotonous in fact a lot of these tracks chased their tails and featured some pretty obnoxious hooks but there was still a lot of personality on this thing that I did enjoy I didn't like it as much as I did our rule our but still a decent album and so now we're here Maya play this now that's it that's obnoxious yeah look at that I'm kidding there's quite a bit of social critique on this record just as there are on mi A's previous efforts and it doesn't stop at the lyrics one of the opening track as lyrics about stepping up into club and speakers and has this really crunk beat but it samples power tools that are placed at a volume that just basically drowns out all the other music in the mix it's funny but this is the first LP I think mi a put together that suffers from inconsistency the following track XXX o would be ready for top forty glory if only the music charts would make room for it that tracks clean studio sound was a surprise and so was the sound that I found on tracks like tequila and story to be told which sport a really really clear dubstep influence which is on the album thanks to a producer she collaborated with on this thing Rusco and though I do love dubstep I do love the harsh sounds that came out of these tracks and just the style of that genre mi haze flow gets a little clumsy at the slower tempos sad to say and another disappointment is the repetition that turned me off of a lot of tracks on kala is in fact worse on this album but the dancehall feel love it takes a muscle and the atmosphere of space are actually a welcome change of pace from that but really most of the tracks do just kind of recycle ideas to the point where they're underwhelming even the loud ones especially on one of the singles born free that thing is just really psychedelic and just burns with distortion but by the middle of it I feel like it hasn't changed it hasn't done much of anything in terms of introducing another idea and I'm just kind of sitting there like okay that's cool the song meds and feds which actually samples sleigh bells is kind of like that too if you're not into the singles I don't see this thing redeeming itself with the other tracks but if you're looking for some pop with etc lyrics distinctive female vocals and very junkyard esque beats this is where you want to be it kind of jumps all over the place - for me this album isn't the worst thing in the world it's not obnoxious like puffy and it's not a spectacle like sleigh bells but it's not that great either I know this thing has been pretty polarizing but I'm kind of feeling a strong five on it there were points that I really kind of dug maybe a couple songs that I actually liked but many of them I didn't really hate but just kind of felt bored if this is your first exposure to m.i.a please go back listen to those earlier albums both of them and if you're enjoying this then keep on enjoying it but tell me what you think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why anthony Fantan o mi a Maya forever [Music] [Music] 
gtyH07BM4TA,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan Oh Internet's busiest music nerd I'm sleepy what does catchy chest I think of sleep I hate that you're sleeping it's remix Wednesday on the needle drop dot-com go over there and download some remixes now and let's go to Twitter real officer narc writes i totally hung out with you're wrong I'm right tonight jealous yes I hate you mmm Lib fan writes any suggestions for metal with both clean screams or evil screams and clean screams vocals yes picture this is the latest album from Al cest a French metal project that has been alive in some form or another for the past ten years the latest title to fall under the project's name his scales of the moon we're going to listen to the two-part title track of this LP totalling up to 20 minutes go down there mm-hmm to give a listen to this sound al cest has to offer al cest with scales tractor kinda night and day really just to slightly different approaches from the first half the second half the first track had a very impenetrable wall of sound going very shoegaze ii with jangled guitars to open it up the drums and the guitar distortion kicked in and though it felt loud voluminous it wasn't overbearing it wasn't completely in your face it was kind of Airy kind of atmospheric in fact I would say it was even uplifting very pretty the guitar distortion sounded like this really tiny black metal style tone but the cherry on top of this track had to be the extremely extremely clean clean vocals now it builds it falls there's variation in different melodies it starts to get really thrashy toward the end of the first half and I would say there's really enough variation in the first track and in the second track to to really justify their nine-minute lengths part two of this track after some serene guitars and what sounds like ocean waves lapping on to shore it really just starts tearing ass with no regrets thrashing everywhere more distortion louder guitars this thing is way more aggressive and the vocals are nowhere near as pretty or clean in the first part of the second half the first song was just spent building things up and I feel like the second track tears it all down in just about half the time and about the halfway points of the song it starts getting really bleak and desolate and the clean vocals come back in and it sort of feels like an aftermath and epilogue to all the anger and destruction and harshness I really have to give it to Alice s for coming together with something that is clearly so thematic and conceptual in fact there's really a lot to love about this track and just this album in general the production is fantastic the sounds are great the songs are all very linear the structures are interesting but I do have a gripe and you know what it's more of a personal thing I think it's something that's just going to hit specifically me I hear a lot of people ranting and raving about this LP I know it's gotten great reviews on pitchfork and Allmusic but mm for me what's kind of stopping me from enjoying this fully is the clean vocals they just seem so out of place for me it's an interesting mix to have these rough ideas and these cleaner prettier ideas just thrown together it offers contrast it offers dynamics makes things feel a lot less boring but when the vocals are clean they are just so sanitized to me sort of feels like spring glass cleaner into my ears there's just literally nothing dirty about them but I'm sure all you can relate I'm sure there's been some band or project or piece of music that you didn't really get the first time or get the tenth time but then all of a sudden you know you take a break you come back to it a while later and you know it just sounds sounds a lot better but what do you guys think of this album and what do you think of these two tracks do you love them do you hate them and why Anthony Fantino elseís scales of the Moon Bret 
4pmTuXGyCPE,no no no no no no get rid of that give her it at but the right one there okay good my needle drops what's up anything Fantana here internets busiest music nerd how are the kids mm-hmm well usually a band-aid will fix that no problem all right we're gonna we're not gonna review this no because it's blown up instead we're gonna review this Mountain Wittenberg Orca this release or EP or mini album is a collaboration between two acts that hold a ton of water in modern music and that's Dirty Projectors in Bjork if you're into adventurous music then this is the stuff that wet dreams are made of but I will admit at first I was turned off to the idea of this album but MacOS or FM actually turned me back on to the idea of this album hold I'm saying that's okay that's spelled correctly I've plugged him before on the channel but spelled his name wrong because I thanks I guess my initial issue with this release is that it's weighted down in concept I wish I didn't read anything about it in fact the lyrics paint a picture of man's mistreatment of the oceans and more specifically whales Bjork sings from the perspective of a mother whale the female vocalist from Dirty Projectors sing from the perspective of baby whales while David long strut sings from the perspective of a member of his band after seeing whales off of Mount Wittenberg it it's a lot of context and the proceeds of this digital album and the proceeds of all sales on this LP go to the National Geographic foundation so it's basically a tearjerker that is meant to make you feel like a heal if you don't spend money on it however cuz there's always a however the music the composition all of that good stuff which we are actually here to talk about really stands beyond any context that came with this release I'm not joking if you've enjoyed Bjork soulful vocals on debut more specifically on the track the anchor song or if you've dug the Dirty Projectors bit Orca I see no reason as to why this thing shouldn't be on your mp3 player this thing has a really stripped-down sound that shoots for simplicity and minimal overdubbing Dirty Projectors tight and complex vocal arrangements still reign supreme but they're not as dressed up or as over produced as they have been on their more recent stuff you really couldn't ask for a more authentically sounding collaboration because it really sounds like Bjork and Dirty Projectors are performing just for you I guess what I mean to say by this thing has a simple sound is that it sort of seems to be devoid of studio magic there's some tinny acoustic guitar some very distant electric guitar but what I love the most in the mix is of course I'm a bass man so I love the acoustic upright bass that is all over this album especially at the one point in the beginning where it's just creating this menacing bowed drone with all these dissonant vocals layered all over it really an attention-grabbing experience for me you know it's kind of funny I actually used to hate the vocals and Dirty Projectors music just really irritated me but now I just kind of see them as the most essential part of the Bands music considering that this release is really like enjoying the best parts of Dirty Projectors without having to sit through a lot of complex and confusing song structures and without having to commit to an albums length of time plus you get Bjork and that's like a bonus bonus buer Bjork bonus not a lot of bands get a Buick bonus the tracks on this thing go to great lengths to tell a story and they succeed the minimum price is seven bucks and you know what really dollar or song on this is not highway robbery so if you're looking for conceptual experimental composition built out of simple sounds if you're looking for some music that just sort of hangs on the precipice of the avant-garde and is passionate and emotional this is where you wanna be Anthony Fantana Dirty Projectors Mount Wittenberg Gorka tell me what you guys think of this release do you love it do you hate it and why forever 
TvPFu80ZVz0,it's track review Oh should use a bit but toes and Hicks Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hello my needle drums this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock top electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good before we get into the track review I have some mail listen Clara there's mail let's open the man let's open the mound belinka Palancar champeta criolla and afro roots in Columbia from 1975 291 this is the new compilation on sound wave records make it around to reviewing this may not but I want to tell you guys right now I've been listening to it and it's pretty freaking badass ok saddle a records sound way sound way sound way pehle AAP link a picture of the release that these two tracks come from the new 7-inch for panda bears upcoming album new single right here tomboy this animal collective member is slated for a new LP in September it'll be his fourth album and follow-up to the critically lauded person pitch and of course this is all happening after the big animal collective craze of 2009 where everybody was freaking out over the LP picture merriweather post pavilion what do a couch esta thinks about animal collective you know sometimes they're a little boring for me but I do love that saying my girl my girl wets material things like social stats my girl I hate copter chesta I hate college and Trust is so freaking much guys are going to listen to the a side and the B side of the 7-inch look for links down there as to where you can't hear them with your ears here are the tracks tomboy and slow motion okay guys pretty much what you can expect out of these things is really what we have come to based on releases like person pitch and of course panda bears work in Animal Collective a lot of psychedelic effects and electronics and minimalism with the track tomboy there was just loads of repetition and strange samples throughout the song I don't know if you guys heard this but right in the beginning of the track two spots right in the beginning it seems pretty clear to me that there is a recording of someone throwing up into a toilet sounded like there was an explosion at one point of the song just a lot of strange sounds I just cannot identify that we're hanging behind all of the reverb all of the abstract vocal melodies and all of the guitar strumming the percussion was very constant there was this cute little pop and there are a lot of thudding bass drum this thing was just really kind of relentless with how repetitive it was I would have liked a little bit more contrast to be completely honest a little bit more contrast but still the sounds on this track are pretty great the monotony and the fact that this track didn't have all that much mystery we're probably my two biggest gripes about this thing it didn't really seem all that puzzling panda bears music doesn't need to be puzzling to be good but that's really what I've always come to enjoy about it the most when it is puzzling so on this first track I'm really feeling a light to decent six now slow motion on the other hand had this opening beat that just had me like oh the reverb was magnificently tight a lot of slap bag with just one syllable wrapping around the next and just really emphasizing the percussion of this track and these very strange cords that were playing I didn't know if they were keyboards or if it was just some kind of manipulated guitar sound could have been either and what I loved about this track a lot of rhythmic experimentation which shows up in some of my favorite panda bear and animal collective songs this thing seemed like it was in six but it was counted in a very strange way one two one two three four one two when it sounded like a broken record but in a good way very surreal trippy strange kind of way unlike tomboy I felt like this track had a lot more texture a little bit more dynamics just as repetitive though but this one really did play with my head a lot more than the previous track I know off the bat this one is not going to be as accessible as the a side of this 7-inch but I enjoyed this a little bit more I enjoyed this more I'm actually feeling a strong seven on that track slow motion like in slow motion more what can I say but you guys heard these two tracks let me know what you think of both of these which one do you like more than the other and what do you expect of this upcoming panda bear album hmm Anthony Fantan Oh panda bear tomboy forever you 
du-Szi7pGRE,superhumanoids urgency well hello there my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little bitty album review this release is not out physically but it is out digitally and there is a link down there where you can go to listen to this entire EP all the way through for justice the band is superhumanoids in this is urgency these guys are an LA outfit that I've been following for a while now and this thing is literally their first EP even though before this there have been some demos single and I wrote about these guys back on the old blog when I used to have that and the reason that got taken down is because bloggers thanks but I was surprised to see that I actually landed a quote from the old blog on to their press release their chili kraut rock heavy tracks are eerier than an open-casket funeral rock is a pretty clear influence on the CP if you're familiar or a fan of the exploits of bands like noi and can but I wouldn't call superhumanoids a kraut rock band I think they're playing within the world of straightforward rock but there are lots of interesting influences and flavors just hanging in the air on this album sort of like an aftertaste this EP has a really live in the moment sound it's just living and it's breathing there are lots of swells lots of things that just sound like they're happening right then and there but there are lots of electronics on this EP to some drum programming and lots of retro since it might appeal to the new wave crowd it's got sweet melodies and hooks great vocal deliveries lots of decent musicianship but there's something kind of off-putting about the music on this EP it's so simple and broken down to the bare basics that it can't help but stand out a lot like the very early rock minimal of wire it's almost as if the band is afraid to make too much sound and to be completely honest I really liked it it sounds very kind of white and clean and sanitary kind of like a laboratory very mechanical and well-oiled and calculating and yet so emotional so human it's like an Android a musical Android my one gripe is that it gets underwhelming in a few spots but only a few i'm loving most of these tracks and I'm feeling a light feathery 8 on the CP most def so if you're searching for something that's kind of like okkervil river covering a kraut rock band and I only say that because I feel like we'll chefs vocals are a lot like the lead vocals on this EP and how could I forget there are lots of female vocals on here too so if you're looking for some female crooning / throbbing electronics steady mid-tempo beats lush keyboards shimmering guitars gentle swells and strong songwriting this is where you want to be it's simple minimal and linear rock that you can just get lost in Anthony Fantan Oh superhumanoids urgency forever 
6Eiy1V32zws,it's track review BAM right there what's up my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd yeah you know what I'm gonna get straight into it this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good now this particular track came from the mod box got voted up to number one and was suggested by 64 Chris 64 a longtime viewer of the channel Chris thanks for being awesome picture of the single that this track comes from it's not actually a physical release but a digital release from none other than Adult Swim who has been actually putting out a new single for the past eight weeks they've just finished the series this week but this was one of the first singles that I believe they put out Adult Swim thank you glad to know that the revenue from all of the DVDs that I bought from you went to good use but what I would really really love is for you to bring back Harvey Birdman attorney at law that would just mean the world to me get right on that you're the best so this track is from washed-out a solo project of Ernest green a Georgia music producer who is commonly associated with the chill wave movement I went to a couch a Chester thinks about chillwave stayin in real candy music it's like slow down eighties PAP used to soundtrack recreational drug use he know I hate counter just so let's give a listen right here washed out with you and I link down there in the D box all right before I get on this track let me just say that everybody knows that there are quite a few people who are naysayers who will simply hate on a new trend or a new genre just because it seems to be popular but let's consider chill wave chill with chill wave chill chill what chill with is not that popular you can't walk down the street and start asking people left and right what they think of chill wave they won't know what you're talking about if you can get past all the hype and all bolts linked I think anyone with an ear on both sides of their head can hear that Ernest green is a great music producer with an appreciation for sound there was a lot of repetition and minimalism in this track but for me it never dragged on never got too slow so dreamy so lucid I felt like I was swimming in a glass of wine and I felt a little less reverb and a little less fuzz on this track it's still there I still hear it but it feels like he's toned it down just a little bit since that EP that was so huge in 2009 I'm glad he's not rejecting the reverb and rejecting the fuzz but it is nice to hear a slightly slightly clearer sound from washed out because I think the songs do kind of stand on their own and don't necessarily need to be drenched in all of these effects to be enjoyable they're all these fluttering electronics and crisp drum machines and just really sleepy vocals a lot of subtleties a lot of attention to detail flowing make it sort of seem like you're just not running in a circle feels like a dance track has the aesthetics of a dance track but it's just pulled to a much slower tempo has way more of a surreal sound to it so yeah depression dance party mix them together get this and of course there's a lot of building in this track with these throbbing retro sounding synth notes until it falls into this sort of half wrapped half-spoken monologue from Caroline Pola check I thought this thing was really catchy really colorful had a lot of dynamics and is on par if not better than everything washed out had put out last year I got to give credit where credit's due you know screw the whole chill weave is a shanwa thing I don't care I'm feeling a light too decent 9:00 on this thing am i interested to see where we're chill wave goes in the future maybe not probably not but I am interested to see where washed-out goes in the future Anthony Fantana washed out you and I forever 
EOJLDZMDS1A,mustache no viler desert fires hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and see that see that that's a video you gotta see if you don't see this video then you I was turned on to her work back in 2007 and then I was young brash listening to a lot of Noise music a lot of drone music and I was all like oh my god I like Nadja not just a cool band and then last.fm was all like oh hey dude you should probably listen to some novella and so I did so I listened and I liked and I found that not too long after she joined up with the noise rock band parts and labor but only long enough to record one album receivers which quickly became one of my favorites in their discography simply because of how minimalist it is and just the beautiful walls of noise and walls of guitar sound in that album in 2009 she released the album red rainbows whose opening track actually got a 9 out of 10 on track reviews for you old skool needle drops this is the follow-up to that LP and needless to say I was excited to hear some of this noise I wonder what counts your chest too thinks about noise I think I'd rather listen to something else I hate coucher Chester so if red rainbows was a hurricane then this album is the calm after the storm because this release is nowhere near as harsh or avant-garde or unsettling this album is subdued pretty ambient and I would go as far as to say relaxing this LP is about a half an hour and a lot of tracks sport a clear chord progression which is something a little new for me when I'm listening to novellas music there are a lot of shivering guitar effects and just lush chords on the first track almost alright I was kind of thinking that novela was going post rock on me almost this thing is pretty easy on the ears but that's not to say it doesn't have an edge there's quite a bit of tension in the idea that this album could get loud even though it does Rumble a little bit and there is a bit of distortion it feels like yeah this could be turned up more this could be a little more aggressive no Beller could get blaring if she wanted to and a lot of the sounds in the background don't really drone as much as they kind of wash in and wash out and wash in and wash out slowly pulsating kind of like smooth ocean waves chill waves the songs don't really fade into one another that much but there's still a lot of cohesion among them as if they're just smaller parts of a bigger more thematic whole read rainbows was clearly an attack and this LP is clearly a more ambient embrace I think my only gripes about this LP is that it seems a little less experimental a little less of a mind melter and sometimes I want my mind melted there's not really a what the five factor to this thing all of the sounds all of these sources of the sound seem kind of obvious where is on her previous releases there were a lot of points where I was just wow is is this coming from a guitar how she making this sound this is weird but still not to take away from this LP the sounds are still very nice some high-grade soundscapes built out of loops like distortion and plenty of swells I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this LP it did not blow me away like red rainbows did to be completely honest and if you are looking for a harsher more aggressive experience with your noise and your drone I recommend starting there however if you're looking for something that is a lot more serene desert fires Anthony Fantino Novell err 
GqT7NVvRDBQ,Oh sir left foot the son of Chico dusty good boy it's so freakin hot I need someone to cool me down maybe this will work I feel cooler but I don't feel cooler hi my needle drops Anthony Fantino Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review big boys new album sir left foot the son of Chico dusty well big boy is a Georgia MCM producer who's best known for his work in one of the longest-running rap duo's Outkast duh and I like many of you had my early years peppered with hits like bombs over Baghdad and so fresh so clean and of course miss Jackson but their early stuff like is just a hip-hop classic really beefy drumbeats heavy bass and memorable samples from 70s funk and soul and of course Andre and big boy at the time were just standout personalities with abrasive words but they didn't really dip into the world of gangsta rap amen Outkast more recent albums are just notorious for being all over the place and it's no less true for this thing sir lucious left foot is powered by a ton of influences but Big Boi is not afraid to flaunt them throughout the album he makes references to Michael Jackson care as one wu-tang clan the ghetto boys and the production is kind of derivative to for example just on one track alone one of my favorites shutterbug we have a hook that kind of reminds me of that classic hip hop song the bubble Bunch some really retro since they actually borrow a hook from a soul to soul song at one point back to now and the beat on this song the rhythm sounds eerily close to Jake wands tipsy it's really tough to keep this album review at a certain amount of time but still do each song justice because every track kind of goes in a different direction this album is pulled all over the place not only by its guest MCS and singers like the alt rap band Vonnegut Janelle Monae is on here Jamie Foxx George Clinton just name a few but there's also little to no cohesion in the production department too we have beats from organized Noize who of course have been there since the beginning of Outkast career mr. DJ Little John Andre 3000 Scott Storch and those are just a couple names that you'll see in the production credits and this leads to a lot of inconsistency which is kind of refreshing at first hearing a lot of different things kind of like a Tabas tree tapestry oh and I got to give it to Big Boi for basically putting together an album with no two songs that sound alike but I can't help but feel as if this album at some points isn't so much worried about producing a decent song as it is getting the credit of that singer getting the credit of that emcee getting the credit of that producer just to sort of have it on their just pad this album with cameos and appearances as opposed to just putting together a good Feist solid Feist record fight as usual big boys flow is just nasty clever wordplay and sometimes the way he says things is more interesting than what he's actually saying just manipulating words to make rhymes fit make syllables fit together out of all the things that I might not have liked about this album I have to say that Big Boy's rhymes his presentation his personality aside from a little bit of tough-guy bull slinked not a lot of complaints this album as a typical as it is is too typical of a story for me because the first few tracks on thing are fantastic I'm loving it but it just turns into a drought in the middle in the vicinity of the track tangerine in that second third of the album big boy is still rapping like a champ but I'm really not diggin the songs or the production all that much some tracks get really sappy while others too flaunt obnoxiously bad hooks and on a few spots with this album it feels as if the weight of the world has just put on the guest singer or guest MCS shoulders to sort of carry the whole track but it's just not working however the LP does redeem itself with 2009's shine blockers which is sounding remixed and resurrected that track just has a really soulful hook these really deep pit shifted vocals that I love thankfully so the left foot and strong just as it starts strong but there are too many tracks I don't like for me to love this entire album I know big boys not a one-dimensional guy so I'm just kind of confused as to why he produced an album with so many one-dimensional songs but if you're looking for a rap record that's pretty much a party album something with a lot of different production styles something with a lot of different guests emcees and singers and producers this may be where you want to be but what do you think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why let me know Anthony Fantino here the needle drop big boy thanks for watching for it 
2KoLHtolHkQ,explode well hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hope y'all are doing well hope you had a good fourth of July weekend and also have to say before we get into this album review on the needle drop calm right now there are a few tracks few mp3's that I highly recommend to your warm a black metal band from Holyoke Massachusetts that recently emailed me saying yo dude check out our demo I did and it was pretty good you gotta listen to it link in the d'box this is the new club 8lp the people's record and these guys are a Swedish boy-girl duo and their musical taste is really all over the map which is something that I can really relate to adding up all their LP eps and singles these two have quite a few releases and they've been active since 1995 and despite all that this is really the first time I'm hearing about them their earlier stuff dabbled in drum machine pops and very light indie rock quaint bossa nova it sounds is that these two have given a lot of airtime to bands like camera obscura Belle and Sebastian and even know Val vlog but this record is quite the surprise because it maintains the light airy sounds of Club eights earlier work and these strong female vocals but takes this very unexpected trip into afro-pop the kind of stuff you guys may have heard if you're a huge fan of Fela Kuti or if you are aware of any of the compilation works put out by the fantastic fantastic record label sound way records so this thing has a myriad of percussion lots of very warm base sunny guitars very infectious vocal chants and some very stereotypically cheesy organ to bluetopia and of course let's not forget the horns club 8 really does put their own spin on this style of music and makes it highly accessible I would say to a Western and European audience club 8 really has done our homework when it comes to this style of music and have maintained a lot of authenticity throughout this album but if you're an afro pop purist which I am partially I can see as to why this LP would turn you off because in some ways it is a little sanitized it is a little simplified you know it's not exactly like how a hawk and a hacksaw authentically recreate smisek from the Eastern Bloc but if you like your music with a bit of worldly spice in the same vein that vampire weekend sort of puts a worldly spice into their music I can see this thing being a perfect summer record for you my biggest gripe about this album is that I really can't commit to it just because so many of the songs either sound the same to me or simply kind of just breeze by just strike me as unmemorable i SAT through this album time and time again and yet after I sort of distanced myself from it I can't really remember all that much about it but while it's on it strikes me as very sweet and enjoyable and then the vocals are a little too sedate for me from time to time and though this is nice when I listened to it it kind of makes me want to listen to some real afrobeat in afro pop music but if you're looking for something that is good mood inducing some indie pop with an African twist some great percussion even greater grooves some swoon-worthy vocals and at least several standout tracks I highly recommend this record I'm kind of feeling a decent or light five on it I'm really on the fence with it though there are like I said a couple songs that really kind of strike me as up this is good but let me know what you think of this record give it a listen look for some of the tracks listen to some of the d'box and that's it Anthony Fantino club eight the people's record forever 
X2xEj8wiS88,it's track review hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and yeah thanks for watching man yes yes okay sorry got excited there calm down because if I don't calm down not gonna be able to do this thing properly now before I get into this hmm I want to tell you guys that there's a link in the d box where you can follow us on Twitter follow us on Facebook and if you do that your life will be so much better mmm another music community announcement that I want to make you're wrong I'm right his back he's making album reviews he's putting up videos he's reviewing music and I got to tell you guys that if you hit up his YouTube channel many of you may have not have heard of this guy but if you have go visit his channel see what he has to offer he was one of the two music reviewers that I knew of at the time that you know serve I started making music reviews with and at the time it was pretty much just me you're I'm right and jumble junky music just watching each other's videos and that was it and then this thing kind of just grew into something that I never ever thought it would all right this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and bam picture of the new Interpol self-titled album it's their fourth album and bam there are New York rock band who have a very moody sound and Bing okay anyway Interpol sound has time and time again been compared to the likes of Joy Division just something cut of that very dark post-punk cloth however don't assume these guys to be a revivalist act or some band that just sounds like another band that's most definitely not the case these guys are a modern group with a modern sound after a short stint on Capitol Records this band has finally returned to the record label where they released some of their most definitive work Matador Records and this LP is slated for a release on September 7th over there this track we're gonna listen to is from that LP it's titled lights and it was suggested by Sylvia one in the Mod Box got voted up like crazy thanks a lot Sylvia you too best let's give a listen to this link down in the d box Interpol with lights hmm all right guys this track was off to a slow start but the voice of paul banks just had me gripped i love this guy's vocals style it just seems so monotone at times and yet just so full of emotion just so full of 'if i just can't help but just hang on this guy's every word also some interesting lyrics about being put in a dark place maybe not wanting to be there maybe being there against your will put there by somebody else weird stuff and i'm really digging the atmosphere around this track - I'm loving the guitar tones this thing just feels big it feels huge I could hear the big stage I could hear the lights this thing had a very linear structure to which I'm usually very much into a lot of Astral hums in the background coming from I don't know where keyboards drums and a little bit a little bit of bass just building into this wall of instrumentation over the course of five minutes and at about 350 it kind of reaches its climax but my issue with that is the climax doesn't really sound all that different than all of the song before it because it builds so slowly this thing really takes its time borders on dragging out way too long not much longer after it gets loud it just kind of hangs there fade out which doesn't feel all that proper to me kind of depressing and though there are elements of this track that I really like it just kind of makes me want to listen to BAM turn on the bright lights because truth be told for the past several releases of Interpol I have kind of missed listening to Carlos danglers really big thick bass lines I miss hearing his bass lines in a prominent point of the mix I'm kind of feeling a strong five on this really on the fence with it I don't know what to think about this new LP based on this track I hope the rest of the songs aren't like this because this thing just kind of felt a little blah but we're gonna find out what's up with this thing on September 7th when it gets released there we go Interpol's new self-titled LP what do you guys think of this track do you love it do you hate it and why and thanks again to Sylvia for suggesting this in the mod box that's awesome and remember guys if you're suggesting old albums and old music inside the mod box you officially thanks I'm in the business of discussing new music and turning you guys onto music that you've never heard of before not telling you what to think about albums that you already hate or already enjoy but if you really want to know what I think about all these older albums go to the needle drop com support me support the website give the donation and request that I do a review on my other YouTube channel based on that donation until then keep listening to new Jam's and anthony Fantana Interpol forever 
Q8Jp4U2BBnI,hey my needle drops Anthony Fantana here music nerd gonna do an album review like the new waves album king of the beach so this band is fronted by this singer song writer Nathan Williams plays guitar and in 2008 he came out with this album titled waves and it was like almost self-titled but it had three V's in it instead of just you know the normal amount of bees that are in the word waves since then he's been like touring to the brink of insanity and released a couple songs with Zach hill of hella and he most recently has picked up Jay retards old band to back things up on drums and bass this is waves third album and it's like a change it's like a big change it's something that maybe is gonna take off all the low Phi fanatics Boop that's the attitude you gotta have with this LP with haunting here we're going to review this album instead now uh this is the album Brotherhood from new order uh really like pretty good you know like it's got a couple good songs um it's got this song on here bizarre love triangle so this ain't like a thinking man's record no not that you don't need a brain to enjoy it not that you need to be brainless to enjoy it it's a good way just to turn the old noggin off for like 30 minutes and just rock so long story short if you're not turning this up and thrashing about you're doing it wrong and speaking of doing it wrong did you know this album has not four but five compete eating entries inside the mod box before you go putting something inside the mod box could you at least check and see if it's already been suggested before you go putting it in there and then voting on it because if you don't you thanks with a more pristine studio quality this time around the hooks stand out so strong on this LP it's partially the production I think overall the songwriting is a little bit better to the chorus from the track take on the world sounds like a post-punk Beach Boys melody the opening king of the beach is a perfect start to this album just trebled hot distorted burning chords heavy drums fantastic and there's some soft sentimental songs on this thing too like when will you come and baseball cards a couple tracks with some very subdued rhythms and even some synthesizers show up in the mix there's some real dynamics among these tracks I may not love every single song but still overall this thing is a lot more varied and engaging than waves last release and I think part of what makes this record such a fun experience is that Nathan really lets his influences pour through on this LP I'm not surprised that he's working with Jay retards old band because they're really pulling from a similar punk aesthetic and I'm feeling a huge skate punk and pop punk influence on this thing really from the old school kind of like screeching weasel the queers the mr. t experience I just can't get away from that vibe and though this is one of the most visceral records I've heard all year and contains lyrics about being an idiot people hating your guts and not giving it this is the most mature waves has ever sounded I think my one major gripe is that it really falls apart on several tracks for me for example on Mickey Mouse baseball cards those tracks are very subdued have a draw machine and I just do not like this music backed up with a drum machine it just knocks the wind out of this record Lou the momentum on it and just pulls the guts out of it and the song convertible balloon god that thing just feels like swallowing a giant ball of corn and almost choking to death on it should you be taking this really seriously there's a cat smoking a J on the cover no you shouldn't be taking it too seriously you should be putting this on enjoying the vibes enjoying how loud it is how ballsy it is and just sort of don't think Jessa I'm feeling a chill eight on this waves chill waves what do you guys think about this thing hmm do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantan Oh waves forever [Music] you 
a1HzLIKAQ4A,the roots how I got over whoa my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd going to do an album review here creaky chair and I wanted to tell you before I do that it's a remix Wednesday on the needle drop com if you're not over there downloading remixes you fool Oh woof thanks alright and as you can see from this album cover we will be talking about the new roots album how I got over in case you don't know him the roots are a hip hop band yes band and this is their ninth studio LP now I know some of y'all who are in my subscriber base don't like hip-hop I don't know why but if you were to try one contemporary hip-hop act the roots are one of the few groups I would highly highly recommend not only for their live dynamic instrumentation but for the really heavy soul funk and jazz influences that just pour out of their music something that a lot of modern gangsta rap is completely devoid of the band has had a lot of lineup changes since their inception but their core is still intact with Questlove on drums their lead MC Black Thought and Kamal on keyboards around this simple skeleton some of this group's best material has been written and that is no less true for this album right from the start of the track walk alone the band builds a song out of some really chunky drumbeats and somber piano chords and from this come something really really emotionally impacting this song also hits a real homerun with the chorus and most of the tracks do it really avoids something that bugs me with a lot of modern hip-hop music where it'll try to pose a real attitude in the verses and the rhymes but once the chorus comes around it'll put some corny overly sweet sing-songy voice in the hook which really kind of turns me off however the roots are very conscious of that emotional balance on this LP and make sure all the pieces to the puzzle fit long story short these songs are built solid brick house and a lot of what makes the tracks on this album stand out from one another are the fantastic and well-thought-out guest spots vocals from monsters of Fulke John Legend and even joanna newsom brings some emotion to these tracks that just could not have been there otherwise with the girls from the Dirty Projectors showing up on this thing - there is quite a bit of indie star power throughout this new route - album but I'm very pleased to say that this thing is not over shadowed by its guest contributors even its guest MCS I'm no roots expert I haven't heard all nine of their studio albums and the ones that I'm most familiar with are organics do you want more Things Fall Apart and I've been listening to a little bit of their more recent material - but from what I can gather this LP is one of the most downtrodden sobering albums I have ever heard much less ever heard from the roots which is really funny because from what I've read the band perceives this to be an overly positive album a very positive album I mean if this is positivity I don't want to see negativity but honestly it's not like this album is suicidal it doesn't see life as pointless it doesn't see life as futile I guess the way I could put it best is that this is the sound of being fed up politics and social issues have always played a huge part in the roots music and that's also true on this album and to be honest why wouldn't the roots be fed up the world sucks right now war oil leak racial injustice sexism pollution poverty I mean I mean have you looked outside black thought and guest emcees like porn Fonte and blue paint a rough but relatable sketch of the political climate according to them and to me it hit a really good balance between being enjoyable clever being well written and preaching a little gospel - the way I see it it's kind of like reporting feel free if you want to disagree but this is the world according to us it's really hard not to feel the struggle that these MCS are in the Rhymes and that just makes this album so much more of a powerhouse my one gripe and believe me it's just one I really don't have much to say about this album in the realm of negativity is that the last two tracks just kind of feel very out of place for me kind of like bonus songs because they really break the emotional narrative of this album and they really break the subject narrative of this album quite a bit especially the track hustla which is really kind of coming out of left field which is why I understand them kind of shoving it at the end of the album but still I'm feeling an extremely extremely strong eight on this album if not a light nine if you guys are looking for something from the adventurous side of rap music something that has a real political tinge to it it hits a lot of groups and it's one of the best hip-hop albums I've heard all year the roots how I got over what do you guys think of it tell me down there in the the comments did you love this thing did you hate this thing and why anthony Fantan oh the roots how I got over forever [Music] [Music] 
Q2nYEWeAR-s,whole parade Expo 86 where does the time go my needle drops where does the time go Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd this is an album review for the new wolf parade LP Expo 86 before I get into this review I want to tell y'all that there is a new track from the band these are powers up at the needle drop calm right now it's good times find a link to download it in the d box wolf parade is a Canadian rock quartet that has masterminded for the most part by two different songwriters Dan Buettner and Spencer crew and these two guys are unbelievably busy a lot of side projects and I've been known to enjoy myself some sunset rub down some frog eyes some handsome furs and some Swan Lake - what I love about these guys is that no matter what song they're singing dan and Spencer just let everything just pour out all over to the track just spilling everything everywhere emotions all over the place can't control the mood and how Dan and Spencer stay together in a band is completely beyond me it's a tribute to working together because to me they are very very different songwriters of course Dan is way more visceral way more of a hook man and all about being straightforward and to the point Spencer on the other hand is much more into unconventional things abstract lyrics very weird song structures stopping building instrumentation back up and starting again he has a much stronger experimental side but these differences on Expo 86 have for the most part disappeared this album really shoots for a consistent sound using production to maintain a cohesive aesthetic you could just land on any track on this album and you're bound to find some really booming loud drums a lot of burning guitar distortion and some extremely bright reverb on the vocals it's really a rock record and the most no nonsense that wolf parade has ever been I mean if these guys have ever dawdled a little bit too much for your taste this may be the time to give them second chance but I am turned off quite a bit by the production the reverb is so freaking loud on the vocals that it's almost distracting and it really doesn't complement dan's vocals or Spencer because something that both of them have in common is that they like to do a lot of vocal yelping and of course this yelping is only magnified by the fact that you're hearing it repeated two or three times by the echo also this album is really really compressed just everything is so thick and loud and voluminous throughout every track from beginning to end even the points at which there is less instrumentation it is loud which really kills the dynamics of these songs but I get it the band is clearly going for some kind of gut reaction get loud don't think just rock however this sue to me fits Beckner much more snugly than it does Krug Dan is as energetic as he's ever been writing songs that go from zero to 60 in a second flat while Spencer's usual experiments with volume and swells stopping and starting are kind of silenced on this album not only by the production which I do not think complements him but by trying to write songs like Dan in a catchy or fashion but I wouldn't say Spencer's attempts at this are completely fruitless what would my lovers say is one of my favorite tracks on this and chaos Appian is one of the most fiery songs on this album this record most definitely grooves it moves there's a lot of tight tight playing on this thing it's a beat cracks like thunder picks a sound and sticks to its guns it's most definitely an admirable release but sometimes this direction worked for me and other times it didn't in fact quite a few times it didn't I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this just about in that area I thought it was okay I didn't really hate this album but let me know what you think did you like this thing did you hate this thing and why Anthony Fantana Wolf Parade Expo 86 Brook 
WnoLpkdUDng,hello my needle drops Anthony fan that was violent Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd going to do an album review here and it's for the new Finders Keepers compilation cloud cuckoo-land a lot of you may remember back to earlier this year where I did a review of a compilation called pomegranates and I got a really great response out of that a lot of people commented positively on that saying oh you know I love listening to older stuff weird stuff obscure stuff so I figured I would go a little further down that road and talk about some odd songs on some odd compilations from odd places so let me introduce you to this compilation same way I was introduced to this compilation 20 garish quills plucked from the plumage of crowd rocks lesser spotted flock progressive pop cuz mirror slop art school psych post-rock readymades from the nest of the longest-running independent label of the deutsche rock generation so in my head already I was like no I can't kraftwerk faust cluster but I was terribly terribly disappointed no long linear drawn-out electronic atmospheric quiet dynamic rock songs for me in fact most of what's on this album is psych rock jazz fusion and prog to put it bluntly only a few tracks on this compilation actually followed through with what I assumed it would be but to be fair krautrock is really only a blanket term used to describe the experimental rock music that was coming out of Germany in the 60s and 70s really could be anything of that era but really post-rock readymades what is that even if any of the bands on this CD had a lineage in the post rock family tree it's so far removed that you really wouldn't draw that comparison if you listened to it a thousand times I was kind of irked about the false advertising but what I came to learn about this compilation is that it's really a snapshot of the goings on at a single German record label called kakaka it just seems like a bunch of tracks that were released by this label between 1970 and 1974 and it's kind of hard to see it as more than that because this record label could cook seems to be the only binding thread that brings all these songs together because there's a lot of variety here though there is a lot of rock music throughout these songs there's not really much in the way of sameness a whole lot of variety there's also film music on here some stray ambient pieces some straight-up noise synthesizer worship and a typewriter solo on tracks evidence there bbbbb strange tracks on this thing really are strange to the point where I can't help but just hold them in high regard for being so weird but there's a lot of familiarity here too it's got the bluesy guitar riffs fiery foods and druggie ambiance that we really love when it comes to music from these 60s and 70s plus many of these songs are sung in English to be completely honest I don't think anything on this compilation is going to blow anyone's mind but does that make it bad music no absolutely not in fact I think it's pretty good music and would like to compare to this you know how when you were a kid it was pretty fun to find a rock and then you turn it over and there'd be all these bugs under a creeping and crawling going that's pretty much what this is it's not a total experience or understanding of what is going on under the rock but this single moment where you get to peer into what's going on under it it's just like getting a limps of something that's just laid covered for years so look into this if you'd like to hear the exploits of a small german label or just hit up another solid release from the finders keepers discography there are some links where you can string clips from this album down there in the d'box check this thing out on finders keepers records com and if you listen to it let me know what you think love it hate it and why Anthony Fantana cloud cuckoo-land forever 
YMyzLX4-Lv4,Emeralds does it look like I'm here hello miles Rafa Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and this is an album review and it's for the new emeralds album does it look like I'm here which was requested by mr. cool man Tim in the Mod box that everybody voted it up so good job mr. cool man Tim why that was always commenting and watching my videos emeralds is an Ohio outfit who I was turned on to back in 2009 by someone who you all may know and love a YouTube music reviewer by the name of you're wrong I'm right here's his review of their 2009 LP what happened my first impression of this LP was really really great the music just makes key references to other albums and artists that I hold in a very high regard from the minimalist synth compositions of Vangelis to one particular collaboration between Brian Eno and Robert Fripp on the LP no pussyfooting which is just loaded with these very strange unsettling guitar drums and what's reminding me of all that music is really the sound of this new emeralds LP I think sound is this albums most unique aspect lots of atmosphere on this LP but not so much reverb that it's overbearing a lot of synthesizers that sound like they're really not of this age much more retro much more vintage but there's a very new studio clarity on these old-school synth sounds so it kind of breathes new life into this style of music this is really the kind of stuff experiments are made of and a CD that no astronaut should be without it has an aesthetic I think most people will associate with the future and science fiction and Emeralds are most definitely conscious of this especially with song titles like Science Center double helix and summer data the track cycle of abuse sounds like sitting in the control room of a UFO while the computer readers which are completely beyond my comprehension are just going there are some moments that really stick out for me like the 12-minute jannettek which kind of reminds me of the intro to a zombie song but doesn't really get loud or all that rock-oriented anyway that particular track is just really an explorative explorative experience along with the title track of this LP which numbers over seven minutes - to be completely honest a lot of the shorter tracks on this thing just kind of breezed by for me not that four minutes is a really short song length but for me with this style of music it kind of is plus all these shorter tracks take some very very similar stylistic and structural cues they will introduce just three to four sounds some synth chords guitars some kind of other bubbling synth melody and maybe some added noise or distortion just to put some more mystery into the track it'll slowly build these three to four sounds up sort of hang there for a minute or two once it's built all of them up and they're all together maybe introduce one additional little guitar melody or something in the mix that's kind of buried in the rest of it all and then fade everything out I couldn't help but gravitate toward the longer tracks more just because I felt as if I was doing a little more exploration into the music and so was the band I enjoy what this record is shooting for I love it sounds and I love the music that is clearly from what I can see influencing this album but structurally I find this record to be pretty uninteresting and wrought with sameness but I know that people are going to and already have enjoyed this record a lot more than me so if you're looking for something that is really synth-heavy borrows from the world of Brian Eno is very minimalist very colourful very retro sound a little explorative a little ambient and won't try to wear you out with overly drawn-out song lengths if you're in the market for that then I highly recommend this LP so I'm really out of strong five to a life six in regards to this one it really didn't even come close to amazing me some of the tracks did though really did like genetic really did like the title track but the majority of this thing just had me wanting more kind of just wanting more let me know what you think of this thing did you love it did you hate it and why what were some of your highlights what were some of your least favorite parts what could have been done better and what - you was perfect Anthony Fantana new emeralds LP forever 
AxvUaBMM8Xg,hey it's track review my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd I haven't shaved it's really hot out it's humid I'm sweaty I'm miserable it was raining outside a few minutes ago now it's stopped Tom Waits the recommender net it is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion it's Thursday I hope everyone's having a happy Thursday copy furs day and today I have some mail mail from civil Civic HQ 659 blah blah what could it be hmm open it open it open it up forever oh yeah the new civil 67 inch that I reviewed monday i bought this with my own money to on the internet ooh and it comes with a photograph ah the guys in the band mmwah all right guys picture of the LP that this track comes from the name of this band is Magic kids and I found out about them via the mattah blog on matador records com this record is coming out via Matador and true panther sounds in this particular song is really hot on the blogosphere right now one of the top blog tracks on elbows and so i decided to give it a listen so let's put our ears on this link in the D box where you can hear it magic kids with summer wow this track was absolutely adorable just a series of cute songs i don't mean cute in the twee sense cute I mean cute aney god that's just so sweet that's just so innocent that's just so kind and gentle and captivating I love the string sections there are a lot of different styles flowing throughout this track the beginning reminded me of some very brave ambitious Britpop but then it jumped into something that in terms of production and later in the track in terms of style was heavily heavily in debt to guys like Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys and also the end I mean after those two influences kind of comes out of nowhere I mean the percussion and just the timbre of the instruments on that particular part of the track be very end sounded distinctly distinctly Latin just like Latin music Colombian music just some very nice dent dent in it dead then then nnn and then the melodies were great the lyrics were really immediate and i love the vocal delivery just something that was totally taken from another time and just breathe some new life on this track I mean there was a lot that was vintage on this song and though it is a great track and i have to give these guys kudos for coming up with a song that felt really catchy however i think this band from a personal viewpoint borrows a little bit too much maybe drowns in its influences a little bit but you know these days what isn't borrowed the borrowed thing aside magic kids has put together a really summery very enjoyable track and something that's got me really interested in hearing this new album picture of it again plus I'm hearing some similarity here not influence but similarity to that girl's LP album arm and considering that that was also released to be a matador and true panther sounds I'm wondering if because that record was so popular are trying to repeat that success because in terms of musical style and even in the vocals I am hearing a little bit of girls here it didn't blow my mind it didn't change the way I listen to music but it did make me swoon I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this one but you guys can listen to it down there let me know what you think do you love this thing do you hate this thing and why and are you looking forward to this new magic kids album Anthony Fantino new record from the magic kids summer 
ABAea7gFO5I,Laurie Anderson homeland hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd thank you thank you for listening thanks for being cool subs and today is Wednesday remix Wednesday on the needle drop com where you can download five different remixes for a good time there are remixes of Pantha two prints cults health up there right now so there's a link in the d box head over there download those tracks if you want to yeah and that's all I hope everyone's having a good week and let's get into the album review this is Laurie Anderson's new LP homeland and Laurie Anderson is I don't really know I can't really describe Laurie Anderson all that easily but what I do know is that she holds a special place in my musical heart and yes I could say she's experimental I could say she's aa bond guard but those really aren't all that descriptive but let me make a futile attempt or describing what she doesn't say her music is where minimalism electronics spoken word and art pop all collide tied together with lots of vocal manipulation and violent my first exposure to Laurie Henderson was big science after having heard the album at the college radio station that I used to be the general manager of it was an eye-opening experience tracks like from the air big science and Oh Superman just had me hooked from the start I loved the overly abstract narratives and the cold electronics just had me feeling Kraftwerk of course I want to make a mention that big science came out in 1982 and this is Laurie Anderson's first album in 10 years and this is pretty much about as cinematic as any album is going to get this year it's not really a release that you listen to simply for its music though it is musical there's really more to it than that the poetry of Laurie's words and sometimes the lack of sound in a given track can mean everything to me that's kind of classic Laurie Anderson because from big science to bright red to here there's always been this prevalent desolation to the sound set of her music at least some of her music but going back to the words the poetry the verbage I can't help but hang on this woman's every word and on homeland she points out America's faults politically and philosophically without subjecting listeners to an overly preachy solution to the problem instead she keeps things simple and yet so complicated because to tell you the truth I have no clue what this woman is trying to say at least half the time not that it's gibberish but a single one of her sentences could be interpreted in about a dozen different ways usually I just find myself trying to find the most appropriate way to react to one of Laurie Anderson's songs on this album for example my favorite track is the 11 minute another day in America and it's this very long drawn-out narrative and she tells a story in it a short story in it because there are a lot of different passages to this narrative and this story is about a couple who gets a divorce and they hate each other and they wait until their 90s to get divorced and when asked why did you wait so long to get the divorce the responses well we wanted to wait until the children died now my initial reaction to that to the story the story itself is to laugh because that's a funny story that's a joke however there's a load of social critique in that because some people do live like that that is an extreme but a lot of people you know oh we stayed married because we wanted to wait until the kids moved out of the house and then you have this third level where you have this story which is funny and has critique in it but it's set to this very eerie music and this woman with a digitally manipulated voice which is sort of you know a bunch of registers lower is reading off this story in a very strange way there's a level of creepiness there too and not just that track but this entire album is just pulling from different emotional sides of me as Laurie Anderson's work usually does I'm smiling I'm inquiring I'm confused I'm upset as far as highlights on this LP the opening transitory life is a very hair-raising beginning to this room the ending flow which is very pretty violin piece ends this album very strong to the story on the beginning of memory is unbelievably surreal just a mindful and the single only an expert I think is my least favorite track on this album though even that track isn't that bad on this song Laurie dispenses some of the best critiques some of the best poetry she has on the entire album but what kind of has me on the fence with this song is that it's it's set to this techno beat that just feels so out of place for me something that isn't really appropriate and maybe a little annoying bordering on annoying but Laurie experiments Laurie adventures I wouldn't have it any other way and if she's gonna do a techno beat she's gonna do a techno beat that's pretty much it I see most of this album as Laurie Anderson doing what Laurie Anderson does but in a much more contemporary fashion and of course on this album she also collaborates with 4/10 Antony of Antony and the Johnsons does some vocals on their John Zorn of course lays down some psychotic sacks and Lou Reed comes on plays guitar we'll read let me just say that this thing is not for the faint of heart for people who are impatient for people have more straightforward sensibilities if you want to go on an adventure if you want to try something weird if you want to try something that is going to hit you a lot of different ways emotionally something that you just will not know how to react to properly Laurie Anderson homeland I'm feeling a deathly deathly strong aid on this almost bordering on a 9 maybe more listens will bring more enjoyment I'm sure they will but as of right now feeling very very very positive about this album and highly recommend it to anyone who is into anything experimental anthony Fantana laurie anderson homeland forever 
3niVOWuSVF4,Janelle Monae argh Android hi my needle drops Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd going to do an album review the new Janelle Monae arc Android before I get into the review I want to say for all you new and true-blue Ariel pink fans Ariel has a new project together called Ariel pink with added pizzazz there's a track from that project upcoming the EP on the website right now download it over there good times Janelle Monae is a singer songwriter dancer a real triple threat this is her debut full-length album and this thing has gotten some really heavy votes inside the mod box since I put that thing on the YouTube channel but I kind of just sat on the review and didn't do it as maybe soon as I should have and maybe that was because of fear and irrational fear kind of like how some people fear going to the dentist even though it's not that bad just the fear of trying something new I guess because Monet is Grammy nominated she is on P Diddy's record label and she's also been featured on American Idol just a lot of uncharted territory for my reviews not exactly the type of music I'm usually talking about but to be honest once I jumped into this LP it wasn't bad and here's how bad it wasn't despite all the mainstream hype in big-time musicians surrounding Monet as of late do not take this LP for your average pop album in fact most of the tracks don't even follow a normal pop structure but that's besides the point this thing is more conceptual intricate and colorful than most of the indie albums I've heard this year and totally spits in the face of the idea that as you get more popular you have to water down your art this thing is a big-time production has more credits on it than a feature-length film and it's definitely not an album for just putting on the high five and just leaving it alone and going about and washing your dishes and eating your food and petting your cat to fully appreciate this you have to sit down on the edge of your seat and just take in all of its twists and turns instrumentally and emotionally because this thing is all over the place in a good way because hip-hop jazz Motown funk contemporary R&B and orchestral pop all survive in harmony among these 18 tracks this album stylistic shifts just keep things feeling fresh and engaging and nothing really feels out of place except for the of Montreal collaboration on make the bus which is pretty much done in the band's usual over eccentric style it's really not that big of a pothole in the ride and ride is probably the best analogy I can come up with for this album especially in the first half which I kind of neglected up until this point to mention but this LP is actually split into two suites the second and third of a four-part series which is really not complete right now but the first part came out in an EP before this but anyway a ride yeah the first suite of this LP is incredibly fluid with just one song boozing into the next you really can't tell where one starts and one ends just one thing jumping into another overall the first half of this album does emphasize a more straightforward approach taking a lot of influence from guys like Michael Jackson Prince and James Brown just a lot of upbeat funky and brassy tracks and even the slower numbers on the first sweep for mayor just to immediate to deny the first half has its moments of experimentation but it's mostly catchy tunes the second part of this LP the third suite is actually where things get a little weird the longest tracks are in the third suite the songs are way more abstract and linear not repeating a lot of hooks a lot of string sections and there's even one moment where the strings section is playing the melody from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory pure imagination I'm surprised I haven't heard a lot of people talking about it but the thing is it's either the melody or it's so close to the melody that it's definitely inspiration or some kind of each and considering that that this LP would lift a melody from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from pure imagination specifically I feel like it just kind of embraces our key androids whole notion of fantasy it definitely works with the imaginative aesthetic that the lyrics tablet but of course our key Android isn't all sci-fi and futurism and androids there's some love songs in here to soften the blow but overall the third suite is a real mixed bag and save some of its weirdest parts for the end like on the 9 minute Bop pile which is full of jazz improvisation 's and double-oh-seven orchestrations it's possibly one of the most ambitious moments on this LP but may go sort of unnoticed just because it's so long it's kind of strung out and it's at the end of the album but to go back to what I said about ambition this thing has doodles of it and maybe it's to the point where it may turn off some listeners because if you like your pop simple sweet and straightforward this thing may not be the most easygoing album of 2010 but for a concept album it's really playful it's really fun and it's really thrilling my original gripe about this LP or really my first reaction to it is that I didn't like it or that I wasn't going to like it and the reason I felt that way was mostly because the sound the production the quality of this recording sounds very much like a modern or contemporary R&B recording like you may hear on commercial radio which is really not my thing however though this thing sounds very modern though it has a very new studio sound and it sounds like you know she recorded in a studio that she had access to because she's on P Diddy's record label it sounds like it was recorded kind of in that context but still the songwriting is fantastic this thing does not forget in fact it embraces the fundamentals of jazz and Motown it's everything I love about these older styles of music but put into a much more updated context and thrown together with very android-based subplot now there's tons of stuff in terms of concepts and ideas that I could talk about and even relate it to Fritz Lang's Metropolis and just ask all day what does this lyric mean what does this lyric mean for me that's more of a personal adventure that one has to make kind of interpreting all these things and I could be talking about how famous Janelle Monae is getting and about how a lot of people are just singing the overhyped blues but that is just a bunch of outside contextual stuff that doesn't really need to be discussed I'm here to vouch for the music and I can say beyond the shadow of the doubt in my opinion that the music on this album is good very very good in fact it's excellent in fact I'm giving it a strong eight if not a light nine it's a brave new album for a brave new world and I highly recommend it but let me know what you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana Janelle Monae arc Android Suites 2 & 3 forever [Music] you 
ynJ2Fhx9E5Q,[Music] it's track reviews hi everyone needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm feeling good today's Monday it's a Monday and yeah starting off the week just feeling energized feeling like my Chi is in balance I hope everyone had a good Father's Day and thank you for answering the Father's Day comment question of the week box yeah thing and before I get too deep into this track review I want to say at 7 p.m. today Eastern Standard Time gonna do a blog TV look for a link in the d box as to where you can go to watch that and also on the needle drop com Adult Swim has been releasing new singles from artists like mad villain and Bonnie Prince Billy for the past 5 weeks I have two of the new singles up there on the website right now from Black Lips and washed out download them over there down there in the D box link ok we're gonna start the week off right with a track review from picture of the single that this comes from the latest 7 inch from the electro rock duo civil Civic I came into these guys I want to say a little over a year ago over a year ago when one of the members of the project sent me what I think is possibly the greatest piece of music to have ever been emailed me by the artist himself these guys have been touring behind their new stuff and head down there in the D box where you can find a link to listen to the b-side and the b-side of their new 7-inch single let's start civil civic with run overdrive and fuck youth okay hmm I love how this thing started just with the light guitar chords very easy but at a very steady tempo but it did not take long to just blast your face off with a heavy dose of distortion stylistically there's a lot of similarities here between this track and civil civics earlier EP but these two songs are just as invigorating and I do feel like the duo is going for a cleaner sound here just a little cleaner I mean it's not sparkling but smelling am i hearing a little bit of maturity here I don't know but when this thing kicks it kicks hard I love the freaking just oversaturated compressed heavily heavily fuzzy bass the tight snappy drum machine the wailing guitars and some of the reverb guitars in there too just adding some more texture when everything was just getting fat and loud and just heavy it's just so instantaneous it's just so Pleasant the melodies are awesome just the groove the feel of this track to me is just something that I feel like I could show to anybody hence I'm showing it to you on this first track here run overdrive civil civic really put together something with a great feel and a fantastic sound set Bravo guys decent eight on that one and on fuck Youth the other b-side I don't know why but I'm just feeling a big Mega Man vibe on this song just kind of feeling a little Mega Man like Mega Man 2 I enjoyed video game music as much as the next guy the guitars here felt a little space here is if the effects on them kind of had them set to phaser the distorted bass showed up here too and the two tight drum machine programming also it was a little quirkier than the other track and it didn't build as much but still hit an earth-shaking groove I'm feeling a strong seven or a light eight on fuck youth great track two and overall I feel like civil civic is going in an interesting direction with this new single and their debut EP I mean they're really yet to disappoint me and I feel like in terms of melody sound structure they're just top-notch but if you've heard these two tracks let me know what you think love them hate them and why so civil civic run overdrive fuck Youth keep being awesome forever [Music] you

LwDNWYvFpYs,20 to lose faith now puffy sex dreams and denim jeans hello my needle drops this is a review of the new EFI LP sex dreams and denim jeans puffy is a part-time producer part-time singer part-time rapper in full-time electro queen and her debut full-length is a compilation of some new ditties but some old hits that she's had lying around - like emcees can kiss and pop the Glock and I was introduced to uh fee the same way a lot of people were on the album cross through the track the party where she sort of does a little vocal cameo there throughout the whole track and it's a great song really colorful kind of funny playful talking about getting drunk hanging out chilling at the club being with your friends and I admit I thought she put a lot of personality onto that track and just made it a really good time I dug it but this debut full-length is a 48 minute long migraine made of overly simplistic beats and really cheap lyrics we'll get to what the lyrics are a little bit later but for right now who let this girl near microphone seriously I want to lay the blame on somebody because her flow is awful it's so frickin clumsy she couldn't wrap a present and in terms of singing she couldn't carry a tune if it was in a bucket which is why 90% of any and all singing on this LP is auto-tuned with all the auto-tune that's on this LP it's like listening to the trials and tribulations of a snooty party addicted fembot the production is one of the few redeeming qualities about it and it is best when avi has nothing to do with it we do have some beats from Monsieur waz oh who is a very respectable electro artist in his own right even though his last LP really didn't do much for me and mere wastes and feeds hoping I'm pronouncing those correctly also bring some beats to the party - and all of uppies vocals aside all the tracks here are pretty fun and bubbly and colorful and just very simple music that you can get drunk with thousands of people - inside of a dark sweaty Club but the lyrics are astonishingly self-absorbed they make gangster rappers look like altruists ah he pretty much only sticks to several different topics she either raps about herself people she likes because they like her people who talked about her people who love her people who hate her or her loving someone I mean the complete and utter lack of depth on this album makes listening to sleighbells feel like reading Aristotle she's like an underground Miley Cyrus who takes fashion tips from the do's and don'ts section and vice magazine but should I be getting mad should I be getting offended and angry at this album shy really be hating on this well I mean after all in Effy's lyrics she does say herself that she doesn't claim to be an artist that she's not a lyricist that she's no singer but she does say that she's an entertainer and my question is if you can't be an artist or a lyricist or a singer how do you propose to entertain anybody the beats are okay the lyrics are annoying and I would just sort of let it go at that however there are a couple major rock-and-roll offenses that are committed on this album for one the title track samples The Velvet Underground song rock and roll though loaded is not one of my favorite Velvet Underground albums and rock and roll is not one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs thanks for ruining it and also there's a cover on this LP of the Siouxsie and the Banshees song Hong Kong garden thanks for ruining it and even the rapper Farrell stops by for a cameo on the track a DD SUV and you know before this album I was kind of like yeah feral cool guy but right now I'm kind of on the fence with him in regards to this whole piece of garbage right here so if you're looking for some ironic white girl gangsta posing some gray deaf hipster hop some fun beats that to me are like raisins covered in a candy coating of vocal feces crappy rhymes lots of auto-tune it's basically watered-down Ke$ha it's about as gimmicky as ICP and more conceited than a pop diva with a six-figure record contract it's uh fees extremes and in denim and jeans I am feeling a very very light too on this a very light skinny malnourished - yeah yeah - and that's only because there are some beats on this LP like I'm a song difficult that I do enjoy but the rest of it is just so annoying so obnoxious it makes me want to throw up and then eat my throw up and then throw up one more time and then he but if you've heard this LP what do you think about it do you like it or do you hate it and why because you know what they say once you've heard uh fee you've definitely had enough II further for the rest of your life that was bad forever you 
FZnXhfwF8rg,hey it's track review hello my needle drums Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to do something here that we do regularly a track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music before we get into the track review I do want to talk about this right here new single from the pains of being pure hearts say no to love it's out now on slumberland records there's a little music video floating around the internet for it great song listen to it enjoy it yeah and speaking of singles there's a new one on the needle drop com from New York trio new New York trio their name is family trees family trees that's their name and they've got a great song out called dream talkin kind of sounds like the Everly Brothers making love to jonathan richman that's just what I think that's just what I think but anyway picture of the LP that this track comes from band of horses third album out on columbia records i would think by now in this band's career they really need little to no introduction but their new LP is streaming in full on myspace right now along with this title track that we're going to take a review of band of horses with infinite arms okay just want to make sure everyone knows that if you go down there in the dbar the d'box the low bar the downbar the did you can hear this track on band of horses myspace myspace.com / band of horses but a better that so here we had an introduction with very simple guitar strumming a lot of atmosphere and some ambient sound lifted from a forest in the night a lot of crickets a lot of birds and this is fine because this is all country's natural habitat and I didn't really care for the vocals at first but given the aesthetic here and given these shimmering guitar leads and just how easy and soft this song is I really can't see them being done any other way this thing for me was a little too sedate in the verses and I would say it even bordered on being underwhelming however when the chorus kicked in and you had that swell that heavenly swell into you that for me was really captivating just undeniably beautiful and what was that melody kind of following the chorus to sounded like a whistle maybe a guitar I don't know very pretty melody very pretty addition to this track pretty and there's a lot of attention to the detail in the production to just haunting guitars these really soft dynamic drum rolls there's a lot to hear and a lot you may miss if you're not really staying on this thing and listening to it really paying attention to what's going on there's also some melodica or harmonica in the mix too there's some things that with repeated listens you will be catching that you didn't hear on the first listen I really like the fact that band of horses produced this LP themselves it shows it really sounds like something that these guys had mulled over and made sure was a perfect finished product my main issues with the song is that I didn't really care for the vocal melody in the verses it had a strong beginning a strong end but overall the thing is just kind of a little vanilla it's just kind of plane it's a little too easy it's a little too soft it's a little too this isn't the most distinctive thing band of horses have ever done plus if I'm going to go down this road I'm really more of a fleet foxes vetiver kind of guy it's still a pretty song and if I was in a very chill chill mood I can see this thing hitting me in a better way I'm feeling a strong 520 like six on this about in that range but if you've heard this track or if you've heard this album or if you're just a band of horses fan or hater let me know what you think of this particular track Anthony Fantana Band of Horses infinite arms picture of the new LP again for you you 
Gko3qhyrBAw,hi my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and before I get into this review of divos new album something for everybody want to tell you guys on the needle drop calm there is a new mixtape hiphop mixtape vishawn does a little tribute to the NAS album Illmatic you guys may remember at the beginning of this year I did a review of Sean's new LP Boy Meets World great album give a listen to that new mixtape link in the d-backs some of you may not know who Devo is and you may also not even care about who Devo is but I'm here to tell you that you really should because Devo is without a doubt one of the most crucial groups in New Wave and post-punk right up there with bands like new order and artists like Gary Numan but Devo really did have their own unique style they had a cold calculating disposition a lot like the group Kraftwerk but yet they also had this inquisitive experimentalism about them something that was kind of fun and quirky that I could liken to Brian Eno's for solo records and because of that their music is just so much fun it just has a lot of personality just so rigid and robotic and yet so human and so endearing now I'll admit I've never really appreciated a Devo album in full not that I haven't listened to one in full but there's usually a stray track or two that really rubs me the wrong way and that's because usually there's a really strong dorkiness a really strong geekiness to this music that can turn me off and it's kind of ironic because this very Deaconess is kind of what attracts me to the music in the first place and this is something that for me is even pretty prevalent on devos earliest albums there are tracks even on there despite the fact that I love that LP that I just cannot get down with for example their cover of the Rolling Stones satisfaction to me one of the worst most indulgent cover songs ever but still I have to give Devo a lot of respect and a lot of props because of the songs of theirs that I do like I absolutely love and I know that Devo really is the only place where I can go to hear this kind of music that is on this album you know here done well anyway also did you know that Devo and the Black Keys are both from Ohio coincidence I think not so something for everybody it's DeVos first album in 20 years their first since their 1990 LP smooth noodle maps and this thing is like a version 2.0 rendition of New Wave if I've ever heard it here Devo has a new studio sound but they still maintain their really blunt synth-heavy percussive style the band is stuck with their usual lyrical themes of Conformity love troubles sci-fi fantasy and they've even stuck in some pretty modern social critique like on the song don't shoot on a man and what we do is LP are extremely extremely high just songs that to me are instantly instantly catchy like fresh and later is now just great hooks and great sounds great songwriting throughout and Devo is put together some really impressive sounds on this album - really snappy drums and infectious ly mechanized grooves and of course there's just an army of synth tones and Timbers throughout this release - squawks buzzing distortion weird tremolo effects I mean this LP really sounds like it's from 2010 but Devo still in no way has abandoned the primal hybrid of rock and electronics that made their music so unique in 1978 if you really want to know what this album sounds like imagine a disco dance party with the cast of lost in space where everyone is forced to wear the same colored tracksuit on the dance floor but I do have some gripes about this album one of my major ones is that on some of the tracks the hooks are just repeated ad nauseam with little to no alterations to them so it kind of seems a little over repetitive a little monotonous it's like on the tracks please baby please and what we do and there are some hooks and songs that I really can't get down with at all like on human rocket some futuristic song about a programmed rocket man who's gonna go blow something up and no second-guessing because he's programmed man he's gonna and then a song about a Native American dude with karate moves and he drives a GTO and there's all these devil voices in the mix yeah there are a handful of songs that are not my favorite on this album but it's mostly because it's kind of Devo being their quirky funny selves sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn't it's more of a personal thing I'm not the most hardcore of Devo fans but I think people who do enjoy their Kitsch who do enjoy their personality a lot more will dig on those tracks that I didn't I'm kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this about in that range but if you're looking for something that is electronic poppy well read very weird music that doesn't care what anyone thinks this is where you want to be but let me know what you think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why it's an LP that would win first place at the science fair do you have something for everybody forever you 
pkcnbD9DT6o,hey my needle drops just got back from a journey journey no not from there from the new radio department LP clinging to a scheme this is my first time taking a suggestion from the moderator box on our YouTube channel youtube.com slash the needle drop in case you're watching this anywhere else and down there in the moderator box you guys can suggest an LP and it's highly recommended that you actually leave a youtube link or some kind of link where I can hear what you're suggesting if you don't do that and you choose to instead make suggestion in the comment box of this video or any of my videos you feel Thanks so why was this a journey well mostly because on first listen I kind of hated it well maybe I didn't all and out hate it hate it but I was kind of like I was kind of like this and maybe it's because I usually like a lot of sonic beef a lot of color to my music and the radio Department for the most part are an easy breezy Swedish pop band who sound like My Bloody Valentine being forced to start a Pet Shop Boys tribute group and there was a lot turning me off about this LP initially but you know I had to listen to it deeper if I was gonna do a review because I wanted to find out why I didn't like it there were a lot of cheesy scents that reminded me of 90s radio pop plus a lot of very sedate vocals that didn't feel too engaging to me at first and plus the music just had this middle-of-the-road thing going on it was dreamy but not too dreamy it was poppy but not too poppy I just kind of felt like maybe it didn't know what direction I wanted to go in and also what's with the smoking I have a theory about albums where they're smoking on the front cover I I don't like them however this theory time and time again is being disproven it's really not all that good of a theory it's a small tea theory but after multiple listens to this new LP which wasn't hard because the songs are pretty straightforward in the album is pretty short I've started to catch some elements that I really really loved I was getting past any hang-ups I was having and I truly started to feel like these reservations were kind of melting away and I was starting to see the radio department for what they were I was starting to enjoy the relaxed melodies the very moderate hypnotic tempos and the very pleasant synthesizer sounds - it was kind of like listening to a dance party in slow motion or let her like medium motion not so much slow but medium mid motion and initially I saw the sound of this album as being very hollow very vacant and right now at this point I can't say I'm on the opposite side of the aisle not really there but I am starting to hear and starting to appreciate how much of an influence shoegaze has on this release sure there's a lot of New Wave influence on this LP a lot of synth pop influence on this LP but the radio department conjures a lot of walls of sound - but they're not really harsh or distorted they're very light and soft and embracing the sound of this LP is definitely not deafening I would almost say it's ambient if the songs weren't so engaging and I'm really starting to enjoy the hooks to the heavy reverb on the vocals make translation of the lyrics a little difficult from time to time however I think the mood of this album is actually more important than understanding the words in the songs and I think I pretty much owe my enjoyment of this album to several tracks that on first listen did impress me despite the fact that I might have been on the fence at first with this LP like the upbeat reggae influenced keyboards on follows suit the very jangling shimmering guitars on the opening track domestic scene and the very robotic drum beat and plethora of instrumentation on the track David all these moments kind of just engrained themselves into my head after first listen and even though I may not have enjoyed the LP the first time around I said wait a second let's go back to these tracks because there's something here one major gripe that I do have something that I don't think I'm going to get past is that whether it's the sound the mix the production whatever a few tracks on this release do come off kind of thin and tinny almost to the point where it hurts my ears if I turn it up loud maybe it's intentional but that doesn't mean I have to like it but still this is a really solid release and a great third album for this project none of the songs really stuck out as being bad to me but if you're looking for an LP that has a blood trail leading all the way back to the late 80s and early 90s something that is kind of easy listening for the indie crowd just some drum machine pop with calm as hell vocals then this is where you want to be I'm feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing maybe more decent eight yeah decent eight but if you've heard this and I know a lot of people have because this did get voted up a lot of times on the moderator box which you should use from now on if you're going to suggest an album but if you've heard this LP what do you think about it do you like it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana the radio department clinging to a scheme forever you 
95i8EtUH7q8,you guys are cute some of you guys are real cuties okay okay all right all right villagers is the project of singer-songwriter Connor O'Brien and I've been conscious of this band for I want to say over a year now when Connor O'Brien back in 2009 actually emailed me telling me about a debut EP he released under the villagers name and even though the song seemed really heavily influenced by Bright Eyes and Elliott Smith the four songs on that thing were kind of a breath of fresh air the musicianship was something to admire and the vocal delivery really struck a chord with me without being overly dramatic plus the lyrics are certainly well read and on first listen I fell in love with the track off that release the meaning of the ritual so that was that I enjoyed it I blogged it I recommended it to some friends and after that I didn't know if anything would come of the project I just know I dug it at the time and it was pretty freakin good so a little while ago I was surprised when I saw the Domino Records pick villagers first full-length album oh yeah that made me kind of feel like my taste isn't totally garbage so what we have here on becoming a jackal is some acoustic guitar songs with a lot of raw emotion something where the lyrics pretty much take precedent over everything almost as if it's the type of music that is set to poetry not vice-versa and on these 44 minutes and 11 tracks the villagers display more drama than a theatrical tragedy battling themes revolving around love and loneliness and introspection Connor O'Brien does sing in the first person quite a bit he may not necessarily be singing about himself but still singing in the first person and whether he's pointing the mirror at himself or some kind of character he's coming up with the image isn't all that pretty like on the tracks the pact or becoming a jackal there's not a lot of self-loathing there's not a lot of self-hate it's more like acknowledging one's problems but not really making the effort to fix them I would offer my help but I'm not a licensed professional if there's one strength I have to pull out of this LP its most definitely variation we have a rotating cast of instruments just sort of taking turns being at the lead of the instrumentation in a given track electric guitar acoustic guitar we have piano we have string arrangements we have horns a sea of horns in fact on the rework of meaning of the ritual soft percussion heavy percussion there's just a lot going on with this album and there's one release that I couldn't help but think about for a majority of this album and that's the bright eyes LP lifted yeah this thing really reminded me of lifted if you're into that album if you're into that album I highly recommend that you check this thing out because it has a lot of the same strengths as that released but also in my opinion it suffers a lot of the same faults - for example for me on becoming a jackal there are a lot of points where the production the instrumentation feels so separated from the vocals that it's almost as if Connor O'Brien is just playing karaoke over his own songs hollow kind is bounds just bounds more natural without a doubt however this is no relief still has a lot to admire as a full-length debut O'Brien really has translated his songwriting and song structuring talents to record and he's produced a lot of standout moments - I'm in love with about half of these tracks and it's for the same reasons that I'm down with projects like the mountain goats Smaug Simon Joyner and silver Jews just sweet melodies poetic lyrics and the front men are borderline mental cases but there are a few lows on this LP for me despite the fantastic production great songwriting and great sounds for example the whole karaoke thing I'm also some songs really just end abruptly which just offends the hell out of me especially on the precipice of the climax on the meaning of the ritual with all the horns and all the strings just swelling and then it just conks out that just feels like a cop-out to me makes me want to shoot myself also some other abrupt endings on this LP to kind of make me feel like yeah that's that's conceptual but does it sound nice is it enjoyable no not really and to be completely honest this thing does drown in its influences quite a bit and I'm kind of feeling a I'm feeling I'm feeling a strong six on it yeah strong six yeah it's pretty much where I am with this LP so loves some likes and a few paints but if you're looking for some strong songwriting with dark tortured poetic lyrics stuff that's just gonna break your heart this is where you want to be and if you've heard this album let me know what you think of it do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana villager's becoming a jackal forever 
vFozdNxwJZM,hi my needle drops Anthony Fantino Internet's busiest music nerd here gonna do an album review foals total life forever foals are a UK outfit who produce some really well groomed dance rock tunes that are really easy on the ears very smooth studio production some very pretty guitar effects warm bass snappy drums and some very tight math rock musicianship something that I think fans of errors or even block party could appreciate maybe even to a lesser extent fans of battles and this is their sophomore LP and on this release the band really turns up the more accessible side of their music emphasizing the grooves and the passionate vocals that were even there on the band's debut full-length antidotes but that's not the only change one thing on this LP does kind of suffer at the hand of the other because the math rock elements the eccentricities the daring nature of Foles music has clearly been turned down this thing is really shooting for a wider audience because fulls has traded their old sound in for a more straightforward one the direction of this LP is a quieter one - a really chill atmosphere pervades almost every song on this album and though it does have its loud moments it has its hooks it has its thrills it never really gets dangerously loud or cacophonous the smooth softness especially on the song Spanish Sahara reminds me of like a medical room just a lot of sanitary instruments everything is white everything is futuristic its soft yet dramatic it's very relaxed but yet it's clear that Falls are very passionate about what they're doing on this release somewhat it reminds me of what Radiohead did on their last album there are moments where it's bleak and yet the colors the sounds are so lush or so pure for me the most upbeat track on the album is this Orient I love the tight intricate layers of that song it's very colorful really a treat throughout all these tracks however I'm having a hard time enjoying this release outside of its singles for me this new foals release is just way too complacent in its laid-back atmosphere to get any excitement or interest out of me however I could see some of these songs really hitting the spot on a slow quiet gray rainy day I love how clean and cut the musicianship is I love how concise the song structures are it's just a very very orchestrated very intensive there is some assurance to how calculated the music sounds however most of the time I just kind of find myself sitting here just waiting for this album to take a chance just do something out of the ordinary just do something that's just gonna catch me off guard but to be completely honest for me that moment just never really comes I could see other people liking this album a lot more and if you are liking it amen to you this thing is just not really my cup of tea my boat of fish my hat of rabbits my bag of candy my car of clowns score but that's just my personal opinion on the thing but if you have not heard this album if you're looking for something that is on the straight and narrow something that's danceable but not in-your-face this thing will not weird you out and there's a lot of impressive musicianship on it too if that's what you want then your ears should be here but let me know what you think of this animal love it hate it and wine anthony Fantana folds total life forever forever you you 
cUXCNgJSmzU,yo my needle drops Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review for you the drums self-titled before I get started I want to tell you guys that if you click the link up there see that link says the needle drop has my name up there if you click on that it'll bring you to my main channel page if you scroll down on there there are an entire there is an entire list of different music reviewers on YouTube check those guys out if you like what they do give them a sub and if you sub tell them the needle drop Sencha and that's it music reviewer community alright the drums are a New York outfit and I've been listening to so much New York music that my ears are going to rot off but no saint that bad these guys have been building a lot of buzz since 2009 on really thin jangly drum machine pop with very reverb Laden vocals in 2009 they released the summertime EP and that thing had songs like let's go surfin spreading across the music blogosphere like the herp and I wasn't the biggest fan of that ep to be quite honest didn't really see what the buzz was about behind the whole thing though I did like a few tracks off of it and because I wasn't totally in love with that thing I was kind of surprised to find it tracks from that EP made the cut on to the new album thankfully there were songs off the EP that I liked and they do sound slightly remixed in some cases on this new album and what can you expect if you listen to this thing well for one simplicity some of these tracks are so stripped down so skeletal so bare-bones that they make wires pink flag look like an orchestra suite there's a real lack of warmth and low-end throughout this entire album and it's no wonder no bass guitar also the drum machine sounds so tinny it puts the word tin into tinnitus I'm awful I'm awful however that sonic hollowness is more than made up for with strong as hell hooks they give these songs a real first listen memorability with lots of pretty melodies and steady beats that are really worth swaying your shoulders to plus I'm really no stranger to the type of sound that you're going to find on this LP it's nothing that hasn't been done before by groups like the Smiths Joy Division or even new order when they were making stuff around the time of low life also the Cure also surf rock a little bit I guess my gripes about the album the double guitar the drums and the vocal combination don't exactly add up to a lot of variation there's quite a bit of sonic sameness on this album however I'd say the hooks are good enough to be able to pull one song apart from the other but still if you're looking for a significant change past the one or two tracks that you may have already heard from this album yeah that's not going to happen also I can see this turning other people off so I'm going to warn you however it really didn't bug me didn't bug me at all but there is an extremely persistent whine enos on the vocals of this album a lot of just cracked vocals some flat notes and just really some however I really find the emotion that Jonathan Pierce frontman Jonathan Pierce brings to these songs really just captivating really just makes you know the flat notes all that other stuff for me just kind of irrelevant if you're kind of a vocal purist if you really like your vocals on key you like them concise this may not be the release for you but if you're looking for something that is more emotional than it is on key something bright light and summery something that's going to make new order Joy Division and the Smiths fans warm where it counts painfully emotional and about as straightforward as a punch to the face it's extreme pop simplicity it's the drums self-titled full-length you should really be putting your ears on that score but that's pretty much just how I'm feeling let me know what you guys think of this do you love this thing do you hate it and why and also favorite this video and make YouTube a better place Anthony Fantana the drums forever 
qS84qVZz27Q,it's track review no my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd right now looking for my sanity sheet the sheet that I need for my sanity and this is track reviews where we talked about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music before we do that we are going to do album of the week usually the albums of the week are a bit older a bit more experienced but still the new woods album is pretty good a Nicole 8 and you know I really just want to show you guys that I do buy the news and today on track reviews we're going to review Black Mountain I drew some Black Mountains here in honor of that there's a Sun there's some trees Birds and there's me giving the Black Mountains a ten out of ten because they're mountains picture of the LP that this track comes from the latest Black Mountain LP the forthcoming Black Mountain LP wilderness heart due out September 14th on jag jag you are now these guys are a band from Canada with psychedelic classic and progressive rock tendencies this LP will be the follow-up to their second album in the future and I'm going to show you a picture I had Black Mountain in the future if you're into the old school you've got to get your ears on this it's a beautiful double gatefold LP flop heck is a double gatefold alright we're gonna give a listen to the first track to come out from this new Black Mountain LP it's called old fangs look in the D box for a link to listen here we go all right that song four minutes long and I was just really worried right from the beginning of it right from the very beginning of it just the very plain drumming the chugging chords and just that that guitar distortion tone it just reminded me of something that I would hear on modern commercial rock radio coming home from my dead-end nine-to-five cubical job every weekday to a home full of like five kids and a wife who hates me but still like I would usually come to expect from Black Mountain there were some really great synthesizers in the track very great organ and the tone of the sense and the reverb on them kind of reminded me of something out here from Vangelis or open pronouncing this correctly jean-michel Jarre another thing I can't really knock about the track is the female vocals in Black Mountain they're always there and they're always top-notch but to go back to the downsides I just felt like this track was not equally as ambitious as any song on Black Mountains previous album even that shorty wild wind I appreciate that this band doesn't want to do the same thing the second time around and I'm not all that worried about this new album despite this track because I know if black mountains two previous releases are any proof of anything is that the band really loves to throw a lot of variation into their releases so not every track is going to sound like this if you're not digging it if you aren't by all means awesome I tugged the choruses I dug the bridge I love the passion in the vocals but the verses on this track just were not doing it for me just wait to rock with a W score but what do you guys think of this track do you love it do you hate it and why and are you looking forward to this new Black Mountain LP picture of it again let me know Anthony Fantana Black Mountain will it's hard forever 
A38cOUWdK9k,"suckers wild hello my needle drops I'm just I'm just really just laughing laughing laughs anyway before I get into this review I want to say thank you for bringing me past five hundred subah dubba dubba I'm already past 50 100 wait 50 500 5000 and that tells me that I must be doing something correct if that many people are willing to subscribe to me I must be doing something right something here is going right I don't know what but something happening is right gonna keep doing what I'm doing best album review suckers wild smile these guys are a Brooklyn quartet and this is their debut full-length with a creepy-ass baboon on the front now my first introduction to this band was a little EP that just blew me away on first listen with just several tracks on it but they were really good several tracks including songs that I'm sure you guys can find out about online beach queen and it gets your body moving and I caught sounds on that EP that were reminding me of talking heads Modest Mouse some post-punk stuff and a little bit of post-rock too I mean ya suckers were on that release incorporating a lot of different sounds a lot of different ideas but they were also well-placed which is hard to find so because of that I'm excited to hear these guys do it full length style and hear them really explore their strangeness explore their pop sensibilities to their limit elevator up and i gotta say the band has brought the best elements of that EP to this full-length ambitious song structures really shimmering production giant sing-along choruses and some pretty off-kilter lyrics to make this thing really fun as well as engaging intellectually and you can really tell in terms of the huge booming sounds on some of these tracks that the producer and the band really wanted this release to be huge I mean at some points this is about as arena rock as indie rock gets and of course there are a range of styles touch down upon with this new album the first track save your love for me sounds like in 80s rock ballad really something that you'd whip your lighter out for crossbred with somewhat of an oldies tune something Bobby V or Ricky Nelson might sing so if you love fold me really great opener with that one there are some great oriental guitar leads and some fantastic just attention-grabbing falsetto vocals on the song before your birthday ends kind of creepy very catchy all over awesome I think my major gripes are that I wish some of the hooks were a little bit stronger but really that's the least of my complaints because in fact my least favorite track on this entire LP is the most straightforward one which is black sheep that song is just really loud and not all that dynamic and just doesn't interest me all that much it just kind of crashes and bashes wham bam thank you ma'am just heads out the dough I love hearing the drawn-out dynamics all the passion all the sweat that really comes out of the longer tracks on this album I just don't know if simplicity is the correct route for suckers because I hear so much more potential so much more beauty when they're really taking their time introducing instruments slowly getting loud getting soft really experimenting with composition and I'm not exactly sure if any of the songs on this new LP really Trump any of the tracks that suckers came out with on their debut EP especially it gets your body moving and does the band feel the same way I don't know but they sure didn't think twice about taking the same version of it gets your body moving on the EP and reprinting it on the LP the same version the same way the same thing it's the same thing we've heard it's still an acceptable follow-up it has its standout moments and it does go just a little bit farther to really define the sucker sound and so far it's sounding good though i'm not completely in love with this album i am impressed by the fact that suckers truly are hammering out a definitive sound for themselves something distinctive that you can really identify from other bands the phone don't call me so if you're looking for a rock album strong pop sensibilities very eccentric and yet very catchy it's colorful it's heavy it's loaded with beads that just make you want to crank this thing in the car it's an ambitious release that really builds and shows a lot of dynamics though the hooks may not be hitting you over the head and making this thing catchy right off the bat it is kind of a grower if you guys have heard this LP what do you think love it hate it and why Anthony Fantana thanks for bringing me past 5,000 sub a dubs forever you "
S4HW7jmRXeE,without write a song I dr. Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti before today hahahahahahahahahaha it's time for it to help them review my needle drops let's get right into it Ariel pink is a California rock and roll musician who not gonna lie is a little difficult to describe and why well for one the guy has really spent most of his musical career deep deep deep into the underground since the 90s releasing tons and tons of songs tons and tons of albums on cassette CDR basically anything he could get the stuff on at the time and stylistically he's all over the map people labeling him as a noise musician as an avant-garde musician psychedelic musician New Wave punk some people I've read even call him chill wave which makes me want to put a bullet in my head haha if you can depend on any kind of consistency from the guy it's that his music most likely will have some kind of anachronistic quality to it it will most likely sound as if it was recorded much earlier much much earlier than it actually was I mean decades ago guys and that's why I imagine this new Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti album is titled before today I don't know and I kind of see this album as Ariel Pink's official coming-out party really rising out of obscurity in the independent music scene and landing a release on one of the biggest independent labels out there for a D this LP covers a lot of the rock and pop styles that Ariel pink has done best over his career it sounds a lot cleaner than his earlier recordings plus it revisits a lot of the best songs in the Ariel pink canon making them a lot more accessible while maintaining that vintage aesthetic that complements this band so well chances are if you've been following Ariel Pink's since he got signed to the Animal Collective label Pond tracks you've already heard songs like revolutions Ally Beverley kills little wig and one of my favorite tracks to out of the band can't hear my eyes and I'm not an aerial pink expert I don't claim to be but even if you are it's kind of difficult to tell what songs on this album are new and which ones are old because who knows how long Ariel Pink's really been sitting on some of these tracks and some of these ideas and has simply just reworked them for this album and what can you expect from before today if you put it on your ears well you can hear that vintage recording style though it is to a lesser extent than his previous releases I mean if you guys have heard songs like are you going to look after my boys the sound of those recordings really reminds me of like a cassette tape covered in filth just soaked in urine and thrown into a microwave for 5 minutes for good measure before you place it into the tape player and most of the music sounds like a lost relic from the late 70s or early 80s showing some influences here and there from 60s garage rock like on the track Lestat or on the rock and ramrods cover bright lit blue skies you've got some really mutant disco pop on round and round and some really off kilter New Wave music - on the song Beverly kills very distorted loud psychedelic on the song but house burn though there are a lot of old aesthetics to this music it couldn't have possibly been made in any other time but today because this music though does have a really nostalgic quality to it it's clearly made with the knowledge of all these musical movements having already passed by because a lot of these songs don't really stick to one influence don't really stick to one idea it feels like three genres mixing at once things and ideas that I don't think normally would have been put together into one song at the time I mean some songs to me feel like a forced collaboration between Michael Jackson our Stevie Moore the Thompson Twins and Frank Zappa I guess my one problem with this LP though it certainly is good is that I'm familiar with more songs on here than I would actually like to be and that's because so many songs on this LP really are remakes and I do find myself in several cases liking the older versions more than the newer versions like on revolutions a lie or even on can't hear my eyes but that's really because on this LP I don't see aerial pink reinventing himself or breaking any new ground for himself but simply working to make his sound accessible to a wider audience and there you go the songs are still good they're just a little bit more sanitary a little bit cleaner I'm feeling a light aid on this LP but if you have heard it what do you think about it love it hate it and why and Ariel pink mantra feeding you you 
Wj_P3CQUXZE,hey my needle drops it is nasty and hot and humid that I am miserable right now but I've got to do an album review of the new here we go magic LP pigeons before I get into it I want to say that the site the needle drop calm is now back up Thank You Go Daddy you're cool and yeah go check that out when you get a chance the template isn't up on there as of right now but it'll be up there very soon you know as soon as the weekend's over I have some time on my hands here we go magic as a Brooklyn outfit with a new sophomore album and a new sound to the band's self-titled debut was the solo effort of their frontman Luke temple one of those one guy one for track machine jobs with a very hazy psychedelic minimalist approach to sound and structure some pretty catchy tracks came out of the project to like tunnel vision and fan gala BAM links right there give them a listen of course because of those tracks and the self-titled debut some buzz picked up behind the project and here we go magic expanded into a five-member band and this new LP is the result earlier this year the band dropped a single from the LP before it's released collector and for me that song was a really exciting change in direction for this band just because it sounded just like something that could have come out of the kraut rock movement one band that I want to recommend out of that movement the group noise and if there are some sounds that you can most definitely expect from this genre of music it's very tight very straightforward drumming some reserved guitars spacey synthesizers very linear repetitive song structures with an emphasis on building the kind of music that you can really really get lost in but of course here we go magic doesn't really exercise this type of music without putting their own spin on it there are a lot of very colorful vocal harmonies throughout this LP and also a very contemporary studio clarity to the whole thing I know a lot of people who are watching this video may not be from earlier with krautrock may not have a palette for krautrock so the sounds on this LP may be very new to you but because I'm kind of used to this stuff because I enjoy this stuff quite a bit this is a very vintage vintage sounding LP for me plus it's really really really obvious that this thing was recorded to tape which only adds to the old-school sound of it the drums are very soft and fluffy and dampened the guitars aren't very sharp at all the synthesizers and the bass guitar of course are very warm and resonant and humming there's a lot of variety and consistency on this LP to consistency because the whole thing really sticks to the minimalist synth-heavy sound throughout the entire album no real left hooks when it comes to that kind of stuff but variety because there's a ton a ton of great emotion on this album old world united is this really snappy chaotic catchy piece of post-punk while another song he is this really soft gentle atmospheric song that builds into nothing short of a psychedelic freak out my one problem is that there is a real real pocket full of tracks on this thing that just kind of meander for me put a few potholes in the road either songs that maybe just take a little too long to say what they're supposed to say or tracks especially the two at the end that kind of really don't do anything but just display an idea and then quickly duck out before you actually realize that you're not really getting a track but more of a motif or a simple rough drawing of an idea I didn't mean a track on here that I hate it for sure however don't expect the electrifying feel of songs like collector old-world United even land of feeling to last throughout the entire album that's really my only critique of it some tracks really just kind of pale in comparison to others I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this album it is an okay album it's kind of good they're just a few moments on here that I didn't really care for that I could kind of but aside from that I think this really is a step up from their last LP in a really interesting direction I love the sound that these guys are pursuing and I really love that they're bringing back a genre of music putting their own spin on it and giving it a lot of sincerity too so if you're looking for some minimalist rock with a strong pop sensibility you're looking for something that is just so in the moment warm tape sound kind of a vintage aesthetic something that is really synthesizer heavy sometimes sober sometimes psychedelic something that really tips its hat to krautrock this is where you want to be here we go magic pigeons Anthony Fantana here we go 
02BToM5GZ_Y,draw my needles I have quite a busy week question it's for me wondering wondering I got a face off McLean doesn't music make a drug or does the drug make a music if you do music do you make better drugs know that we know that there are people who do lots of music but don't make good drugs and there are people who do drugs but don't make music drugs and according to this graph we know that there is no truth to what the drugs can do to music so what do you do with music when drugs are in your ears 
7Hq8WgQ-6Gs,yo the needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd got to do a little album review here but before I do that I want to tell you guys that the new villagers LP becoming a jackal is now streaming at NPR music link down there in the d'box listen to the whole thing it's going to get reviewed on the channel fo sho ok sleepy Sun fever this is the sophomore album from this California sex Tet and a little bit of backstory in 2008 these guys dropped the LP embrace and that album to me just bled just bled potential but lacked the power adequate to blow my jaw clear off of my face an advanced combination of psychedelia progressive rock blues and folk really caught my attention but something was just missing and now it's 2010 this is fever and the band has improved one the recording quality is way better the effects are clear as a bell and there's a ton of variation on there too just loading a plethora of color onto this LP the guitar distortion is rougher than a trucker stubble and when this thing gets loud it gets ah I love hearing a band who values soft ethereal acoustic sounds as much as they value loud abusive sounds someone's calling me I'm filming a video review right now plus something that is totally awesome for me there are a few really badass harmonica solos on this LP that you really need to put on your ears two more memorable songs just melodies and sonic textures that when I heard them for the first time on this album they just blew up in my brain and burn themselves onto the back of my skull great solos ambitious builds and the feel of this record is really just sticking with me it embodies the idea of progressive rock without bordering into sheer guitar wanker e3 it calls back to an earlier era of rock music without sounding overly no stahl Jack or dated four but better album cover I don't know on my first real hard listen to this album it just had me thinking of my first experiences with Pink Floyd Black Sabbath king crimson black mountain and not to say that sleepy Sun sounds like these bands they really don't but like those bands sleepy Sun has a very equal mix of visceral and intellectual elements in their music it just felt like a really refreshing rock experience that's really what I'm connecting this to all of those LPS and this one just felt like a refreshing experience with rock and roll yes it's not too simple yes it's not too technical yes it's not too pretty yes it's not too rough it's just the yin and the yang of all these different elements combined just a great balance and when these guys embark on a long song it really feels like a journey but one of my major issues with the LP is that the shorter tracks especially the acoustic ones with a really dry mix feel so much less mystical than the longer tracks with more effects and more dynamics and more volume still the softer and shorter songs do play a very good counterpoint role throughout this LP my one other issue with is that the vocals from time to time felt a little too sedate a little too sleepy but these guys are sleepy sun i don't know maybe that's more of a personal thing i'm not saying the vocals were performed badly maybe just in need of a more of a kick from time to time a lot of songs on this thing wowed me there were a few that we're just all right and it did me enter in just a couple places just a couple but despite all that it's a great follow-up to their debut album and this thing gets a high recommendation from me to anybody who is a fan of the bands that i mentioned earlier in this review or if you're someone who's looking for some heavy heavy rock music with a very psychedelic and progressive edge to it if that's what you're looking for then this is where you want to be because this is really something that you could throw on a pair of huge speakers and just blast it and just let the sound take over you while the soft gentle or tracks kind of come in between those latter moments and just provide a little bit of Solace a little bit of serenity I'm going to give this a strong 72 a light eight I'm really friggin digging on it I love the sounds I love the feel I love the aura of this album give it a listen links down to hear some of it in the d'box and let me know what you think Anthony Fantana sleepy Sun fever 
pzsUK9Iq4DU,hi my needle drops Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and wearing the earth shirt today because I thought it was appropriate to do a review of the new Melvin's album the bride screamed murder before I get too deep into this review I just want to say the Chicago hip-hop outfit the cool kids actually have a new mixtape out you can download it for free there's a link in the d box check it out alright The Melvins are one of the most significant rock bands of all time influencing countless artists from Boris to tool to Mastodon and playing a huge part in defining what we now know today as sludge metal I'm gonna spare you the minor details and the origin stories and all that crap and simply say that if you're not into the Melvin's you could pretty much grab anything that they put out from the late 80s to the mid 90s it's like shooting fish in a barrel it's when the band put out their most career-defining work really their best stuff and then the entire scheme of things this album is Melvin's 20th yeah 2-0 and it's really got some classic Melvin sounds on it some dime stop riffs really rough guitar distortion plus they carry on a lot of tricks that they were really pushing on albums like nude with boots like doubling up on the vocals and making them sound really huge really experimenting with vocal harmonies humbling drums delivered by not one but two drummers and concentrating on making their songs feel a little weird or a little stranger more complex instead of submitting to the specific simplicity's of sludge metal and there's some pretty psychedelic moments on this album too the heavy heavy fuzz on I'll finish you off really reminds me of how badass this band was in their prime or I guess since they're still kind of bad at anyway the heavy fuzz the strange vocals on that track too which sort of took me by surprise really made it feel like a very surreal experience throughout these nine tracks there are several moments where I found myself sitting there just thinking wow these guys could seriously still pen a tune they could still pump out a memorable riff it's just nice to know that after years and years of The Melvins just punishing our auditory senses that they could still put a good dent in the old eardrum the one thing I didn't really enjoy about the album is that there was a real pervasive ridiculousness on a lot of the tracks especially on these really noisy transitional moments at the end of some of the songs where you hear some squelching horns some really weird keyboard or some freaky vocals it just makes me think The Melvins are trying to get away from their old sound trying to redefine themselves as a band they don't really want to do the same thing over and over and over but instead of innovating instead of just pursuing a new altogether different sound they're just trying to use absurdity to kind of drift themselves away from their older style and it's not exactly functioning that well for me there are some moments where this absurdity kind of drifts into some of the tracks on the LP for example the first song the water glass just starts off with really pummeling drums really heavy riffs really got me excited but then it kind of broke into this militaristic Colin respond routine that really was not working for me at all but I think the most tongue-in-cheek moment of the entire album is yes there's a cover on this LP of the who's my generation the vocals are really weird the song is done in a really sludgy fashion and it just feels a little like novelty it just feels like a little bit like kind of a joke as a whole to tell you the truth I'm kind of indifferent on this album and I'm feeling a decent 5 on it it's not awful however I'm not really loving it all that much and before you go crying and crying your eyes out don't know he gave it a 5 just you know come on come on we know The Melvins are great we know that their power is undeniable however they have put out way way way way way better stuff in their career don't lie to yourselves you and I both know this also they've been a lot more consistent on their albums too but the Melvin's are still to be worshipped and respected and if you're into heavy music if you're into heavy metal if you're into loud rock and you're not listening to the Melvin's you're seriously seriously missing out because these guys should be an essential part of any musical diet so if you're looking for something strange loud distorted an album that does not stay in one spot or something that is going to allow you to explore the psyche of sludge then by all means give this a listen and it also looks like yeah yeah there are a few Melvin's fans watching I see you what do you think of this do you love it do you hate it and why and also favorite tracks all right Anthony Fantana The Melvins the bride screaming murder forever 
t70fklNoFBI,tame impala inner speaker hey my needle drops Anthony Fantino here internets busiest music nerd going to do an album review of the tame impala album inner speaker over the past weekend I got a ton of requests for this LP so why not give it a listen these guys are recycled ellic rock outfit from Australia and yes I did say psychedelic rock however we both know that there are about 1 million different ways to do psychedelic rock so to be more specific let's say that fans of the earlier more authentic side of the genre are who this band will be pleasing the most fans of groups like the birds the seeds the doors also not to mention the frontman of this band Kevin Parker has a vocal delivery that is uncannily similar to John Lennon's way too similar for it to be completely unintentional and I've got to say I'm going to make a huge recommendation of this album to fans of the new MGMT record congratulations the tame impala record is not as polished however both of those albums bring in some of those same studio tricks that old-time lucid rock production but give it a more updated more contemporary sound there are some moments on this LP that feel really anachronistic because you're hearing this old rock style and these old rock sounds too pushed up against these things that you would only hear today like the breakbeat drums on the track alter-ego the really crisp clean studio quality a few of the synthesizer tones and a few breathtaking effects too however much of this album really does stick to the old school sound basing a lot of its mind-altering dreamy moments on fuzzy strange guitar distortion a lot of reverb a lot of layers of improvised soloing and these really Spacey atmospheric drawn-out guitar jams that seem like at times they just go on forever when the band breaks away from the song structure and starts soloing and starts just playing off another they really get into it they really get explorative and I seriously mean that this thing isn't really all that interested in sticking to a pop structure the band isn't really all that interested in editing themselves the songs aren't like thirty minutes but still when the band starts jamming it would take nothing short of the rapture to actually stop them that or the song fading out and the fact that the band can really improvise with this style of music shows how well-versed they are in it tame impala does speak that era of 60s rock that psychedelic rock but they also speak different dialects of this stuff - you're going to catch different flavors throughout these songs different influences from garage rock to Paisley rock to brick top also there are a lot of blues rock riffs throughout some of these tracks too just all that and the guitar tones just make this a fantastic compilation of sounds from that era of rock but I do have one major gripe about this LP despite the fact that there is really great production on its side despite the fact that the band is very consistent on their delivery their songwriting they're playing throughout the entire album I can't help but feel like this release is kind of an exercise in nostalgia and nothing more from time to time and believe me guys I'm not shy when it comes to listening to artists who are reliving an old school sound kink on enshrines Sharon Jones & the dap-kings for example however I feel like team and Paula really does spend more time borrowing than they do pioneering or at least putting their own kind of spin on this music so if you're looking for something with that old-school trippy sound you want to relive the sixties psych era you want to hear John Lennon's vocals come back from the dead or if you're not very well-versed in psychedelic rock and you're kind of looking for a gateway drug into that sort of music I highly recommend this album this needs to be on your ears now this thing is definitely not going to be one of my favorites of the year however there were some standout tracks for me and I really do have to give these guys some big ups some big kudos for recreating the sound authentically and not making it sound like just simply a stick or a routine I'm feeling a light 7 most likely a strong six on this LP it really didn't blow me away it is no klp it was a good LP but you guys let me know what you think of this do you love it do you hate it and why and what about this LP blows you away specifically that's what I want to know anthony Fantana came in Paula and her speaker forever [Music] 
LEuxWZ_0zwc,LT Simpson OJ Simpson all right my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here gonna do an LP review of the new guilty Simpson album OJ Simpson but before I jump too far to that I just want to say quickly the website the needle drop com is currently down I'm in the middle of switching servers that's gonna happen very soon hopefully the website is up this coming week okay guilty Simpson's rapper with some Detroit roots who recently just a few years ago I want to say came out with his full-length debut ode to the ghetto and part of the reason guilty has as much underground rap cred as he does is he was championed by the late and great producer J Dilla and what makes his new LP so interesting to me is that it's produced by none other than mad lib right now 2010 mad libs in the middle of a project where he's literally releasing one new album a month of instrumentals and loops and beats all that kind of creating stuff that he does not just that but the guy has worked with Talib Kweli of course MF doom or doom on the project mad villain and he recently earned some production creds on the new strong arm steady album so with these two people working together you have Gugu Susan and madlib whose real initials are actually oj so you bring it together you've got a jason the first thing that really hit me is that this project for Mad live at least is somewhat of a callback to that mad villainy album a lot of different samples and styles and melodies are hidden within the beats there are not a lot of hooks here when guilty Simpson is rapping is just a lot of straight straight flows know sort of interruptions sort of bringing in some kind of catchy melody or something like that there are a lot of psychedelic effects a lot of studio trickery going on and also there are quite a few interlude sketches little comedic moments when Madlib is putting a beat together on this album he's doing it as well as he's ever done it what I really love about his style is that it doesn't sound really choppy or rigid or it doesn't really sound all that looped though it's clearly looped it really does have a flow to it it really does have movement to it as if the music you're hearing played in the background is being played in real-time doesn't sound like it's just being kind of woowoo now in terms of guilty Simpson I've heard ode to the ghetto I've heard some tracks here released before that but I'm not really an expert on his guest spots in a lot of places but still on this LP he pulls out some of the best rhymes I've ever heard him spit guilty just has some real gangster aggression here this is just some real tough guy rapping but it's not the type of hip-hop where the lyricist is just rapping about how much cooler he or she is than you or how much more money he or she has than you it's just some badass rapping from a guy who's clearly lived his life as a badass guilty can be pretty relentless with some of his rhymes but still there are some moments where he'll throw in a joke hear something really funny there kind of breaks the tension a little bit too he's got a really great flow throughout this entire LP and throughout these 24 tracks here mad lib and guilty really do produce some of their best work but that's only when the two of them are actually working I have one huge gigantic gripe about this LP it just has an extremely painful lack of balance this LP is titled after guilty Simpson but it doesn't really feel like a guilty Simpson album it feels like a mad lib album that guilty Simpson merely guests on a couple times I know when it comes to talking about rap albums and LPS in the hip-hop genre a lot of people will joke about you know how ridiculous some of the interludes are maybe how good the album would be without the interludes however half of these tracks half of the tracks literally half of the tracks are either intros preludes outros plus are interludes supposed to be short I mean I know that four minutes isn't the longest time in the world but a lot of the intro moods on this album are longer than the actual songs which is ridiculous interludes intros outros that can add a lot to an LP it could add context to a song they can tease towards something that's about to happen they can make something funny they can make something more serious they can give you an idea as to what you're going to hear or give you closure on what you just heard however with 12 tracks being of that ilk this LP really oversteps a boundary I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this there are some tracks on here that individually did make me think goddamn these guys have to do another LP I can't wait to listen to the next guilty Simpson album however this thing just detours way too much to feel like a complete album if you're a guilty Simpson fan if you're a mad lib fan mad villany fan whatever let me know what you thought of this love it hate it and why anthony Fantan Oh guilty Simpson Madlib OJ Simpson forever you

-l_acNr2uMo,ready that lp4 hey my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and yeah it's time for an album review rather that's lp4 rata that is ADC electronic music duo and this is clearly their fourth album and on the surface I really can't say this LP is that out of step with rather that's previous efforts you got around 40 minutes of music here a dozen tracks and all of them are pretty much instrumental all the sounds that we've come to know and come to love from these guys around this LP to the really dry very rigid percussion lush synthesizers undeniable grooves and plus a sound that has pretty much become a trademark of these guys some very tinny harmonized guitar soloing that just slithers all over the music just coiling itself around the beats and the melodies as if it's making the music its next meal and what makes LP for interesting is that it continues down the path that the duo set on LP 3 where they're experimenting with different musical styles and different genres I can tell you right now on this LP even after a first listen I hear elements of Hawaiian music Middle Eastern music hip-hop neoclassical music as well well the duo pretty much sticks to the electronic grind on this album but still each track has a certain spice that gives it a different flavor from the next the instrumentation to is really something that I could just pour over for days a lot of lot of beautiful beautiful you want to cry string arrangements around this album that don't sound flat at all of course horns are in the mix mandolin acoustic guitar of course the usual percussion bass drums and the synth tones that these guys come up with are something that I couldn't even begin to describe they're like the Willy Wonka's of sound there are just so many sweet Sonic's just all in one place and I think it's really great that the sound set has has widened for a dad I mean we all love and know that tinnie harmonized guitar solos sound but because they have more at their disposal in terms of things that they can write songs with they don't rely on that all the time it's much more of a balanced sound that guitar currently gets it's fair amount of play but it's nice to hear rather than experimenting with other instrumentation the structures get a little bit more ambitious too rather that really isn't afraid to slow things down and take their time with a lot of these tracks favoring building and a lot of variation - I've enjoyed my share of songs off of classics or LP one but the amount of shifts each song goes through on LP pd4 mix rather that's earlier work seem just a little bit monotonous plus the production quality is just a lot better - I mean this album is just twelve nails into the coffin of radda that's older slightly rar sound there is a level of predictability on LP four even if you've only heard one rat-a-tat album or just several of their songs and I think a lot of critics are gonna dislike that predictability a lot of music fans are gonna dislike that predictability and rightly so to an extent we're obviously going to favor those earlier albums simply because that's when the sound the Ratatat sound first hit us and it was like wow and now we're sort of just listening to the duo two different variations of that same style but you know I don't know if I really need Ratatat to change the world for me to be quite honest I just want some sick-ass tracks that are gonna make my booty shake and that's what this does I feel like the tracks are fantastic if you're gonna go back and compare to their earlier stuff and be like yeah well you know it's not all that significant of a change I suppose you could make that argument I have to agree with you I'm not saying you people are wrong however that's not really affecting how much I'm enjoying this album for some reason I don't know but if you've heard this LP let me know what you think about it do you love it do you hate it and why and what do you think about the Ratatat sound Anthony Fantana ranted at LP for forever 
fAEAaIqEuVI,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd thank you thank you and album of the week Fugazi's steady diet of nothing okay this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic experimental music and whether or not it's good and before we get too deep into this track review I want to say picture of the new single from MF DOOM and Madlib aka mad villain that single you can find a link to download it on the needle drop dot-com new bad villain track give it a listen BAM Lincoln the D box alright guys we're gonna talk about the new single from Arcade Fire of course it's been floating around the internet picture of the band's new album the banjo guest release details of the release of this LP today it's going to be out August 3rd on merge records for the people in the United States of America for the people in the United States of America of course the European release will be date earlier because you guys are a lot cooler than us the two tracks are the month of May and the suburbs there's a link down there in that D box to listen to both of those songs here we go ok alright ok let's talk about that just a little bit hold on my headphones first month of May damn pulsating driving energetic sweaty gutsy testosterone distorted just yeah and the drums had a really particular sound especially the snare drum it sounded like puffy puffy it just had this sharp snap to it and yet it felt a little cushion - just a really sweet sound on the drums nice reverb on the vocals great guitars very fuzzy bass guitar Arcade Fire's really looking to kick ass and take names on this track this thing is just a bloody bloody song it's blood soaked its blood blood blood tore the end of the track you had some cool noises some feedback or some synth something really high-pitched kind of floating around in the background just making you know some sharp tones back there but also kind of serving us some kind of solo some kind of bridge some kind of extra color I don't know but I liked it now this wasn't the most definitive track though the style of music has been played time and time and time again kind of a glam rock sound with a blues influence you could really hear the arena in this track it's just a pop rock that's really fun and rough and rowdy to me I enjoyed it quite a bit however if you're looking for that emotional depth that you know of course you've heard on albums like funeral if you're looking for that kind of emotional depth something that's gonna just come inside and just tear you apart this is not that kind of song this really doesn't have that emotional weight to it this is a much more upbeat in your face kind of moment here for Arcade Fire I'm feeling a decent seven on that track then we had the suburbs the title track to this new album had some pleasant piano and a really nice swing to the rhythm section really kind of got me into the movement of the song just kind of going back and forth on that one very lusty lusty foot above locals on this track and it just builds very nicely into some strings that just caramelize the music just make it so sweet so tender so nice and the music the ambience of this song kind of reminds me of a saloon maybe it's just the plinking piano but there's something really quaint about this track but the songwriting the melody of this particular work I can kind of take or leave I feel like I've heard this track at least a dozen times before done in a dozen different ways by a dozen different bands to be completely honest however as I kind of dove into the lyrics a little bit I found myself enjoying the song more just because the way they were written the way they were performed there was just a lot of heartfelt emotion right there that I was able to appreciate talking about wanting a daughter wanting a son growing up not wanting them to suffer but this track like the last one but more so was lacking in something kind of distinct for me something that when I hear it whether it's the emotion or whether it's the sound I say AHA that's Arcade Fire damn and they're good this track just doesn't have the passion and the excitement that got me into Arcade Fire in the first place dear I dare say it I dare say it but this last one especially just felt a little bit anonymous I mean I I don't think I would have known it was Arcade Fire unless I was told so I do think this last one is suffering from a little bit of ambiguity just a little bit of ambiguity and because of that I'm feeling a light too decent six on the suburbs but like I said again this new LP is gonna drop in August merge records give a listen to both of these songs links in the D box tell me what you think of them which song do you like more than the other end do you like either of them and why and are you excited for this new LP hmm let me know the needle drop Anthony Fantana Arcade Fire the suburbs forever 
OElyc_yZU54,let's get hideout boy zester portal look sorry my needle drops Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd haven't done a metal review in a while gotta do a metal review guys zas Thurs portal of sorrow zoster is a one-man Californian black metal project whose eight albums tall but his releases go into the dozens when you count demos and splits and EPS and all that other jazz and portal of sorrow is alleged to be the last album from the zas thor project because malefic or scott conner rather is closing the doors on it for good but there are rumors around the internet and on zas Thurs website of other projects coming down the pipe now Jaster over the course of his career has proven to be just as harsh as any other black metal artist out there the LP subliminal genocide comes to mind but there's always been a very prevalent atmospheric some would say ambient style to his music stuff that is really looking to kind of alter your mood as opposed to rock your face off stuff that's a lot like Burzum or wolves in the throne room leviathan not these more straightforward black metal sounds that we're hearing from new records by bands like Gorgoroth or Arcanum and the ambient feels really out in full force on portal of sorrow I can really see why the guys in Sun have given this project so much kudos that have collaborated with Scott Connor in the past despite the very low 5 airy home recorded approach that zas Thor takes on this record which isn't a surprise in light of his other records he comes up with some really interesting sounds like the humming really distorted guitars on this abyss holds the mirror there are also some very beautiful female vocals provided by Marissa Naylor and Connor's vocals are just really wretched and harsh but they have this really surreal awkward at times blurriness haziness to them kind of as if they're buried underground my only real complaint on the our record is the drums and some of the drumming the mixing on the drums kind of makes them feel out of place in relation to all the other instruments in a given song and plus there are some moments where the drums are just played pretty badly I'm surprised Scott Conner didn't do a couple second takes one of the worst drum flubs on the entire LP is right where it shouldn't be at the very beginning of the album it was possibly one of the worst LP starts I've ever heard and it really made me question the kind of music or at least the kind of playing that I was going to be in for for the duration of this LP and there are a lot of moments like that for me some of the bass is a little clumsy some of the keyboard playing here and there is behind tempo I know black metal isn't about virtuosity however is it about not caring not even a little bit just not even giving us however I found the LP actually got better as I trudged through it the songs to me we're actually getting more entertaining and I was feeling a lot of the Bleak desperate emotions that zas there injects into this music I suppose a few gripes about this LP that are not just mine that I feel like a lot of people are going to have the keyboards do sound a little bit cheesy especially the synthesized horns and the synthesized strings they didn't really bother me I thought the sounds were okay plus I'm kind of used to that sound from listening to black metal didn't really disappoint but I can see the keyboards getting in the way of enjoyment for a lot of people I think my major gripe about this album is that a lot of the songs just kind of meander structurally they just kind of harp on one idea and just drag it out and drag it out thankfully zas they're kind of ends each track before a given idea gets so boring that you don't want to hear it anymore however it's kind of hard to take one song out of this entire LP and say ah this is self-contained this is a good track that I can show you here's a great Jaster track that's not really how this album and how most of zas their albums work each track kind of feels like it's part of this bigger picture of this thing that really should be listened through in one sitting however there's not really any kind of rhyme or reason at least to me anyway as to how these songs link together or if they're linked together at all because they certainly don't fade into one another that's for sure though I enjoy the black metal sound and this LP certainly has that sound and 2009's all reflections drained I feel like this new LP is superior to that one in terms of color variation production clarity this new LP definitely has better sounds than that last one however structurally melodically and conceptually I still found this new album very very underwhelming very underwhelming I know there are some zas their fans subscribed to

portal of sorrow forever 
wwikVZU7CfA,I know I know I know you know my needle drop sometimes you just gotta stick to your guns until you find a weapon of mass destruction I just haven't found a weapon of mass destruction yet when I do I will use the weapon of mass destruction but as of right now I'm gonna alright guys we're gonna do an out review here the sophomore LP from tobacco maniac me so tobacco isn't something you just smoke guys it's also the solo project of black moths super rainbow frontman to bathroom and black moth super rainbow has a pretty distinct sound really crispy break be drums fuzzy synths damaging distortion heavy reverb and phaser fed vocoder vocals and there's a BS mr track that you should check out in 2007/2008 tobacco introduced us to his solo work with fucked up friends with a DVD release and the CD release and to be honest the line between these two projects is very gray very faded tough to tell where one starts and the other ends if they weren't labeled differently it would be difficult to tell what's a tobacco track and what's a black mouth super rainbow track especially because about 80 to 90% of the sounds that are in black mouth super rainbow releases show up on tobacco albums too but if I had to lay my hand on a clear concise difference between these two projects I'd say the tobacco sports a much much heavier hip-hop influence for sure especially on their latest LP black Mouth super rainbow sets their song structures in a much poppier much more accessible vein whereas this new tobacco is a lot more adventurous a lot more free-spirited slightly less immediate and a little bit noisier too this is the type of stuff that can really make your head spin if you let it lots of reverb on melodies that just swirl them into puddles of color and very very intentionally damaged production that brings a hundred different kinds of Lofa sounds into the mix but don't get me wrong some sounds on the self here lo-fi summer HiFi could be a melody could be a bead something's gonna sound torn but there's also going to be something that sounds part of the way decent to give this track some kind of dynamic no matter what direction sonically or melodically each song goes in at least there's a pretty phat beat anchoring things down and keeping things sensible a lot like on this track sweat mother these are basically some really creepy spooky danceable electronics that would make the perfect soundtrack to your next Halloween party or if you're the type of person that has costume parties in the summer invite me hopefully there are a lot of first-time listeners on this new tobacco album because BEC yes the great Beck actually lends his vocals on two tracks which is pretty nice but among these 16 tracks ya gets 16 bang for your buck among these 16 tracks there are some misses and some tracks are so short it's kind of hard to fall in love with them I was actually kind of surprised to find out that the Beck tracks were actually two of the shortest some tracks just kind of come off as rough ideas as opposed to finished products but tobacco doesn't really strike me as a project that puts an emphasis on sprucing things up and polishing things off if you're into the black Mouth super rainbow sound if you're into the tobacco sound this thing is going to hit you with some pretty considerable variation if you're outside of that box a lot of these tracks may come off sounding the same but I have to say a lot of different colors here I think this LP is a little bit more ambitious than fucked up friends has a lot of the same sounds but is a little less monotonous and maniac me hmm this LP it really speaks to my dance music bias I have a pretty strong dance music bias arguably tobacco is doing what he's always done but he's doing it better than ever and that's how I'm pretty much feeling on this LP I think my major gripe is that this thing is so sonically similar to that previous LP to black Mouth super rainbow its kind difficult to tell whether or not this thing is actually gonna leave a lasting impression on me or if it's just gonna kind of fall into the gray area with the other B SMR stuff the other tobacco stuff I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this LP if you're looking for a change from tobacco a significant change you're gonna be disappointed however he still put together an album that has funked the hell out of my dancing shoes also I want to make a note that this review is actually a three view I'm doing in collaboration with Sir all about music and jumbled junky music so head over to their channels if not now when you're watching this video later today they will have reviews of this same LP up cools cools Anthony Fanta no tobacco maniac meet forever 
DxDiyg9IMKU,hi my needle drips droops droplets Anthony Fantana your Internet's busiest music nerd going to do an album review but first before I do that I want to make a mention on the blog right now the needle drop calm we're going to do a mixtape battle on May 28th with radio another blog who we're in the midst of a pretty heated there's a there's a feud going on linked in the B box 528 we're gonna drop our mixtape they're gonna drop their mixtape listen to both of them hit us up on Twitter tell us which one you like more and that's pretty much it alright this LP is hippies from the band Harlem and these guys are a sloppy energetic garage rock trio from the good old state of Texas to be honest I've probably listened to a lot more garage rock than I've actually covered on this channel this year for example like the new let's wrestle record new record from eddy currents oppression ring the strange boys the OCS - there's also a new March Sultan album now yeah part of it is you know I'm really looking for something that's gonna rock my face off and those five LPS certainly do that but I want something that's gonna pull at my heartstrings a little bit - you know just speak to the inner inner Anthony the emotional Anthony as well but when this record opened and I listened to the first track I knew that I was in for something a little bit different someday soon you'll be on fire and you'll ask me for a glass of water I'll say no you can just let that burn and you'll say you know maybe that's not a very eloquent statement maybe not the most flowery language but it is heartfelt it's very heartfelt and that's what makes the cell pious stand out for me the messy the immediate garage rock appeal is most definitely there and that makes the music feel real and down to earth and all that other good jazz but there's also something funny or sad or clever to relate to in the lyrics and the hooks also and I dig the production on this album - of course it's not immaculate the guitars are really tinny the base is really muddy and thick and the drums have a ton of room ambience on them is if the whole band is just playing live in a really small room like an elevator or an attic or basement sound just gets the job done and the vocals are really passionate - and there are a ton of swears in the lyrics not that you know that's offensive but still you know kind of speaks to the down-to-earth nature of this album these guys don't give a fuck so they're gonna say there's some artists who just won't swear because they don't consider it poetic or they think of themselves as being above swearing when they're playing music but yet will swear an average everyday conversations it's kind of silly these guys are definitely more interested in having fun instead of just sounding slick and that's what these 16 tracks pretty much boil down to it's about partying and dancing like no one is watching it's completely unselfconscious music which in some ways can really help it and in other ways can really hurt it if it helps because it brings just some really authentic energy to this album when a band is sounding like they're having fun making the recording and playing the songs it's hard for the listener not to get into that same feeling but maybe if these guys were a little more self conscious more conscious of how they sound in the greater scheme of things maybe they would have spent some time hammering out a more distinctive sound something that once you hear you could pull it out of a lineup against all the other garage rock groups out there today but it's not like can blame these guys for the popularity of garage rock to begin with it's not their fault that there are a lot of bands playing this kind of stuff and overall a lot of these tracks hit only a couple of a missed which is kind of bound to happen over a string of 16 songs you've got a really consistent sound a lot of memorable hooks a little bit of 60s a nostalgia and just overall some good vibes based on how much I liked each individual track I can give this thing a pretty decent too strong 7 it's a good LP it's a really good LP it didn't blow my mind you know it's not in mind-blowing territory now whatever it still is a really good album with a lot of stand out frigging songs I highly recommend that you guys give this a listen there are a few tracks below in the D box that you can hear and if you've heard of this band or if you've heard this LP tell me what you think do you love this band do you hate them and why Anthony Fantan oh Harlem hippies forever you 
1aJXrwCX20U,Anthony Fantan oh here doing an album review of the new sleighbells album treats ok sleighbells is a duo a Brooklyn duo featuring Alison Krauss on vocals and digit Derek Miller on guitar production beats all that good stuff and you guys may remember that I reviewed two tracks of theirs they hit the internet a while ago in a little track review segment and maybe I wasn't the biggest fan of sleighbells that I could be and maybe I'm still not so if you take this album whether it be on vinyl mp3 CD dat tape mini disc laserdisc whatever medium it happens to be on and you listen to it what you're going to hear is some boy girl drum machine pop with an extreme emphasis on volume lots of distortion contrived vocals and cut and paste beats the whole thing really borders on novelty scenester hip hop come on guys I mean this is an as bad but this LP is just about in the same league as broke inside it really is come on and maybe this influence this sound is kind of coming out of left field for me but the heavy heavy low end of the compression just the pummeling nature of the beats behind this music really reminds me of crunk dirty south rap little John some of the beats get me moving for me the one redeeming thing about treats is that is just so goddamn loud it is really really loud yeah yeah and really that's that's the one thing I like about it I do like how abrasive it is how aggressive it is you know you guys know I'm into the loud stuff you guys know I'm into the loud stuff however if you were to take relentlessly breathy female vocals and put them over a son track it would ruin that too some of my favorite production on this album is on the track infinity guitars just the beat on that thing is just massive and what's ironic is that's the track where I hate the vocals the most - so I'm really kind of torn on that one and a lot of this album I guess another redeeming quality is the songs and the album are short yeah pretty short things just kind of touch down just long enough to be catchy and then they just kind of fly away I think a couple of the tracks I didn't really cringe on where real real dug that one and straight A's straight A's was pretty cool - this LP is loud it's ballsy it's proud and I have to admire it for that there's a ton of guts just all over this LP blood - and traits a certainly sweet fun and poppy can't take that away from it it's just that there's such an extreme nature to this album there's so much balm Bassett II it's basically like forcing down a two-liter bottle of soda in one sitting it tastes good but it'll make you sick I mean with how extreme this album is there is a pretty strong noise and loud rock influence on here I mean tracks straight A's that I mentioned earlier really kind of reminds me of this industrial distorted swans and melt banana combination really strange combination of influences there and considering that Derek Miller used to play in the hardcore band Poison the Well for six years I wouldn't be surprised if he was into those bands this is really one of those albums where it's like 10% music 90 percent energy 90 percent attitude 90 percent pomp but yeah sleigh bells treats this is just some extreme extreme brooklyn-based hipster hop this is certainly not the worst thing in the world it's accessible I could see people get two people are getting into it this thing is gone - ton of great reviews but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it and I'm really not strong - yeah maybe you like three but jeez are you a sleigh bells fan and if you are tell me what you like about this LP because I'm just really not enjoying it I don't know and even if you're not a sleigh bells fan head down there in the D box listen to a few tracks from this album and let me know what you think Anthony Fantana sleigh bells treats [Music] 
0zMQS8YxYNA,Blackie's brothers hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here and it's time for an album review the Black Keys are a blues rock duo from Akron Ohio and this is their sixth album the title is brothers at six albums and just about any band is going to be in an interesting place and that's no less true for the Black Keys in 2008 the band put out a tight colorful little album called attack and release the Danger Mouse produced LP removed some of the gritty wandering elements of the Bands music and replaced them with some studio Sheen and extra instrumentation brothers which may excite some fans is return to the basics the drums and guitar foundation that made the Black Keys early work so great plus the Black Keys have taken to producing their own music once again but still brought on Danger Mouse to produce the single tighten up which is arguably one of the best tracks on the LP so even though brothers may be somewhat of a return to the Black Keys earlier work it doesn't mean the bad ignores and abandons everything that they've learned up into this point for example whether it's an instrument or an effect or a studio trick the band makes sure to put a signature sound into each track making it easy to separate one song from another for example she's long gone has some really unique guitar squak effects also too afraid to love you has a beautiful harpsichord that really colors the background of the song the opener everlasting light which I absolutely love has some great falsetto vocals brought to us by Dan Auerbach and the track black mud is a short little instrumental brothers is a little more brave in terms of length to adding almost 20 more minutes than its predecessor and several more tracks to over all the songs are longer and take a bit more time to build and emphasize groove and atmosphere rather than making sure you hear the hook right off the bat the attitude of brothers is something to make note of - maybe it took this new LP to see it but the passion on brothers makes attack and release look as if the Black Keys are playing karaoke over their own songs I find the emotion on this new LP to be really open authentic and relatable maybe overall it's not as immediate as attack and release but still the dirty blues based rock that made this band popular is back with a few occasional John's into the world of soul music though I do commend the Black Keys for doing what they've always done better than ever arguably there's still not enough stylistic separation between this LP and their earlier work for me to say that this is the greatest album in the world plus I think the largest disappointment on this entire album which is always a downer for me personally is when you have a cover on the album and the cover on brothers being the Jerry Butler song never going to give you up you have a cover on brothers which is better than every other original song on the album years from now will we look to brothers or will we look to an LP like rubber factory and say to ourselves yeah that's the Black Keys best album or do you think it'll be something that the band will release after this LP so what I guess I'm getting at is that I like this LP I like it more than attack and release and I like it more than magic potion too but I still think LPS like rubber factory and thickfreakness take the cake I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this most likely a light 7 but if you're into the Black Keys and you've heard this LP what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it and how do you think it compares to the Bands earlier work 6 albums in there's quite a bit to compare this to anthony Fantana The Black Keys brothers forever [Music] 
yjUB20WlJnw,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and before I get into this track review want to do album of the week right here Russia's moving pictures guys classic classic album all right picture 
3Hbhb5CGEB0,LCD Soundsystem this is happening hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and before we get too deep into this review I do want to take a second to say rest in peace mr. Ronnie James Dio you will sorely sorely be missed you're the man and today we're taking a look at a new album from LCD Soundsystem this is happening LCD soundsystem is a dance punk post-punk hoop tears project fronted by vocalist multi-instrumentalist and producer James Murphy this is the band's third LP and it's allegedly their last and I know a lot of people are freaking out about that but I'm sure it's not going to be the last piece of music that James Murphy ever makes and the choice of ending the band especially here I'm sure has caused a lot of controversy but after this LP I don't think anyone can say that these guys didn't fight all the way up until the end here LCD Soundsystem is really really aiming for the dancefloor I mean I know they usually are with their music but I would say especially on this is happening they're a lot less concerned about making a poppy track making a concise track at the hot single out there get the hook in there this LP is built on a really strong foundation of long adventurous dance tracks that really remind me of bands like yellow magic Orchestra James White in the blacks and especially Talking Heads I mean these are the drum beats that dance music was not just fantastic percussion all the way throughout this LP you've got some really unique yet nostalgic sense sounds that remind me of a lot of singles from the 80s emotive vocals that are always believable never flat never boring and the production is freakin top-notch and bumps the hell out of my speakers and James Murphy brings these really harebrained weird eccentric lyrics that just catch me off guard and is there a method to his madness I have no clue some of it makes sense on the surface and some of it doesn't does that matter no so you've got nine tracks here and the songs are extremely extremely ambitious you've got to have serious balls to be putting out nine minute songs these days but honestly no song really feels as long as it actually is with a lot of subtleties really fun vocals great instrumentation fantastic building each track just really flies by I know this is the point where maybe I won't see eye to eye with a lot of people but I don't think not one song maybe with the exception of somebody's calling me not one track gets boring her drags on or really feels static each track is always moving always shifting always changing into something different which makes it kind of an evolutionary experience this is a dance floor not a ballet Sun a lot of variation keeps the whole LP feeling just fresh from beginning to end two drunk girls is a really fiery single which I ever viewed before on the channel and is quite possibly one of the most immediate tracks on the LP all I want is a sweet little love song that clocks in at almost seven minutes but has really great wailing guitar Lee it's just a casserole of layered instrumentation and some atmospheric scents too and for some reason the track one touch kind of reminds me of Nine Inch Nails with how moody it is and significantly darker than every other track on the LP just early 9 inch nails and really this is one of the few times that dance music actually comes off as epic and this is happening has fantastic musicianship fantastic sounds production just everything and my only gripe is something that I mentioned already in this video I didn't really care for the track somebody's calling me I was okay on it I feel like it just could have been more eventful but other than that I'm just loving the hell out of this album I can't get over how fun it is this is just over 60 minutes of dance music and each moment is moving sweaty and infectious now I have to warn you if you're looking for something that is simple straightforward to the point this may not be what you're looking for these tracks build they really take their time and they do not edit themselves we have some long tracks here my friends we have some long tracks strong girls which is a track that I'm sure a lot of you have heard is the shortest and the only single esque track on the LP the rest of the album is pretty much just drawn-out adventurous exploring every nook cranny and idea that they can within a given song I'm not feeling a light 9 on this I'm not feeling a strong 9 on this but I think I am feeling an honorably decent 9 on this freaking album it's just really good it's really good for me personally I already love to death the type of music that this album pulls from so it pretty much just hits home for me with my musical tastes I mean I just love post-punk music especially the Dancy er more disco influenced side of it and that's exactly where this album's coming from so of course I'm a little biased in that direction but if you've heard this LP and if you like LCD Soundsystem any of James Murphy's work what do you think of this LP do you like it do you hate it and why what's your favorite part of this album what's your least favorite part anthony Fantana LCD Soundsystem this is happening forever [Music] you [Music] 
v_7WlMvv50I,my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an LP review of dead weathers sea of cowards the dead weather is one of several projects brought to us by the infamous Jack White of the White Stripes and features Alison Mosshart of the kills the from Queens of the Stone Age and the bass player from the rock hound tours this LP is the extremely buzzed follow-up to their 2009 album horehound nice that they would follow up that within a year and let me preface this review by saying it's going to be a little bit of good news and some bad news too but as you guys know I'm here to make videos not friends well what do I like about this record I have to say the sound the sound of this thing is immaculate really one of the best sounding records of this year some very vintage sounding reverb some thick fuzzy muddy bass very saturated organ sounds and of course the guitar sounds are amazing the tones of the guitar the timbre of the guitar the distortion quality and various effects laid down by Jack White the guy is really a master of tone he really knows his sound and I would expect nothing less Jack white really expands upon the guitar sounds he put together on the first dead weather album and even on his work with the White Stripes he's really calling back to artists like Hendrix and cream and Zeppelin there's just some real passion and detail in the production of this album and it's really not something you come across every day in a lot of ways it kind of spits into the face of the overt digitalization of modern rock albums really if you're not enjoying the sound of this album you're kind of just enjoying half of it not even maybe 30% this is not grape juice this is wine so stop gulping it sip it smell it taste it and enjoy it now what this LP also has are some really great groups at disposal I'm not sure how they recorded this thing but it doesn't sound really rigid and multi-tracked and very sterile it sounds really down and dirty and filthy a lot of interplay between all the musicians just adding a ton of subtlety to the mix just some really sweet ass rock and roll but to quote the single die by the drop I've got myself a problem and my issues with this LP are pretty much limited to the songwriting a little bit but mostly the vocals there are a few tracks where Jack white throws this demonic chorus on his voice that sounds way more obnoxious than it is interesting pretty much ruining the song for me at least and just some of the vocal deliveries - and the lyrical situation has me missing the days of get behind me Satan shake your hips like battleships all the white girls trip when I sing Sunday service that to me just sounds like some novelty rock rap bullsh and on the track I'm mad I figured Jack white actually must be mad because that song doesn't really say much outside of the lyric I'm mad haha and I can't really say at least in the context of this album anyway that I'm a fan of the vocals of Alison Mosshart she tries to sound really soulful and just give it her all and it just kind of ends up sounding contrived or kind of like a parody of the musical style that she's trying to sing in but still this album just has a ton of texture and variation great sound quality the songs are pretty decent I just wish the lyrics were a little bit better and I know jack white can write some pretty goddamn good lyrics because of his days and the White Stripes and in terms of the vocal deliveries I just wish they sounded just a little bit more natural I'm kind of feeling an extremely extremely strong five on this album teetering on a six there are a few songs on here that I'm okay with but most of it to me is just ruined by the vocals and though I know of five is kind of a neutral esque score it's not really because I'm bored with this album it's because I have this one aspect of it that I really really really really love and there's another aspect of it that I really really don't care for at all and they kind of just cancel each other out I don't want to feel that way but I do still if you're in the Blues Rock thing if you're into the 70s rock thing and you just want to hear some badass guitar music at least give this a check out and if you've heard this LP or if you're a big fan of the Dead whether you like Jack White's work even the rock hound tours tell me what you think of this LP love it hate it and why Anthony Fantana the dead weather sea of cowards forever you 
0eHLiOjUOQw,"hi my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd want to do a quick question of the week video right now first off want to tell you guys thanks for bringing past 4200 subscribers really appreciate that mm-hmm 5,000 is on the way and I know a lot of you guys are asking about reviews for the new sleighbells new Black Keys new dead weather LP those are coming most definitely ok guys yesterday I found out about a new genre of music a new discovery one of my needle drops emailed me about it plus I was just seeing it mentioned on a few blogs here and there which house yes which house is apparently a genre if you go to our tumblr site which is linked on the needle drop calm in the links section and if you go down there in the d box you can find it I do have a little thing about which house in there what it is kind of what it sounds like apparently which house yes it's slowly becoming accepted as a genre and there was a community of artists considered which house artists making music under the label so it got me thinking what makes something a genre what makes a shanwa is that this type of music sounds different than any other type of music or is it merely because a group of people a culture surround this music and label it as so how do you know when something is really authentically a genre is there any such thing as a fake genre we have about a couple dozen different kind of cores out there and tons of different types of jazz out there and you know a hundred different shades of metal and pop music there's so many different styles that we think or is it really all the same freaking style the whole time and we're just tricking ourselves by relabeling it and labeling it and how many people have to be listening to a certain kind of music in order for it to become a genre I guess or how many artists have to be making it how can we tell when a piece of music is authentically new and now we need a label to differentiate it from every other type of music out there and you know the other side of the aisle there is marketing someone's just marketing a new label new genre which house what makes a Shondra forever "
Lfw6vPZAUtc,the New Pornographers together my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here intranets busiest music nerd alright we're gonna do an album review the New Pornographers together these guys are Canadian indie rock band and this is their fifth studio album and I don't know how many members you need to be a supergroup like your music gets more super the more members you have get that up but the word supergroup has been used to describe this band on multiple occasions and it's not hard to see why because they have eight members and among them are AC Newman Nikko case and my favorite songwriter of the whole bunch Dan Behar and the style of this band is pretty indie but what the hell does that even mean and because you have these different collaborating voices comprising the whole band it's kind of difficult to nail them into one hole especially on together which is pretty varied but if I had to pick one genre that I keep hearing pop up again and again on together and just the New Pornographers music in general its most definitely power pop stuff like big star stuff like Fountains of Wayne and a comparison that I hear a lot cheap trick the New Pornographers don't have as much much easier as these groups but even at their softest and their Poppaea stores Rock roots aren't that hard to hear this really is music for the gut it's pretty visceral stuff I'm hearing some strong drums on this album some great guitar melodies a lot of groups singing and what I think I love about this LP the most is it has a ton of arrangements strings Keys horns some members of Sharon Jones & the dap-kings actually joined up on a few tracks with this LP too and despite the fact that you have all this instrumentation going on the song never ceases up or slows down or gets complacent in its sea of sounds thinking oh yeah this already sounds huge we don't need to write a good song I actually found most of the songwriting to be of a very high caliber very catchy and always immediate if I didn't end up liking a try it was mostly because the production a lot of the studio work on this thing is very very polished it borders on being over polished at some points but as I listen to this thing over and over and over I can't explain it but something about it brings me back to when I was a kid in the 90s listening to just a lot of pop and rock on the radio tracks like my Shepard and crude and silver Jenny dollar just remind me of stuff that I would hear when I was riding around with my parents in the car and the radio was on this thing is pretty much just a set of really enjoyable pop rock songs with strong melodies decent hooks and pretty distinct vocals distinct enough where you can separate the New Pornographers even after one listened through to the album from pretty much every Papa Rock there I think my only real gripe about this LP is that there's a lot of singing in unison with all of the lead vocals kind of mixed at or near the same level of volume and it's a little distracting it doesn't really add anything to the song to have everyone singing the same thing at the same volume I would have rather just heard one singer taking the spotlight at a time and for reasons like a silly song structure some annoying instrumentation and that really bad in unison singing I just absolutely hate the song your hands together oh my god that was the first track I heard on this album and after I heard that I thought I was gonna hate the whole freaking thing seriously but other than that this is just a really nice straightforward pop record and you really can't expect the world of it you know this thing isn't going to blow your mind but that doesn't mean it can't put a smile on your face and put a few tunes into your head the New Pornographers have clearly made more superior music in the past but I wouldn't short sell this album it definitely has its share of songs that I think advance past their previous work if you're looking for something light easy on the ears good mood inducing I would highly recommend this LP and I could give it a light 7 I can most definitely give it a light 7 and that's pretty much it I also want to say that MacOS or of the YouTube channel MacOS or F em also reviews music he also reviewed this LP over there on his channel and there will be a link in the de box to where you can watch that review of together sort of get a different perspective on this LP Anthony Fantana the New Pornographers together forever together forever you 
ncrpTX6jR5w,woods at Echo Lake yo needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd album review woods at a at Echo Lake woods is a Brooklyn funk band who for every year for the past five years they've been racking up a new album and instead of burning out and pretty much destroying their sound they've built a pretty decent following for their music and the sound of this well imagine a combination of folk and psychedelic rock with very creepy falsetto vocals there's a really raw recording style to this album - it sounds like something you might hear in your head if you were stranded out in the middle of the forest at midnight and you had no clue where you were and you were bordering on insanity and about the false set of vocals that I just mentioned a second ago they're pretty much the deal-breaker for this group for a lot of people turn some people on turn some people off I mean the falsetto vocals here aren't exactly Tiny Tim proportioned but I'm of the opinion that they're pretty freakin good and they give woods a very unique sound I feel like the vocals set a really unique mood for this band but I'm sure it could be argued all day as to whether or not they're actually all that good but what you can't argue about I think is that this album is way more straightforward and concise than their previous effort songs of Shane which if you guys remember I gave a pretty high score to on this channel when I reviewed it and songs of Shane still haunts me to this day with melodies that just sometimes I wish I could just exercise from my brain and Echo Lake is doing the same thing but maybe on a more miniscule level if songs of shame is midnight then at Echo Lake is like 4:30 you're like 5:00 a.m. in the morning it's still kind of dark out but still the Sun is coming up there's some Twilight up there there's some rise light on the horizon because there's some more upbeat sounds on a Echo Lake and a lot of variation to but would still stay true to their sound I mean there even some tracks on here that pretty much sound like songs off of songs of shame I'm pretty sure the track till the Sun rips has the same exact chord progression as rain on but there are some sounds that really come out of nowhere like blood dries darker which kind of sounds like a honky tonk esque piece of folk rock and the track morning time I'm not exactly sure how to place it kind of sounds a little bit glam ish maybe a little bit of beetles and fluence in there I'm not completely sure but it definitely sounds like something that could be a piece of 60s radio pop there's a little less reverb on these tracks and what I'm also liking is that the van gets a little braver in the production department throwing in some more sounds some chimes of experimental drum edits there's definitely more texture on Echo Lake than there is on songs of shame for sure this album is just a lot of fun it's really immediate but my one gripe with this album is the same that it was with songs of shame that the tracks are maybe a little too short and just not fleshed out enough I did find myself gravitating toward the longer songs on this album than I did the shorter ones and imagine how hard that was for me kind of because overall this album is shorter than its predecessor by 7 or 6 minutes the songs here really aren't that expansive they kind of fly in touchdown stick around to just kind of lay down a basic idea maybe throw a solo and there are some kind of interlude and then just shoot off into the distance waiting for the next song to come in which you could see is nothing getting done or nothing getting old and I'm more of the opinion of the latter I guess I'm pretty much enjoying this album a lot and even though there's not a world of difference between this LP and songs of shame Woods has a really distinct sound that really no other group out there right now has so it's kind of hard to get sick of them because you don't hear a bunch of repeat groups out there right now but I will warn casual listeners too Woods will probably not see a difference between at Echo Lake and songs of shame but if you've listened to songs of shame enough to have those tracks kind of infect your head then you're most definitely going to hear that there is at least enough difference between these two albums to make Echo Lake Oh worthy this LP is a little shorter and it borders on being maybe too straightforward and I'm diggin it maybe just a little bit less than the last album I could give it a light eight but still highly recommend it for you guys if you're into psychedelic rock if you're into freak folk stuff or what a lot of people are calling this new wave of weird America but if you're a woods fan what do you think of this LP and if you're a fulk fan do give a listen to woods and tell me what you think of them - really interested and basically did you love this did you hate this and why thanks for watching Anthony Fantana the needle drop woods ad Echo Lake forever 
DuMUDldrG3g,"the national hi violet hi everyone Anthony Fantino here thanks for watching Internet's busiest music nerd doing an album review the Nationals hi violet the National is a Brooklyn band they've been together for about 10 years now and they've just put out their fifth album and the National has a distinctly cool and reserved rock sound and what's awesome about this album is that it was recorded in my home state of Connecticut in the same studio where they recorded turn on the bright lights by Interpol but but but but that's enough fanboy ISM if you're gonna expect anything of this LP if you're going to expect anything of hi violet make sure you're ready for some white collar blues filtered through a very bleak mournful post-punk sound this is the kind of self-perpetuating sadness that occurs when you're making $80,000 a year but yet you still believe that something's just still not right about your life as you look down on the busy city streets from your high-rise New York studio apartment so if that's something you have difficulty relating to the sentiments of hi violet might not exactly resonate in your heart of hearts but for the most part of half-joking there is something arguably relatable about The Melancholy sounds of this album and the Nationals music in general whether it's the good production the great songwriting or matt baron injures baritone vocals there's a lot to like and i'm seriously a sucker for baritone vocals it's not really a fan of these thin whiny pansy vocals go through and though hi violet is a sad LP there are a lot of aspects to it that make it a really easy pill to swallow and I think the strongest of those aspects is the production the horns the strings there's even a point where I think I hear oboe just the lot of color a lot of texture throughout this whole LP and I think the best addition to this album is most definitely the mechanical meticulous drumming style usually I like my drums a little more dynamic a little more interactive maybe with a little more variation but I wouldn't have it any other way on this album because if the drums weren't so sharp and just right on tempo this album would seriously sound like a bowl of sambar mush and now that I've touched down on that point there are actually some parts of this LP that do sound like that just a bowl of somber mush so much gray area that you'll just be begging for some black and white to just make things a little more lively tracks that are so weighted down in misery and instrumentation that I think they actually try to sonically drown themselves out in some kind of music related suicide attempt the tracks that I actually found myself loving loving to death weren't the simplest or more straightforward tracks but the ones where you could actually hear a decent separation between each of the instruments I'm thinking conversation 16 I'm thinking blood buzz Ohio anyone's ghost sorrow these are really beautiful well-crafted songs with in extreme attention to detail like Eleanor Rigby take a note out it's ruined there really is a strong assembly of very cinematic tracks on this album that when I hear them even though I'm not digging every single song on high violet it really makes me think damn the National is completely deserving of every shred of fame that they receive hi violet for me does have its share of great moments but there is this handful of tracks that are just keeping me from falling in love with this album and I don't know if that's the general consensus because a majority of the reviews that I'm seeing for this thing are just fiercely fiercely positive this thing most definitely has some nice sound some decent songs to spare and a lot of attention to detail but I think its biggest downfall is maybe it's consist see because if you set back from this album even just a few feet everything tends to get very very blurry as if this thing is almost too cohesive for its own good because after just experiencing this ongoing sad somber emotion in one sitting kind of makes it difficult for me to just muster up the strength and the attention span to listen to even the last two tracks which arguably have some of the best production on the entire album though I did enjoy this LP for the most part just too many songs fell into the gray area for me and if you feel the same way maybe because of these stronger tracks on the album like blood buzz Ohio it's kind of worth it to stick around and maybe acclimate yourself to those weaker or less immediate tracks I'm feeling a strong six on this album but what do you guys think I know this thing is getting a ton ton of good reviews and are you one of the people who thinks this album is amazing and if so tell me why down there in the comment box and also how do you think this album compares to their earlier work Anthony Fantana the National High Violet forever [Music] you "
ySXryTlo9Ac,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd doing an album review holy fucks LAN now look before I get too deep into this video I know that usually I will edit myself or put in a little if I swear but for the sake of my sanity I'm not going to put in a bleep every single time I say holy fuck because that's the band's name holy fuck is a Canadian band who I fell in love with back in 2007 just like a lot of people did with the release of their LP LP and what made this album so appealing to me at the time what makes it appealing to me today is its unbreakable grooves it's linear Dancy structure its experimental electronics its improvisation I wouldn't change a thing about this album I mean it's like sugar it hits the tongue it's immediately good and it's a shock to the system so of course since then I've been awaiting a follow-up and now we have it nine tracks 38 minutes and a noticeable change since their last album even if you don't like Len you can certainly not accuse holy fuck of making the same album twice the most noticeable change on this album is a real step up in production no more lo-fi or live sounds that we may have heard on holy fucks previous efforts here the band really tries to develop their studio sound with more effects more clarity and a lot more studio Sheen in that sense Latin is a really mature album and it's noticeable right from the beginning with the intro track with the really huge reverb e synthesizers that sound very very Vangelis very huge epic ambitious and of course after that you have the band's usual combination of GRU and electronics really crisp drums drum machines these very spectral synthesized sounds and a lot of those vocal yelps that you may have heard on LP though holy fuck doesn't really have any lyrics they do have some vocals from time to time whether it be ooh or like oh and you just sort of like hear it reading across the mix there's definitely no shortage of sonic texture among these songs and there's a pretty decent mix on a lot of these tracks too not really sounding all that flat or one-dimensional pretty panoramic at times and there's a lot of variety on this LP - I already mentioned that epic opening then there's the tracks stay lit which is one of the slowest but I think is one of the most captivating - simply because of its synth melody the tracks know just kind of cashes in on the Kratt rock influences that I always knew holyfuck had but I just heard very faintly in the background wasn't really able to confirm them and then you have some really fast or more aggressive moments like stilettos - and I have to be completely honest and there may be some debate about this in the near future but I don't really think this album dethrones LP a lot of you may remember that track review I did at the song latin america off this album and though it's not a bad song my one gripe with it is that I felt a lot less interplay between the band members on that track I felt a lot less subtlety and a lot less dynamics which is what drew me to this band in the first place a lot of the instruments on this LP sound like they're conforming to a set song structure if not recorded individually as opposed to having the band record these songs together all at once whereas if you listen to LP even multiple times it sounds like those tracks could just break off in a different direction at any moment there's a lot of interplay there's a lot of interaction between each musician a lot of snap decision making I really find this album to have the same subtlety as any jazz quartet out there I don't think Latin is going to send people flying by the seat of their pants like LP did when that album first dropped be honest but still Latin is a very fun colorful album with a lot of dancey qualities and great electronics it's really catchy you're gonna get it in the first listen but I think there's always a reason to listen to this thing again the Latin didn't amaze me holy fuck is SIL keeping things interesting and they're most definitely evolving which I like a lot I'm feeling a decent seven on this thing and look for a link down there where you can hear some of holy fucks music of course and also if you've heard this LP or if you enjoy holy fucks music let me know do you love this album do you hate this album and why is it better than LP worse than LP do you find what holy fuck is doing on Latin to be interesting and I also want to thank you guys for bringing me past 4000 subscribers this past weekend and your awesome holy fuck Latin [Music] 
cndwH6byJnk,hey my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review little women throat little women is a Brooklyn quartet new album throat seven tracks its pieces one through seven like throat one through seven forty one minutes in total and this album has been blowing my mind for the past few days blowing my mind this review is really going to be for my Avant drops for my noisy needle drops so if you're looking for the next electro pop album you may want to turn back but if you do want your brain scoop out of your skull and hand it to you on a plate then I think you're gonna want to stick around for this now there was a phase in my musical trajectory where I was just listening to a lot of avant-garde music because I just enjoyed the thrill of it a lot of noise music - you know your cage yours or your Branka also minimalist composers like Philip Glass also you guys know I'm heavy into drone listening to a lot of drone listen and the guys like Murs bow pre and stuff like that - also free jazz music and anything that I could kind of get my hands on in mp3 formed from the New York no wave scene bands like DNA and as a result my tastes and it have become a little more picky I'm a little desensitized to it sometimes and it's a you know kind of hard for me to derive the same joy and thrill out of Noise music because it's you know the excitement isn't there now like it was when I was first listening to it so enter Little Women the instrumentation on this LP isn't anything that you haven't heard before in your lifetime you've got tenor saxophone alto saxophone electric guitar and drums and that is it my friends that is it and also want to make a very clear point of this stress this no effects none not that I hear maybe there's some light compression and the post-production something like that but no reverb nope you know distortion no chorus nothing like that nope pitch shifting no experimental weird effects this is raw musicianship here my friends and this raw musicianship translates into really and I'm being honest here one of the most brutal experiences I've ever had with music on an album you've got these flurries of drums that incorporate elements of jazz music like metal music grindcore punk music math rock and you have these horns playing really dissonant intervals of just the tone of the horns in the recording just blaring in your face and you have these really sharp pointy guitar sounds just like kind of crunchy - really just making this album something else just just how aggressive and abusive this sound is I just can't explain but maybe I can liken it to this you guys know like if you were tied up to a pole and you had a blindfold on like you have a cigarette in your mouth and there's like a firing squad in front of you something out of a cartoon or like out of one of those old westerns and you were about to be shot at and executed but instead of rifles everybody in the lineup in front of you actually has fully automatic machine guns with an unlimited amount of rounds okay and once the album turns on they're shooting you and here's and here's the bad part like you know here's here's the bad part you won't die you just won't die so you're just forced to stay there on the pole alive and just you know feeling all the bullets go I mean literally there were points when I was listening to this album I started screaming like I was listening to it I'm just going I was listening to this and almost every time I do if I just have this at a certain you know loud volume this thing needs a loud volume if I had this thing at a loud volume and I'm just really concentrating on and I'm just listening to it no distractions my eyes just go wide as if I was like watching a really gory gory murder occur right in front of me like I'm just listening to the murder of music now I'm gonna link you to this band's MySpace the first track off throat is on there at least at the time of me making this video give that a listen there are a lot of tracks on this LP that are like that I want to say about 1 to 4 the tracks on this album are really cut of that extremely aggressive disorienting cloth you do have another track on there that is very slow very stripped-down no guitar no drums just the two horns and they're making like these really just sour notes that are just like you know just it's like after the first round of being shot and then another track kicks and you're being shot again you know it's another disorienting experience on the fourth track which is my favorite and the longest on the album is actually quite beautiful very pretty very harmonized horns on that one and the chord progressions on that track are just really emotionally you know just hit home with me I guess you could say and the drumming on that is very great too I mean it's it's honestly a pretty track you know I mean of course that's objective but um it's a very pretty pretty track compared to the rest of what's on this album and yeah I enjoy it probably the most out of all the tracks but I enjoy it for a different reason than I enjoy the other tracks you know I'm enjoying it because traditionally when we're talking about music and musicality it's more traditionally musical you know it has things that are more widely accepted in greater society to be musical like pretty notes and pretty harmonies and a chord progression and a you know consists didn't see an interesting rhythm it's a pretty track it breaks down into some ugliness here and there but you know it is a very pleasant track I would say and then you had the last track where it sounds like all the members of the group are trying to choke themselves to death and there's like man also add the guitarist Mick bar drew the picture on the front cover of this album if you're in the technical stuff if you're into experimental metal music I don't think you need a better endorsement than that I don't know if there's anything else I could say about this album other than that it just drove me insane yeah it did really disorient in the experience and I highly highly recommend it really I do I think I could give this a late-night yeah this is like this is really fucked up you should listen to it forever 
O0hpcqwBUKU,it's track review hema needle drops anthony Fantana here the internet's busiest music nerd and this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good if you guys haven't done it yet please go to the needle drop calm podcasts interviews mp3s over there got a nice interview with Luke temple of the band here we go magic their new LP pigeons coming out in June that's gonna be awesome give that a check out also we're past 3900 subscribers awesome awesome alright we're not here to fool around let's get reviewing picture of the LP that this track comes from the new Black Keys album brothers brothers it's nice it says there right on the front of the name of this album is brothers that's nice this thing is due for a May 18th release and it's the follow-up to their LP attack and release which I really dug myself a vinyl copy of and Danger Mouse who y'all know did a fantastic job of producing that album and bringing a lot of different colors a lot of different sounds and instruments into the fold with black keys music though maybe that LP wasn't his mmm pow bap wasn't the most gutsy LP that the Black Keys ever put together still decent LP a lot of variety Danger Mouse is also coming on again for this new album so excited for that and sir all about music did a review of the song tighten up the first single for brothers a while ago you can find a link to that track and you can hear that track down below but we're gonna listen to is what I guess the second single or at least the track that the Black Keys put out a new music video for which is pretty lousy listen to the track down there the Black Keys with the next girl whoo yeah man a lot of emotional tension in this song kind of felt like me me too me kind of felt like to me it could be sound tracking some kind of silenced fight between some guy and his girlfriend or some girl and her boyfriend and just like fighting throwing stuff but in terms of instrumentation the heavy-handed drumming that I've always loved about Black Keys music shows up here also Dan's really strong vocals as emotionally strong vocals are here too and some great effects some great sounds on the guitar I love that reverb II kind of thing that they had going on great effect right there and also Danger Mouse is production really crisp clean clear but yet has this sort of unique quality to it I mean even though everything does sound really clear the drums kind of sound like maybe they were recorded in a different room or something like that you know you can hear some room ambience around the drums the guitar sounded a little distorted a little dirty kind of fuzzy like very retro kind of vintage I guess you could say everything like I said crisp clear but kind of aged well-traveled this tracks got some hair on its chest some hair on its shoulders too and it's elbows just hair everywhere this is a really hairy track and I don't know if you're under the whole hair on the chest thing but that's kind of what I felt was missing from attack and release this thing feels a little bit ballsy just a little bit ballsier and I don't know if you guys noticed this but there's a really weird kind of mix on this song in the left channel it's like mostly guitar just the guitar kind of alone inherently I can't say there's anything wrong with this tune but everything for me pretty much everything is about context so so so so so much about context and listening to this yeah decent tune but still in my head I'm thinking God how long are the Black Keys just going to ride on this one sound sure this is a nice sound it has a very classic timeless feel to it but if you take it in context with the rest of this band's discography it's not all that distinctive it's kind of like yeah I've heard you do this before now if you take the other single Titan up which I feel like had a little bit more space in there have these really nice up strokes on the guitar I feel like that was a little bit more distinctive not completely a departure but you know wandering a bit outside of the Black Keys comfort zone dug that song a lot more than this one this one to me just kind of felt like it just falls into the gray area camouflaging itself among all the other tracks and the Black Keys discography that are a little difficult to distinctive buy from one another like I said I know that I dig tighten up I just hope Brothers has a lot of variety on it just like attack and release did but maybe with a little bit more guts something that's just gonna pull me by the shirt and be like hey man listen to this I'm feeling a strong v or a light six on this track most likely a light six but uh if you listen to it link down there in the D box tell me what you think love it hate it or why tell me what you think love it hate it and why Anthony Fantana the Black Keys Brothers forever 
KCuamde9Atc,Flying Lotus Cosmo Rama all right my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and damn I have gotten countless I mean dozens and dozens of requests for this new LP flying lotuses Cosmo grandma Flying Lotus is a music producer from California whose knack for music sampling and sound production sound manipulation basically smashes any preconceived notions of what hip-hop is or what hip-hop influenced music is I mean we all know Girl Talk and Girl Talk makes these mishmash is of radio pop tunes well if if Flying Lotus you know mishmash and stuff it's kind of like a tapestry of the strange the eerie misfit samples that other DJs just won't touch or just don't know where they are can't find them have no clue they exists flying lotuses 2008 LP Los Angeles caused a fiercely positive wave of reviews just hit him and I have a feeling this new LP is going to do the same with maybe even more positive reviews simply because he's opening himself up to a wider listening audience on cosmic Grammy you're not really going to find a traditional song that's not really what this thing is about on here you're gonna pretty much find ideas concepts motifs some feel fleshed out and some really don't but and cosma grandma doesn't just throw different songs at you it's constantly throwing different sounds at you this thing just has a galaxy a galaxy a galaxies worth of instrumentation a ton of harp which isn't surprising because Alice Coltrane is actually flying lotuses great-aunt also you have special guests Rebecca raff playing a lot of harp on this LP strings horn scat vocals break beats those are only the instruments that you can actually identify but I've written down a few things that I actually think are on this album but I cannot confirm screaming dentist drill space laser water ping-pong balls train there are quite a few significant guest stars on this album - you could say this bro named Tom York from this band named Radiohead is on the seventh track and the world laughs with you you also have Laura Darlington who's in the electronic music duo the long-lost who also was on a flying lotuses last LP to Los Angeles and of course flying lotuses cousin Robbie Coltrane plays some saxophone on here too which just speaks to how strong the jazz element is on this album though jazz is most definitely not the only thing that is represented throughout cosmic grama it's way more prevalent than it was on los angeles between all the jazz sampling all the jazz soloing just how boundary with some of the music feels and the track title artistry has to be some kind of sun rana reference but I guess if you could boil this album down to one thing it would be a variety in terms of style in terms of sound there's just a lot that hits you between the beginning and the end of this record but whether or not this LP is good I think that really depends on what you want and what you're looking for if you're looking for a series a very consistent very well developed sounds you may not find that here instead of making sure one nail is square into the whole Flying Lotus is just a little all over the map with this LP and if you're not into the art of sampling or music collage I can see a lot of these tracks kind of flying by as if they're just filler but that's just sort of the exploratory nature of this LP instead of giving you one thing and maybe that one thing is done incredibly well it gives you a little bit of dubstep it gives you a little bit of hip-hop a little bit of club music a little bit of techno sounds a little bit of jazz a little bit of cuts from a hundred other different things but in comparison to the album la Kozma grandma is a lot cleaner a lot less vinyl crackle it's more colorful I would say it's more accessible less primal less cohesive a little more upbeat I'm kind of torn between LA and Kozma grandma I mean yeah you don't necessarily need to pick one or the other you can like both and I do like both for different reasons I mean Kozma grandma is a really diverse musical trip but still I don't think it even comes close to touching how bleak and moody LA is I basically see the difference between these two albums as let's say you're a huge fan of Japanese food and you want the most hard-core authentic Japanese best of the best food BAM it is just pure concentrated best Japanese food you ever had that's la I see Kozma grandma as more of a buffet sure there's Japanese food at the buffet and it's not the best of the best but still when you go to the buffet you can get the Japanese food on your plate you can get the falafel the Agra dashi tofu and you can also get a hamburger all on one plate there's no other place you're going to get all that on your plate though it's not the cream of the crop though it's not the most finely tuned of all these different types of foods it's pretty much the only place you're going to get all this diversity but I don't want to rain on anybody's parade because of all the press leading up to this LP because of Flying Lotus affiliation with the ganja Sufi album because Thom Yorke is on this LP they're going to be a lot of first time listeners when it comes to Flying Lotus here and they're probably going to love this thing this thing has a ton of different sounds on it it's really going to hold the tension even people who have short attention spans I think and overall it's really fun album and am i enjoying it hell yeah man I just think it would have been a little more interesting if it were a little less boundary-less and maybe Flying Lotus picked several of the sounds he's experimenting with on the sound boom especially the jazz I would have loved to hear him just you know do an entire jazz exploration and kind of stick to that from beginning to end because I think it would have kind of turned out a lot of interesting sounds with one concept as opposed to just kind of jump in here you go here you go here you go there's there's a spot there's I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this LP I don't see any reason why I won't turn up in my favourites of the end of the year but still yeah decent album and most definitely definitely definitely need to check this thing out I mean yeah I don't expect everyone to love this album I'm not even a fan of just a handful of tracks on this thing but I think this is where some music is most definitely headed and just as kind of a preliminary thing just kind of seeing what's going on in the future just kind of see in a different direction this is a must must must listen solemn saying all right guys thanks for watching thanks for being awesome Flying Lotus Kozma grandma forever [Music] you 
5xIQCY__HQ0,saucy hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review here broken Social scene's forgiveness rock record now Broken Social Scene is a band or collective or Club I don't know if they're from Canada and the group is for the most part spearheaded by two musicians Brendan canning and Kevin Drewe but the band does tend to talk up how collaborative they are working with anywhere up to maybe nineteen people on a single track and among some of these collaborators are Feist and Emily Haines and many more people and the style this band shoots for can definitely be categorized as indie rock some people would say art rock and I've heard some go as far as to say post rock the band's new LP is forgiveness rock record it's their fourth album and it's the follow-up to their 2005 self-titled LP which got some pretty unanimous praise and independent music circles not as much as their previous but still good praise and one more thing to acknowledge about this new LP is the switch one producer to another the previous producer that Broken Social Scene used to work with was David Neufeld and now they're working with John McIntyre who has a much more impressive list of clients but we will get into whether or not that actually panned out for this LP the first thing that hit me about this record much more than broken Social scene's two previous albums this thing is amazingly amazingly straightforward almost painfully straightforward to the point where it feels as if they're simplifying the songs for a Dumber audience it's true Broken Social Scene does have some experimental roots and their latest albums haven't really been about experimentation first but still this thing really kind of seems to be completely devoid of adventure it's a pretty safe album every riff melody and production decision seems like some kind of watered-down musical agreement that could only be arrived at democratically and I know the group is supposed to be a collective but this album to me just sounds really really anonymous the band's previous work was so much more definitive had so much more character to it even this LP just feels like a pile of messy indie rock notions that take absolutely no chances and makes no move to come up with a definitive sound which brings me to the production now this thing could have been collaboratively mixed with John McIntyre collaboratively produced with John McIntyre but still some of these songs are destroyed they're wrecked there are at least a handful of moments where tracks have the drums mixed so loudly that they drown out any hope of actually enjoying the song for example forced to love me me in the basement water and hell there's just really not a lot of subtlety to this album and that's kind of disappointing though seriously the hooks on some of these songs are fantastic some of the arrangements and some of the melodies are great for example the string arrangements on meet me in the basement are just fantastic addition to the song however making the drum sounds so sharp that it sounds like a jackhammer is literally entering your ear canal doesn't really add to the track but there are tracks on here that I do like and for the most part I am really amazed surprised at this band's versatility for example on the track of sentimental exes they really go for this poppy linear kind of krautrock thing with these light drum machines these really blippi scents and I could say they pull it off really well that's a great track to me but despite their versatility despite the fact that Broken Social Scene can take on some different sounds they don't really do anything with any of the styles throughout this LP that separates them from the band's and the musicians the artists who have done a certain style a hundred times before now I'm not looking for the reinvention of music here I'm looking for is something that is just a little definitive something that will just tell me who Broken Social Scene is at least on this record but to be honest I don't feel any closer to that answer now than I did before I let this album take up an entire hour of my life more than once though there are some decent spots on this record the parts that I did like were really few and far between this thing is just generic it's just painfully painfully generic but you guys know how I feel about this stuff it's opinion pretty much but this is what I want to know if you're diggin on this LP let me know why let me know how much you're diggin it let me know what some of your favorite tracks are and let me know if you like their earlier stuff better or if you like this LP better I'm feeling a decent four on this thing a light too decent for not really feeling all that happy about it I really expected more from it and thought I was actually going to enjoy it quite a bit but what are you gonna do Anthony Fantana Broken Social Scene forgiveness rock record forever you 
VXaKHorhNIQ,Hey it's track reviews my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for being here thank you for watching I want to say quickly before we get into this that there's a new podcast up at the needle drop com have some eddy current suppression ring in there some Crystal Castles in there needle drop calm we're past 3700 subscribers I would write that here but my dry erase marker shit the bed but anyway we're on the cusp of 38 for thousands almost here here okay this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and whether or not it's good sometimes this stuff is independent sometimes it's not picture of the LP that this track comes from fulls sophomore album total life forever these guys are UK rock band I would even go as far as to say they're a Brit pop band and their debut LP caused a lot of waves throughout the indie community building them a huge following though I can't say they did as well in the u.s. as they did in the UK but with this new LP that could be a totally different story turn things around let's give a listen to the new single off of this album here's foals with this orient just look for a link to this track down in the d box another great tune great song great tune alright first off what I want to say is if you're looking for something experimental if you're looking for something that's gonna bend Minds that's gonna throw your musical inhibitions out the window and change the way you look at the world get the go this is not what this track is all about I mean this thing is kind of a safe Indy tune not exactly you know redefining the genre not redefining music not redefining rock music but still a very well oiled well-groomed very mature look at that style of music I have to say as I was listening to this track I just thought of a factory just everything a very clean factory just all these assembly lines things running from one direction to another direction everything's very clean and white and plastic and people are wearing face masks or something I don't know and that's because everything in this track is just so layered and tight and orchestrated and meticulous I guess you could say and I don't really like my music like that usually I'd like to leave a little bit of something up to chance usually I like to leave just a little bit of danger just hanging around I don't know where this is going I don't know what's gonna happen I mean yeah this was a little predictable but the song was so good that I didn't really care whether or not I knew where it was going the mixing and the production were fantastic you have these fantastic said that twice guitar wails in the background to me that sounded a little bit post-rock and also just great great drumming these layers of synths and these guitar arpeggiated and you hear these voices there too just a lot of different things going on even though this thing is four minutes long it feels a lot longer than four minutes because fools get a lot done in that four minutes they condense a lot of stuff and still don't make it kind of feel like they're throwing so many things at you that the track is hard to process and this thing isn't just about the song either I mean it's about the builds and the Falls and you know of course the intro is pretty interesting and very nice syncopation they're really grabbed my attention and sort of you know not every band can do something that syncopated in that tight plus I have to give huge kudos to the mixing job up until this point I was pretty much listening to this thing on just a set of speakers but putting this on headphones the song kind of reminds me I have to say again post-rock or even that new Beach House LP in the fact that it just sounds so panoramic like the music is going on in front of you to the left of you to the right of you behind you just it just is all-encompassing just around you I feel like my head was literally wrapped in this song when I put it on some headphones picture this LP again this track definitely has me more excited about this new album more than anything from the first foals album that I heard had me thinking about this band that didn't make any sense basically I'm excited though it's not overly experimental not gonna change the way you think about music it is a decent kind of standout moment for this kind of stuff no matter how much coffee you pour cream rises to the top I think this is just a little bit of that cream it's all I'm saying I think this is like a strong seven to a late a strong seven to a light eight like I said down there in the D box check this track out tell me what you think of it are you a full van and even if you're not what did you like about this track what did you hate about it and that's pretty much it Anthony Fantino you and me best buds thanks for watching Bad Brains black dots this is not the new Autechre album forever 
7kYun_oGZnI,my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd you're pretty freaking awesome yeah yeah you are you're awesome don't let anyone tell you differently now I have a question question of the week here quiddity cool and maybe it's really a series of questions a series of enquiries and I've been thinking I've been think with my noggin been thinking with my noggin I want to know what's gonna happen to the music industry now look I'm not worried about the music industry I don't think it's gonna blow up I don't think there's any reason to be worried unless people just stop listening to music and of course that's just not gonna happen I think that in 2000 it would have been impossible for people to imagine what the music industry was going to look like in 2010 people downloading left and right bye and see these people are buying more records for some reason so my question to you is based on everything you're seeing right now on the internet with blogs with MySpace with band camp with all these different ways that bands are selling their music directly to the listener with all these independent labels we see popping up left and right with all these music blogs and specialty music blogs that only cover a certain kind of music but still pull in a very decent following of people I'm wondering if you can guess what the music industry is gonna look like and say 10 more years are we still gonna have labels or is that practice pretty much gonna die out we'll be be buying music on some other kind of medium will people be buying music at all will we just find our favorite bands and then instead of buying their music just donate to them just you know infrequently to get them support to actually put a new album out and then they put it out and then they sort of just give it out for free maybe the answer to this question is a little more involved video responses would be cool just because I imagine the answers could be a little bit longer but still if you could bunch it up into a paragraph couple hundred characters on YouTube what do you think the music industry is gonna look like in ten more years will there be an industry will music just be completely free and we'll be pirating it everywhere and nobody will have a problem with that it'll just be like ah will there be room for people like me on the internet who review music and point out music and talk about music or is doing this pretty much gonna be pointless in another couple years why don't you let me know you guys are the best forever 
YFKNa0z_XzU,it's track review Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd hey guys how you doing hope you're doing well keep being awesome before we get into this video I want to say a couple things blogtv tonight 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time link to the blog TV room inside of the info box and if today is not today then don't go to the blog TV because today is the day as the blog TV and tomorrow is not is is the day of the blog TV next album of the week Bad Brains black dots also awesome punk band Bad Brains got a know'm at a DC alright guys this is track reviews where we talked about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and whether or not it's good and picture of the LP that this track comes from Health's disco to health re noise rock outfit from California who have a really huge emphasis on a dance music feel in their music and because that is so prevalent it sort of seemed appropriate after they put out their self-titled LP to also come out with disco which was a series of remixes of songs from that first LP now of course last year health put out the album get color great LP I didn't like every song on it but I certainly did I did freaking love the single die slow great track listen to that oh but anyway like with their first album health is now gearing up to release disco to June 22nd it's gonna have a bunch of remixed tracks of songs off of get color I believe javelins going to be on their remix in a track from that album Crystal Castles along with tobacco however there is one track that's going to be on the LP that is not a remix at all it's an original its Health's track USA boys let's give it a listen track link down there in the de box here we go like I said health USA boys why is it got a fade-out a still not a bad song to fade out with health USC boys down there in the D box come on down there in the d-backs but damn good track good track you know the thing is you heard these initial kind of dancing around your head very weird very trippy kind of reminded me of contemporary techno just had this really contemporary techno feel but with a much slower tempo very easy kind of sedate druggie you know very but once everything came in these sense this Distortion all this bass all this thumping it kind of reminded me of the 80s just this really big epic 80s electro rock anthem kind of like Phil Collins little feel Collins II am I going crazy here Phil Collins I could hear the strobes going off in my eyes I could hear the drugs being taken around me I could hear blood splashing all over the floor I could just hear people dancing really slowly slow motion dancing yeah it was almost epic and dare I say it kind of sounded like some stuff some sounds that I've been hearing off that new Crystal Castles record now when you compare this to Health's earlier stuff you still have these really spectral vocals all these really ghostly sounds you still do have these dance elements but this track was really straightforward really poppy really danceable and really accessible I mean this thing it sort of seems like it's a totally different band when you compare to some of the noisier tracks off and get color and also had a really great structure even though it did repeat this kind of pop verse chorus verse kind of thing it really built you know it really felt like you know one verse wasn't the same as the next verse it just kept building and building and just kept getting bigger and then when that wash or distortion kind of came over the bridge it just felt like yes though this is most certainly not one of health's noisier tracks this thing is totally gonna fit into the dance aesthetic that a lot of these songs are going to be on this new remix album disco - may I say this track sounded maybe a little bit industrial - mm-hmm anyway you have some really great sounds on this track good structure with subtleties and in terms of style some very good influences to call back - and pretty much health right here is doing everything that they have done before this but just as good if not better I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this track I feel like the more I listen to it the more just grows on me and the catcher it becomes but give it a listen are you a health fan and even if you're not did you love this track did you hate this track and why also head over to the needle drop comm you can download this freaking thing over there right now - I believe keep being awesome Anthony Fantan Oh health disco to USA boys 
II-Dj_gtRL4,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd going to do an album review of the new Crystal Castles album Crystal Castles Canadian electronica duo Crystal Castles have finally followed up their 2008 self-titled debut with an LP that is also self-titled and when Crystal Castles got big a couple years ago there was a lot of drama and controversy over them they're sampling this they're stealing that they're dressing like this it's just a little bit I don't give of all I know is the first album is a fantastically diverse display of electronic music styles there are a lot of bases covered on that first LP like shoegaze experimental techno Digital hardcore and even chip tunes so with all these different sounds it wasn't the most cohesive album in the world but still each track was good great awesome yeah good album all the way through I don't care how many different styles you do as long as the songs are all good hmm I think Crystal Castles do is a lot more cohesive a lot of you guys have heard the track dough dear but believe me the album never reaches that level of aggression again once that track rolls by there are a few spots where you're going to have some shrieking vocals from Alice glass that are a lot like like on the track baptism but for the most part this thing is a pretty clear exercise in just left-field chilled out techno along side sounds of ethereal shoegazing yes it's important there's a lot more reverb floating around in the mix on some of these tracks and there are a lot more walls of sound like what you may have heard on the tracks elastica and there are a lot of great standout moments too like there's a fantastic sigur rós sample on the track year of silence suffocation has this really cool atmosphere so cool that it's almost minty and it has some beautiful fragile vocals from Alice glass on the song too and Vietnam has a great build up into these crunchy sins that to sound like they could be sound tracking mad max or something like that but I didn't like every track which was kind of a disappointment for me because that is how I felt about the first album for me the opening track doesn't bring anything to the table and if you guys saw my recent track review you pretty much know how I feel about Celeste Iike fit and the songbirds has this really persistent electronic glitch that every single time it plays it feels like I'm getting needles shoved into my eardrums over and over but still I have to give it to this LP for creating an interesting electronic atmosphere and putting together at least 10 decent songs in my eyes in my eyes however the new songs on this album that I like I feel myself kind of gravitating toward them because they sound eerily close to songs on the first album not to get too deep into track names but some moments and baptisms sound an awful lot like the track vanished from the first LP and the vocal sampling on Europe silence sounds a lot like the vocal sampling on Crystal Castles health remix crime wave but there are still moments where Crystal Castles takes the opportunity with this album to experiment outside of their comfort zone and get a little louder get a little quieter and just kind of stretch out their sound and their musical vocabulary so at the end of the day my feelings on this LP are kind of mixed I mean yeah we know a lot of this LP sounds good but it's only because we know these sounds sound good already I can't say this LP is as good as the first album for me not by a long shot but it's still a decent release and there's no reason to lose faith in Crystal Castles or any bit like that I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this thing yeah thinking of life 7 but as we all know this thing has come out digitally it's all over the internet already you've probably listened to it and if you have did you love it did you hate it why let me know down there comment box anthony Fantana Crystal Castles Crystal Castles forever you 
jd8olhovn6w,"it's track review music nerd and yeah before we get into this video I want to say a couple things I want to say that this Thursday the date I am going to do a blog TV let's say at about 6 o'clock 6 o'clock p.m. Thursday gonna do a blog TV couple hours one or two hours I would put it up here on the whiteboard but as you can see my marker is cached it is also I want to say album of the week Pink Floyd's animals because it's cool one more thing I would write up on the whiteboard right now is that we're past 3,500 subscribers that's insane I can't wait to get to 36 I'm freaking out free Kim out all right this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion thanks for being awesome thanks for watching anyway picture well not really a picture this is a single picture of the single that this track comes from it's the first record that the band blur has put out in seven years of course these guys being the band that broke song number two second song song two numbered song song - everyone knows that track it really popularized these guys in the u.s. dare I say it and of course the frontman for that band Damon Albarn has gone on to make some fantastic music with gorillas if you guys haven't checked out Plastic Beach I did a review of that album earlier this year great LP fantastic songs on it you really got to be listening to that especially if you like this song like I said first record in seven years it's a single Parlophone records printed 1000 copies of this single that the band put out sort of for Record Store Day to sort of stand in solidarity with record stores around the world and I do appreciate that I do dig that sentiment but still for the fans but to have more stuff for the record stores to sell the record store some more money you do more justice to the record stores good times but I digress the new single is called Fool's Day look for a link to it in the d box it's good listen to it blur Fool's Day you know what the first thing that hit me about that track was just how gray it was I felt like gray there were clouds in the sky there was rain just really gray day but the thing is the song itself wasn't grey it kind of just played grey grey was the concept it sort of seemed like it wanted to play with the idea of being boring and mundane and uneventful the lyrics kind of talking about everyday life and things kind of slipping into just monotony and just apathy really felt like this track was just about to give up on life but again it was more of a concept than an actuality it kind of reminded me of a less post-punk version of a track that I know titled right there cuz I can't remember in the top of my head of a song on the first Gang of Four record just kind of you know play this is everyday life this is just really played with this idea of bleakness however what made it so easy to latch on to that idea was the fact that the songwriting was so good the track was so catchy great vocal melody they're really good guitar sounds I love the sound of the guitar in this track just so clear and just crystal just really crystalline shimmering kind of guitars and just great drum sounds on there too I look how mechanical and just how straightforward and just how mmm just playing the drums sound is really kind of played into the whole concept of the track and even though it doesn't have a huge emphasis on reverb or vocals it still feels really dreamy kind of surreal maybe like it's not actually happening there's some really subtle moments of distortion and feedback in the background just moments that you're going to catch it upon repeated since to this thing and really make it have a lot of replay power in my opinion the whole track is great it's just really easy on the ears easy to latch on to easy to enjoy they're taking everyday life they're boiling it down to simply boredom and then taking boredom making an art and then making boredom interesting if that makes sense I'm feeling alighted on this I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this really great track um I wish I had the single I wish I had a little 45 but still go down there in the D box listen to this track if you guys liked it you guys hated it tell me why anthony Fantana blur forever you "
