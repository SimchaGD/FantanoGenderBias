87YplHEgJ2c,hi everyone hi have any tom tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new pianos become the teeth record keep you these guys are a Baltimore rock band their third album is this album their second I reviewed in 2011 it feels like it was so much more recent but I vividly remember coming away from this record feeling like hey the band has some good production and they sound together while they're playing you know like tightness but as far as the style the sound the musical composition of this record it was just emo by the numbers these guys were just not stand out in a face of new young groups who are worshiping at the altar of cap and jazz and American football pianos become the teeth just really didn't have a musical identity of their own and yeah that's how I felt and now it seems that with their new record here they have changed they have taken it upon themselves to change their sound change their style and it's a pretty bold and surprising change the band has slowed down the tempos of many of their songs very mild drumming on this thing playing it very straight the guitar tones on this thing are reminiscent of some 2000s era post-rock like some explosions in the sky or this will destroy you and for the most part they're really impassioned screams and shouts that were all over the last record aren't really on this record rather now the vocals are way calmer they are sadder they are intelligible you can hear what the words are saying now there are definitely still some emo influences wafting around in the air now that the band has like burned their old sound to the ground and this might come out in like a chord progression or a guitar melody or maybe like a quivering vocal that is maybe a little Conor Oberst esque but now after this change the band just sounds like some faceless 90s college rocks throwaway band that nobody remembers now because they weren't really good then while they were active they were really middle-of-the-road because they couldn't decide they couldn't decide whether or not they wanted to go more mainstream go more underground go for more of a REM goo goo dolls Bush three doors down kind of sound maybe a little matchbox 20 or something in there for good measure I wouldn't say this record sounds quite that poppy but that's the thing it only borders on sounding like that but it also just borders on sounding like something sort of emotionally pained and potentially interesting I get this serious sense of sadness from a lot of these songs but it only really ever comes from some of the forced vocal performances and the very reverb cavernous atmosphere around this instrumentation rarely do I actually hear a lyric or like a melody that actually touches me in any way emotionally when it comes to lyrics and melodic writing listening to this album is kind of like staring into a void of nothingness so not only is this record under written but it feels like pianos become the teeth don't really know what side of the fence they want to sit on what kind of crowd they want to appeal to what kind of sound they want to create because even though the band is coming through with a new sound on this new record I just feel like I'm getting another undefined nondescript set of songs that in comparison with the last album are most definitely uninteresting I think inferior simply because the performances are way way way less riveting this record is offensively inoffensive I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana pianos become the teeth forever 
VBFkzgB-9zQ,aha hi everyone blunt theny ich tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the New Zealand banks record broke with expensive tastes Azealia Banks is a new york-based singer and rapper and this is her repeatedly postponed full-length debut album broke with expensive taste I didn't think it was going to happen but here it is existing at this point it's funny to think that it's been it's been three years since the release of azalea's biggest and break out iasts single - one - but even though it's taken a long time for this record to see the light of day Zelia has done a pretty good job of maintaining people's attention because she's kept a steady stream of singles coming out she had a mixtape drop in EP and she has had many a Twitter beef since the release of - one - as well some of her lashing out was even directed at fellow collaborators like Pharrell on the song a TM jam which was one of her least successful singles and she was pretty quick to put the blame on Pharrell for that but the thing is a lot of the singles Banks was releasing between - one - and this record were not even really that great and even the good ones were still showing some chinks in her armor for one she's not that versatile of a rapper and she's a kind of subpar singer - still there aren't that many notable hip-hop artists out right now that are fusing rap music with house at least not the way that they used to in the days of Missy Elliott and Rob bass and even Technotronic artists whose influences ring pretty clear in say Leah's music and the song - one - is undeniably one of the best singles hip house has had in years given the distance between this album and - one - I'm kind of in my head left questioning are we just going to have another Kreayshawn here sort of an overnight sensation who just waited too long to capitalize on her one single hit and also completely lacks the potential to come out with another viral single but personally I can't really see it playing out like that I think we're going to hear more from Azalea in the future because as far as the Kreayshawn comparison she is on another talent level she sounds great on a beat she's got flow even though I'm not always in love with her singing I do think the Mel that she tries to sing a lot of the time aren't too bad and I also don't get the sense that her music is is novelty in any way even though some of her singles have been pretty awful and even though that Atlantis video was completely gross and tasteless Azalea is a serious musician zeliha is really trying on this record and the results are here for the most part she brings on a series of very reputable interesting producers on this LP Machinedrum loan MJ Cole a rap music one track here grabs a very brave and interesting enon sample and we also have vodka even Ariel pink among others I actually like a lot of the instrumentals on this record even on some tracks where I don't like azalea's singing at all like on the opener here the Bee is pretty progressive and kind of interesting but when the lyrics and the songwriting coming together with a good instrumental we get a great track like on give me a chance the song that I mentioned has that enon sample really funky bass line and drum break on this thing and then toward the end of the track it makes a surprise turn into Latin music totally changes up the beat we get a great horn section and Zelia is even rapping in Spanish it's ambitious and really turns out great Azealia drifts away from some of the house instrumentals that were used to hearing her on and hops on a few bangers which I'm glad she did for the sake of variety like on heavy metal and reflective I like her lyrics on this track although I think that the song really could have used a hi-hat regardless the track has a completely unexpected Blade Runner reference inside of it then we have desperado fantastic song MJ Cole actually did the production here I love the UK garage flavored instrumental on this thing the haunting melody the desperado vocal sample the song instrumentally is top-notch and as far as Elia goes she works her way into this preconceived beat pretty well we get the song BBD another trap electro flavored banger with some pretty good lyrics as well the song ice princess which is more lyrical brags but as Elia works in a ton of cold and ice and winter references throughout this track and we also get the songs to unto and young Rapunzel she's still trying to get mileage out of these older stale singles though they still don't sound that bad here and and still add to the overall character of the record - one - I hope you've heard and young rapunzel is easily one of her most interesting singles even if you don't think it's one of her best which features some strange screams really loud coughing this beat it's like she's pulling from some Atari teenage riot or even some prodigy the song is dark it's epic it's wild I can't deny it even though I didn't expect it this record has quite a bit going for it but it's also got a lot of downsides and feels like an album put together by somebody who in the music industry is relatively rare and behind the ears it feels very much like a debut album that doesn't know what direction it wants to go in not only that but there are elements of this record that just aren't that polished like the singing constantly azalea just functions off of these sort of corny musical theater inspired vocal inflections where she just throws her voice she's just singing from the back of her throat most of the time well it sounds like she's just putting on a voice or when she's rapping she's just throwing her voice down a few registers trying to give the appearance that her voices is deeper than it really is which is just not the case because what she tries to sing in her lower register that is where she is missing the most notes I feel like Azealia tries to give us these kind of over-the-top maybe somewhat theatrical inflections but she doesn't have the range or the passion or the power to really sell it in the same way someone like Lady gaga someone who is similarly excessive when it comes to vocals and we get weak singing on track after track after track soda Wallis luxury and the closer whereas Elyas vocals are actually mixed really horribly with the beat the song just sounds like a demo and it's maybe the worst way the album could have ended there are moments where I'm impressed with azalea's beat choices when I like her flow when her rapping isn't that bad or her lyric writing but when it comes to her singing it's like the smoke screen just drops and it's revealed that instead of listening to a gray album I'm watching some toddlers and tiaras style talent show which is not cute when the contestants are in their 20s and I can't even begin to talk about how ridiculous and unnecessary the song nude beach go-go was on this record which again is just Azealia singing over an instrumental over a track that is going to be on Ariel Pink's new record I hope Ariel pick out a good paycheck out of this because she took a perfectly good song and turned it into something that sounds like it's from the bye-bye birdie soundtrack on Maui and this song actually makes me rethink the whole Azealia Banks not being novelty thing I said toward the beginning of this review because there are so many beats on this record that have a life outside of Zee Leah's music it just seems like she's not really writing or creating a lot of these songs but just finding beats and then just singing and rapping over them and sometimes magic happens over the course of that process and it seems like a Zelia really reclaims an instrumental as her own and it would be hard to imagine that instrumental without her listening to it again but a lot of the time I just feel like I'm kind of getting some like really weak watered-down mixtape type material or just like bad karaoke where you make up your own words I'm feeling a strong v to light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Azealia Banks broke with expensive tastes forever 
JKMyr5J9J-Q,I could be eBay's hi everyone Kathy plantino here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new wild birds and peace drums record rhythm wild birds and peace drums is a husband-wife musical duo they hail from Sweden this is their third full-length studio album if you're not counting the compilation sister EP record they put out back in 2010 typically wild birds and peace drums records feature the fantastic singing of miriam will lenten and the fantastic drumming of berlin and that's pretty much it the duo is able to embrace influences hailing from jazz and art pop and maybe even a little bit of a folk music and blues too but just with drums and vocals a lot of the time of course on their sophomore record the snake they did bring in some extra instrumentation to I guess kind of progress past they're very minimal beginnings on their debut album and even though it's been about eight years since the release of the snake it's not that Miriam and andreas haven't been busy or doing other things they of course last year together worked on Miriam solo record Miriam the believer not to say that she did the album all by herself but on this record it felt like more of a solo effort because she was really flexing her singer/songwriter muscles and let's also not forget and Riis's and Marian's participation in the fire orchestra who came out with two albums recently both of which they participated on and now that they've done their thing in in fire orchestra they came out with that amazing blood donation Marian the believer record they are getting back to the roots of what made them so popular in the first place and that's wild birds and peace drums now this thing is nine tracks it's 40 minutes and sonically it's not quite as minimal as their early stuff there are tracks that are simply for the most part just vocals and drums like the song ghosts and pains the intro track of this LP which rides heavy on a lot of vocal refrains making it very catchy despite its instrumental simplicity along with the song who I was which is the shortest track on the I record and maybe the most infectious to Merriam's vocals sounding amazing on this track so powerful so much range so much passion few singers could carry a record with just drums and and Miriam is certainly one of those voices and of course with many of these tracks just being vocals and drums lyrics kind of stick out like a sore thumb and a lot of the lyrics on this record at least from what I can observe seem to have a lot to do with relationships love and not just like this initial kind of lust fueled love more of like this long-term interconnectedness and the joy that can come from that be complications that can come from that this message was very perfectly displayed in the cover and single art for this record now there are tracks that feature other instrumental accompaniment but what comes into play is very subtle like with the song the offbeat which features quite a bit of vocal overdubbing maybe if you vocal samples here and there and some very quiet but sporadic jumpy and somewhat glitchy synthesizers that progressively get louder as the song moves on feels like something that could have been lifted out of an LCD Soundsystem track the song keeps some hope seems to be aided by quite a bit of vocal overdubbing as well and then there's a big bassline helping out the usual drum and vocal work on the track gold-digger there's also this growing ethereal atmosphere that i think is coming through with some just reverb soaked background vocals on the back end of this track - and just with all of this sonic color being put into the song this track would have fit pretty comfortably on Miriam solo LP there are some moments where like a really primal drum beat that is fast paced and just intense or some really kooky background vocals might remind me of like a a tune yards record or something like that but not as much of a pop appeal way more raw way more energetic it's more of just a comparison than an influence or anything like that because these songs also sound like wild birds and peace drums previous stuff it's not a comparison I just want to do to death for the most part the additional layers which are very quiet a lot of the time work really well they work in favor of this album's appeal the only moment that I think it works against this record is the song soft wind soft death where we have Miriam singing she's multi-tracked her voice so many times to the point where her vocals are huge they're slow they're sweeping they're gorgeous I love the melody of this track but the drumbeat which fades in to the track we didn't get a hard start on this song we get this kind of weird fade like we're happening upon the middle of this song just feels like it's coming from a completely different world the vocals and the drums may be working at the same tempo but it's almost as if the pacing and the groove of the vocals isn't really complemented by the drums and vice-versa there are also some moments like the closing track on here the feature some really interesting maybe slightly Kate Bush esque spoken-word passages despite being built out of such a simple instrumental foundation this record stays somewhat varied and and entertaining um nearly every track here wild birds and peace drums just come with the same fantastic level of talent they usually do but maybe with just a little bit more accessibility on these new tracks I'm feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing transition if you've given this record of listened what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana wild birds and peace drums 
EdX73QXbBmk,hi everyone cliff Inigo aptana here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new KO dot record coffins on io KO dot is a new york-based rock band fronted by songwriter singer multi-instrumentalist just experimental music workhorse tobe driver there was quite a bit of knowledge experience and ability at Toby's disposal in his musical projects it shows with the wide array of fantastic musicians that he's worked with over the years it shows in all the genres that he's explored in Ko Dada chamber music experimental and avant-garde metal death metal progressive rock and jazz fusion all of these flavors actually turning up on the band's last full-length record Bardot quite a long record and an ambitious record to compositionally and conceptually with a very strange story running congruently through all of the tracks there are a variety of vocal styles on this record a variety of genres as I just said there are some intense spots and loud spots some absolutely gorgeous moving and beautiful spots on this thing too but all of this ability often in my opinion drives kayo da and Toby into maybe a little too much indulgence or maybe even negligence because we do have records like coyote and Gamma Knife whose production is seriously underwhelming and just a little too low fight a completely complement the ambition and the musical style on these albums I absolutely do appreciate that these records are not over produced in the way that a lot of progressive metal and progressive rock albums these days are but under production is not really all that preferable either however in the case of Hvar doe that records recording was stellar but as I said occasionally it could be kind of long-winded or just have some really unrewarding musical passages or just some lackluster vocal performances maybe they go on assuming something is a little more interesting than it is because it's may be different than what the last track was doing or it's a relatively new sound for them in this feeling of adventure over quality that I get on Keo dots records was just a little confirmed for me the moment I put this album on from there just from the opening track because it became very apparent very quickly that this wasn't gonna just be a progressive rock album it wasn't just gonna be a progressive metal album or an experimental rock album we are essentially getting some prog mixed with some darkwave some gothic rock with a generous helping of synthesizers of course it is not surprising to hear the longest track as the first track on this entire record the track can be a little challenging but not necessarily for the right reasons the synthesizers are a little high in the mix they're kind of farty they sound gaudy the false set of vocals the watery guitars the kind of start/stop groove that this thing is riding on their characteristics about this track I don't really care for but the song at the core of this music to me is is actually not that bad and this song does do a good job of I guess setting the tone and the flavor of this record this song essentially works in three parts with some sudden crescendos erupting at the 4 and the 8 minute marks both changes are great but just before they occur the band starts just border on sounding kind of mundane mostly because I feel like they continue to pile one on top of the other some progressive rock it's some goth rock cliches sometimes the music just sounds a little too self-absorbed and on top of it the vocals while impassioned can come off just a little ghoulish this song could take a little while to digest I recommend listening to a more than one time especially if you're into goth rock or progressive rock but the next track on here off-ramps cycle pattern 22 the vocals here are so unbelievably amateurish and the instrumentation in the background just continues to cycle over a lot of the same grooves who's the needle person and the very finish of this song sounds like a comedic ly spooky synth rock odyssey while there are moments on this record that I like there are a lot of aspects to these songs like I said that they just border on me taking these tracks sort of intolerable and when I'm not getting vocals that I just don't really care for sometimes the band is repeating through musical pieces without that much progression or tension like with the song library subterranean I like the end of this track the very hard-hitting odd time progressive rock riffs all over this track are really fiery as they start but as they continue I feel like things just lose intensity I think this track could have used just a little bit more than some screaming saxophone to keep this musical passage interesting the only thing really keeping this part of the song alive to me is the drummer who is absolutely amazing now with the song that I heard first off of this record assassination of Adam fantastic track most aggressive track on the entire record really noisy walls of guitars and drums I love the downstroke guitar riffs on this thing really pummeling great groove but there are moments where the sort of low fire recording of this track holds back the intensity of the noisy instrumentation when I go into a Khao da record it's it's just so weird because there's so many things that I like there's so many things I admire there's so many things I think are top-notch and fantastic but then there are things that I don't care for at all or really just ruin a track for me and what's funny is that it's never the same thing it's never one thing I can never predict what it is I'm going to like or dislike about a Keo dot song this vocal performance isn't that good the recording here is just okay this part is mixed really weird this parts a little repetitive this parts a little long-winded but on the flip side here's a captivating melody there are some great guitar playing there are some amazing drumming the record ends sort of as long-winded as it began but maybe with not as interesting writing or as compelling a performance but I still came away from this record liking much of what I heard I guess as long as Toby and Kay ODOT continue to adventure and experiment I will always be interested in hearing what they do next because it will be different it will be refreshing in some way shape or form Kyodai is pretty good at keeping me intrigued even if they're not always keeping me entertained I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition a few given this tracker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan o KO dot forever

3SA8qhEpSTg,hi everyone each Sinise crashed an O here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new arca a lemn zen hey Dori nori come here Oh duh baby isn't it Oh baby this little baby's so cute ARCA is the pseudonym of a Venezuelan electronic music producer who has been having a pretty great past couple of years back in 2012 mr. Alejandro Garcia here released a couple of EPS on uno NYC records these EPS outside of a few websites and some core fans didn't really drum up a huge buzz for arca but it did end up landing him a co-producer credit on Kanye West's last full-length LP not only that but he got in on the ground floor with one of this year's most exciting singers fka twigs entirely producing her second EP and taking part in her fantastic new album as well and now that he has this newfound buzz he seems to be pulling back a little bit and concentrating on his solo stuff releasing a full-length commercial debut right here on mute records now Arcas material on these past aps some incredibly strange and unorthodox stuff some really glitchy and warped combinations of hip-hop and electronic music to the point where it was kind of difficult to tell where one genre started and the other ended listening to these EPS though they may be incredibly abstracted points there are arca isms here that also show up on the new fka twigs records so that there is a pretty clear connection this artist made these sounds here then he made them here and I see these similarities however these similarities aren't quite as apparent when I listen to Zen arca seems to be doing something pretty different on this record there aren't as many commonalities here with his past work there are 15 tracks on this thing they number up to 40 minutes and even though they may be very explorative and strange just like the music on the stretch EPS a lot of the hip-hop influences have completely just dissipated many tracks here are actually kind of boundary-less synthetic motifs mitii Diddy's if you will there are moments where I feel like I'm not listening to the guy that produced fka twigs I'm listening to OneNote Rick's point never or maybe one of the more abstract names and 90's IDM this is especially true of tracks like sad bitch and failed and held together and promise there's nothing awful about these tracks but I guess I was kind of surprised at just how minimal Arcos approach was on much of this record there are moments when I'm kind of underwhelmed by the synth work even though the Tambor maybe some of the few effects laid onto these sense might be interesting the performances and the playing are actually not that inspiring especially on a track like family violence which is just like a junk pile of fake strings too busy tripping over itself to actually play anything coherent even though I appreciate the experimental nature of some of these songs this is not the genre bending and defying production that was on those stretchy EPS that was on that ampersand mixtape this is kind of predictable despite its lack of accessibility the meteor and more layered tracks in the track listing here are actually much more enjoyable even if many of them are as structureless or as boundary-less as many of the more simple stripped back tracks here like the title track here which kicks off with these strange horrifying horror movie sound effects right at the start mash with these huge hits of sub bass there are some skittering rhythms here and some really eerie sinfully it's moments like this where this record sounds super unique and I wish our code just delivered more instances or the song thievery which is just as cavernous and strange and warp but there's like this reggaeton rhythm underneath these icy synths and just a cacophony of percussion and samples the song tongue is creepy and spine-tingling as well with these high-pitched drones and really weird since stabs and the song sisters is one of the few moments here with a very loose instrumentation though it doesn't really lined up maybe it's not perfectly quantized or anything like that despite the looseness what the music is playing is actually pretty gorgeous especially the tambour of the since on this track it's like listening to light shining through diamonds but tracks like this only make up a portion of the record the best songs here find some really interesting combinations of beauty and darkness but for every moment there is like that there's also a kind of formless underwhelming interlude a musical bridge to nowhere I really like about half the tracks here I enjoy the aesthetic of the album anyway even if I'm not liking the composition of these songs I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana ARCA Zen forever 
2cOnW7CRGWw,uh-uh hi everyone strengthening board canto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new the world is a beautiful place and I'm no longer afraid to die album EP really between bodies these guys are a connecticut-based emo and indie rock act whose full-length debut album that came out not too long ago impressed me enough to talk about it because personally lately I have been mighty underwhelmed by much of what people would be calling the emo revival right now which I think naming it as such is a little disingenuous camera given that emo began in the mid 80s and has continued to exist as a thriving relevant underground rock movement since then not to mention that just ten years ago this genre was at its peak of cultural relevancy and it is no longer at that level of relevancy because every musical trend and movement has a shelf life it has a certain span of time at which it holds the general public's attention and you must either evolve or accept niche relevancy take jazz music into account which evolved heavily through the 50s the 60s and the 70s and punk music from the 70s the 80s and the 90s and emo has undergone similar evolutions as well but I'm finding very little novelty in this latest strain of groups but I get it emo is not really sold on the premise of being progressive or experimental rather cathartic emotionally the genre appeals through its Punk energy with an emphasis on melody and poetic lyrics and sort of twinkly guitars and impassioned vocal performances al be it a little angsty many of these newer groups have stuck very passionately to this blueprint and as has the world is a beautiful place however I did find this group to be a little bit more dynamic experimenting with post-rock huge chorus vocals even a little bit of sort of weird kitschy gimmicky novelty music on some of their EPS uses and they are on another experimental aunt on this new EP of theirs as well between bodies this time the band is providing instrumentals and some backing vocals occasionally some lead vocals as well as atop all of this instrumentation and singing we get spoken word from mr. Chris Suzumiya on nearly every track here Chris can be heard delivering these shouted declarations on life death times space stars the beginning the end pretty much everything and when I say everything I don't mean like bricks and bottles and ballpoint pens everything I mean I'm trying to say something super important and super deep right now everything and as I said earlier these poetic diatribes are supported by the world is a beautiful places typically slow twinkly melodic rock instrumentation these instrumentals are dynamic they progress in a very linear fashion maybe this is something the band is experimenting with a little bit more here because they're not working with a verse chorus verse structure they can just kind of move as they please as long as you can hear Chris's vocals audibly or maybe just sort of intensify as he intensifies some of the instrumentals are really slow burners they're growers some have a really strong backing beat they're a little straightforward and others are much more abstracted and noisy the band does a really great job of complementing Chris I think Chris does a great job of complementing the band performance wise I actually enjoyed this album quite a bit in concept even though this sort of thing has really turned me off in the past especially in the case of bands like listener where you're kind of getting these generic indie rock instrumentals is kind of playing in the background with some spoken word on top that is just cringe-worthy there's even something about the tracks on this EP that reminds me of a recent snap judgment story or performance that you can check on YouTube with someone a 15 year old by the name of Noah st. John telling a story about his mother's getting divorced and they're driving in this CRV and he thinks that they're going to break up in front of him but then fact he learns that they're going to be staying together and their family is forever and so on and so forth it's very moving to me this new EP kind of functions on a very similar premise however it's not quite as effective and in my opinion it could have been more effective because the recording on this thing is great the band plays really well I think the instrumentals they come together with are great the vocals are nice but after a few tracks on this record in my opinion Chris becomes difficult to stand honestly it's like he's trying to force this sense of importance in everything that he's saying he's trying to force this sense of emotional weight in everything that he's saying he's just freaking out over the most obvious and common of statements like oh we're made of the same stuff as the stars like maybe that statement has some kind of impact if you're hearing it for the first time on this record but that has been said again and again and again and there's nothing about Chris's approach to saying this line and many other adages on this record that is really all that stunning or emotionally moving not only that but I don't really feel like he backs up anything that he says because he seems just rattle off one abstract idea after another maybe there are some very real coherent tangible things that inspired some of these songs but you wouldn't really know it from just observing the lyrics in the abstract it's like Chris tries to get to everything and because he doesn't focus on any of it it sort of all adds up to nothing which is kind of a shame because I think in concept this EP was really great I like the instrumentals but the lyrics play just too big a part in the making of this record to just outright ignore them and just enjoy everything else about the record I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana have a nice day music forever 
rq-5t0XfQ4c,hi everyone Andy fans do here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a little rundown of my favorite records from the past few months as many of you know I spent a you know a little bit of time in Australia on September doing some speaking engagements and I spent much of the time of that month once I got back just kind of catching up from reviews and I didn't really get around to doing a favorite albums of that month video and now that October is over and out of the way and we were at the start of November I'm going to talk about my favorite albums from not just October but from September as well cool cool and also down there in the description box I will put a link to the loved list so far all the albums that I have loved so far and all the songs I have loved so far this year and the song list will have been updated by the time I put up this video so you will see the latest songs that I thought were worth paying attention to in that list let's get into these records to start the new bus driver record perfect hair if you're looking for some kind of Avant jazzy strange out there an abstract very technical and uppity uppity uppity hip hop music that's really just sort of pushing the envelope and might weird you out a little bit then give this new bus driver album a listen after that the new perfume genius record two bright singer-songwriter perfume genius this is his most instrumentally lush album yet it's gorgeous it's pretty just like his previous record put your back into it except up not quite as spacious or tender I love the gentle feel of put your back into it but if you felt that that album could have just been a little more hard-hitting then maybe too bright is the record for you this record is perfume genius is most straightforward LP yet some of his Poppaea songs so far and I think it I think it was a win next the new Ice Age record plowing into the field of love great post-punk noise rock goth rock record with a little bit of country influences here and there some folk music influences here and there really everything I loved about this band up until this point but with more instrumentation and some tracks that sound a little bit like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds next the new Flying Lotus album you are dead not an incredible night and day change or progression from his last few records but I think his most straightforward and hard-hitting record to date if you're looking for some strange electronic experimental hip-hop style instrumentals fused with jazz music then give this thing a listen the songs for the most part are short very much ear candy much like on many other Flying Lotus releases but I think on this record better than any other album the songs really work together to build an album that flows really well rarely do Flying Lotus of songs come together and feel like such a holistic piece next the new dope body album lifer the noise rock post-hardcore band dope body comes through with a record where they start to incorporate some grunge influences some psychedelic rock influences the production is noisy as hell and I love the songs on this thing it's just a great wild sweaty energetic rock record a lot like their last one but kind of in a different style as far as hardcore hip hop goes you cannot go wrong with the new run the jewels album rtj - the sequel to killer Mike and lp's self-titled debut as run the jewels and yeah I think I think this record was an improvement on most fronts on the beats on the guests on the hooks the bars the rapping were roughly the same in terms of quality but there's one thing that somebody mentioned to me in an email about my review of this record there were some tracks that did have some socio-political undertones that I didn't quite dive into too deeply but for the most part that is because so many tracks on this album have such violent cartoonishly violent overtones that that really kind of you know steals the show but still do understand that underneath this violence and underneath this aggression drives much of the record there are some smart clever socially aware statements to be made as well and finally the new botanist album VI flora this is an experimental low five very bright and blissful black metal record with drums vocals some bass guitar some harmonium on a track or two but not guitars but hammered dulcimer and it has led to a really interesting sound for this project a sound that no other black metal project has right now while it is very rough and it is very harsh and there are some very visceral tracks on this record for the most part the just the tambour of the dulcimer and just the the production sound of this record is so bright and so pleasant that it's got this really interesting mix of just her and Oh beautiful and those are my favorite full lengths from the past few months thank you for watching you're the best Anthony Fantana music forever 
IcU_E2quVBQ,hi everyone I love to me you tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Deerhoof record la snap bonito 20 years as a band and I believe this is their 13th full-length album if I'm wrong on that I'm sure in the comments you'll correct me over the years that they have been a band they've undergone numerous lineups some sound changes but it wasn't the 2000s that they kind of evolved into this style that they're working with currently which has made them one of the most fun-loving idiosyncratic rock and pop groups in the underground Deerhoof is one of those groups that sounds unique as a whole because there are so many unique individual parts that go into the finished product so Tomi is very light hi childlike vocals as well as her kind of esoteric and absurd lyrics Greg's very aggressive frantic groovy and danceable drumbeats and John and Ed's very sharp angular and sometimes very dissonant guitar leads the band is also well known for using some pretty strange chord progressions on their tracks - or time signatures and even though Deerhoof has settled into a pretty familiar style at this point they do make sure to throw in a few left hooks or surprises into every release they are constantly creative and in my opinion rarely disappoint if you're new to the band I suggest you try anything from the album apple o to friend opportunity but as far as their more recent stuff goes we have the album offend Maggie which was easily one of their most straightforward distorted and rough albums so far maybe even to a slight fault because so many of the songs on this record in my opinion sound very much the same because of the kind of harsh recording then we have versus evil which by contrast was a very dynamic and lush record at times with some of dear hopes most tender and beautiful songs yet while delivering their their usual collection of very uppity poppy catchy very fun tracks as well and on the record breakup song their previous record they experimented quite a on some tracks with some electronics some samples but on their latest here lie they seem to be getting back to basics not really fooling around with anything else other than the guitars drums and vocals that we know them for much like a fan Maggie this record has kind of a rough sound to it it's a little grimy the sound of the music here really speaks to the cover are you're looking at something kind of black and white grayscale but it's kind of distorted and warped too it's like watching epic Saturday morning cartoons on an old old television that is seriously on the fritz as you consume massive amounts of the most sugary cereals known to man the drums on this record they're loud they're booming they're harsh the bass is very resonant the guitars are very sharp and shrill and have kind of a very metallic tone to them they are sunburnt and so Tony's vocals are very loud they're very close in this loudness in this straightforwardness again this record reminds me of a fen Maggie but I think Deerhoof comes off a little more dynamic on this record writing some softer tracks some prettier tracks too and simultaneously deer hoof in my opinion actually delivers some of their heaviest material as well on this record this isn't the first time deer hoof has work with quirky extremes on a record of theirs and they do it again here pretty well too we have the song big house waltz which has this huge massive bass drone on it that's fit up against this killer drum be some awesome guitar melodies so Tomi brings forward these vocals at one point that sound like she's like a ringleader at a circus there's a really strange guitar passage toward the back end with the track deer hoof they might be writing something catchy but they always find a way to throw a wrench in the works and do something weird and the song exit only has one of the most aggressive heavy and hard-hitting drum beats and guitar riffs to ever land on a deer cuff album ever there's the song mirror monster one of the more gentle tracks on the LP that features all these fluttering guitars there's some very tender vocal melodies and harmonies on this thing I love the way the chord progression of this track ascends and resolves and there's the song black pitch which has this very twinkly pretty guitar intro that sounds a lot like something that would have been more marketable in the indie scene in the 2000s when Deerhoof was doing much weirder stuff as much as I like the harsh moments on this record it's nice to hear some pretty songs as well especially since the more beautiful spots were what attracted me so much to versus evil the one major downside to this track is the kind of abrupt ending and the closer Oh bummer is is another track that is a little softer a little more melodic though this track is maybe the dreariest of any song on the record with a vocal melody that's that's absolutely nightmarish and emotionally painful and Deerhoof make sure to balance tracks like this out with songs that are unbearably fun like the song doom which is loaded with melodies that sound like I'm on a psychedelic island filled with squawking polkadot parrots and dancing coconuts there's some pretty male/female vocals on this track as well and this is one of the few tracks on the record that kind of follows in an unpredictable linear structure there are a few tracks on this record that are kind of average for Deerhoof like paradise girls not amazing or totally new song for them but this track would be nice on a mix for a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar because that's what the song is about a girl who is smart and plays bass guitar and I wish the song God to was longer it's a really great instrumental that I wish just had more length to it and I wish that for a few other tracks on here too as creative and as fun as some of these songs are I kind of feel like Deerhoof came in brought some interesting ideas brought a great recording but sort of dipped out early on some of these tracks to me this is another entertaining album from Dieruff I wouldn't say there's anything incredibly ambitious about it in comparison with other Dieruff releases or that there's really anything that fantastic about the flow of this album either for sure there's a nice variety of songs here but it still kind of just feels like a standard mixed bag of tracks whose only continuous thread is the band style and the kind of Bhoomi shrill production what ends up saving this record and makes it great to listen to is that we have a lot of good songs here very good quirky fun rock songs that are sweet and very enjoyable in there unorthodoxy I'm feeling strong seven on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you look did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah Anthony Fantan oh dear huff forever 
ktiEB7Svutg,I was throwing nap and a Tuesday I think it's cuz I eat too much food hey I was throwing up and a Tuesday hi everyone why am I doing this Tara here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Slipknot album 0.5 the gray chapter Slipknot our Des Moines Iowa metal band known for their numerous members they're kind of creepy masks and for their massive popularity in the new metal movement in the 2000s in my first half of high school I was a pretty big fan of this band I caught them live at one point when I was younger I thought that their self-titled album was like the most hardcore shit on the planet and I bought Iowa when it first came out - and I love the hell out of that record as well but very soon afterwards I kind of fell out of favor with Slipknot not only because it seemed like frontman Corey Taylor was sort of spending a little bit more time with Stone Sour and I didn't really care for that band at the time I just I really hated sort of those dreary sad alternative metal bands like stained and in my opinion that's kind of the direction Stone Sour was going and so it was not vibing with that it was not my style I was young and angry and then on their next record vol 3 I started to hear that sad sappy stuff begin to leak into their sound and their style so I was just I used to really dig their stuff and and there are some groups from my teen years that I have gone back and ivory listened to some of which I've been able to enjoy more and appreciate but some groups like Slipknot have really not aged that well with time in my opinion because now when I listen to some of their older stuff I hear just a lot of cringe-worthy lyrics and lowbrow anger and very safe alt metal production and now that I listen to things more closely and I have a better grasp of instrumentation and production it's just very clear how non-essential some of the Bay members here are 2 Slipknot's core sound which is essentially guitars drums and vocals like many other bands in their genre but there are some things in Slipknot's music that I can look back upon fondly for one I think that their guitar tone is still pretty gnarly these days and Corey Taylor is maybe one of the most ravenous just Mad Men vocalist of nu metal I think he's a good screamer I think he's a good singer and though I may not always enjoy his lyrics there is a seriously real feeling of anguish and frustration that comes through in his performances as a kid I loved Slipknot for their extremity like I said I thought their self-titled record was like the most hardcore shit ever but then once I got in hardcore punk and later into grindcore and some thrash metal and death metal and some black metal more recently in doom metal 2 what made for extreme music was instantly reframed I had heard harder heavier faster and mean our music Slipknot no longer scratches those itches for me which essentially leaves them standing on the pretty flimsy leg of songwriting which I think they used to have a really strong prominent element of on their early stuff tracks like wait and bleed are still pretty decent tracks and I think they did a really good job of melding pop hooks with their extreme aggression on Iowa even better with songs like heretic if you fought fat sack jack socks as well as people equal shit still today I think that sound kicks ass and I think Iowa does the best job of any record in Slipknot's discography when it comes to just putting the Slipknot mission statement out there the fast riffs the pummeling drums the self-loathing lyrics the nihilism the hatred of humanity but since Iowa the band has kind of sweeten their sound and now that they've done that and I guess now that I've heard other things they're not exactly as menacing as they used to be there are some songs on this record like scar tast Rafi great title that get the fifteen-year-old inside of me clenching fess and getting into mosh stance there are some familiar themes on the song of being sort of an outsider being misunderstood not taking the world's crap killing everything that killed you I was really impressed on this track by the passage of very warped tremolo guitars set against some very fast speedy blast beats it sounded really twisted but on this song as well and on a few other moments too we get some turntable scratching set up against these new metal riffs and instantaneously the album just sounds so tasteless and dated there are other equally aggressive tracks but very few of them are actually as catchy as scart Astra fee or approaching original violence which i think is another decent track know when Slipknot go poppy and catchy which I know they can do while staying aggressive the whole time when they go poppy and catchy they incorporate these sweet clean voiced ultra melodic hooks which in their defense wait and bleed is one of those tracks but that track does not quite step over the cleanliness line that a song like the devil and I does which considering that title there's no reason for this hook to sound that wimpy if I wanted this kind of vocal overacting I would go listen to disturbed you know you're in a weird situation where you were thinking of reasons to listen to disturbed but maybe in a weird way I would prefer to do that than listen to a song like kill pop which it seems like Corey Taylor is diving into this like self-harming narrative revolving around this girl in my opinion Slipknot does not do sad well they do not do sorrow well I get them on that aggression level there I feel like they really know that very well but when they go sad it just sounds so melodramatic it sounds so forced it sounds so corny and though they may be addressing some serious topics when they do when they perform a sadder song rarely does the depression actually translate through so that completely rules out many a track on this record for likeability then as I said earlier you have a lot of these aggressive tracks that you know are no longer at that level of her that I am now sort of adjusted to I guess and then compiled that with all the lotion II throw pillow sweet tea choruses all over this record and there's just not much here for me and that's all I can really say I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition if you get in this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Slipknot forever 
DmjuddymqGM,hi everyone anime money tornado here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new black milk record if there's a hell below black milk detroit MC and producer he's been at it for over a decade now and he is dropping his sixth full-length album right here a record i was kind of surprised was coming out so fast given that his last full-length album was out just a year ago no poison no paradise and of course i was looking forward to this album because I enjoyed that album the production on this record is grimy it's low Phi it's jazzy it's funky there are loads of textured synthesizers peppered throughout these beats if you're into people like J Dilla or mad lib or Kareem brigands you're gonna enjoy the beats on this record I still had my minor reservations with black milks rapping as I had on some of his previous records but uh no poison no paradise black milks lack of enthusiasm and technical skill was made up for by some of his most personal verses yet a lot of songs on this record were coming from a sort of dark introspective and occasionally nostalgic place and maybe there was a chance that this next record of his would be even more hellish and dark given that the title is if there's a Hell below that's what I thought in theory but in actuality this record isn't really all that hellish no more hellish than no poison no paradise there are a few exceptions in the tracklist here but for the most part the beats on this new record come from roughly the same place and milk's delivery is roughly the same as well not that I expect a whole ton of progression within a year's time but there's such a lack of progression on this record that Black Milk openly revisits topics that he talked about on his last album whether that be some of his family or just trying to survive and continue and stay successful in hip-hop I guess all I can say about this record is that Black Milk is at what I suppose is a very reflective point in his career and he just feels affordable rapping about what he knows like on the song what it's worth which is another visit to black milk's mental hustle in the hip-hop industry reminding himself of why he does what he does for his fans for his fans it's not that exciting but the determination is admirable then there's tracks like leave the bones behind with blue and blues guest verse isn't bad but this song is severely under produced it's like just a loop from a song used as a beat which I guess there are fantastic songs that in the past function off of that simplicity that minimalism but it doesn't really keep the track interesting here especially since Black Milk isn't really that electrifying of a rapper to begin with the song every day was is another nostalgic look into black milk's past with him being in school kids banging on desks making beats causing ruckus dropouts failed rap dreams and another similarly muddy vocal hook that feel a little cloudy in the same way that the vocals were kind of cloudy on black notes last record then we get tracks on here like scum with random acts which is the trio that Black Milk has made music with previously featuring Sean price and guilty Simpson and this song has some decent verses from guilty and Sean though I do kind of cringe just a little bit at that you rap dude do but on top of that this song doesn't really feel like one song but rather three different songs because the beat changes up significantly when guilty enters the picture when Sean enters the picture and it's like things shift so much that I don't even feel like I'm listening to the same track anymore and there are other tracks here that feels similarly disjointed or have like a little weird instrumental interlude tacked on right at the end of the track that doesn't really add anything to the equation for me the most fun and interesting track on the entire record which is also maybe the most unorthodox track for Black Milk is Detroit's new dance show which has this awesome beat that sounds like I don't know the the the backing instrumental to what would be a dance music competition on like some public-access television show where people are just popping and locking in breakdancing black milk has some alright lyrics on this track but I have to admit I don't really love the song for its lyrics as much as I do it's instrumental flavor and its groove there's also the song story in her which when it begins it kind of starts like an inconspicuous old love old flame old crush story where Black Milk is meeting up with someone who at one time he had feelings for she never really gave him the time of day she was with other guys and meeting up with her later in life she is interested now they get together and then there is a super crazy twist ending that I did not expect at all so Black Milk does have a few tricks up his sleeve in the tracklisting here but much of what he delivers on this record is relatively average for him at this point in his career I'm getting a lot of the same ideas and expressions and themes that I did on his last LP but for reasons of either production or lyric writing or lack of hook or something like that the material is just a little less compelling Black Milk really is treading some water on this record and he's delivered some less interesting instrumentals and there are some tracks here especially with the last two songs and the track listing that feel more like they are motifs ideas for songs than they are fully realized and fleshed out songs I did come away liking this album for the most part but you know nowhere near loving it or amazed or surprised I'm feeling a light too decent 6 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why

-JypvZFqPuM,hi everyone dandy try potato here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pharmacon record beast eale burden pharmacon is the musical project of noise maker margaret Chartier she is on her second full-length album here for sacred bones records a label that kind of took a risk signing her because she toys with a genre that the label doesn't necessarily cater to all the time that genre being power electronics one of the most harsh unforgiving and difficult subgenres in modern music the only thing grosser than Margaret's music are her album covers maggots but also making it difficult to get into this music a lot of people who make power electronics are incredibly prolific they will drop limited-run editions of their music onto tape the live performances of this music are often freakish and very loud very ear piercing it's not the kind of scene that tries to cater to the average music listener whether that comes to its sound the way these people structure their albums the way they market themselves and get their music out there so it's interesting to see an artist like Margaret who is in this genre making so much headway though I would argue her music is not 100% power electronics not even close really there's a mix of death industrial and just industrial noise in there as well all genres and labels aside mark Barger it makes tortured hellish music with very shrill demonic screams cavernous reverb heavy primal percussion and some searingly loud electronics it is not pleasant but for someone who enjoys harsh overwhelming dissonant and sometimes disorienting music it is only sometimes that pharmacon reaches that benchmark and then is able to hold on to it take the song intent or instinct for example as noisy as this song is it gets pretty mundane pretty fast it reaches a certain level of density with it's very simple rhythms with it's cycling feedback loop that plays over and over and over and over and the vocals too but then once it reaches that point it just plateaus for the duration of the track we get no significant progression or variation that leads the song to get more intense or more interesting it's sort of like jumping into a scalding hot bathtub only for it to get cold just a minute or two later I feel the same way about the track auto-immune and as far as the title track on this thing goes it's got some pretty simple but also dark backing instrumentation which only serves as a very bland foundation for Margaret's vocal freakout on the song which to me wasn't even really that blood-curdling not as much as other tracks here not as much as tracks off her debut record for sacred bones though I really did like the noisy intense finish of this track there are essentially four meaty songs on this record but then there are two other more inconsequential interlude tracks one of which kicks the record off doesn't sound that bad but one is kind of like a series of chokes coughs it sounds almost as if Margaret is making herself gag or throw up and is just recording the audio and then she kind of set a rhythm to it in my opinion the best track on this entire record is body betrays itself and that's mostly because it has the most significant progression out of any song not only that but the electronics on this thing just had this beautiful metallic ringing quality to them that is just really ear piercing the vocals are frightening and the rhythms are really nice they're pummeling they flow in a really fluid manner there's something about the groove and just the lumbering quality of this tracker reminds me of like some early swans stuff it's moments like this where pharmacon gets particularly twisted and Margaret's moans are like really really anguished the wall of electronics on this track is huge its massive this is the only moment on the record that in my opinion the aesthetic the quality of the aesthetic is met by the quality of the composition and that's a meeting that doesn't happen on the other tracks here in my opinion pharmacon has style but most of these tracks don't contain enough detail to keep the emotional intensity high I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this record transition if you given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music pharmacon scary scary forever 
uNgQD02sJYc,I am a person hey hey hey hey hi everyone fat Tony that tan though here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new botanist record 6 flora botanist is a one-man black metal project that is had a number of albums released thus far if we are to go by the Roman numerals on this record you can assume that this is the sixth installment of the ongoing botanist musical saga and even though I am reviewing this project just now I have been conscious of it for a while and while I can't say I have been a fan of the bottom use ik I have found it pretty interesting in that the approach taken to black metal in this project is kind of experimental it's lo-fi there is also hammered dulcimer yes hammered dulcimer which is a pretty strange choice for a black metal record and on previous botanist releases I thought it was just a little gimmicky however on this latest release we see the incorporation of some bass guitar and some harmonium and this hammered dulcimer is typically just compressed it's distorted it's just overblown to the point where it sounds kind of like a distorted guitar and now on this latest release we are getting the inclusion of some bass and some keyboards harmonium specifically this record is botanist at its most wonderful beautiful sounding most detailed botanist has one foot in the old harsh lo-fi world of black metal and another foot in the grave new world of black metal where the production and the melodies typically are very bright occasionally epic or uplifting the music on this record sounds kind of like sunrays or just a musical aurora borealis or like beautiful colorful exotic flowers which isn't too out of comparison considering that every single track on this record is named after a plant now this LP is 10 tracks long it's got an interlude at the end and again despite being black metal the the sound the tone of this record is pretty warm and fuzzy you have those wretched yeah vocals all over this record occasionally you know some clean vocals some whispers of course there are some really aggressive drums on this thing blast beats but despite all that this LP is kind of inviting don't go into this thing expecting that big polished soaring sound that you would get on like a deaf heaven record or a wolves and throne room record bond this style is much more raw visceral and direct and the inclusion of hammer dulcimer just like on previous releases continues to give botanists a sound like no other black metal project the sustain on the dulcimer is amazing for the style of music as well as the very metallic tone of these notes the instrumentation a lot of the time sounds gorgeous just as it does on tracks like the opener stargazer or Calais Steen on and even though the melodies on this record can sound beautiful things can take a turn for the dark really quickly just like on the tracks in a moment partha Ngoc salon where the melody here is so devilish that even the bright hammered dulcimer can't distract away from how just evil this lead is I wish the vocals were a little louder sometimes though they do sound quite harsh but they are mixed very low it's kind of like having somebody in a very scary way whisper to you as you press your ear against this wall of gorgeous sound the sound really draws you in but the moment you get you know really comfortable with it and you feel immersed in it you sort of find that there's this really just odd shadowy figure walking through it which for me was the case on the track teri though fight where the melody on this track is is very lullaby ish there are a few songs where the sustain of the hammered dulcimer may be brought together with the harmonium makes for a particularly droney soundscape very relaxing very gorgeous there are a few tracks here and there where you get a little bit of odd time signatures stuff and the song just before the closer is one of the most aggressive propulsive hard-hitting songs on the entire LP this this record really ends off with a bang I think compositionally this record has quite a bit of variety to it even if the very rough and lo-fi production leaves a lot of these songs feeling a little Sammy Sammy but even if all these tracks have a similarly hazy and fuzzy feel to them it's really the compositions underneath that that just attract me there are maybe two or three songs on this thing where I feel like maybe melodically these tracks are a little too basic I wish that the harmonium came in and did a little bit more or the bass or that I just wasn't getting some basic hammered dulcimer chords specifically on tracks like dianthus but still I came away from this album loving it I think this is botanist most complex and interesting album yet and I look forward to seeing this musical project progress into the future I'm feeling a light decent eight on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana botanist music forever 
f7xmVw419fs,hi everyone Anthony Mel tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new panda bear EP mr. Noah songwriter/producer Noah Lennox aka panda bear one of the main brains behind the neo experimental psychedelic pop outfit animal collective he's also pretty well known for his solo material as well albums such as person pitch and he has a new record on the way here's what it looks like many people thought this album was going to drop this year but no in fact it is going to be released in January of 2015 and mr. Lennox has seen fit to give us this new EP to kind of hold us over in the meantime I guess now let me say before going into this EP I had a relatively positive mindset even though I was not really big on panda bears last full-length album tomboy I felt the record was pretty repetitive it was redundant it felt like so little was going on and yet it was so warped and difficult to decipher and on top of that animal collectives last for length album centipede hurts not really a favorite of mine in their discography not to mention  in my opinion AV tears oh 4 - right now in the solo album department still animal collectives past full-length album successes still hold quite a bit of weight for me so at this point I really have no reason not to at least a little bit look forward to whatever panda bear is going to be doing on his next full-length album in this new EP now the song mr. Noah kicks this EP off and I guess it's also a lead single from the new panda bear album as well so I guess we're going to be hearing it in two different contexts but at least in the context of this EP anyway it's a pretty great start the song features driving beat it's kind of low Phi and it's recording it's layered it's trippy it's colorful if I'm not mistaken throughout the track panda bear incorporates a sample of like dogs whimpering throughout this track it's very apparent that guys like Brian Wilson still inform panda bears vocal style heavily and I love that descending vocal line he keeps using on this track Hey however panda bears vocal performances are just about as off point as my vocal performance just then he just doesn't seem to be as in tune on some parts of this song as he typically does on like an animal collective track I don't know if he's writing himself out of his range or maybe straining a little bit there are some points in his lower register where he just sounds a slightly goofy but instrumentally and melodically I still like this tune I think it has a lot of personality to it unlike centipede Hertz I feel like this track is an onion and I guess I'm sort of enjoying peeling those layers back but sometimes this cacophony can feel a little unnecessary sort of like on the next track the song faces in the crowd which has these swirling cycling synthesizers that a lot of the time I just feel like they're distracting away from what is just an all right song however with the very reverb icy melodies all over this track I do care a lot for the very blissful tone of this track then we get the song untying the knot which I think instrumentally is one of the most interesting tracks on the entire record we kick this song off with like some weird shamisen samples if I'm correct which are incorporated throughout the track and sound very wonderful then we get the layered repetitive vocals throughout this track which read a lot like a chant to me and with the primal beat backing all of it it feels very hypnotic and meditative and a lot like this track I find the closer to be pretty pleasant to the lyrics though sort of come from this place that feels a little esoteric for me you know Noah seems to be talking about the ocean as well as not eating fish it's another instance of panda bear taking something that feels like it was possibly informed by something very real and maybe something very regular or normal but then he just pulls it into this abstract world where we have very little context and have no choice other than to interpret it as strange there are loads of chimes on this track some very textured since swells and the way that he mixes these things it feels very panoramic and enveloping very much unlike in my opinion what was going on with centipede hurts and maybe tomboy to an extent where I felt like I was very much on the outside of the noise and the chaos on here I feel like I'm just sort of surrounded by it and welcomed back into it in the way that I was on some previous animal collective records or in certain surgeons overall to me this EP is decent its likable but I still kind of feel like I'm just getting a taste of what panda bear could potentially offer on this record especially with some of the abrupt endings of these tracks and aside for more fleshed out songs I hope that the vocals are a little bit more on point than they are on some of these songs here though maybe that might not be the case given that mr. Noah is one of the lead tracks from this forthcoming album maybe mr. Noah is going to you know sort of be a forecasting for much of what we're going to be hearing on this record and even if that's the case I can't see this album being awful I'm feeling a light to decent six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next why that land right on the desk cool everyone have a nice day Anthony Fantana forever 
ywdF8ixPCQ8,ah hi everyone happy theny birthday tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Clockwork Indigo EP this is going to be Ross I'm going to be reading going to be talking no editing Clockwork Indigo is the musical collaborative project of Flatbush zombies and the underachievers - underground New York hip hop outfits right now two of my favorites in the New York underground at the moment they have both released some projects recently that I encourage you check out they are on tour so to help promote this tour they decided they were going to release a little bit of original music along with it which i think is a fantastic idea and this original music has taken the form of this new five-track EP which is about 20 minutes or so and on this EP I guess I don't know listening to it I like it but I don't really think there's any a kind of aha moment that when I listen to this thing I'm like oh man like this never could have happened if they were making music separately it just doesn't occur you know I just feel like they're coming on these tracks and just doing these songs together the EP feels really promotional you know and and and that's all not necessarily the worst thing in the world but it feels like it was made specifically for helping out this tour and yeah I mean I I feel like everything Flatbush zombies and the underachievers everything they've had to offer stylistically up until this point has been heard on this EP you know if you want to hear them at their best I would recommend you listen to their you know solo efforts however these tracks aren't really bad I don't think this EP is proof of these guys coming together and having incredible chemistry or inventing something entirely new what I think this EP proves is just how well these guys complement each other how much these guys are on the same page I suppose the the lyrics the verse is all over this record they are aggressive they're druggie occasionally they're kind of socially aware socially conscious a little subversive kind of like on the song system which has one of the best hooks on the entire record one of the most melodic hooks on the entire record it's a bit of a shame that this track is so short and on nearly every track here you have verses from is a gold and zombie juice and Eric Arc Eliot and a Kay and Michi Darko's so you know everyone in these groups are here and I'm assuming that a bulk if not all the production is handled by Eric arc Eliot because he is the Flatbush zombies sort of go-to producer and member slash rapper so you know there you go you know you have production handled in-house and the production actually is quite great I think on the butterfly effect the soaring theme melody very whimsical all over that track is beautiful it's wonderful the boom bap beat on that thing is very spacious I wish the pacing of the track was a little bit faster I feel like the song is kind of the definition of an overly long and sort of just generally long-winded hip-hop - and it would have been nicer if maybe some of that link turned up on the track system but generally all the songs here are nicely length and don't really you know try patience or or anything like that again I feel like these guys just complement each other really well stylistically that I suppose they don't really need to come up with any conceptual tracks because a lot of what they rap about sort of overlaps a lot of the time and personality and theme and tone though there are some tracks like benefit concert for example where it seems like you know moshing is most definitely a theme that comes up again and again and again in the ad-libs and the verses on this track as far as some of the other production on here I love the song Lu a.m. which has this lead melody on it which sounds like it was lifted or it's just very similar to that of Drake's started from the bottom but once the beat kicks in the song has a very different vibe with rattling high as in just really bombastic kick drums there's also again benefit concert which I think has some of the most just overbearing heavy drums on the entire EP it's really killer track and yeah I suppose you know that sort of the lyrical content that is the instrumental content I feel like a lot of what I'm hearing on this EP is stuff that these guys have executed before separately and right now they're just kind of doing it together they're doing it together really well but you know it's not anything altogether new I like it but I feel like I just kind of like it as a fan and I like both of these artists separately and I guess even though this collection of songs isn't like completely blowing my mind or anything it is nice to hear two artists that I like coming together and complimenting each other really well this EP isn't incredible when it comes to hooks or songwriting or anything like that it's just you know one verse after another you know all these guys are great spitters so they're really on the same page technically so it's not like you're getting you know some great verses here and there and then there's a garbage reverse popping up that's just kind of an ear sore or something like that that's not really the case you know you're just getting one solid verse after another from all these guys and you know again I think it was great that they were able to come together and complement each other so well I'm feeling a light a decent seven on this thing transition if you've given this EP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music forever also you can head down to the description box to check a review of the new the world is a beautiful place that I'm no longer afraid to die EP between bodies a week before it lands on this channel 
guCMYIlKSac,
oiNIJAQWUbY,hi everyone Anthony Fangio here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new run the jewels record run the jewels did run the jewels is a hip hop duo consisting of southern rapper killer Mike and new york-based rapper producer LP these guys have been one of the most unlikely and super hyped rap team ups of the past few years they started turning heads in 2012 with the entirely LP produced killer Mike album rap music which was highly praised by both fans and critics and LP n killer Mike seeing the success off of this record and basically the chemistry they themselves rivers we're seeing in their creative process decided to solidify this duo with the name run the jewels and they dropped a full-length record just about a year after this killer Mike album even though LP and might come from different walks of life they've had different artistic trajectories when it comes to run the jewels they really get on the same page artistically they kind of get together and meet at this middle ground where they can be straightforward blunt super aggressive brutal but also kind of cunning and clever too a little adventurous I think LP skips a little bit on the wordplay on the technical ability I think killer Mike drops a bit of his southern flavor from the equation too and this is all for the sake of coming together and doing something that is uniquely them still even though this first record of theirs really hit it off the question remains that can they continue this and hold people's attention can they keep it fresh can they keep it entertaining can they come up with some new ideas how far can this newly formed oooooo go are we going to get another black star or can we progress past this first album into something just as good Mike and Jamie certainly seem to hope that that's the case because it looks like they're marketing this album as a sequel to the first album Plus on top of it they're dropping this record just a year after they put out their debut record I guess really hitting while the iron's hot but still a lot of hardcore fans are going to have that debut album in their recent memory and they're going to hear this wasn't going to okay which is a completely fine reaction to have if you feel that way but in my personal opinion I think rtj 2 is better there are super brutal violent and aggressive rhymes all over this record cartoon alee aggressive sometimes hilariously aggressive sometimes as well but I think LP and killer Mike have stumbled upon a newfound just like serious darkness on this record - on some of these tracks I think LPS production on this record in comparison with the debut is way more layered detailed it's got more melody - on some of these tracks it's heavier it's busier it's punch here these beats are weighty and together with the lyrics these songs are about is blunt and straightforward and hard-hitting as like a wall of the coolest graffiti - tumbling over on top of you some of these songs feature numerous parts or have wonderful segues toward the end of them that bring you right into the next track without losing any momentum on the record like the track oh my darling into blockbuster night or all due respect into love again like with the last record Jamie and Mike bring just a handful of features but the features they do bring are super impressive Travis Barker of blink-182 hammering it out on drums on one track we also have Zack de la Rocha of raging as the Machine and gangsta boo of three 6 mafia they're not messing around and a few Underground's somewhat unknowns as well Diane Coffey who you might know as a member or a collaborator drummer for Fox again as well as boots a new york-based songwriter who on this record helped lay down one of the most beautiful choruses on any hip-hop album this year as I said earlier I think LP and killer Mike are finding their dark side on this record are finding a way to make slower more toned-down songs entertaining they do it right at the start of this record with the track jeopardy which is a really odd track for run the jewels they're lurking bass lines all over this thing just like eerie horror movies synthesizers and lead guitars some synth swells once the beat kicks in it's really heavy its lumbering and they're like some kooky saxophone leads all over this thing to LP and Mike bring these really slowly paced gritty grimy verses that really build up the the evil of this record like this song isn't the most evil that the album gets but you know that there's a larger evil coming down the pipe there are other tracks on here too that are equally toned down but a little darker just a little more depressing or even sad at times like the song all my life or even crown where killer Mike is delivering this eye widening lease adverse where he's rapping about dealing drugs to a pregnant woman regretfully however throughout the rest of this record run the jewels is the typically head bashing duo that you've come to know this is like some action movie with like LP and killer Mike running in slow motion with like trucks filled with gasoline exploding behind them and like Isis terrorists all around them like shooting at them with their fully automatic assault rifles but like every bullets missing like with the song Omar which has one of the most massive instrumentals on the entire LP really heavy sub bass simple snares coming through some watery swirling keys LP delivers some pimp sea references and some big references there's a hilarious line where he says that someone should run backwards through a field of dicks the instrumental gets noisier and more chaotic as it continues the song isn't exactly delivering any food for thought or anything like that but the lyrics and just the overall tone of the song is hilariously badass same with the song close your eyes and count to LP and killer Mike also deliver some brutal verses here and we have Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine like I mentioned earlier on this beat he is laced into the instrumental itself and it sounds amazing however his verse isn't totally mind-blowing or anything like that but I do think it's better than his appearance on the recent Deltron 3030 record we've got the song lie cheat steal which one of my favorite images on this entire record comes from this song teabagging a piranha tank or the song love again which has another incredibly hefty catchy beat and gangsta boo delivers a verse that is so raunchy that I blushed a little bit nearly every other track on here that isn't you know sort of sadder or more toned down song is it outright banger and I love that about this record but I also love the LP and killer Mike came together and and put forward a full length that is more balanced as well there are some darker tones on this LP and some of the most melodic hooks that LP and killer Mike have delivered yet especially on this track that features Diane Coffey to me this record is run the jewels sounding more distinct sounding more dynamic despite their incredibly aggressive attitudes I think they took some risks on this LP and the results are positive there are a few tracks here the pale in comparison to others but I don't really think there's anything incredibly negative that I have to say about this LP sometimes the more aggressive lyrics on this record can be a little cringe-worthy but that's the kind of tone and story that this album chooses to put forward it's unreasonably mean I mean look at the cover here it is a stick-up going on it doesn't want to hear your sob stories run the jewels man here and there I wish there were some beats that were just a little bit louder so the vocals were we're more immersed in them as opposed to just feeling like killer Mike and LP were just sort of on top of them with just kind of a lot of space between them and the beat some small technical things here and there pretty much but I'm still feeling a decent too strong eight on this thing transition if you've given this record a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana have a nice day music forever 
1pJLYMHAaAo,ah hi everyone truthin the Embargo here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vine update where i'm going to be giving you guys some of the latest additions to my vinyl collection over here uh it is my birthday month so I have decided to be a little nice to myself for me birthday however kicking off this list of Records is a record by one white reaper okay light reaper these guys are a recent addition to the poly vinyl roster I believe this is their debut project handful of songs on there six as you can see this is dirty punky scuzzy psyched-out garage rock with a low fire recording it's got a lot of guts even here on the label here it says that this record will make your ears ring play as loud as you dare and the packaging is fairly simple you know lyric sheet in there too with a picture of the band it's a very dark but the cherry on top of this thing is really be wonderful clear pink final so if you're looking for some psychedelic garage rock and maybe you have like a checklist of vinyl colors that you need in your collection there's the heat kicking on and on in my apartment Woollett yeah we have heat over here if you're looking for pink you can pick it up here on the new white Reaper record alright moving on this next records a jazz record came out in 1959 y'all are always asking me hey man how do I get into jazz man what kind of jazz should I - listen - dude come on man what's up at out edge as this record is a benchmark in the world of hard bop of bebop give this thing a listen Charles Mingus is I can't even show you what the record looks like on this thing because it's sitting on the turntable been listening to it but uh yeah there's the sleeve looks great um like most great jazz records you have tons of text on the back giving you background on the record I'm not 100% sure who is playing on this because I did not read this prior to doing this video I apologize for that for being a noob however by my personal tastes I will vouch and many other people wove ALG as well to dis records greatness okay Charles Mingus is Mingus ah um cool listen to it alright fiery solos on this thing and some some passionate tracks as well this I have not listened to yet however I am excited to listen to it given that I am a fan of this guy and his contemporaries and essentially what they did for dub reggae this may in a particular essentially being sort of at the very root of it one of its inventors mr. King Tubby this is essentially a what I am to believe a series of lost tracks b-sides who knows what's or where's they even ever came from but yeah so you know I'm looking forward to giving this a lesson a listen if you're looking to get into dub reggae that being reggae that has a incredibly progressive experimental production techniques lots of echoes and you know beautiful scenes on a lot of the instruments and things like that look up King Tubby look up scientist look into the genre and there we go look at look into a Lee scratch Perry the up setters Blackboard Jungle dub great record I have a super ape the upset or super ape in the collection as well another great dub record King Tubby lost treasures this I also have not sunk my teeth into yet this is the only crass album I haven't tried yet Christ the album given my fandom of their previous records feeding the 5000 penis envy this I'm sure will not be disappointing you know some very simple stark and sort of ominous album art and like many other crafts reissues so far these records come with very this elaborate elaborate album art which um I think is wonderful which i think is wonderful shows ambition got the lyric sheet right there they don't hold back and it's just block after block after block of text actually looking into this we might even have more than lyrics in here actually it looks like we have much more than lyric city or maybe we don't actually given that ya know it looks like we have lyrics in here but still given that I have not listened to this album yet with all the text here maybe I'm in for a treat this seems intense I'm seeing countries listed here pacifism and violence futures yeah this looks nuts okay okay I'm game I'm down I'm down crass price the album double LP over here can't wait to sink my teeth into this thing crash is this wonderful noisy chaotic very politically minded and they will throw your politics in your face like a Molotov cocktail they're an anarchic band came from the UK and they have some of the most vitriolic punk songs I've ever heard in my life and despite the their lack of great production they have quite a bit of gusto I read a quote one time and and and crass broke the balls of the clash on numerous occasions on numerous songs you know essentially called the mountain called punk out for not really being punk you know if you understand the punk ethos you know what I'm saying and I read this quote once with Joe Strummer saying that crass was like a storm in a teacup what's the point it's like it's like in a teacup like what's the point of the storm if it's relegated to the teacup always hated that quote alright next RL Burnside's too bad Jim another storm in a teacup this is this is this is quite the dirty badly recorded very loosely and and roughly played blues rock record III would say this album has much more charm and you know I guess rough and rustic charm than it does a fantastic execution you know just pretty much simple layout and everything like that simple layout 180 gram it's heavy vinyl although you know it's it's not like the sound quality of the recording itself is amazing it's a fairly rough recording but it's still got a lot of guts if you're looking for you know just a lot of oomph as opposed to wonderful playing or songwriting I would say look into this but if you're looking for a player who's like you know SuperDuper skilled I would say you know maybe head further in the direction of your Robert Johnson's or something like that or maybe even somebody who's just a little bit more concise and together with their band like a hound dog Taylor or something like that or if you're just looking for some good blues rhythm and blues blues rock singles look into Sun Records can't go wrong there moving forward with another crass related title this record came out on Crassus label back in the day k ukl I'm just going to call it tickle because that's what I'm going to do and the eye is the name of this record and I played I paid a pretty penny for this reissue I don't think it's reissued by this it's reissued by one little Indian you know there's a sticker on here sort of bragging about the quality of the record itself this like many records on Crassus label as elaborate cover art you know this thing unfolds into a huge poster the record itself says crash Records on it this is some noise rock some post-punk some experimental rock and the interesting historical and factual tidbit about this band is that it features none other than Bjork before she was actually even in or making music with I believe the sugar cubes so if you want to sort of dive into Bjork's experimental noise rock post-punk past-due look into k UK Elle's the I um I would say side a of this record is is pretty strange pretty noisy pretty challenging Bjork's vocals and just the vocals in general aren't totally like on pitch or on key a lot of the time and I think it's more for just the effect the dissonance side be seems to be a little bit more concise and pulled together on this record so you know if this thing does seem like a huge pain in the ass in the first half I advocate sticking with it because I think it pulls together in the second not to say that the album itself or the half of the album is bad but I think you know you're really getting two different sides of the band on both sides you know so if you don't care for what you're hearing thus far stick it out make sure you listen through to the second side alright this next band is all post-punk band and noise rock band the third record third full-length record of Oh Ice Age hain wowing never the me lob lob yay gave this record a rave review I love this Elm it's fantastic it's like everything I've loved about ice ages previous records but with so much more instrumentation and finesse and songwriting it's wonderful it's double LP it's got a little poster in there wonderful I was kind of sad to see the record cover of this thing and not see the band's very ominous roon logo on the front but there you go they popped it in the gatefold a gatefold man I love a good gatefold and you know just very black ominous labeling and vinyl sleeves popped in here I love it I love it I love the packaging I think it looks great I think it looks wonderful haven't put the records on to the turntable just yet I just picked this thing up but you know I am very familiar with the record having reviewed it for the channel so I am just waiting for a little bit of leisure time to just sit down and listen to that new Ice Age album on record all right next to our classic experimental rock and krautrock albums one I'm very familiar with having helped having owned a digital copy of this album for a long time but decided to pick it up on excuse me vinyl um tegu Magoo from can cool cool German experimental rock act give these guys listen if you haven't already this is obviously a reissue um lots of details there on the inner sleeve with production credits songs song information on the other side it's an elaborate package it's really nice it's really nicely put together I can't wait to throw these things on and just sort of you know get into this album on vinyl and um also picked up their debut album as well monster movie this album in their discography I am NOT is familiar with as I am with soundtracks and eggie Benassi as well as tagging Magoo but given that I am a fan of those records I thought I would give monster-movie a try as well and just you know sort of go in on a blind buy on the rare occasion that I do do that although you have already seen that I just did that with that crass album as well but you know like I said it's my birthday month you know I decided like hey you know what get some things you like get some things you haven't heard before that you've been meaning to get and just surprise yourself and finally I will close this out with a beautiful double LP copy of the New Sun Kil moon record Benji it's on wonderful clear vinyl awesome little you know for effort for such an unsuspecting Instagram looking front cover this does have a beautiful wonderful gorgeous gay fold I love those roses they look great if in fact they are roses I don't think they are good job Anthony I'm no botanist and then we have over here a some nice labeling on there on the clear vinyl and yeah the other LP is clear as well and apparently the D side of this record is loaded with a bunch of live cuts of some of the songs on this record and no unfortunately the New Sun Kil moon track Sun Kil moon suck my is not Sun Kil moon but a war on drugs suck my that song did not uh did not make this a deluxe version of the record unfortunately maybe next one you know maybe maybe there will be a 7-inch okay get it alright that's going to conclude our of vinyl update cool cool I'm going to have fun listening to these you have fun listening to whatever you're going to listen to and have a nice day Anthony Fantana vinyl music forever 
I3tRZOln8KY,hi everyone who vanthu new Fang tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new dope body record lifer these guys are a Baltimore rock band I believe they're on their fourth full-length album they came out with a cassette years ago on watercolor records back in 2011 they came out with their album nothing on Hoss records but in 2012 came their Drag City Records debut album natural history that year that year the album came out it was one of my favorite rock records of that year please give it a listen on this record not only did I love the band's songs but I fell in love with their sound and their style as well which incorporates elements of noise rock post-hardcore a little bit of metal irresistible grooves and bass lines even though dope bodies music is incredibly aggressive it's also incredibly funky - especially on songs such as powder and Road Dogg do what you've bought I do baby what you bought of it that not only is dope body on this record and in their music in general fantastic instrumentally but it is also the vocals that kind of makes the band stand out front man and Ruhlman's wild shouts and shrieks and caveman-like grunts really bring the energy level of dope bodies music up sigh so with dope bodies last record being a total powerhouse and the one prior to it growing on me slowly with each passing time I listened to it what is the band gonna do next well I think we got a little hint of that when they dropped a single last year for the song Saturday there was rougher production on these two songs just Wilder more chaotic performances but aside from that there weren't really any major defining characteristics about these two new songs except for maybe that they were less driven by the really weird and quirky grooves that were all over Natural History which is change in direction that kind of makes sense because I think the band did that sound all the justice they possibly could on Natural History to me Natural History is very much dope body finishing something that they started on nothing whereas lifer feels like the band is beginning something that is slightly newer for them because not only are there elements of noise rock and post-hardcore on this new album but there's also some psychedelic rock in here too some classic rock flavors as well post-punk and grunge which is pretty funny to think because on dope bodies record nothing there is a track titled the shape of grunge to come some tracks do have kind of a Nirvana or like early Soundgarden vibe to them so lifer is not as tightly wound or as funky as natural history but dope body finds different ways to experiment namely with very slow strung out guitars and verses vocals very loose playing and performances very chaotic they so while there are a lot of verses on this record that are kind of subdued it's the choruses that are really heavy and loud and brash abrasive and climactic some of them are loaded with psychedelic guitar solos some of them have really brittle distorted swells of guitar sound don't bodies mo on this record really seems to be that loud soft dynamic they're doing everything and anything they can do to create the greatest amount of contrast between Part A of the song and Part B whether that be a sonic contrast an emotional one a stylistic one the band may be totally just like off their rocker and out of control for one second but then they'll just tighten up and start just like a well-oiled machine punching through those riffs so that's kind of a structural change for dope body another change is their songs on this record that seemed to get more intense as they carry on you know really just escalating in a sort of linear fashion tracks like repo man as well as the 7-minute closing track here which I might add is loaded with sort of noisy glitchy synthesizers something I don't believe the band is done before an atom's vocal delivery has changed quite significantly on some of these songs too he's still a madman and and is willing to show that side on numerous tracks here but during these more toned down verses he is legitimately singing at first it may be kind of hard to swallow and with tracks like new sensation he kind of sounds like he's just sort of dicking around but I found it easier to get into most of the performances here after just a handful of listens to these songs namely on tracks like echo it's on songs like this where Adams very pained moans and whimpers where he's just kind of like wandering around aimlessly it reminds me a lot of Honus Honus from Mann Mann if you've heard that band not only that but this track also features some very slow spacious kind of backwoods guitars that maybe have a bit of a southern rock vibe to them but as soon as the chorus kicks in the song just Rockets off into these spiraling guitar chords that send the song spinning at a thousand rpm so while there are some great tracks on here that create that fantastic contrast between some parts of a song and other parts of the song there are also tracks here that just straight up rock in the way that you would expect a dope body song to rock like the track toy which is maybe as punk as it gets on this record complete with lyrics about wanting to be original and not wanting to be a wannabe also the songs rare air and day by day tracks that have very very very abrasive lively choruses but the verses have these kind of watery milky bass lines that sound like they would be very comfortable inside of like a Joy Division song or like a Bauhaus song even as on the song day by day Adam is delivering vocals that feel like they could be placed onto a Fugazi record the the Ian MacKaye side of a Fugazi record then there's the song hired gun which features one of the most badass heavy noisy guitar riffs of any dope body song yet and for whatever reason the melody that this riff plays is just eerily similar to that of the vocal line on the roll Stonestreet fightin man throughout this record there are loads of subtle references to numerous rock disciplines and they are executed really well without watering down dope bodies trademark personality and just exuberant energy simply put I think this is just another great record from dope body I wish the production on here was just a little bit cleaner because I think the production quality on Natural History was was very very ideal but still despite that very small issue this is a very wild it's a brash rock record with personality with viscera with guts with explosivity with songs that have numerous parts to them lots of changes lots of shifts the band shows that they can write they can perform they could play a loose they could play a tight and they can switch from one to the other at the drop of a hat I'm feeling a decent two strong eight on this record Tran know the best position and if you've given this record to listen what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantino a'dope Abadi forever

EUVXJjKeHek,ah hi everyone whoo theny clan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Vince staples EP hell can wait Vince staples is a West Coast rapper much of who's come up has occurred underneath the odd future Wolf Gang kill them all umbrella he has also collaborated with the likes of Mac Miller he's had some semi successful solo mixtapes some pretty great features out recently as well on the new dilated peoples record on the new earl record when i hear this guy turn up on someone else's track typically i end up liking it but when it comes to Vince solo I'm a little underwhelmed Vince's typically relaxed flow works at two speeds laid-back and lay it back also if you give this guy's rapping a listen you should pick up pretty easily a very old-school Snoop Dogg type inflection now I'm not saying his lyrics or his style are trash but he is not exactly the lyricist of the year either sometimes his instrumental choices have been a little shoddy to me and he's not exactly a song or hook writer in my opinion either sometimes his his courses can really be duds so in my opinion Vince staples can be a little boring for long strings of time but he has a commercial full length on the way he is kind of teasing toward that with this new commercial EP I figure I like his style enough to be curious about this project and it's not a full-length and the EP naturally is going to be shorter plus I did like one of the lead singles off of this EP blue suede we essentially have seven new songs on this project and while not in love with it I do think this is Vince's most consistently quality set of tracks yet but there is a little bit of a range on this thing we have great moments like 6500 which has one of the most killer hooks on the entire record even though it is simple in Vince's courses do tend to be simple it's very very sticky the birds and the bees come with a G Plus this track does have one of the better instrumentals on the entire record - very jazzy horns strings that are very mournful and we be playing underneath the verses some chopped up piano samples as well and over the beat Vince sounds fantastic he's putting a little bit more emotional inflection in his voice at times to me sounding a little bit like andre 3000 and even though we do get a lot of typical gangsta rap themes and Vince's lyrics on this track and other tracks here I think he does a good job of conjuring the hopelessness that comes out of such dire situations as the ones he is rapping about then there's blue suede stellar instrumental the trap high hats the massive bass on this thing the groove of it I as much as I love this beat it's also a little bit of a double-edged sword too because I feel like this song and 65-hundred do sort of highlight the fact that Vince though he is capable rapper he is a little instrumental dependent to continue with this track I do love the surreal imagery in the song the death fixated imagery in the song sort of seeing your friends passing on and hoping that you're going to outlive the red roses that may be at their either their tribute shrine somewhere wherever they had died or on their grave at their funeral I also love the ear you wailing synthesizer leads on this track - it's like a weird dark fusion of southern hip hop and West Coast but even though tracks like screen-door are a little more thematic uh it's it's hard getting into this track just because of how mundane it is as a song the instrumental doesn't show that much variation it's very skeletal very minimalist and vince staples doesn't really change up his flow or his inflection or his energy level that much across the length of the track either and this is a 4-minute song and it feels so much longer because of the the lack of significant change I feel the same way with the song hands up - whoo - I wish this song wasn't as subdued as it is but it is an interesting track lyrically that addresses police violence police corruption cops gunning young kids down and even though Vince doesn't name this location by name a lot of people because of recent events are going to link this track directly with Ferguson but stories like these are happening all over America I think is why it was smart to do sort of a more general thing on this track instrumentally it should also be noted that Vince is kind of doing a nocturnal DJ mustard flavored funk and the instrumentals pretty fitting while I do think the hands up don't shoot and the put your hands in the air as you would typically hear in a hip-hop song parallel is very clever there are some moments on here like the opener which do hit hard instrumentally but lyrically and flow wise is just kind of okay and occasionally Vince shows sort of a softer side of himself like on the song limos not every song needs to be as brutal as the closing track here which does have a line that grips me even now where he says he's going to put the burner in your mouth and free your mind but I still think Vince is on a journey to find his real standout voice while he can rap he sounds fine on a beat I think he still got a little bit of progress to make when it comes to compelling songwriting and finding a narrative and an angle that will separate him from all the other rappers out there that are rapping about similar topics I'm feeling a light at ease on this thing transition if you've given the sepia listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Vince stop 'less yeah forever 
JIpJwefNiNo,hi everyone Rick theny Grimes tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Scott Walker and some record soused soused is the completely unexpected collaborative album from experimental music figureheads Scott Walker and son both of whom come from different musical backgrounds both of whom come from different musical worlds though they are very dark in experimental worlds however their respective pasts have very little in common Walker has been the passionate and bellowing voice behind many fantastic baroque pop records decades ago and Greg Anderson and Steven O'Malley of son their background ranges from metal to hardcore punk however both of them are making incredibly strange music now currently and for years son has been a major figurehead in the doom drone metal world sort of taking the heavy vast somewhat ambient archetypes set out by bands like Earth on the record earth - but taking it so much further into the dark ambient realm into the noise realm into the black metal realm and Scott Walker went off of the artistic deep end in the 90s with the record tilt then he went on to put out the drift and most recently bish Bosh a record where Scott's very strange and deep kroons are delivered over some of the strangest instrumentals he's dealt with yet some of the instrumentals here are very minimal and sparse and eerie others are incredibly cacophonous and busy and disorienting dissonant harsh frantic and intense and as far as the lyrics on bish posh co they're absolutely absurd absurdism to the highest degree without a doubt there are plenty of dark and disturbing moments on this record sonically and verbally as well but there are some tongue-in-cheek spots - some people have tried to boil this record down - Scott simply messing about and maybe that is what he's doing to a degree but if you think about what messin about kind of entails No Boundaries No rulz no inhibitions and Scott took advantage of that lack of boundaries in a way that I think no artist ever could or ever will even though bish Bosch is not a welcoming record it's not an incredibly rewarding record it is awe-inspiring Lee twisted and bizarre and even though son makes music in a completely different genre I would say those labels also apply to some of their best records to which personally is enough common ground for me because once I heard this collaboration announced I had no reason not to be excited in my head I sort of visualized like another black one where son bring on Scott Walker and sort of have him mucked into their typically heavy and dissonant and thick instrumentals with just Scott going absolutely insane or maybe even son drifting away from the drones and trying to come up with instrumentation that would complement Scott in a way that the instrumentation on bish Bosh did but with sort of a different tone or style in my head no way could this record be as underwhelming as the recent over collaboration because it's just it's just too unforeseen and it's not like son and Scott Walker had so little common ground that this thing could be as disastrous as like lulu socially speaking anyway because i like some tracks off of Lulu so even though I went into this record with nothing but just positive vibes and a good outlook and just somewhat high expectations I came out just like a sort of underwhelmed maybe that was bound to happen just because of how high of a regard I hold these two artists in first I guess I'll start with something that is very obvious from the sound of the record and was kind of confirmed for me in the way this album has been billed and marketed for one this LP comes out on Scott Walker's label currently for a D and Scott Walker does get first billing if son is playing second fiddle on this record it certainly sounds like it occasionally there are some ear piercing guitar leads here and there who knows if that is coming from Stephen or Greg really where son's presence is felt are in the occasional appear PSA's of thick heavy droney walls of guitar sound sons mo essentially the sad thing is these thick walls of guitar don't actually enhance Scott Walker's schtick which doesn't really change that significantly on this new record in my opinion these walls of droning guitar sound kind of tame when compared to son's best material which leads me to the question that if Scott Walker is running the show here essentially why isn't this weirder I did not love head over heels bish Bosh at the time that I reviewed it at the time it came out it has grown on me a little little since then but the appeal for me in this record is that it is a musical freak show and while freak shows are great their appeal does run a little one-dimensional not to say that there aren't interesting lyrics or emotions or musical compositions on this record there most definitely are but more often than not they work to enhance this record sense of shock value and when so much of what you're doing banks on oddity you've always got to work to advance beyond what you did in the past or else it's just going to feel less shocking it's going to be less gripping and I just can't help but feel as I'm listening to these mere five songs that Scott Walker could have just done these songs on his own outside of Suns guitars instrumentally these tracks just feel like another round of bish Bosch style strangeness but not as strong not as disorienting not as extreme because certainly when the droning guitar sort of introduced themselves the compositional side of these tracks sort of end up stagnating and not really going anywhere that significant though I do think there are exceptions such as the song fetish which most definitely has one of the most interesting progressions of any track on this album not only that but sun's input on this record feel so much less obvious than it does on many other songs here and the track lullaby though repetitive does stay consistently twisted and engaging especially as the horror-movie synthesizers and scott's upper register come together for some pretty interesting climaxes meanwhile the tracks off of bish Bosch thrived on change and unpredictability I can't help but feel like I'm just listening to lesser versions of what I just heard Scott Walker do there are some moments in this record that stand out like the chorus vocals on lullaby when Scott is singing out just very ear lead very creepily the glistening sensor guitars right at the start of the opening track here one moment in particular where Scott is sort of throwing these very primal drums behind Suns droning guitars it actually comes together pretty well and has a bit of an industrial vibe on here and no track on this record is outright awful except maybe for the the second one which does border on just being dreadfully boring at points but outside of that there's not really that much appeal for me on this record it doesn't feel like Scott is pushing himself artistically in the way that he was on his last record and son a lot of the time just kind of feels like background dressing this collaboration is more exciting in name than it is in execution I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this record unfortunately transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it forever also down there in the description box I will drop a link to a review of the new royal blood album you can watch it down there at that link a week before it actually shows up on this channel over here cool cool you're the best you're the best you're the best 
F0FDvjCOCTQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sir Michael rocks record Bank oh this is the latest full-length project from California via Illinois rapper Sir Michael rocks a guy who was mostly known for his affiliation with the rap duo the cool kids which if you don't remember also features the input of rapper producer Chuck Inglish and when the cool kids hit the internet and blew up they got pretty big they were one of the first hipster hop sensations before - racist before ASAP mob before Death Grips and Danny Brown and Odd Future and all that I was loving tracks like pennies and a v8 and I rock and black mags pretty much most of that bake sale EP if you loved 80s hip hop and really phat beats and simple flows clever rhymes a good sense of humor then the cool kids are worth checking out their lyrics weren't overly complex or deep or anything like that but they knew how to write really instantaneous fun creative hip hop music that had a seriously fresh edge to it and maybe that bake sale EP maybe some of those singles haven't held up too well in recent years but I feel like the reason for that is is that once the cool kids drop that EP they really needed an album to seal the deal and solidify the fandom they had built up so far and when they dropped the full-length LP that really came too late after the bake sale EP it was kind of a fumble and as a duo ever since the release of this album the cool kids have remained relatively silent and the solo material they've been dropping since their slow fade to black has begun has been pretty mediocre - if I'm going to be honest and going into it I thought banco is going to be another instance of the cool kids running on creative fumes ever since the release of the bake sale P and maybe there are some people out there given my reputation who would think I would say the same thing because even here on Twitter we have my Crocs telling me not to review this I'm so picky I just cannot be pleased well I'm happy to say that even though banco is is not a perfect album i did think it was a fun and enjoyable album the mic is roughly at the same level of lyrical ability that he was when the cool kids were at their most popular and he pretty much grabs a bunch of rappers who were around that level as well other than Twista his feature is fantastic and he kills Mikey on the beat but still I have to commend Mike on this recapturing the simple fun silly attitude that made the cool kids so irresistible when they first hit on banco we have some really infectious pop rap with some kind of eccentric playful beats the intro song on here is one of the few that actually takes a serious tone we get a bit of backstory from Mike talking his transition to California sort of suffering the death of a loved one in the process he raps a bit about his current state in music depression there are a lot of brags weaved into these lines but some kind of surreal psychedelic and unsettling imagery to this track is kind of like a bad trip which is a little misleading because the rest of the record is pretty light-hearted because a mood change comes really quickly right on the next song with memo there's a punchy beat on this track a wonky melody some synthesizer chords that kind of sound like a a phaser baby accordion and the hook on this thing I'm ballin did you miss the memo it's enthusiastic it's funny lyrically there's a lot of typical rap here but it sounds like a party we're all invited to then there's the song some issue with some weeping guitars and the beat the groove is very punchy on this thing I'm loving the tremolo synth chords and there's also the twist to feature on here which is great and topically this song is kind of about a meeting of bisexual lover again not a very deep track but a very fun track all the same if you loved some hip-hop that is doused and sexual fantasy then give a listen then there's a song busing maybe one of my favorite tracks off the cell P Casey Veggies I am soo hoping pronouncing that correctly also on this track it was one of the first songs I enjoyed from this thing there's a beautiful icy synth melody on this track kind of a non-sequitur hook what's most enjoyable about this song is that not only is it just kind of an ear worm but it's just filled with in Kading young boy swagger and these sort of underground hits just kind of keep coming with tracks like drug dealer where Mike's kind of just paying homage paying tribute to the drug dealer but kind of like in an older 90 cents as he paints a portrait of this guy that has numerous cell phones and beepers then there's the song kill switch with rob banks and puia another pretty good track and the beat has this awesome bottle rocket sample that makes the song so noisy and ear grabbing the song Lost Boys is well sort of a weird lo-fi country rap hybrid with Trinidad James and Mac Miller both of whose verses are pretty decent they measure up there's all sorts of slide guitar in this beat and for verse after verse after verse the The Lost Boys theme kind of works the main tracks on this record for the first three fourths of the project are all pretty great it's just that they're interrupted by these experimental songs by these skits some of which are good and funny like the song cold sore the Pokemon reference on that skit kills me but then there's the skit Doc's or the Dino feeding skit the song PlayStation 1.5 is kind of underwhelming as is the song SeaWorld though I do think the very close of that song is humorous I think the absurdism and the playful attitude of some of the songs on here that I love also leads to some underwhelming tracks as well and that's all these skits and these weird or tracks still do add character one of the only songs on here I think I strongly stand in opposition to is maybe one time which to me is just a half-assed song through and through one time wintertime summertime at a time then there's the song new with two short and Chuck Inglish the beat on this track just screams DJ mustard it's just kind of a trendy throwaway then the song Francois not a bad track as well but not exactly a winning closer either maybe something that was a little bit more personal or meaningful like the intro track to kind of bookend the whole thing and just kind of make it feel like an experience would have been more fitting but whatever overall it's not a bad P I will say this again but it is fun it's catchy it's not that heady if you're looking for something that's a little lighter on its meaning and is just trying to make you laugh and is trying to get a hook stuck in your head but isn't as dumbed down isn't as overly simplistic as some of the hip-hop you might hear on the radio then give this thing a listen I do think this record is it's smarter than it lets off it may be braggadocious it may be materialistic but it's kind of ridiculous as well and I mean that in a totally good complementary positive way I'm feeling a strong six to eight seven on this thing transition if you given this record of listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Benko forever 
U62WH5CsMqM,
ndeO80edrZA,hi everyone Captain Crunch tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Fox Aegean and star power oxygen is West Coast rock and pop band fronted by singer-songwriter duo sam France and Jonathan Rado I was first introduced to their music through this album right over here take the kids off Broadway very good fun record think the unicorns teaming up with Ariel pink to do a medley of songs that kind of sound like songs that the Rolling Stones the Stooges in the early years as well as like The Velvet Underground The Beatles and David Bowie would write and like some kinks and maybe some animals too not only was this record super nostalgic but the way that these guys wrote their songs was almost schizophrenic jumping from one popular music sound in the 60s to another I thought this record was super creative super awesome and it just had me waiting with bated breath for when Fox agem would come through again and put out some new stuff and they did really quickly on the same label jag jag you are we are the past 21st magic it's a crazy title and to me this record was a surprisingly tame follow-up to take the kids off Broadway the production was cleaner the songs were more concise no longer were Sam and Jonathan kind of just jumping around sonically or stylistically and even though it was a sudden change the very good and catchy tunes all over this record kind of carried the band through the transition and proved that foxy jiin has potential beyond sort of whoever is into loaf I weird experimental psychedelic pop nostalgic throwback music stuff however not soon after this release a bunch of inner band drama kind of came to light on the internet and music blogs and music websites and then there were a few very underwhelming solo releases which I kind of came away from thinking okay hey doesn't matter Fox Egan is a different band they sound best as a team I just want to hear the record that they make as a team and follow their last album up they're a team team team team team team at least that's how I felt until I heard this record now on surface this record seems like a really bold ballsy experimental totally unpredicted move there's 80 minutes of material on this record and Sam and Jonathan are going back in a lo Phi direction which is part of why their early stuff was so fun and crazy and spontaneous but these surface level assumptions fell apart completely and fully as soon as I started actually listening to what Fox agem was doing on this record in terms of writing and in terms of performing in this 20-plus song tracklist Fox ijen unapologetically churns out one inconsequential non song after another either the band couldn't even be bothered to write anything compelling or they've totally lost the ability to edit themselves to say hey this track good this other track that's so good so we're going to take the good track and put that on the record and take that not so good track and just push that to the side as evidenced by songs like 666 or Wally's farm or the song have some are one of many tracks in the track listing here that feels like Fox Egan hasn't really written or recorded a song as much as they are just sort of jamming on a really weak idea and when Fox engine does have a decent song on their hands they deliver the most half-hearted performance and recording and just suck all the potential out of the track the song could have been my love take that track for example this song's chorus is so anemic it's like the musical equivalent to a fart rather than exploding and bursting or just coming together with a rush of inspiring instrumentation that might actually make the the love theme of this song feel tangible or relatable might actually move a listener emotionally the songs just like choruses come in 1 2 3 up there are a few tracks on here like Cannibal Holocaust that has that sort of take the kids off Broadway musical schizophrenia vibe to them but even these tracks don't come together that well they just kind of feel like one part just paste it with another part this is also kind of an issue on the album's four part title track nowhere on the record is the gap between Fox's jhin's ambition and their execution what actually happens on this record wider it's just a series of tracks sort of an intro a song sort of a bit of a build up and then an outro it seems like these tracks would complement one another on paper but the recording styles don't even fit on each song the segues between each track are really sloppy and not only that but the second and third parts of this song the performances are so loose the band doesn't even sound together on these tracks it's like listening to a Velvet Underground song without actually any songwriting or like a really subpar live recording of the Rolling Stones on and off night and then Fox engine has the gall to put out tracks like winter freedom that starts off with this incredibly noisy abrasive drone like so far on the album you have not dished out not even two minutes of exciting compelling music and you're gonna drown me out and do a noise piece however it should it should be noted that this noise piece is more compelling than a lot of what would be considered a song on this album it's not uncommon for a band to put out a record that I love or maybe two records that I love and then all of a sudden out of the blue they drop a full-length that I don't love quite as much it happens it's not a big deal but rarely is the disappointment this stunning though not to say this record was without precedent or that it couldn't have been seen I mean this LP to me kind of feels like the Jonathan Rado album with just way more runtime I would like to think that somewhere in this track listing there is a pretty good EP something that after I list - I would think okay that was alright hopefully there's a better album in the future however I can't have that reaction here that would be to ignore all of the awful non-essential and completely pointless tracks in this track listing which just really make up a bulk of the runtime hear the terrible recording the terrible writing the terrible performances inexcusable stuff like a band that just got together a year ago and this is their first band camp album type stuff this is not the kind of thing that when I listen to I'm like oh yeah this is this is on a label this has got to be on a label so I'm just kind of disappointed with this record at multiple angles as a fan of this band as a fan of music in general and also just to think that this is sitting on vital somewhere I am feeling a strong one - a light - on this LP to be completely honest transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Fox again forever 
RuCv_Nt7Bkk,uh hi everyone loud and angry and nihilistic tanno here the it's Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new god flesh record world bonfire deadly kill everyone this is the sinisterly titled and latest full-length album from birmingham industrial rock and industrial metal outfit God flesh starring among others experimental music workhorse Justin K Broderick these others being people like GC grain and a rotating cast of collaborators over the years though right now in God fleshes current form it is just Justin and GC now Justin has the bragging rights of getting in on the ground floor of some pretty awesome genres throughout the 80s and the 90s with bands like napalm death ice curse the golden vampire Yaesu who I've had the pleasure of seeing once as well as techno animal but in the late 80s along with bands like pitch shifter and ministry and lard and maybe to a lesser extent Nine Inch Nails if you'll let me through a popular name in there God flesh would go on to set the foundation for industrial style metal music going on to influence groups such as beer factory or strapping young lad and when I say industrial metal I mean metal music that might potentially have electronic drums hanging in the background really heavy thick distorted bone crushing riffs so God flesh they formed in the 80s they broke up in the 2000s and no record in their discography is more celebrated in their full-length debut album street cleaner and it's not hard to figure out why even on first listen because of just how massive this record sounds even today especially the remastered version even at 25 years old this album sounds like an apocalyptic aggressive beatdown that will not let up the band would go on to experiment with more fluid riffs and melody and harmony and an overall smoother sound on the album selfless there actually were some riffs and grooves on this record that would go on to influence the nu-metal movement in the 2000s and that vibe is even stronger on the band's next record in 96 songs of love and hate not only does this LP forego a lot of the boomy electronic drums that we remember from past records but there's more live drumming in the mix instead and with tracks like hunter to me this song is just totally totally 2000 zerrin new metal but without the pop accessibility on records like us and then got flesh indulged in not only incorporating hip hop rhythms into their songs but drum and bass - and what was at one time the band's swan song hymns is a fantastic record where they started bringing some atmospheric sludge metal sounds into the fold actually featured a kind of Spacey and harmonious closing track that sort of led way to the whole yaesu project that justin dove into directly after the demise of God flesh this record is easily one of the best goodbyes in underground extreme rock music so do give it a listen if you get a chance but now God flesh is back after 13 years new record which I guess is a nice change of pace given that all of the reasons stuff yaesu has been putting out I've been pretty underwhelmed by and the band is not really taking off from where they left in the early 2000s on this record this thing is more like our hit of the reset button this thing is like a record that could come out right after street cleaner there's a track on here Imperator I believe it's called that features some clean vocals though this track is a little bit of a bore the vocals are sort of buried thrown into the background the last songs a little long-winded kind of slow and atmospheric there's one beat on here that feels like it might have a little bit of a hip-hop influence but for the most part these songs are completely devoid of all the experimentation got flesh did from like 1990 to 2001 which is funny given that these guys are one of the group's early on that experimented putting industrial music and hip hop together and now that noise infused hip hop music is kind of catching on it's sort of like nowhere to be seen here I guess you should listen to this album if you want to hear God flesh go back and just redo the sound the concept and the idea of their earliest material essentially what the wider community music community celebrates them for street cleaner this MO could not be more apparent right even from the start of this record where the guitars are massively thick compressed heavy Justin's typically deep guttural barked vocals are very crisp they're very clear they're upfront they're in your face I think the only thing this song really misses from the whole God flesh aesthetic are the drums they're so quiet they're so buried where the snares that sound like a shotgun going off in an airplane hangar occasionally they come up on tracks like life-giver life-taker but I was just hoping for them to be a little bit more prevalent still there are some really good grooves coming out of these sort of stiff and electronic drums a lot of the time like the rolling double bass kicks on the song dead end or the drum groove and the guitar riff on the track shut me down which is maybe one of the most nasty head-banging irresistible riffs on the whole record God flesh guitar wise at least and and riff wise too are sounding just as earth as ever there are quite a few tracks on this record that could really go toe to toe with street cleaner in terms of dissonance and aggression and just bleakness and nihilism however there are quite a few songs on this record too that sound kind of inconspicuous for God flesh like with the opening track or life-giver life-taker again these songs to me why loud are not really punishing enough which really is what street cleaner is as an experience a punishment and with so many songs on this record just sounding really heavy and slow as hell for the duration of the track time it kind of keeps these songs from feeling dynamic Justin definitely makes the effort on this record but sometimes the choruses the hook the bridges of these songs don't really contrast one another enough to warrant any excitement or emotional peaks the last third of this record though in my opinion really seems to pull things together delivers one head bashing riff after another and the closing track like I mentioned earlier is a multi-faceted longer song with some interesting sound scapes in there really sort of bringing that atmospheric sludge metal thing into the fold this record is just another example of a group who put out some of their best stuff in the late 80s the 90s sort of coming back out of the blue and just putting out new material again and that's totally cool that's totally fine I mean you know FX is doing it my bloody Valentines doing it way more people that I haven't even mentioned right now are doing it and some of these artists thus far when dropping new material have stuck pretty passionately to what we remember them for some of them have ventured out and experimented in this case with God flesh they're just really kind of sticking at home base and doing what is comfortable for them which is a little disappointing given that the band experimented throughout their career and maybe it would have been interesting to hear a record that was kind of a culmination of the many things that the band tried throughout their career I think it was easier to kind of make a record like this because in retrospect the music community has deemed the band's early stuff cool whereas their drum and bass and hip-hop influenced stuff that would go on to sort of set the tone for new metal throughout the 2000s not quite as cool so I like a lot of the tracks on this record I don't think there's a horrible song here and I think God flesh came through with good production there are some pretty nasty lyrics on this LP as well at least from what I can make out from the lyrics my only big glaring issue with this record is that I guess the whole idea and concept was a little obvious but that's it I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music music me like forever 
2x3B4W2FVkI,hi everyone Hannah theny Montano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new my brightest diamond record this is my hand this is my chin this is my foot this is my elbow this is my neck this is my knee this is my review my brightest diamond is the singer/songwriter project and band fronted by multi-instrumentalist Shara Worden with this new LP I believe she is on her fourth studio album right now and if you love your vocals whimsical and theatrical and your pop songs loaded with dense lavish chamber and Baroque instrumentation then I recommend you give her stuff a listen unquestionably over the year Shara has done baroque pop and chamber pop quite a bit of justice though in my opinion she's never really been like one of the most bold little artists in the genre especially in the case of her last full-length record which I do think had it's underwhelming moments however on this new LP of her share is seriously turning up the heat on numerous tracks here especially the lead single Shara is bringing louder instrumentation stronger percussion and even a few of the quieter songs on the tracklist here have this kind of staredown intensity to them that gives the songs especially the title track on here a lot of emotional power plus in addition to being beautifully orchestrated and arranged and recorded and mixed really well this album much of the time is very well written to once again Shara deliver some great songs on this record starting with the very dramatic lead single pressure which kicks the entire LP off it's a very dramatic marching band style instrumentation the dance will groove on the hook is fantastic there's the diamonds I didn't know Cher's pop sensibility could be this great and with the lyrics on this LP about diamonds and dispersing light and the pressure creating these fantastically amazing stones Sharra's lyrics continue to be filled with poetry symbolism metaphor the next track before the words also feature some strong drumming I love the backup vocals on this track beat the drums are lovingly wrapped in these layers of vocals this wonderful warm brass it's gorgeous instrumentally this song is very refined but it's visceral as well this dynamic she hits perfectly on the song lover killer - it's got lavish instrumentation like many other tracks here but the beat behind this thing wouldn't sound too uncomfortable behind like a disco track conversely the title track on this LP is much more toned down but like I said there's that sort of quiet emotional intensity to it especially with the very self-affirming lyrics and the very slow-growing track shape is another highlight for me on here - I love the patient arpeggios I think the song has these three individual interesting parts and especially at the end the song gets pretty explosive I think the background vocals on their fantastic as far as downsides I think there are a few moments on this LP where maybe Shara isn't hitting the lyrical mark I've heard her hit numerous times in the past like on the track which I sort of hear the concept of this song but it seems just like an overly simple portrayal of the sort of love on the rocks or maybe tainted or dangerous love situation and the finish of this LP in my opinion is not quite as fantastic as the beginning unfortunately this record doesn't really stick the the dismount for me and it starts with tracks like they're easy which to me this song is just like a overly long interlude the song resonance while much more lively feels more like a groove that goes on and on and on and on and on than a well formed song and the closing track on here feels like Shara just kind of delivering some words or maybe a poem in your usual vocal style over a little bit of acoustic and electronic ambience and while it is very pretty from an aesthetic standpoint it is very beautiful texturally I think the track is a little anticlimactic for a finisher overall I think this is a really good record just another decent LP in the my brightest diamond Canon I do think it's really worth checking out there are a few duds in the tracklist here kind of an underwhelming finish occasionally the backing instrumentation feels a little frivolous or maybe a little bit like window dressing for kind of a reference point if you ever heard that band after clang there's there's definitely something to the orchestration here that reminds me of that but for the most part especially in the first half this is a very captivating full-length I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and and that's it Anthony Fantana my brightest diamond forever 
Uge_eyjwPYw,ah hi everyone Anton Fantin here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Weezer album everything will be all right in the end famed alternative rock and power pop band Weezer on their ninth full-length album here Wow their first album came out in 1994 it's on my favorite pop rock albums of all time it's essentially been 20 years since the release of that record amazing singles on this album clever sort of fun humorous nerd friendly Tunes but as great as this album was to me in the grander scheme of things it doesn't really feel like anything more in the career of Weezer than just a moment in time because now with the band being as old as they are there's a lot of history Weezer hit an artistic and a commercial stride with the Blue Album with Pinkerton but then more radio-friendly songs began to come down the pipe with albums like the green album but the grown worthy material didn't really dropping until records like maple leaf or the red album or attitude where we were getting singles like Beverly Hills and we're all on drugs songs that are so far outside the rubric of why you originally loved the band it's kind of hard not to at least feel just a little bit of a sense of betrayal and when fans feel that way it's a little hard to kind of win them back it's like you've almost soured the relationship plus I think a lot of fans were anticipating that Weezer would kind of aged and mature along with them as they grew up but instead Weezer decided to kind of stay in this musical Neverland where they would essentially stay sixteen years old musically and lyrically for the rest of time so despite this lack of progression and maybe even a tiny embrace of regression on a few records I actually did end up enjoying Weezer's last album quite a bit early for me this record was relatively low on BS it just had a lot of good catchy straightforward pop rock songs and the typical Weezer style but another thing this album signaled to me is that Ouiser is going to pander less to the radio rock market because we've got the internet now where everything has a niche and maybe if we're lucky will we not only get some better songs from Weezer but maybe even just a little bit of acknowledgment of the years of disappointment felt by people whose adolescence was defined by songs like El Scorcho and the sweater song as well as Buddy Holly and Weezer actually does that here they make the effort they do it to the best of their abilities I will not go as far as to say Weezer has matured on this record but they have put out their most ambitious album in a while here and in addition to that this is their most self-aware record in well over a decade musically Weezer is putting together songs in typical Weezer fashion with that same guitar tone super heavy super thick the mid-paced riffs rivers Cuomo's vocals still have a somewhat whiny tone to them but still very enjoyable the bass is basically there just to thicken things up the drums are nice with Weezer it's not really the magic of any individual part really it's more about how all the instrumentation comes together to complement the song and there are some songwriting triumphs on this record like eulogy for a rock band a song that embraces a theme on this record that rock and Weezer are both kind of past their prime maybe pass their peak of relevancy and if that is in fact the case then this song is a very punchy fun catchy and kind of a tear-jerking goodbye super melodic chorus way catchy lyrics on the chorus as well and poetically I think it kind of puts the rock band to bed quite nicely and I love the song had it up to here which starts off with this really funky guitar riff it's got a great groove but then when the verse comes in I think the theme of this song really hits home with river singing that I'm trying to give you my best artistically I'm trying to give you my best material but you've essentially plugged up your ears at this point which for a lot of Weezer fans is totally 100% true and you know the the frustration rivers is is very mutual but not on this I love how lyrically he's diving into a lot of the critiques that people have thrown a tweezer over the years and maybe he's acknowledging them a little bit the lack of edge the mediocrity the homogeneous Asian he's saying what a lot of people have been saying and he puts it into a very nicely packaged song but is he only saying what sort of maybe longtime Weezer fans or X Weezer fans have been wanting to hear because it's not like this album isn't without its mediocre moments you have lonely girl like you you were just singing about mediocrity and then you put out this song lonely girl which maybe has some of the most insipid lyrics of any Weezer song not just that but the song is just way too cliche to handle and even further on the cliche scale is the male/female duet on the song go away again you were just singing about mediocrity and you're doing a song here that sounds like a really terrible chien hem tune we have a lead single from this LP back to the shack which instrumentally is a pretty catchy tune but lyrically I'm not really sure I'm that into the concept we have river singing about hey you know let's get out of this crappy singing show stuff and instead get back to what we do best and what we're familiar with them when we know is great and what we know the fans want get back to the shack do the writing do the rocking just be Weezer and in this song lyrically we have river singing about going hardcore like it's 94 when in fact this song does not sound like 94 Weezer it sounds like 2001 Weezer anybody who's a Weezer fan knows that and while in concept I do agree with the the jabot stupid singing shows the alternative that Weezer is bringing to the table here is really only like a lesser of two evils it's not like oh my god this is what I should be doing instead and the opening track on here to over 20 years as a band and Weezer is still singing about that feel when no girlfriend not just that but this song is also an example of how atrocious the production can get on this record the song kicks off with this overly loud bass e and compressed guitar riff that is just so boom and so crushing like what are you trying to prove you don't got to go super heavy just to impress us and besides when the guitars get this loud which they do occasionally you can't even really make out the vocals that well so yeah the the years of musical abuse I have had my heart turned a little cold when it comes to Weezer however there are still moments on this record where they get to me like on the song the British are coming which is a little overly simplified as far as the history behind the song but it's still a little fun left hook patriotism pop rock tune which I didn't see coming then there's the song da Vinci which I think has one of Weezer's best hooks in years on it and I like the lyrical concept of this song saying that this person that maybe a love interest is very hard to describe their abstract they're different they just have no precedent they're hard to put into words saying that not even da Vinci could paint this person not even Stephen Hawking could explain this person we've got Cleopatra which to me sticks out as a unique tune just because of how oddly shaped and grooved the lead melody is on the chorus really weird hook it feels almost as if like the drums and the guitars bust in maybe like a beat early and it's a bit of a surprise like on the British are coming we also have a bit of a nod to history on this song but the concept of this track really lies in aging and just growing older and growing colder emotionally which maybe runs parallel to the whole Weezer rock fan dynamic going on right now that's mentioned on a few tracks here there's the song foolish father where we kind of see rivers very well-documented daddy issues kind of playing out into a sequel song here where maybe he's reflecting a little bit on the fact that he is a father now and has to kind of work through these difficulties at a different angle and once again the song is incredibly catchy straightforward sweet that classic Weezer formula at work once again in this track like many other songs on here work through the themes set out by the title of this album that I guess everything will work out when it's all over and the record itself definitely does that it resolves really well with this trio of songs that are filled with soaring guitar harmonies it's a really grand epic and ambitious finish for this record for Weezer in general maybe some of you might be thinking this trio of tracks was trying a little too hard but I personally like the fact that Weezer seems to be trying at all it really feels like they're putting an effort into these songs and again while this record may not exactly be mature Weezer at least tries to build a bridge to a lot of their older fans saying hey listen we hear you and we know the issue and we know the problem and essentially we're just like a little sorry for it and it's it's nice to hear that but only sometimes does it feel like Weezer is actually working to fix these issues and as a result as much as I like a lot of the tracks here it's sort of hard to be totally gung-ho about this record because of the disappointing moments I'm peeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition though I guess I did totally end up digging a lot of this record yeah you know it's it's a likable album it's a good album I just uh you know it's it's it's just uh it's just hard not to at least be just a touch disappointed because of just how high the high-water marks were at least for me anyway earlier on in Weezer's career but that's it you know it feels like a throwback album a little bit but again it's very much a throwback to like the early 2000s Weezer not the 90s Weezer cool cool have you given this album we'll listen if you have what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and um and that's it Anthony Fantana Weezer forever

vac3FDyjb5M,good rice city and beans how here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new caribou record our love hailing from Canada caribou is the longtime musical project of singer songwriter and producer daniel smith who in the early 2000s also used to release music under the name manitoba and more recently under the name Daphne primarily Dan's music is electronic but on records such as and/or there is a strong presence of acoustic instrumentation or live instrumentation as well dan may be inspired by stuff like house but he is equally inspired by genres such as psychedelic pop however on more recent releases such as swim as well as the JA long record he put out under the Daphne name we see Dan's music getting more electronic maybe a little colder a little more introspective but still very groove intensive on this new record he might continue in that direction but it has been four years since the last caribou record so who knows however a fusion of Daphne and Caribous last record swim is exactly what this new caribou album sounds like because in comparison to swim our love certainly does feel like it has gone further on the electronic side of the spectrum and I think in comparison with Daphne and swim this record is noticeably straightforward as well right from this album's lead single dance Nate's sounds his compositions his ideas I guess his concepts everything is is very out in the open and obvious we've got a very subtle house rhythm on this thing bit of a micro house vibe very quiet a cyclical vocal sample just repeating and repeating and repeating creating a rhythm along with the beats can do it can do with that we're getting a little bit of a mantra this idea of needing someone this is reflected in dance Nate's falsetto vocal which of course is soaked in reverb I'm gonna do that too the song has a lot of good individual elements but as a whole the track is kind of underwhelming it certainly got a beat and a lyric and a set of chords and maybe all of this instrumentation comes together into a really life-affirming EDM style swell but the song fizzles out immediately after reaching its highest peak of intensity the song really could have gone on for about three more minutes building off of what at this point really only felt like an established idea instead of transitioning into another half of the song or segwaying into a great follow up track we get the song silver which just feels like a throwaway piece of chillwave circa 2009 or 2010 with the analog synthesizers and the kind of jarring vocal samples and very easygoing beat it sounds like washed out produced it mixed with like a little bit of Arthur Russell on tracks like this caribou is taking the the shortcomings of your average bedroom producer and turning them into an aesthetic there are similar vocal characteristics on the song all I need but at the core of this track is one of the better Tunes melodically on the entire record plus the strings and the synth layers on this track are quite nice and it's around this point in the record I'm actually sort of slowly starting to catch on to the themes of love or maybe the themes of loss of love and this record does continue to follow through with that lyrical concept and narrative however it doesn't really change the lack of compelling songs and instrumentals on this thing like with the song dive and Julia brightly to short interlude esque tracks in the middle of an album whose songs have little impact as it is we don't need a break from everything we need things to pick up or the song Mars which has one of the nastiest drum grooves on the entire record I'm just loving the very alive feeling drum pattern that is looped it's very coughing as it's very busy it's very intense but a lot like many tracks from swim caribou doesn't bring a significant amount of progression to this track to justify it's even five minutes of length and the title track - after a very subtle first half which does begin to lose me the song gets louder and starts indulging in every technical shei in the book from the hi-hat pattern to the pitch vocal samples to the bass line even though the song did get more lively I still kind of prefer the nice strings and the falsetto vocals on the first part of the song the first song hit me emotionally after all I ever need is the song second chance it switches it up vocally bringing another singer to the table and she's absolutely wonderful on the track and she gives this performance that sort of smells a little bit like alternative R&B but caribou is doing something way different instrumentally than people like how to dress well for example his keyboards on this track her just throbbing and pulsating and they're so crunchy they're so vibrant they're so loud they're just as colorful as the album art we're getting over here it's a wonderful track and then the to closing songs on this thing lyrically are maybe two of the most coherent songs on the entire record really starting to bring the whole concept of the story of this love that Dan has been singing about home and even though this album may end in a touch of sadness and loneliness the concept really does come together especially as the instrumentals on these two songs make for some of the most intoxicating pretty and gentle music on the entire record there are some things I dislike about this new caribou record or just some things that I'm simply underwhelmed by but the moments I do love I'm just completely wowed with this record in a lot of ways is sort of like the opposite of swim to me it's just not as lively and not only that but I found the singles on this record to be the least impressive tracks and the deeper cuts moved me way much more with swim it was the polar opposite but I don't really think our love as much of a singles album anyway again it's a bit of a concept record not a very lofty or detailed concept record or a lengthy concept record but it's got a strong love flavored theme all the same it's an electronic heartbreak and while it's not going to be one of my favourites of this year I was happy and very pleased to catch up with Caribous music once again I look forward to what he's doing in the future I'm feeling a strong a decent sick on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana a music sluta squad forever

q_gBZFYXHQI,hi everyone drums in the mama tonneau here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review of the new Sun Kil moon song the war on drugs suck my cock strangely enough this track is one of the most highly anticipated folk in singer-songwriter music singles to drop this year it's a song from Sun Kil moon which if you didn't know is a musical project masterminded by singer/songwriter Mark kozilek musically mark has had a pretty astronomical year with Sun Kil moon with the release of his album Benji his latest album Benji earlier this year which has garnered him more attention than Sun Kil moon has seen in a pretty long time about the early 2000s or even dating back to his 90s work in the Red House Painters however Mark's mouth has been gaining him more attention than his music lately most notably at a North Carolina performance where he was said to have told the crowd who he categorized as hillbillies to shut the fuck up but the biggest and most controversial incident of this occurred at an Ottawa Folk Festival where apparently mark was playing at the same time as the war on drugs a Americana alt-country psychedelic krautrock band whose album I reviewed earlier this year it was good but the thing about the war on drugs is they are electric and a lot of their songs are quite loud and I guess on the other stage they were performing on over the hill the sound was bleeding over and Mark and his band and even the audience could hear it I guess it was to the point where it was distracting mark wasn't happy about it some people have tried to turn this into an issue of ego which may be to a degree it is but as anyone who thinks with their head and not what their keyboard knows nothing can make it harder to perform music than to not hear yourself perform but the takeaway from this experience wasn't a lesson in folk festival scheduling or technicals but off-color staged banter because going into the next song mark said the name of this next track is the war on drugs suck my cock which any reasonable person might interpret as a joke since no such song existed in addition to this mark also had a post on his website saying there was no malicious intent behind the stage banter and that he chalked the whole thing up to a technical issue with the festival not the war on drugs but content hungry music websites and an overly sensitive social climate turned this whole thing into a big Sun Kil moon versus the war on drugs it may be a one-sided beef but it's a beef all the same for a lot of people this assumption was confirmed when Mark dared to have an opinion on the war on drugs music which was totally controversial for some reason musicians have preferences and opinions like the rest of us not only that but marks criticisms are quite innocuous mostly boiling down to dismissive comparisons to other artists like John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen and Don Henley for some people this is going to be a bad thing for some people this is gonna be a good thing as evidenced by the numerous positive music reviews about the new war on drugs record comparing the war on drugs to the very same artists so with Mark essentially unhappy and sort of aggravated but still in good humor about this whole situation being turned into a beef he decided to give us what we wanted a song titled the war on drugs suck my cock a song he immediately released after meeting the band who in this very song he describes as nice but that didn't keep even this song from being controversial in this track instrumentally it's pretty much like many songs off of Benji we just have to tars vocals some overdubs though these overdubs aren't quite as concise or as well put together as many of the overdubs on Benji instrumentally this song seems a little thrown together but we still get about seven minutes of music and five verses kind of talking about these five recent instances of Mark I guess getting in trouble for expressing himself and reacting to the drama surrounding these situations we have a verse about the Ottawa incident where mark isn't telling the war on drugs to suck his cock but he is merely repeating the phrase in the chorus because he is singing about when he said that the second verse is about the North Carolina incident and here again we have mark singing again and again and again in the chorus the thing he said that was so controversial we just have him singing what he said owning up to it admitting it but yet also not backing down because mark is of the position that he's not going to back down from stage banter or whatever random bullshit he says on stage which does make mark look grumpy and it makes him look like a curmudgeon but after blowing the situation up into something it isn't it's not like the music media is the moral authority on proper conduct if Mark is beefing with anything it's the needlessly dramatic overreaction to his off-color comments on stage but of course the music media isn't gonna spin it that way they're not gonna act like mark is mad at them they're going to act like Mark is mad at the war on drugs that makes it seem more dramatic that makes it seem like it's more beef which brings us to the third verse on this track where we are getting the only authentically mint pejorative terms on this entire song I think where Mark is calling a particular blogger spoiled a bitch and a brat and a dumb shit for posting a bit of chalk graffiti Sun Kil moon go fuck yourself a little petty but if that's how he feels that's how he feels from here we go on to mark meeting the war on drugs in the fourth verse he says that their hair is long and greasy even though they're nice but he hopes they don't have lice he goes on to call them the whitest band he's ever heard but given that he thinks this song is funny and it's totally meant in jest we kind of have an instance of the pot calling the kettle black a little bit here not only that but mark repeating the opinions which he will not back down from on the war on drugs because there's nothing wrong with having an opinion mark pokes a little bit of fun at the war on drugs fan base in the last verse which you have to understand must be in jest as well since Mark probably has bridge-and-tunnel people as his fans as well and that's literally what goes on in the track personally I enjoyed this song however in a lot of ways it's technically and and lyrically flawed however it is self-aware in that do you think Mark really sat down and spent hours and hours and hours writing that blogger writing that other verse where he's hoping that the guys and the war on drugs don't have lice mark clearly feels that all of this is trivial because it is we get bad lyrics because this is a bad song topic and if this is a bad idea for a song why is it not a bad idea for a really dramatic blog article or a think piece this song is not a sweet dish and it's not abuse either don't trivialize abuse by conflating this with actual verbal abuse that's dumb and just in case you're not aware one of the most popular genres on the planet is loaded with figurative verbal references to oral sex tell me should we start crying foul at battle rap because male and female battle rappers are verbally abusing one another I hope you can still get a refund for that standard at the standard store because it's a double and that's it that's all I think about this track it's a fun song it's a joke and that's it transition hey thanks for watching you're the best go chill have a breather take a fruit smoothie you'll be good just let those nerves calm down cool cool Anthony Fan Tan Oh Sun Kil moon forever

vBHEEDUkme8,hi everyone - any dead tail here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flying Lotus record your dead Flying Lotus is a West Coast music producer known for his incredibly forward-thinking fusion of jazz electronic music hip hop he is also a label head over at brain feeder records many people consider him to have dropped albums that are modern classics like Los Angeles and cosma grandma and on his fifth album here he is following up what I consider to be one of the more underwhelming records in his discography until the quiet comes a record where I think stylistically he was treading a little bit of water some songs on this album sounded like they could have come off of his pattern grid world EP but this album also features some of his most just subtle and toned down material yet it just kind of fell into the background for me whenever I would play it which is kind of an issue I have with many brain feeder records releases so I walked away from this project looking forward to flylo's next project hoping for something a little more lively a little more refreshing and with your dead I got that one of the most notable changes right from the get-go on this album is that there are more vocal features on this LP some honest-to-god rap verses from Kendrick Lamar and Snoop Dogg angel dear Dorian of Dirty Projectors Fame lands on this record Nicki Randa who is a prior collaborator with Flying Lotus and Thundercat as well who is not only on this album vocally but basically as well I'm sure and as if we didn't see this coming Flying Lotus also appears on this record vocally as his low-pitched alter-ego captain Murphy who many of you may remember from his once anonymous solo effort not too long ago something else to note with this record is that it's 38 minutes one of the shorter albums and flylo's discography thus far but I also think you are dead is one of flylo's most upbeat and active albums as well I think this record has the jazzy density of Kozma grandma without all the meandering and the and the atmosphere the music that occurs on this record very tangible it's very bold it's very forceful this record twists and turns and tumbles and flips like a gymnast but an issue that I think some people may have with this album is that some of the tracks some of the musical passages are rather short they're kind of brief they build up to a moment or they create an idea but as soon as that idea is established it's not really fleshed out as much as it is just transformed into something else there are a lot of one-minute tracks on this record and in that regard this album can be compared to something like J Dilla's doughnuts or even a mad lib instrumental album but I think a lot of the pieces of this sonic ear candy though it may be short effectively builds off of one another enhances one another some of the short but amazing musical experiences that these little tracks bring and are incredible right from the start of this record the intro where we're getting these heavy orchestral strings just this dense instrumentation it's so huge it's so massive I just really feel it and even though the song ends in about a minute 24 it glides quite perfectly into the next track which introduces some great bass lines so the killer drums some good keys and this jazz fusion feel gets just turned up the heat gets turned up on the next song cold dead which is just some explosive jazz rock some distorted riffs on this track mixed with these atmospheric musical passages of saxophone and keyboards this album really is flying lotuses bitches brew or even his music is one note coming up not too soon after this track is never catch me with Kendrick Lamar I did a track review for this song I will link it at the end of this video you can watch it there I'm not going to dive too much deeper into my thoughts on this track here but in that track review I thought this track while good not amazing but good would sound better in the context of this album and in fact that happens when this song comes on it's like a fog or a smoke clears or some significant occurrence occurs it's like Cinderella and you're watching this woman in a beautiful gown just come down the stairway ready to have fun at the ball it's not like you're just one tiny unfinished song after another with your dead if you just completely ignore the tracklisting and don't look at the tracklisting while you're listening to this album the entire record sounds like one holistic piece it may jump around a little bit but it features some interesting and nicely crafted segues this is a sensation I also get from until the quiet comes but it feels so much stronger on your dead this album is easily flying lotuses most holistic project yet and even though I love that about this record and I think this is a fantastic record it's not without its underwhelming moments which come here and there it's a handful attracts namely dead man's Tetris with Snoop Dogg his verse his guest verse is kind of underwhelming it's not really anything to write home about Plus for whatever reason this instrumental is far more modulated especially toward the end than any other beat on this record kind of ruins the flavor of the track for me anyway but it's not like this record ever hits a lull anywhere every time I find a track that it's just okay the album picks right back up with a great song it does so right here with Turkey dog coma which features some incredible drumming and there is great drumming all over this record some great rhythms all over this record but here particularly the rhythms are intense moving from there we have the lovely and amazing vocal interlude cornice the Terminator really chilling in heavenly song I love the group vocals on this track they're absolutely stunning Flying Lotus is doing a better and better job with each record just honing and crafting and finding gorgeous sounds Flying Lotus continues to weave this really cohesive musical tapestry tapestry with the song Turtles which features some great hand percussion some blissful female vocals some ascending and descending bass lines ready or not which kind of feels like a little introspective bit of mid-90s IDM with a really quirky drum loop that you know only Flying Lotus would use descent into madness with Thundercat is fantastic melodically and chord wise as well to me this kind of feels like an interlude that would land on like a King Crimson album and Thundercats typically falsetto Vogel are very nice on this track then immediately after we get another vocal appearance from captain Murphy or Flying Lotus himself and he is singing here in falsetto as well it's like a bit of Warped soul music from the 70s or the 80s it's kind of funky but kind of slow and strange as well and he's singing about pills and just generally being unhappy to me the song kind of feels like what Tyler the Creator wishes some of his songs sounded like and this song is a serious risk it's like the weirdest track on the entire LP but my one disappointment with it is not that the experiment fails but Flying Lotus just fades it out which is just oh he was doing so well making one track segue to another why would you just flush this one down the toilet if you're gonna do something this weird stick with it finish it the second last track on this LP is it is incredibly orchestral just like the intro it kind of glides into a an anticlimactic closer but I still ended up loving this LP it was a serious journey it was colorful and varied and dynamic had a lot of personality each song had its own little unique direction and flavor and yet it just came together so well I'm giving this record a strong 8 to a light 9 I'm loving it I'm feeling it transition if you give in this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Flying Lotus forever 
i92M9lzXQFM,hi everyone southern e-track tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new subtract record wonder where we land subtract is the pseudonym of electronic music producer and songwriter Aaron Jerome I loved his last full-length album his debut full-length album came out in 2011 I loved his very subtle instrumentals there were little sparse they had very nimble beats on them some warm bass well composed synthesizers many of his instrumentals influenced by two-step and UK bass dubstep now truth be told the instrumentals on this record we're good but they weren't like amazing to me you know it's not like they were meaty with sound play or really dense with detail or just really showstoppers but I still loved this album because I thought subtract had an incredible chemistry with his vocal guests like with sampe on the song hold on I love this song perfect track on this record group and then we have wildfire with Yuki naeun igano of little dragon this is one of the best singles of 2011 subtract had Jessie where before she blew up on this record roses Gabor was pretty decent on her track too I worried a little bit about whether or not subtract was going to pull through on a second LP because of how heavily dependent my enjoyment of this record was on the vocal guests not to mention the musical trends that subtract was riding in 2011 have all kind of died down by now then the pile worried on top of worry the first big single from this LP drop new drop New York with Ezra Koenig from Vampire Weekend on vocals and as I first listened to this song I just felt this depressing crushing sense of disappointment come over my entire being I was thinking this can't be happening I'm in an alternate universe right now as you're on here doing his usual pretty boy falsetto he's matching that up with some spoken word non sequiturs the beat is kind of horrendous very heavy bass some drum circle rhythms there's some demonic chorus effects too this track was most definitely undeniably experimental but in like the worst waise so going into this album it's very apparent that subtract is going to be reaching out reaching outside of his small camp of mostly uk-based vocalists however the results only come through some of the time like with higher that features Rory of all people and to me this tractors feels like a mixtape demo the beat is alright but there's nothing really about it that says to me Oh subtract made this Rory's got this really quiet underwhelming flow on this track I'm just not seeing what makes it so exciting however with the song look away featuring Caroline Poehler check of chairlift that's a fantastic track really killer chorus vocal melody with some odd effects on it and even though there are some meandering moments on this track I'm loving the very sluggish heavy bass the high hats really grand pianos it's a pretty epic track and then of all people we also get war paint on this record and ASAP ferg voices among the very start of the song we see ASAP ferg doing his best kid cudi impression and the verse itself on this track is incredibly telling giving a little bit of back history with ASAP ferg and his father addiction there's some very dramatic kind of jazzy drumming in the background of this track maybe something that would translate to you if you really love that absol book of soul track off of control system but adversely there are also some incredibly goofy moments coming from Ferg lyrically on this track not only with the the mantra of this song but also Logano go boom emotionally and topically the song felt a little disjointed at times or maybe it's just that it wasn't able to take its emotional subject matter and turn into something compelling thankfully on this record we do get some familiar faces and for the most part they do have good performances people like Sampha and Jessie ware but there are some various reasons as to why these tracks don't hit me quite in the same way that the 2011 tracks did for one temporary view great tune great melody at the core of this song but the really bright dry loud trebly synthesizers that ruin the dynamics of this track really compete with Sam fo for attention instead of getting a really passionate electronically tinged soul song I just kind of feel like you know he's he's thrown onto the back burner when he's really one of the more entertaining things about this song then going in the complete opposite direction we have a track on here where sample is just doing a short one minute solo piano ballad and it feels like he's taking over the entire record or the song that comes right afterward he's singing over a bit of synthetic funk that sounds like he's collaborating with Thundercat not putting together a subtract song while this track isn't terrible it only adds to the feeling that this album is like a mixtape which is kind of strange considering that even though there were a bunch of different vocal guests on subtracts debut album it was a pretty cohesive record however the track Jessi where landed on with this LP I thought she should have landed on this record a Ken considering how passionate her vocals were on this track I thought uniquely passionate for her I think she was a little more lively than she usually is and I think the instrumental was incredibly interesting too with these weird broken pianos it's a very textured B I loved some of the risks that subtract is taking on this record I just think the end results are kind of scattered and don't get pulled together especially given how much filler is on this LP like the day one track and the day five track which are pretty but don't really add much to the cohesion of these songs there's the song everybody knows which I thought was going to be an instrumental I wish wasn't instrumental because it has this vocal Cup playing toward the back end of it that just says hey skip this track and then OCA which isn't a bad song either it's a pretty little drone it's kind of like listening to a one of those rainforest effects CDs but from the year 20xx and all the parrots and all the monkeys and the various birds and bugs you hear tweeting and chirping and buzzing or all half machine half organic beings at the end of the day while I didn't love this LP I still have to give it to subtract for just taking so many I don't care what happens risks with this record names just going to grab some ideas he thought would turn out into some cool songs and just ran with them I think he brought on a lot of guests and created a lot of sounds that we weren't affecting it's just that some of these tracks aren't that enjoyable and even more of them are more surprising for him than they are legitimately interesting I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana subtract forever 
Up6qz8TLGYE,hi everyone 3:30 a.m. taro in the morning shooting this right now here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Ice Age record plowing into the field of love you think it's the same field in here same field maybe ice age is a Danish post-punk and noise rock band that has an incredibly dark and dismal sound they flirt a little bit with goth rock - thus far they have dropped - incredibly abrasive crushing and depressing albums albums that feature very chaotic production and instrumentation very drain and frustrated vocals from frontman Elias bender Ronon felt their sophomore LP is the more dynamic of the two albums and their very short discography I love the aggressive tracks on this record but I came away impressed the most by songs like morals a very sad yet energetic very charged and dreary piano ballad infused with Ice Ages typically noisy guitars and drums in a lot of ways the song was just ice age as usual but with way more finesse plus the promise the idea of there being more instrumental accompaniment into the future was pretty exciting it is something that I in fact hoped for I guess maybe even a little bit predicted on their latest LP right here their third full-length album plowing into the field of love instrumentally Ice Age went all out you've got their usual just very heavy chaotic pummeling punishing drums and guitars and vocals but that is now enhanced by acoustic guitars and pianos and horns and strings there are more melodies woven into these songs as well in general and the chord progressions that Ice Age tends to favor on this record feel a little more harmonious even if that harmony may be a bit of a minor one or a sour one and even though I say just showing more finesse on this record whether it be in the way that they're writing these songs because they are so delivering longer songs on this record that you routinely hit the four five minute mark the entire album is longer than any record they've ever put out thus far reaching almost 50 minutes in length considering their last two records were under 30 minutes each it's a pretty big jump but I say just showing a lot of finesse as well in the way the instrumentation comes together on this record - ice age most definitely showing a gentler side on this record a more subtle side a more detailed side they are writing more complex beautiful songs however they still manage to maintain a very gruff outward appearance they still manage to write and deliver just oppressively cacophonous songs Joy Division and Bauhaus still seem to be primary influences in Ice Ages music but on this new record something I mentioned on my track review for their song forever there is a huge Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds vibe going on with this LP which to me is a musical world that is not untapped in today's modern music market but I think under tapped similar to that of some of the Bad Seeds best stuff in the 80s and 90s Ice Age hit a balance of beauty and ugly but even though this influence may seem pretty apparent at least to me I still think Ice Age has remained its own animal even though they have brought more instrumentation into the fold and the drums and the guitars they may be particularly noisy and chaotic I think ice ages production style has stayed roughly the same as it was on their previous LP and the vocals on Ice Ages record have have mostly stayed the same as well though they have become more dynamic and I think Elias has done a better job of just sort of exploring melody and exploring different I guess inflections and stuff like that all I'm trying to say is that he's not really frightening or commanding in the same way that Nick Cave is rather he maintains a lot of the same emotional characteristics that we know him for on previous records the frustration just the despair his singing is just the epitome of emotional turmoil when he sings it sounds like he is struggle just crawling his way through a desert he hasn't had a drink for days he is on his last breath and their buzzards circling overhead I was impressed with the initial tracks that ice age dropped before the release of this album they really wanted to just send the signal out there to fans that this record is going to be different there's going to be more instrumentation the songs are going to be longer it's going to be different expected to be different and I mean loud and clear the message was I expected a different record and this certainly is a different record in the best way possible in such a way that the band is able to maintain everything you loved about them in their previous stuff but somehow have made it more complex engaging compelling they just built it up I think there's more variety on this record than any Ice Age album so far there are some wonderful slow burners on this thing like the very dreary string kissed against the moon which has some wonderful piano arpeggios in it too or even the song forever incredibly slow song very dismal very depressing and an amazing ending on this track too so so so climactic especially with the horn I love the closer the title track on this thing it just feels like getting your heart ripped out the chords are so heavy they're so downtrodden the ending is just really intense and noisy this track makes the angst of even the saddest 90's records just seem like a walk in the park the song Cimmerian shade is one of the noisiest and and more intense tracks on this record and the melodies coming out of the song are so sinister they're so evil very menacing strung out guitars all over this song and then there are tracks on this record that I think are outright fun like the song the Lord's favor one of the lead singles from this LP fantastic track iceage doing kind of a rockabilly thing taking their post-punk e noise rocky guitars and applying it to the do-do-do-do-do bass lines in a country song Elias vocals are totally strung out more than ever but still through his some compelling melodies for this song and then there's also the track abundant living which has this really gnarly riff playing throughout it that I think is played on a mandolin doo doo doo de song has some serious swagger to it the band is just kicking ass all over this song there are moments where this album just straight-up rocks like on how many and even in the really propulsive rock instrumentation Ice Age finds room for pianos and maybe some very sudden breakneck musical passages and changes like at the 1-minute mark of this song there's the song simony which is another great tune but maybe this is where ice age pull the most from The Joy Division playbook on this record there are a few songs that are maybe more chaotic than they are melodic and I think the tune sort of suffers a little bit as a result maybe with the song let it vanish a little bit but even this song is it really that much weaker than some of the best tracks here even on my least favorite tracks I'm finding the lyrics to be just so ah just the the sadness and the depression behind these songs it's just it's just so rife these track these structures so rife with the nastiness just the dismal Ness these are characteristics again that I've enjoyed about ice ages previous records but it is just so much stronger here and what's awesome is that they've been able to create these dismal feelings by bringing more beautiful melodies and instrumentation into the fold they've they've made me feel like less emotionally by giving me more musically I think this is a fantastic record I think it's a stellar record I think this is one of the best rock records of the year no question Ice Age just really pulled through on this one even though I love the initial singles I didn't think the album was going to be this fantastic I'm feeling a decent a strong 9 on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Ice Age forever 
Y7seq3mi-hY,symphony concerto here the Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching and it's time it's time for a review of the new shellac record dude incredible this is the latest full-length LP from famed underground rock outfit shellac they have been releasing albums pretty steadily since the mid 90s for example their debut LP at action Park a pretty significant record in the noise rock post hardcore math rock canon but a great deal of shellac reputation is built upon that of one of its members Steve Albini of course we cannot downplay the input from other members such as Todd Trainor and Bob Weston Bob you might also remember him from doing tape loops and sound effects for Mission of Burma but Steve is a super producer engineer studio owner he's worked with everyone from Slynt to the Pixies Nirvana Don cab the Jesus Lizard screaming females Cloud Nothings and despite my love of his other projects like big black sometimes Steve's reputation as a producer and an engineer overshadows his influence as an artist regardless that is what we are going to focus on here with this new LP dude incredible is an album of music that is as clearly and as boldly stated as the title that represents it this thing is nine tracks 33 minutes we have guitars drums various members of the band trading off on vocal duties there are loads of very crunchy sharp distorted guitars and bass guitar on this thing sometimes the guitars can get kind of shrill or so distorted that the sound is just like destructive it's on fire it's crumbling shellac continues on this new record to offer pummeling grooves and riffs that often times are in a really weird time signature on this new record shellac continues to offer pummeling riffs some of which ride some some off-kilter grooves a lot of these riffs or guitar leads are repeated to help bring tension up as the song progresses the vocals feature some yelling some screaming some kind of raw spoken word a little bit of amateurish singing and the production as usual is pretty clear it's pretty crisp the drums are really boomy the guitars and the bass are really close and up in your face I think the vocals are a little muffled unfortunately on this record when comparing them to previous shellac efforts especially at action Park and a thousand Hertz but still on this new LP like on previous releases the are usually pretty stark and no BS one of my favorite tracks from 1000 Hertz you'll hear a lyric like this is such a sad  song we'll be lucky if I don't break out crying all of these characteristics I just mentioned you can find running pretty continually through the entire shellac discography shellac sticks to its self applied minimalist tag as well there aren't that many overdubs or layers on this record the distortion isn't usually so heavy that it takes away from the dynamics of the guitars everything here is pretty free of reverb the the recording overall just very dry it's very clear that shellac pulls a lot from bands like Mission of Burma or have a great appreciation for the music of Fugazi or take a great deal of influence from bands like wire and I guess it's cool to see that these influences still have a place on the band's newest records it's also another instance of the incredibly raw and dynamic performances that usually find themselves on a shellac record - there is a lot of interplay on this record record record record Steve Bob and Todd are just together in a way that you don't really hear a lot of bands together in studio recordings these days whether it be in commercial radio music or even in the underground because it's easier to record stuff digitally and just kind of multitrack stuff now and this comes out right from the start of this LP with the opening track that features a guitar riff that feels like it's pulled right out of a stoner rock song but they groove it out in a totally different way once the bass and the drums come in this is a six minute long track there's numerous parts to it a few surprise changes I owe that hook that I can't totally make out the lyrics mostly because the vocals do feel kind of muffled in comparison of vocals on previous records like I mentioned earlier but still the hand and the hand are there the energy the electricity behind this part in the song is just crushing there are a few likeable angular left-field rock songs on this record like the very dreary track Gary or even the incredibly funny at the very end I'm riding bikes but most of the tracks here feel more like abstract experiments in rock art and that's totally fine that's why I enjoy wire albums like 154 or why I enjoy earlier shellac records this results in moments like all the surveyors we're in the middle of the track with these pummeling raw guitarists you're getting these calls of kah kah kah song surveyor is great too this album has quite an obsession with surveyors although I wish that obsession led to a good track on the mayor / the surveyor which is kind of a one minute instrumental where the guitarist is so horrendously half-baked it just kind of leads me to think did you write this did you write anything or did you just figure you were gonna wing it while I do like relaxed performances and their energy and their aesthetic I guess you can't really go into this LP expecting a catchy straightforward or even an entirely visceral rock album because there are some I guess anti songs on here tracks like you came in me or the people's microphone hard-hitting tracks but they're also kind of daunting and challenging to you know you're going to need patience for these songs I suppose although these tracks - a lot like mayor surveyor do feel a tad under in as well overall I would say this is a pretty good LP there are some underwhelming tracks there are some great tracks the entire album itself is kind of short and given that shellac really hasn't made any effort toward reinventing themselves on this LP it does have a lot of similarities with their past catalogue although in a lot of ways they are doing what they have always done as well as they have always done it I'm glad bands like this are still kicking if you're a die-hard experimental rock fan I would say give this record to listen and especially check out their back catalogue if you haven't already I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana shellac dude incredible forever 
NN1P-fPxZ7U,hi everyone used to be Fant anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Thom Yorke record tomorrow's modern boxes Thom Yorke singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist producer famed frontman of Radiohead one of the most significant musical acts of the 2000s there's not really anything that can be said about their early and definitive years that hasn't already been written broadcast each tin to stone but Radiohead's latest output has kind of been consumed by the band's attraction to or maybe even just Thom Yorke's attraction to electronics most famously on the latest full-length LP the King of Limbs which drew quite a few comparisons from Tommy works first solo endeavor the eraser the beats the instrumentals on this LP were pretty stiff pretty lifeless in comparison with a lot of Radiohead's other material however Thom Yorke followed this project up pretty quickly with another project Atoms for Peace the record he dropped through that project amok seemed like a much more well-put-together version of what was going on on the King of Limbs in my opinion some of the tracks off these two records I like some of them I don't my views on these albums are a little mixed I think Tom loves the explorative qualities of electronic music the complexities of electronic music as do I which is why I follow a lot of his forays into this stuff but sometimes Tom really fails to make this genre come to life for me because the end result when he produces something is typically very static and kind of lifeless and maybe that's part of the reason he feels so attracted to these sounds the lack of humanity the lack of an organic feel however I can't say in the case of Tom's music it's something I vibe with 100% even if he does manage to drop a real sense of melancholy and introspection in these songs from the King of Limbs I thought amok was a step forward and in my opinion I think tomorrow's modern boxes is kind of like a step back I think it's self-serving synthetic sadness compositionally I think these tracks are a little less flesh out than the material on amok and maybe even the King of Limbs in comparison I would say even a tad unimaginative there are lots of very dry frigid beats and since sequences on this LP and at times the synthesizer leads the bass lines the rhythms they barely feel like they're syncing up or complementing one another kind of like on the track there's no ice for my drink which is a relatively soulless instrumental there's a little very faint vocal accompaniment on this track not really anything lyric wise to be offered but this song is sort of in the minority on this very short album the majority of the tracks on this LP actually has Thom Yorke's vocals being very upfront very clear tom is delivering more of his typically nasal crooning but very few of these songs are actually that well developed you do have songs like the intro here which kicks off with a pretty great beat but it doesn't really progress into anything that significantly interesting or you do have songs that are really stripped back and skeletal and with the chord progressions and the melodies the vocal melodies they may be pretty appealing there's like a serious tune at the core of this song but instrumentally tom doesn't really build things up beyond the very sparse simple tune that he offers it's like these songs are either suffering from debilitating depression or just a little writer's block or just the couldn't be bothered blues I like the aesthetic of this album I like the sense of place this album has but it's sort of like being rocketed into space without any of the fun or excitement or newness of actually being in space again I do like the aesthetic of this album and there are parts musically that do stand out to me again with chord progressions sort of like the closer the vocal melody on this track is really great as well then there is brain in a bottle which it's got a great beat but it doesn't move on anything more interesting beyond the intro the song interference which I think is my favorite song on this record sounds like it could have made for a great intro or for a great song at the core of a track on a record like kid a and the song truth ray is actually stunningly beautiful as well I loved the way that the chords just drone throughout that entire track it's just intoxicating ly sad most of this a song no hype no pressure dropped out of nowhere album isn't that bad it's not that great either some of its good some of its just glaringly boring Thom Yorke here is just kind of indulging in a bit of digital diddling the results are mixed but I wouldn't mind listening to it again I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Thom Yorke tomorrow's modern boxes forever 
2IS6hJ5b2_k,hey everyone big scary volcano here the intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new perfume genius record too bright now with this review right here we're going to be experimenting a little bit it's going to be a co review live right here in the needle drop office and believe it or not we're going to be having kouchuu chesta in on this review giving his point of view talking about what he likes what he dislikes about this new perfume genius record it's kind of a weird thing to try but we're gonna let kow start off right here sort of telling me what his least favorite song on the album was okay thanks Amy well the perfect genie record my least favorite music from it I need real sense settings hold on hold on there's two things that's going to make this review perfect that I totally forgot about two things one I'm going to need you not to talk for the rest of the video don't talk again oh and to transition dramatic lighting transition perfume genius is the musical project of multi-instrumentalist Mike had rias super edgy very genius this is his third full-length album and I have been hotly anticipating this record considering I am a big fan of his songwriting style his two previous full lengths learning and put your back into it each album a heartbreak in every song on these records a teardrop Mike songs typically are kind of short skeletal instrumentally and melodically a lot of these songs sort of revolve around some very simple piano chords and Mike's incredibly powerful and emotionally charged voice and the chords that Mike works into his songs they're often played at a very slow or easygoing pace these progressions at times feel like they're informed a little bit by gospel music or maybe even some vintage pop on his latest songs mike has been finding ways to build up his typically simple piano led tunes with a lot of backing instrumentation and Mike's embrace of that studio sound quality of better sound quality in his music has led to a bit of a night and day difference on his first two records Mike continues down the path he was forging on put your back into it essentially finding new ways to put lush instrumentation behind his very emotionally choked up dirges and Mike also has a few musical experiments up his sleeves on this record - which is funny to think because he's not wearing sleeves however the opening track on this LP just kicks this album off in usual perfume genius fashion the song I decline is a beautiful spacious piano ballad with Mike singing some very sparse lyrics he sings very slowly and it makes it seem almost as if he's saying more than what he actually is but the lines of this track are pretty bare the message is pretty simple no no thanks I decline he seems to decline a tired line he declines what seems like an offer from an angel to save him I don't know if he's saying no to the cliche or if he is saying no to the idea of salvation in general either way it means for another perfume genius album where Mike essentially grabs happiness by the horns and wrestles it down to the ground in tintin tintin but learning from the success of past singles such as hood mike has made sure to put plenty of tracks on this new record that are actually quite visceral Mike delivers his most instrumentally dense tracks yet on this LP and inadvertently I think the end result is kind of poppy maybe perfume geniuses most accessible record yet there's some really prominent percussion on these tracks and the backing instrumentation is no longer as faint as it was as put your back into it take this on Queen for example great lead single from this LP buzzing keyboard notes on this track some really dramatic drum fills some descending epic mystical synthesizer melodies and a really explosive chorus - that is not only loaded with the strange way melodies but also what seems like a kind of backing up the percussion and the lyrics of this track are actually pretty interesting too it kind of seems like mike is painting this picture of a flawed crumbling emotionally inept matriarch moving on from this track to the song fool which has a seriously vintage feel to it like a piece of vintage pop from the finger snaps to the saxophones to the upright bass this song feels old school the song moves pretty quickly through a very brief and beautiful verse and then right in the middle of these two verses on the song all of a sudden things just go ethereal and Mike's voice just climbs up and up and up it's almost as if we've had a dream sequence in the middle of a song I love the song my body which is maybe the most experimental track on the entire record feels almost as if the song was written by timbre Tambor and Xu Shu and then handed over to Mike to perform this song has a 3/4 time signature eerie bassline some of Mike's most twisted vocals and lyrics yet it's like a racer head sick on the song long Pig we see Mike's singing over these really tightly wound bubbling synthesizer sequences that sound like they could have come out of a Vangelis song or a tangerine Dream's song but there's some very primal percussion going on in the background Mike does a fantastic job of mixing these two worlds the futuristic and just the the very primeval and another strange track but maybe one that I don't necessarily connect with is I'm a mother a song where Mike's vocals seemed to be just pitched so far downward they're kind of unintelligible and he sings with his voice just cracking and it's like he could barely hold the note he's just so distraught he just can't hold it together and it's the oddest sounding thing so there are definitely quite a few new ideas there are a lot of firsts on this perfume genius record there are actually a handful of songs on this thing that approach four minutes in length which is kind of a rarity in the perfume genius discography even the songs on this record that stick to Mike's typically simple formula of just heart-wrenching piano ballets kind of get uplifted a little bit at least toward the end where all of a sudden they break into a different musical phrase or introduce really epic instrumentation songs like no good or don't let them in but I do have my reservations about this record I think that with Mike extending more songs and trying to write longer songs there are some tracks that stay engaging throughout and there are some that don't plus even with the introduction of more instrumentation it's not like Michaels songwriting style at its core has changed that much so there is a little bit of melodic deja vu here and there on this record if you're familiar with Mike's back catalogue while I have no doubt that Mike can and will change moving into the future which is exemplified by tracks like grid there are some songs here that kind of show that Mike's approach to writing piano tunes can be a little limited at times and there are some moments here namely on the song no good where I feel like the bit of instrumentation or maybe the instrumental interlude or the instrumental shift toward the end of the track feels a little kind of tacked on but for the most part this is perfume genius sounding emotional and gorgeous as usual while I do personally prefer his last full-length album a little bit more I think this record is great as well and I highly recommend it I'm feeling a strongly to a light 9 on this LP transition if you given this album a listen what do you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana perfume genius to bright forever

hbTZCS0zxIA,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Milo album a toothpaste suburb Milo is a rapper whose roots lay back in Wisconsin and this is his first full-length commercial project which is kind of hard to think because I've been following this guy's music now for a handful of years and it's been kind of a long somewhat windy and rocky road to get to this point back in 2010 in Wisconsin Milo was yet to really go solo and was still making music in the rap project nom de rap but in 2011 that's when I heard of him he dropped his I wish my brother Rob was here mixtape which I totally loved then he put out an EP rapping over a bunch of bats instrumentals that I wasn't that crazy about but the following year is when he really came together not only prolifically but artistically putting out music under the scallops Hotel name-dropping music with Hellfire Club teaming up with open mike eagle and bus driver and no-can-do that was really coming out in a big way and then he was coming out with great solo projects that fans and critics alike seem to be praising like cavalcade and his things that happen to night things that happen at day EPS you may remember those are my favorite EPS of last year Milo's music was very slowly and very organically gaining a passionate audience and impressing the ears of child literacy advocates and export stars alike and the fact that Milo would be able to appeal to such a wide audience is not really surprising considering that in his music he comes off very clever funny humble likable smart and deviously nerdy it's funny to think of how many MCS are out there right now marketing themselves and pimping themselves out as being different breaking the mold and hip-hop I'm not your typical rapper but to me Milo right now really is that quintessential anti rapper and he could be dethroned one day but there are many emcees in my opinion that as hard are working against the self-centeredness and the brags and the materialism the aggression and the attitude and the few people who could compete with him on that level he's already collaborating with him on record and with these collaborators instead of hip-hop stereotypes Milo offers vulnerability abstractions philosophy an endless gauntlet of references to sci-fi RPGs and pop culture and a rap flow that borders on calming spoken word and a lyrical style that seems to emphasize the idea of just stream of consciousness free subject association rather than a clear theme or concept or storyline sonically the aesthetic of this project isn't really that too far off from what milo was doing on his things that happen to eps to produce he brings on a glue ghost tastes nothing gray hat and of course once again riley lake and together they assemble a group of instrumentals that not only are very ethereal and are very lush and colorful but have a bit of a West Coast flavor to them too like these guys are really pulling from Flying Lotus in that whole brain feeder camp maybe a little bit of James Blake too there are lots of punchy off-kilter beats very vibrant synthesizers from rich chords to very bubbly bleeps and bloops there are tons of effects laid into these instrumentals too I think by the end of this record the instrumental tone of this album does get a little old it does get a little stale it's not like there's a ton of variety across these beats even the ones that hit hardest are fairly gentle and aren't really that poppy nearly every beat here has kind of a relaxed vibe to it but some songs are softer more subtle more beautiful more ethereal and others are a little more dry and tangible but in terms of the lyrics it's a little bit more difficult to come together with a summation even though this record does start off with a really clear idea the opening track here starts off with a bit of a story Milo talking about moving into his first apartment his first apartment on the west coast his first apartment in general I'm not totally sure but he's talking about the life he's leading at this point rusty dollar-store pots and pans living broke borrowing a preamp from open mike eagle really tiny insignificant mundane things that in isolation would be totally uninteresting but Milo finds a way to pull them together into a pretty good song there are even some funny lines that turn up one where he says that he couldn't afford cover art from folk artist Clementine hunter there's a little mantra that Milo repeats a few times at the end of the track too but it doesn't really pull the song together but how could this little lyrical repetition pull this entire track together it's not like a package it's not a box it's a bunch of little trinkets just all strewn about toward the middle point of the instrumental things seem to go really ethereal for a moment Milo starts with whipping out these lyrics that seem to deal in violence and abuse toward black people talking about media lies a lot of stuff that seems to be pretty relevant given the recent events in Ferguson Missouri it's a really heartfelt moment in the song and for sure an authentic expression of what Milo feels on this topic however this moment in the track doesn't really have much more weight than any other moment in the track or any other moment on this record because it's mentioned it's approached with the same brevity that nearly everything else on this album is I think the mental state of this record can be boiled down to a single line in Milo's lyrics one where he says he was going to learn the keyboard and write several ballads but instead at a cookout he got lost in the tater salad listening to a toothpaste suburb is a lot like reading a series of diary entries and and bits of poetry from someone who has a severe inability to focus on anything and Milo's inability or refusal to focus is only emphasized by this records lack of hooks and Milo's sort of monotonous flow and voice and when Milo does try to write hooks they can be a little hit or miss some I like we can eat great clumps of sky but others like the song argyle socks which features one of the harder beats on the record they're a bunch of harp samples bus drivers going wild on the hook this instrumental is a freaking mess but to mention bus driver he dropped an album recently I loved that record and a lot like Milo he seems to avoid just delivering a simple straightforward song structure and when he does he really does something weird and progressive in the process he really does it on his own terms Milo also tries to opt out of traditional structures but he offers very little in their place for sure a lot of these beats instrumentals tracks are linear in structure we're sort of getting this one spot and then in the middle there's a significant change goes into something completely different but a lot of these changes a lot of this beauty a lot of what makes these songs intriguing from beginning to end has much more to do with the instrumentals than it does with Milo almost every single line on this project no matter how good it is is just dust floating in Milo's breath because each line builds off of and builds up to nothing it's like I'm listening to a melancholy punchline rapper with way too many inside jokes and whose sense of humor ranges from dry to incredibly immature the beginning of a toothpaste suburb is really great I think this album kicks off well and maybe that's partially because the fact that Milo doesn't offer much lyrical guidance through these songs it's it's yet to set in but it's the back end of this album that I think ends up really lacking especially starting with the song just us I mean you know I can't step in and say how you should or should not tribute a friend but to me this revision of this song doesn't really live up to the original in any way shape or form however this is one of the few songs that actually focuses on a topic and deliver some really personal accounts of a very significant moment in Milo's life and that alone makes this track so much more enjoyable than many of the other songs in the tracklist here the end of this record doesn't feel any more significant than the beginning of this record it's just all really so uneventful in my opinion and it's not that Milo is a one-dimensional rapper or one-dimensional artist it's just I think he goes about addressing all of these dimensions so haphazardly and so quickly and so effortlessly and so in significantly that at the end of the day it all sounds like it's just one dimension there's some great beats on this record a lot of the rhymes are endearing Milo still has a personality that I think is enjoyable in music but a lot of the things that at the start of his career made him kind standout and made him different on this project are now starting to limit him a little bit I think I'm feeling of strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should are you next and that's it Anthony Fantana a toothpaste suburb forever 
llJ-aWXhGX8,oh hi everyone synth any fan doctors here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan hello mister Fantan oh I'm wondering what is your opinion on the whole Joyce Manor no stage-dive no violence thing and about lead singer barry johnson calling out these stage divers especially with the texas show recently I'm a really huge fan of them they came down to do a show where I live and it was one of the best shows I went to in my entire life I understand where Barry is coming from about these people who come to shows with the intent of hurting others and then later calling them pussies for attending a punk show and then complaining about getting hurt I've been to a lot of shows where there were tons of people who do this and it makes the whole experience a very unpleasant one I feel as if any band not just Joyce Manor has the right to stop playing to make sure of the safety of everyone who attends their shows I want to know what are your thoughts on this whole incidents and I want to thank you in advance Mahalo from Hawaii thank you for the question I appreciate it good letter um if that's how Joyce Manor wants to run their shows I 110 percent support it personally I don't really have a strong stance on moshing or stage-diving I have mosh plenty of times before I think it's fun Cal throws down as well you can meet Cal in the pit however I completely understand why there are people who wouldn't necessarily want to be around that sort of thing or participate in that sort of thing plus I think moshing over decades has kind of created an unnecessary social stigma around certain types of underground music and even though I don't see an inherent issue with it there have been bands that that I love and have gone out and seen live that have just said hey listen guys stop it we don't want moshing to happen during our set and as a fan of that band if I was moshing at the time I had no problem in stopping even the band Fugazi famously took numerous stances at numerous shows against moshing don't fucking kick people don't punch people I'm talking to you right there all right I've told you and you you want to fucking do that shit get the fuck up on the football field all right to me those stage-diving can be a little personally I don't believe that just because you've gone to a show you have agreed to be jumped on and nobody is being a pussy by not wanting to be killed or maimed at a concert for me a lot of the time stage-diving is just a little too self-serving it's only fun for the person who's jumping and there's a little too much risk involved however for me personally that means I would not participate in it and I think if there are other bands out there who continue to have no problems with moshing or stage-diving that's not necessarily a bad thing either I think a lot of it is based on personal point of view personal preference and if you happen to be one of these artists who wants to take a strong stance against moshing and stage-diving at your performances just know that you're going to be in the minority on that and you've got to pick your battles for example if you're headlining sure it's your show tell people to stop moshing tell them to stop stage-diving however if you're the opener or you're like the second band on in a bill of like 8 or 7 groups the larger crowds get and the more unfamiliar with you they may get the larger risk you run like if you're a band playing at a festival I'm not saying you can't protest smashing in these situations but just understand it's going to be harder to get compliance at the end of the day no musician wants to feel like their art or their set was responsible for somebody's temporary or sometimes permanent injury and those are my thoughts transition what do you think of moshing stage-diving should bands tell crowds to stop doing it if they don't believe in it is anyone being a pussy by not enjoying moshing or stage-diving or being against moshing or stage-diving should bands stop playing if these things persist which they do not like very much let me know Anthony fan Tarot moshing stage-diving forever 
FUvNMHqhBC4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Nets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new bus driver record perfect hair hair hair hair this is the latest full-length LP of long time abstract art rapper bus driver as you might know he is a member of the recently formed Hellfire Club collective all of whom have been making an incredible amount of noise this year with a gauntlet of solo projects people like no-can-do open my Eagle Milo has a new album out as well but bus driver he just came out with his for as long as I have known about bus drivers music I have admired his incredibly unorthodox approach however I have not always enjoyed it for example with his last full-length LP bows dollar sign arrows a project that is seriously difficult to put into words however I was very very turned off by the kind of wacky off-the-wall instrumentals and and bus drivers singing especially I was just hoping on this new project of his he would go back to the idiosyncratic rapping rapid-fire rapping that I enjoyed so much on his earlier projects and he does do that on perfect hair he finds balance between his fast tonally schizophrenic nasally flows and his singing now on this record bus driver is writing some of the weirdest instrumentals i've ever heard him on before among the producers on this album are bus driver himself he actually does quite a bit of the production on this record also riley lake you might remember him he's worked with milo mono/poly of brain feeder records also jeremiah jay kenny siegel great dane and mike GAO and the instrumentals are incredibly appropriate for bus driver 4 for these songs as well they're modern they're envelope-pushing they're glitchy they're subtle at times they are quite beautiful and ethereal - some instrumentals have some pretty sweet melodies weaved into them others like the track open mike eagle lands on have the rattling trap influenced high hats that turn up in so many instrumentals today but they are turned up in the most insane on this album here and we've also got tracks that have quite a bit of jazz influence in them it should be no surprise given bus drivers lyrical track record and instrumental track record that this album is the most unorthodox thing that has been Hellfire Club affiliated thus far the absurdism in the lyrics on this record the satire bus driver lyrically and song structurally purposefully avoiding coherence it's like this record is hip hop's long the weighted answer to Captain Beefheart it's only appropriate that on the song Bliss point bus drivers Flo's are met with some really wild angular sax riffing because the way bus drivers flows punctuate beats it is very horn like the pace at which he blurts out words over instrumentals is a lot like that of a solo from a trumpet or a saxophone player playing a piece of hard bop each word is delivered with this incredibly loud and forceful spasmodic brightness but even though drivers rapping may be fast and it may be loud and it may be eccentric and and some of these beats may hit hard I would not say this record is very visceral it's more cerebral than anything it may be kind of catchy and maybe you can Bob your head to it to a degree but it's just so dizzying and confusing and confounding and difficult right from the intro track on this LP we're getting this lumbering groove and instead of getting a catchy chorus to complement these verses instead we're getting these vocal breaks or bus drivers just throwing out these random ridiculous figures as to how much various things on this album cost the studio costs this the backup singers cost that and all of these figures are astronomical after all this the instrumental suddenly goes ethereal completely just melting away the momentum of the song the mood changes instantaneously there's a fantastic finish with just this throbbing pulsating synthesizer sequence and a lot of the lyrics on this track deal in hip hop music the music business relevancy dopest growing older being 30 and having clothes that are still dirty and kind of questioning whether or not you're you're really in the right place in life bus driver reflecting on his continued participation in this music thing it's not a very concise message it's not like it just comes out and says it but for whatever reason at least to me it kind of just feels like it's ringing very loud and very clear and even though I do really love this track I love this start of the record I do kind of end up with some mixed feelings on this song and for the entirety of this album I find these songs to be awe-inspiringly unique I think they're fun and funny I think they're clever I think they're witty but there are times when I think what bus driver is doing lyrically and sometimes instrumentally or with his flow is so difficult it can be a little I don't know unrewarding but with bus drivers really unapologetic sense of humor it's not hard to warm up to what's happening here especially on a track like Bliss point that I mentioned earlier instrumentally but lyrically bus drivers just railing on hip hop as if it were a person giving it these human qualities saying who is hip-hop dating what does hip hop check in the gender box I don't think hip hop has the body to pull off that outfit I think I'm becoming better acclimated to what bus driver wants to do sonically and vocally in this era of his career but I also think he's finding ways to make music that is challenging but not unlistenable case in point the song egodeath the first song I think really hit me hard when I first listened to this record and hit me as being catchy and one of the more easy to listen to on this record not only because of the two great features from Aesop Rock and Danny Brown but the instrumental two is fantastic the ominous heavy bass the distortion on this track the beat on this thing too reminds me a lot of something LP would have pulled off on his last full-length there's a killer hook on here too and lyrically and flowise bus driver Royce this track his lyrics and just how he's spitting on this song is just so dizzying it makes Aesop's verse right after like a walk in the park and I am catching some themes of egoism or even anti egoism especially coming out of Aesop's verse where he's mentioning a bunch of really embarrassing or like humbling things I mean crashing your car Mario pajama bottoms and this is not the only track in this track listing that I think kind of feels catchy there is when the tooth line horizon blinks with open mike eagle and the song features this hook that has the strange 3/4 flow over a 4/4 beat those rattling high hats I mentioned earlier are insane I'm loving the warped synthesizer chords on this thing too and things actually get a little more easy going from here with tracks like motion lines which is maybe one of the most serene and beautiful tracks on this entire record there are some beautiful background vocals on this track and even though bus driver comes through with that really just firing machine gun flow he's all over the place on this B there are a lot of a lot of sad moments in his lyrics specifically having to do with love there's even a moment where he compares his love to a cervix tear ow so there are some love loss themes coming through on some of the tracks here like on King cookie faced as well where it seems like bus drivers may be coming to terms with being a crappy person in a relationship or maybe the relationship sort of broke apart and then afterwards realizing you might have been the cause of that or you were a huge contributor of that and you're sort of seeing all of your shortcomings for what they are and then there is the song with verbs the track can't you tell I'm a sociopath it's one of the moments on this LP where bus driver strikes that balance between being challenging yet instantly gratifying something he doesn't always accomplish fully especially on a song like upsweep where to me his singing and his incredibly nasal flow really hits like a breaking point of Tolerance but sometimes bus drivers excessive anus has an undeniable appeal and beauty to it like on the closer here colonize the moon the song that lyrically is really self-aware and hilarious and instrumentally I think it's a pretty beautiful sonically I think between all the reverb and the very strange harmonized singing vocals it really captures a sensation of the coldness of space and with the mention of street fashion and money and other pieces of pop culture in this song there's even a line here where bus driver says it's important that his life reflects pipsy fan fiction it's almost like he's just taking everything he observes around him and just taking it in and just shoveling it in his mouth and just chewing it and chewing it and chewing it and then just blah and then he takes everything he has just spat out and rearranges it to reflect something he feels and and usually the raw emotion of what he is pontificating or reacting to comes through but yet the way the words are arranged and the way the lines are arranged it becomes kind of difficult to get the total 100% picture however I don't really think it takes away too much from the emotional impact of these songs and I find the the the difficult jumble of a lot of the things he's expressing to be kind of invigorating and exciting and kind of fun and and very playful too um I'm loving this record I am it's a creative it's a unique it's an interesting record not just for bus driver not just for Hellfire Club but for hip hop in general if you're looking for something that's just out there and it's riding the fringes it's got a load of different musical influences and lots of lyrical tongue twisters frenzied flows then I would say give this album a listen you will not be disappointed if you love your music - puzzle you then I most definitely invite you to a listen of this record I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing try and if you've given this bus driver wrecker to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana bus driver perfect hair forever 
r7-5Ct4eQho,could have so many people pissed off at you if you don't give this like the best review the most positive review don't mess it up don't mess it up hi everyone Anthony ant tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new FX twin album Cyro FX twin is one of many but the most popular of musical aliases spearheaded by uk-based electronic music producer Richard E James he is a pioneer in ambient techno Drum & Bass acid techno IBM his styles and his ideas had been copied the world over his influence on electronic music is immeasurable a lot of the sounds and techniques employed on albums such as ambient works have been done to death mostly by other artists to the point where what goes on on these very influential records seem so commonplace and kind of dated now plus it doesn't help that the technology available for making electronic music drum machines sequencers synthesizers digital audio workstations all of that stuff has increased tenfold in terms of capability ease of use availability now even though I think mr. James earlier works do sound a little dated today I don't think that is the case for his entire discography I think the Richard D James album still holds up incredibly well and I actually think the record he left things off with in 2001 is one of my favorites in his discography drugs it may be kind of long-winded and it definitely does drift away from the electronics that many people came to expect from Richard there's a lot of organic impressionist compositions on this record but this is not where Richard is starting his adventures once again on cyro instead he's kind of moving backwards toward an almost completely synthetic sound producing a series of tracks that sound almost retro in tone from the drum patterns to the drum Tambor's to the way the synthesizers sound Cyro calls back to the world of cold calculated cerebral and relaxed IDM I wouldn't say these tracks are as ambient as some of the songs from aphex twin first two full-length records but these songs definitely do explore Richards softer more introspective side so it kind of begs the question do we need Richard to come back to give us another installment of his early years here and how you answer that question depends on how big of a fan you are I guess I mean I just reviewed an effects twin release earlier this year under the name caustic window as music from Richards past sort of resurfaced under this other moniker however that caustic window record didn't make nearly as big a splash as this new effects twin record is and that's for good reason the aphex twin name has quite a cultural pull to it but not really the same kind of pull it used to have when Richard was at his highest peak of relevancy in electronic music when he was still very much active today the underground in the mainstream of electronic music couldn't be more fragmented Cyro most likely isn't landing on the radars of many Zed or Skrillex fans even though the latter of those two is a big fan of Aphex twins music but even though there's a new young market of electronic music fans that Richard's music might not necessarily be touching much of his early discography has recently gained this classic untouchable status combine this with the fact that it's been 13 years since the last effects twin album and you've got kind of a perfect storm for this album it's bound to be a fan pleaser his fans are looking for him to do anything at this point personally I have found this record to be a pretty enjoyable listen despite the slightly stale aesthetic Richard does approach this kind of vintage style of electronic music vintage at this point with a modern clarity and vibrance and a very nice a level of detail some of these songs are packed with subtleties progressions so slight they need to be observed under a microscope but a lot of the very easygoing grooves and light drum Tambor's and very gentle scents on these songs make it kind of easy to listen to these tracks in the background - and for sure I could dive into every one of these tracks and eat up every single musical detail but sometimes there's not really anything about these productions that that invites me in to do that that draws me in to do that because there are tracks on this record that I do think could use some grandeur changes in their progressions otherwise they're just kind of dabbling in mundane minutia there are only a handful of tracks on this LP that I found to be super rewarding when diving into them listening to them more actively namely the song xmas eve t10 which is this groovy 10-minute monster second track on the LP I love the wintery icy chimes synthesizers on this track the bass line which is really funky really nocturnal and I love the bit of percussion that the song ends off with the track is constantly switching out drum patterns and there's some beautiful Lala's at the very end of the song - it's such a journey of a track and then you have circle on six a very aggressive track farty bass lines and these bass lines are riding an increasingly glitchy beat very epic chord progression some really sporadic bleeps some wailing synthesizer leads and I love the mock guitar lead toward the end of the track - and I love the other circle on track coming right after is this a sister song a father song a mother song a cousin a grandfather song I don't know it does share some similar synthesizer tones and drum Tambor's but this track is noticeably darker earier I love the strange vocals that are worked into this track I think this song is also one of the most unpredictable on the entire LP - it definitely has some much bolder changes when compared to any other song especially this really nimble angular bassline that just Ops itself into the song out of nowhere there are some funny doubled high hats rattling away in the song - it's an intricately placed together track and this intricacy was something that also impressed me on the song mini pops but when I first listened to that track I thought it was good but in the context of this album it seems almost dwarfed in detail and attitude by songs like this and then you've got the the lighter and I guess the breezier and the less impressive tracks in this track listening kind of like the song product which is kind of like an exercise in futuristic elevator music the following track underwhelmed me a little bit too then there's the song 180 DB which is my least favorite on the entire record one of the louder and more aggressive tracks but incredibly thin on ideas when it comes to detail really recycling the same obnoxious synth phrase again and again and again why the same intricacies that are on the title track here don't show up there I don't know but I love this song it is a very peppy upbeat fun piece of digital funk reminds me a little bit of a square pusher was doing on his hello everything record but much more cold stiff calculated in pure aphex twin fashion now the final moments of this record are kind of anticlimactic for me here FX twin delves a little bit into drum and bass and and this is where air air air you really doesn't live up to the mastery of past successes on these two tracks the tremolo keyboards may be really cute but they do not reach up to the level of excitement of like come to Daddy it's like listening to drum and bass without all the gratifying punch and viscera and then the closing track which is kind of a very lone solemn piano piece it's very pretty it's very beautiful but again it just kind of adds up to the fact that the finish of this record is kind of anticlimactic and there we have the new effects twin record you can kind of just throw it onto the pile of many other records that we have heard thus far and we'll continue to hear into the future that are coming out from our musical heroes from the 90s sometimes the results are going to be great sometimes are gonna be not so great I think this result personally was a little so so I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana effects twin sorrow forever 
ynbx6v23iyQ,the truth is at the end of the day you're the mean you're doing all that the meme stuff all the jokes stuff you don't take none of these reviews seriously and you're just a big joke Minh you just full of jokes hi everyone vegan theny diet tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new banks record goddess this is the debut full-length LP of california-based singer-songwriter banks which her label built up to the release of not so subtly with almost an albums worth of singles nearly every track on goddess has been previously released leaving very little to the imagination when going into this record which just makes it feel like a random assembly of tracks that just happened to be on the same CD but that was their call it's like the PR strategy behind this record was to throw every song against the wall until some of them stuck and a good handful of these tracks did and rightly so tracks like waiting game and alibi and brain banks collaborates with a series of co songwriters across these songs producers - which include people like Shlomo sone totally enormous extinct dinosaurs and Jamie Woon given those names you can probably safely assume going into this record you are going to hear some alternative R&B some modern electronically tinged soul and that is exactly what we get even though there are many cooks surrounding the pot here we get a pretty sonically and stylistically focused album which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that this record drags on for nearly one-dimensional 60 minutes I don't think this record is interesting from beginning to end but banks does deliver some good songs and she does have a style and this style is quite similar to that of Jamie Woon or James Blake essentially at the core of these songs we have a singer-songwriter but the singer-songwriter is just surrounded enveloped in all of these electronics like on the song waiting game which has this very slow plotting beat this heavy heavy bass and just this and some of the synthesizers get thicker and thicker and thicker as the song progresses in that it's not too unlike songs such as Wilhelm scream and then there's tracks on this LP like the title track which are far more minimal and sparse banks singing really is spotlighted in this beat but even as things get toned down a little sonically maybe banks is going in more of a a downtempo direction she never loses track of her verses and choruses nearly every track here is is very song driven very structured in sort of that aibee aibee style most of the tracks on this record actually land somewhere around the four-minute mark it's almost as if every single one of them is following a pretty clear and concise formula structurally and sonically the only time that breaks is when we have a bit of an acoustic ballad or something like that where the singing actually ends up being pretty great but the instrumentals on this record that are more synthetic they're built out of some of the blandest electronics i've heard this year songs like alibi and goddess and stick I feel like I'm listening to an utterly plain take on the sounds of like the self-titled fever ray record in the current alternative R&B world where you have people like fka twigs making noise there's no excuse to have instrumentals that sound this plain it's typically the songs that are really what end up shining on this record I do like the song that is at the core of the song alibi that kicks this record off it has a stunning pre-chorus banks really reaches up into her upper register at this moment in the song creating just this really strong sense of emotional intensity it's gorgeous I love the song waiting game the gentle pianos on that track contrasts nicely with the electronics I'm loving the pre-chorus there as well because it isn't the same really weak moment in the song really frail really tender and the song someone new to which is very pretty ballad about I guess returning to someone in a romantic sense so there are some good songs on this record but another thing that's kind of hit or miss about this the cell P is banks vocals her mid-range at times is kind of anonymous inconspicuous I couldn't really easily pick her out of a lineup if I just had to merely rely on midrange especially when she's singing very quietly in a very subdued manner it just really breezes by me and doesn't grip me in any significant way but when she reaches up into that upper register of hers these songs can get quite powerful however her lower register really just loses me especially on tracks like brain where her singing in such a deep way sounds quite goofy sometimes she really delivers a captivating performance sometimes she's really selling these songs and sometimes she's not some of the more subdued tracks in the tracklist here like this is what it feels like are just dreadfully boring or fuck'em homey we knew which sounds like a synth pop nap and as far as the the tone I guess the brightness of Banks voice and the sense and the sound of the percussion this track is very just a little muddy kind of like demo quality contrasts these tracks with you should know where I'm coming from and banks is singing on the song is so much more emotionally gripping it's commanding overall I'm very on the fence with this record there are things that I like about this record their songs that kind of give me hope for the future for banks however she does not deliver 60 minutes of great tunes on this thing yet the record is 60 minutes long I think this album is just like a touch of over exposure there some songs that clearly pale in comparison to others yet they made the cut onto this disc anyway a more concise album of the best of the best banks has to offer so far would have been much more appropriate and sometimes the best of banks best isn't even that fantastic even favorites of mine like waiting game at the very end of this song I was kind of hoping for a slightly bigger vocal climax instead of rising up with the electronic instrumentation banks vocally kind of tends to keep it down here in the yellow but if you're digging this record I completely understand why it does have its moments and again I don't really see any reason to lose faith in banks as an artist as of right now I'm feeling a strong five to light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana banks goddess forever

eEceQPaQz9U,
gGD7OIA4duw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I love you I hope you're having a nice day where I talk about a little music here in this new episode of the wino review right talk about a bunch of stuff that I didn't formally review in a full-length video kind of all by itself but now my paper fell on the floor and I'm going to talk about a bunch of Records just in a gauntlet that I didn't get a chance to review in that full length style I'm going to talk about them in brief here just very brief straightforward opinions if any of my descriptions grab your attention check these records out I'm going to bend down pick up this pizza paper but I'm going to cut it right now so you don't see me doing that the new say or album this is the second full-length LP from this black metal project named say or if you're into that new panopticon's record which brought together bluegrass folk music and black metal I think you should check out this record as well although what I've been hearing here folk music wise seems much more informed by Celtic music which is totally cool totally fine it's an interesting blend although I think some of the mixing especially with that flute like on the first song over here is a little off which I kind of felt was an issue on the previous panel to con record if these mixing problems kind of end up getting smoothed out in future releases I can see myself digging this project more I guess I wasn't digging the chugging guitar tone the heavy Chirk Chirk Chirk of the guitars on this record either really I was I was much more attracted to the sort of thin and brittle and very melodic guitars on the panopticon's record not saying you have to like one project more than the other you can't like both projects just comparing it to something I have reviewed before on the channel in case you have seen that review and you dig that record then you might dig on this as well the new yob record of doom metal psychedelic rock it's kind of like another several years another new yada album you know while I do like the fact that this band is heavy to me their recordings including this one are typically just a little too muddy and a little loaf I to eat up the subtleties of the playing that this trio does together not that there are that many subtleties because it's not like there's like any sort of a melodic layering or anything like that as just sludgy long-winded repetitive heaviness for the most part I'm not the heaviest thing I've ever heard not the grooviest thing I've ever heard they have had bigger records in the past though not immensely larger records in terms of popularity these guys are just like a solid doom metal band and this record to me doesn't sound all that much different from their previous efforts in terms of composition and style so you know never really been a giant yob fan and there's not really anything on this new LP either that's a making me make that transition either the new bones mixtape prolific southern rapper bones I reviewed his last mixtape and this new one um I like it but all the things that held me back from loving his last mixtape are also holding you back a little bit here a lot of the same issues the brevity as well as you know just some of the songs not being that well structured but there are some good standout tracks on here it's just kind of a case of feeling roughly the same as I did on the last project which isn't that surprising considering that bones last mixtape didn't come out that long ago so it's not like he's had that much time to experiment evolve progress his sound into something completely different and it seems that his fans really loved his sound as is so it's not like there's that much incentive for him to change but I guess at the end of the day just again feeling roughly the same as they did on his last project but it's still a decent mixtape look it up if you're looking for some dark Southern hip hop with sort of a three 6 mafia twist with some various vocal deliveries and a bit of singing just very dark moody mixtape here the new King 810 record not sure why a lot of people were begging me to review this these guys are Flint Michigan band they're metal group they have a thumbprint that kind of reads like a slipknot cover band their sound just kind of sounds like quintessential 2000s new metal and everything in their sound reads that from the chugging the guitars to the really melodramatic and sometimes violent lyrics the only thing that seems to make this band kind of buzz worthy is the fact that some people are just freaking out over how violent and freakish some of their live shows are they're like images I've seen of like dudes holding a Ches like on stage with them as they're performing I mean I guess it's a bit of a tough image thing and I do realize and understand these guys come from a pretty nasty background and that's totally cool totally fine if you're looking for some new metal with a really aggressive twist look into this record I guess the new cymbals eat guitars record um this is kind of like indie rock reruns here you know I've heard pavement I've heard built the Spill if you've heard those two bands you've heard this record there's nothing that significantly new or interesting about this band in terms of their style or their sound are their songs and it's not like the performances are completely mind-blowing either it's just kind of a another day another average indie rock record still at the end of the day these guys do the genre justice it's not like these are crappy indie rock songs they're completely fine they pass the bar I would say just check this thing out if you really love the genre and just kind of can't get enough the new dilated peoples record famed underground hip-hop outfit DJ baboo evidence Rocca and this latest record there's been a while since their last full-length album which was not anywhere near one of their best but now they're back and they're coming out with a record that's just kind of okay there's some good features on here the production sounds a little dated like a lot of it came from 2003 and it's not like raka and evidence are the most enthusiastic MCS in the world and the underground is much more vibrant and aggressive and out there than it used to be back when dilated peoples were a much more significant group so it's not like this is the most eye widening album you're going to hear in hip-hop unfortunately this this year but still if you're looking for some chill laid-back mean-mugging rap music then I say check this record out the new J Mascis record this is the new solo album of dinosaur jr. frontman J Mascis I would say this album has really no more of a showstopper than his last full-length solo LP I don't really see it carrying too far outside of the dinosaur jr. camp which is kind of unfortunate because it is a sweet little singer-songwriter record it's very relaxing it's very organic it's a very intimate record I love Jays incredibly weary voice from what I can gather there isn't too much structurally vocally melodically separating this record from a dinosaur jr. record but this help he is still very nice for a lazy day you're just chilling enjoying yourself and you want to put on something really Pleasant in the background the new ariana grande record whoo quite a few people asked me to review this ariana grande I really have an issue with her I don't think she's terrible I don't think she's incredibly exciting either there are some singles from this LP that I liked such as problem I think it's really great single I think it's put together really well I look I love this sax riff on this song plus anybody who puts ASAP ferg on their record definitely gets some positive attention from me even though the Big Sean appearance on this LP kind of cancels that out but I digress there's some trendy crap on here but there are some very good and fun tunes on here too and I have to celebrate every time a pop singer who can actually sing breaks the mainstream - in my opinion there's nothing really wrong about liking and caring about ariana grande but I'm not going to come on here in this video and pretend I do the new White Fence record produced by ty Segall if you are into garage rock 60 psychedelic pop then I would check this record out but a lot like that cymbals the guitars record there's nothing too much separating this album from much of the music that came out in that era there are so many groups now so many artists that are so good at nostalgia they're just kind of recapturing the sound of the artists that inspire them and not doing that much more in terms of just honing their own sound or just petting some good tunes it really is kind of a bland listen though I do think this is the most coherent and best recorded record I've heard White Fence on so far typically the music of White Fence especially on studio album has been very disjointed and out there and kind of oddball it's what I think brought an incredible amount of flavor to the full length collaboration tie and White Fence did before the release of this record so I was pretty excited to hear what they would do together on this album right here and I'm just uh turley surprised that the final result here is just kind of humdrum and finally the new Kimber record this is the latest full-length album from New Zealand singer/songwriter and pop singer Kimbra and I was looking forward to it after I heard her record vows there were quite a few songs on that record that I thought were great she was most definitely unquestionably a pop singer but she had some idiosyncratic qualities about her voice she was kind of eccentric she was a little out there she had personality and there is some strangeness and there is some personality on this latest record of hers too but I don't think her pop sensibility comes out as strong some of the songs on this LP are just really cluttered and kind of incoherent messy and just not that pleasurable to listen to like one of the first songs that came out from this record 90s music I hated this song and it first came out and though I do appreciate its oddity a little bit more in the context of this record I feel like I'm listening to a trap remix of a battles Icona pop mashup the Frankenstein chorus on the song here is absolutely horrific as well there are some nice tracks on here here and there the song miracle has a bit of a soul and disco vibe to it the track goldmine has a bit of a downtempo flavor this album as a whole like many of the songs here with the incredibly flamboyant multi-tracked vocals is just very all over the place and not in like a really fun amazing off-the-wall wien kind of way it's just like I'm listening to pop music that that has no attention span and that is this month's why you know what review mm-hmm-hmm transition if you've given any of these records listen what did you think of them did you love them did you hate them why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana bye you know review forever 
YXwUeKjG9gI,Oh finally poor little baby how do you live oh how are you alive oh hi everyone lumphini cloud shadow here the internet's busiest music nerd doing an actual review of the new yung lean album unknown memory yung lean is the alias of cloud rapper Jonathan lean doer fasted he came to the attention of much of the internet last year after the drop of his unknown death 2002 mixtape along with a few music videos and singles he dropped to back up the release of that tape like ginseng strip 2002 as well as the song hurt and my first reaction to these videos to these songs was that yung lean had a much stronger image and aesthetic than he did a sound which for the most part consisted of a pretty unenthusiastic voice kind of sloppy flow the vocals were also buried in the midst of these very atmospheric beats with rattling high hats and very heavy sub bass however the flipside of the sound is yung leans image which is absolutely incredible the outfits the bucket hats the whole sadboys thing the amazingly shot and edited video for Kyoto which sadly is not on this record the really ridiculous and nonsensical and kind of immature lyrics the constant references to stoner and pop culture the whole thing felt like a big fat forced meme so in my review for unknown death I met a meme with a meme and this pissed a lot of young lean fans off yung lean wasn't that happy either and I guess without knowing it I broke a cardinal rule of the internet you cannot not take the meme seriously which is kind of a funny thing when I see memes matriculating into music traditionally an art form that people take very very seriously and I see nothing wrong with making silly music music music music that's kind of absurd or has an absurd image to it but it's almost as if to admit that you are admitting that your music has some kind of inherent weakness to it it just appeals to a different emotional Sensibility there's nothing inherently wrong with it I love comedy music I love artists that have a serious sense of wit to them I love people like riff raff though I did not love his new album I think he as a figure is hilarious and really entertaining memes and the people who create memes that successfully catch on have quite a bit of cultural value and weight in today's Internet age music that has a very strong meme component to it can have just as much cultural significance and impact as more serious or meme devoid music however in the case of yung lean as far as my first introduction to his music went I kind of felt like I was already listening to someone I was very familiar with little B except without the awe-inspiring absurdity the cultural impact the occasionally very sharp and self-aware social critique in the case of young leans earlier work here I think his music suffers at the hand of the memes and it seemed that as we built closer to young leans first commercial release here there was more and more hype building up for him and the sadboys more and more people were sipping on the Arizona iced tea and now we come to the climax of unknown memory will it be a positive or negative climax I don't know but here is my personal opinion aesthetically and substance wise we are getting pretty much the same release that we got with unknown death 2002 maybe it sounds a little more well recorded a little more well-put-together maybe the budget on this project was a little bit bigger but at the end of the day we are getting another serving of fashionable meme flavored slop starting with the song blinded which instrumentally isn't that bad of a track here we've got a pretty decent ethereal trap style instrumental matched with some very shimmering and glistening synthesizer leads this is essentially the formula of many instrumental on this record from angel to yoshi city to sunrise and the song don't go as well many of the instrumentals on this record are fairly simple and straightforward but they have this incredible sensation of bliss to them I'm not saying the instrumentals are gold on this record but they definitely steal the show because they're good but also because yung lean doesn't do anything over them or within them that is that attention-grabbing the instrumentals here really bring the tone and the musical vibe and the relaxed vibe that this project has and young lean pretty much brings the image some of the catchy hooks he's kind of crushed onto these beats the relationship that young lean has with instrumentals is similar to that of Chief Keef and young chop he's the persona he's the poster boy and not much else as evidenced by his kind of uninspiring versus his unenthusiastic flow his horrific auto-tune moaning on numerous tracks here much of young leans lyrics and his rapping on this project range from bad to pretty much ignoring there isn't that much musical or lyrical variation among the tracks on this record and it pretty much brings me to my overall feeling of this project and that is yung lean right now epitomizes a paradigm shift in hip-hop music currently hip hop is being appreciated much more than it used to be for its sound rather than its lyrics and that's totally fine every decade I think it's entirely necessary for artists who work within a genre to kind of question the traditions of that genre and figure out which of them are still valuable to them and whichever ones aren't try to advance past those and create something new and some of my new favorite artists albums and musical trends have come out of this new evolution in artistic expression in hip-hop music and audience taste but in this shift of artists who are outright rejecting the old-school ways of hip-hop music in order to explore what makes for compelling rap there have been some MCS that have outright underwhelmed me yung lean is very conscious of the fact that the necessities and hip-hop music are not what they used to be ten years ago you don't need incredibly deep or substantive lyrics your lyrics don't even need to be audible or coherent or reflect upon the themes of struggle that a lot of older hip-hop was born out of your delivery doesn't need to be enthusiastic or novel or captivating your flow isn't required to be on tempo all the time and with the rise of auto-tune which is a pretty ear grabbing effect you don't even need to bring on a guest singer in order to have a melodic or a pop appeal yung lean blatantly opt-out of all of these original and traditional requirements but not out of the desire to do something altogether new and break the rules but just to do the bare minimum do as little as possible as evidenced in his mediocre flows his incredibly sluggish and listless versus his complete lack of breath control on lean world and his barely structured songs as well like on ice cold smoke or void which is kind of like a tiny verse in the midst of a really long instrumental or Yoshi city which is just like a fat verse in the middle of an instrumental so no I'm not really into this project I'm not really into young lean I think he makes incredibly weak rap music and I think he makes incredibly weak cloud rap music that doesn't even contribute that significantly to the genre young lean is more interesting as an internet phenomenon than he is a musician I'm not saying the music on this project is garbage it is certainly pleasant on the ears but the appeal of yung lean certainly does not rest in his music alone it doesn't even rest in his music mostly feel free to put this album on while doing something else or lying completely still in a near comatose state I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition if you give an unknown memory you listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana young lean a known memory forever 
dEUm_mqWVnI,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a voile update I'm going to talk about a bunch of records that have recently landed into this record collection back here there's also going to be a link down there in the description where you can see a full playlist of all my vinyl videos and see every record that is in this collection basically get some recommendations on some albums and just kind of see the stuff that I like to listen to in my personal time yeah so on and so forth alright this vinyl update is going to start off with a few records that have been passed along to me and I'm showing them to you because I generally think they're cool records and I was happy to have them passed to me and I'm happy to show them to you now that they are in my possession this first one is a soundtrack not something I usually review not something I usually have in here but this was a soundtrack of a movie that I actually saw pretty recently and enjoyed quite a bit I thought this movie had um a nice score to it very heavy very epic the kind of heavy epicness that you would hope for in a movie of this style a comic book movie in action movie and I also thought this this movie had a very interesting use of pop music in its soundtrack really kind of guiding the the flavor and the emotional tone of a lot of very good and funny and emotional scenes in the film we have the guardians of the galaxy double LP soundtrack we have the original score from Tyler Bates that is the second disc and on the first disc we have the awesome mix Volume one I'm sort of wondering if this is going to kind of be like a recurring theme with the film because you know they certainly left the film on on a hang on a cliff hanger and it's not like you know the I think they're going to abandon the series because from what I understand I mean the reviews are really great and I enjoyed it quite a bit myself so you know I'm hoping they do end up coming out with a sequel very soon and you know and when and if they do that they with another awesome mix you know quite a bit of pop music from the 60s and 70s you know we have I'm not in love come and get your love we have Cherry Bomb from The Runaways we have a pina colada song ain't no mountain high enough from you know Marvin Gaye Tammi Terrell it's a very nice mix of pop music from that era and um you know you know soul music bit of vocal pop too and yeah I mean it's not a bad mix of tracks you know I guess a nice opportunity to have some of these songs on vinyl some of which you know are merely just singles or locked into albums that you may not necessarily care for and if you really enjoy this film don't see any reason not to pick it up I was listening to the the original score as well and you know while I can't say that I was totally in love with the original score on the other side you know again it's it's it's a soundtrack thing that really doesn't have much to do with the score itself as much as it does with the you know soundtracks for me just enhance the visuals of a film and to sort of listen to the soundtrack by itself for me sometimes as you're kind of just getting half of the experience but if for whatever the reason the original score really touched you again it is very heavy it is very nicely put together is very instrumentally dense and quite epic so you know not a bad original score or anything like that but me like many of you you'll probably more smitten with many of the pop songs on the first disc of that and the second record something much more classic way more classic passed along to me by LP marketplace I will put a link down there where you can check out their website it's a place where you can essentially buy and trade used vinyl and they pass me a VG a very good copy of creams wheels of fire man Ginger Baker Jack Bruce Eric Clapton one of the best trios in hard rock blues rock and psychedelic rock ever and this is definitely one of their better LPS white room fantastic song spoonful amazing song and if you are looking to hear these tracks whether they be in the studio or live you know do check this double LP out you know we do sort of have a live at the Fillmore version here on the second LP on here but um but yeah you know just a really great record I'm just loving how the very shiny you know sort of foil finish of the record has held up over the years this LP definitely older than me and I'm loving the really colorful psychedelic insides very nice very wonderful thank you to helping marketplace for uh passing this along to me I've been enjoying the hell out of that record alright something I ordered around the time of record store day but I didn't get until after Record Store Day Dead Kennedys original singles collection Dead Kennedys fantastic West Coast hardcore punk band made great music in the late 70s early 80s and before they disbanded they came out with a singles collection they had many non-album singles but before they disbanded they came out with a record called give me convenience or give me death which basically put all these singles together in one spot and you know I I've always enjoyed a lot of those singles some of them have been some of my favorite Dead Kennedys songs and to you know never be able to hear the original analog on analog has kind of been you know sort of disheartening but now you know it's finally here and it's absolutely wonderful the single sound fantastic and there's a little booklet here that comes with the whole thing and it basically gives like a bit of a description of every single single on here and you know not just a I'm not talking about like a lyrical thing I mean you're really kind of giving background of the recording and the context and the story and the theme in the political tone of these singles you know because dead kennedys nothing if not an incredibly political band and you know pretty much all the hits are here holiday in Cambodia amazing song look up some of these songs if you haven't heard them holiday in Cambodia not only should you look into the song but read into what the song is about as well Dead Kennedys police truck amazing song we have California uber alles one of their best and earliest songs man with the dogs and this is this is the single version if you listen to fresh fruit for rotting vegetables this is a different version than that song we have Halloween another fantastic Dead Kennedys track off of my favorite Dead Kennedys album plastic surgery disasters and we also have Saturday night Holocaust b-side off of that we have bleed for me not my favorite as well as life-sentence me this is like my least favorite single of all the bunch but it's still fantastic set we have Nazi Punk's off fantastic song look up this track read the lyrics also Dead Kennedys dead I have the original version of that comes with the Nazi Punk's off armband too drunk to amazing song and the prey on the other side over here and kill the poor another fantastic early single from them and on the other side we have insight and I think that is that is it those are the singles that come in the box set and I give him these things spin and they sound amazing super clean super rich super Basie super punchy no complaints with the sound at all the labeling ISM you know quite nice it's on the manifesto label which is kind of the label where Dead Kennedys work landed after they parted with their longtime frontman Jello Biafra who had the band's work on his label alternative tentacles up until that point in time the sound of these things is great my only real issues with the presentation on at least some of the single art not really sure if you could tell from here maybe if we do a little bit of a close up coming close it's like they photocopy the original artwork and then just paste it onto a white card and you can see where the art stops and the card begins and it happens on numerous singles over here it happens on this one it happens on kill the poor single over here too you know it's like you know it's it's it's just a I don't know it's just a little little lazy to me you know I mean it's these could have been I guess sort of Photoshop so much better just to look nicer or at least look more original you know I mean of course we are buying a reissue here and we know that if we buy into this thing but you know should least try to make the single sleeves look nice or at least you know if you're really going to try to mimic the original artwork do the original artwork justice there are singles collections that don't try to mimic the original artwork and they're completely nice and they're completely fine as long as they as long as they have some kind of nice presentation to them but here we have some original artwork mimicry which is just kind of sloppy you know it's a little half-assed again the sound is great but I just wish the visual presentation was a little nicer but you know if you love these singles if you're living and dying by them and you just really want an analogue copy of them I see no reason not to pick this up I think I paid like 40 50 bucks for it so there you go hardcore fans only another reissue the flen sir you guys know this label experimental music label they just put a have a nice life's latest full-length LP via the unnatural world and they recently reissued death consciousness to death consciousness was recently reissued via have a nice life's original label enemies list records and I don't know how that reissue went down I don't know for the art or the presentation was that fantastic you guys can tell me if you picked up a copy but I am absolutely Smith with what the fun sir did on this reissue over here loving the matte finish on the vinyl over here loving the gatefold and the vinyl itself which i have not listened to yet but I am familiar with this record the vinyl itself is heavy as a bastard so there's a really nice well put together package very dark labeling very minimal not really trying to overdo it in any way at least in terms of the presentation of this we do in fact have this which comes with the record which is a bit of a forward and you know a series of just I don't know a bit of poetry a bit of historical background written by a religious anthropologist who looks like right here he has taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst for almost 10 years now and some of what's here has been put together by him some of what's here are some interesting illustrations some of what's here are lyrics to these songs I have not read too deep into what is going on here but it does seem that a lot of was written here revolves around them this very interesting and obscure religious sect if I have gathered that correctly from what I have read from this thing so far I am looking forward to maybe sort of reading along with this and listening to the record simultaneously and just kind of see what's going on or what Dan sort of believes is inspiring this record or what Dan believes the Dan one of the masterminds that have a nice life what Dan believes to have a an important contextual element to this have a nice life record it excuse me we're doing these wrong we always do them wrong so nothing new here nothing new here at all you know this this is definitely something you might be into if you really loved the book that came along with Dan Barrett's solo project Giles Corey this definitely seems to be much in the the same vein that you know we're getting some really sort of eerie backstory or something that is that is somehow significant to the music on this record and also pass to me by the Flynn sir recently a copy of the new botany record botanist record apologies these guys are an experimental black metal outfit their previous releases have featured hammered dulcimer I believe which has led them to have a very bright tone and timbre to their songs which also rings through on this latest record of theirs though I'm not totally sure if the dulcimer is coming through on this LP - might just be some really bright synthesizers but if you're into that old-school black metal style recording and some of those old-school black metal style compositions but you're looking for something much more shrill much more bright maybe a little sweeter I would definitely look into this record 6 flora the botanist and I'm totally impressed with this Wow wonderful beautiful splatter color matches the shirt really kind of blends in with the yellow there looks wonderful really nicely put together I spun the first side vinyl sounded fantastic I can't say stylistically it's anything all together that new for the botanist but I will be giving this thing another try just see if it kind of grows on me but you know if they are new to you and you are quite a fan of black metal I do influence I do influence you to check it out all right moving along double LP Tim Hecker harmony and ultraviolet coming ever closer to completing my Tim Hecker studio album collection nice nice nice nothing a super you know crazy or incredible about the cover art here but it is a nice gatefold the labeling is pretty minimal on the records themselves black records you know white paper sleeves nothing to you know revolutionary there but a great sounding ambient and drone music record on vinyl nothing else to say other than that you should definitely check out Tim work if you haven't heard already and this is definitely one of his best records unquestionably one of his best records and sort of an initial descent into the darkness that he would dabble in on LPS like rape death which is another recommended record I also loved his his last record virgins was my um album of the year last year if you were not already aware so Tim Hecker major props to him all right also building up the Fleetwood Mac vinyl collection with a copy of their 1979 album tusk Fleetwood Mac this this this record comes straight out of I guess one of their Papias eras in their music rumors and their self-titled LP the two records that preceded this album are two of their most popular and artistically successful commercially successful records to date and sort of following those two records up we have tusks and tusks while still very poppy in tone in terms of just the recording and just how these songs are put together instrumentally is is much more just experimental a little weirder a little more off-kilter I would say so you know if you're looking for a bit of strangeness from Fleetwood Mac's sweeter side I would look this record up my copy just costs five bucks that's fantastic and um yeah some interesting inner sleeve work over here you sort of have a sleeve within a sleeve and then another sleeve within a sleeve and we're just getting like this really surreal imagery and just pictures of the band on a lot of sides of these sleeves and um you know please straightforward record presentation labeling and all that um yeah you know just one nice sleeve after another sleeve and just a good sounding record again Fleetwood Mac if you're in a pop music check out rumors check out their self-titled check out this record and then from there I would say even though they do have some some some nice records that came out in the 80s I would say work backwards to their 60 stuff Oh putting that back alright this next one is a hip-hop record an EP that a favorite collaborative duo of mine from New York recently came out with Armand Hammer bought a copy of this off of mr. Billy woods furtive movements I would say this is more for hardcore fans you know if you really love Billy woods music it loosens music and the music they've made together as Arm & Hammer this is a you know they're quite a few remixes on here a few originals that aren't like their best work but a few originals that are their best work quite a bit of production from lucid a bit of production from blockhead - not a bad collection of tracks and most interestingly of all nice labeling there we do have an orange piece of vinyl wonderful if you're looking for a bit of color there to add to your vinyl collection and you're into the music of Armand Hammer no reason not to pick this up from backwoods studios and finally we have something that is not a record at all I've recently made a trip to Australia where I did some speaking dates three of which were totally sold out it was wonderful great talks I was really happy to meet everybody that came down I did end up getting some presents and CDs handed to me while I was there the CDs of Australian artists that I am planning on checking out but this is maybe the funniest of all the things that was handed to me and it came with a little letter on the back thanks for visiting us in Australia and doing this talk this is a small token of appreciation for the time effort and patience you put into your personal brand a classic prog album on an outdated medium that's practically unusable these days gift wise it's a decent to light for but we are sure you can find the humor in it it should fit nicely in the read shelf behind you Steph still a BA and act guy man Oh Twitter names right there we essentially have Pink Floyd's the wall on laserdisc if any of you are unfamiliar with laserdisc it's pretty much what we had before DVDs and they never really totally caught on but there you go there's the camera right there so yes now I do finally this was just keeping me awake at night not having the wall on laserdisc and now finally I have it so thank you very much for uh for bringing this down to the shell you know it's um it's very nice of you to uh to share such a piece of musical history with wha so there you go those are the recent additions to the vinyl collection back here cool cool I love you we're going to talk real soon reviews coming I hope you're having a nice day transition drink your water eat your fruits and vegetables try a different genre or a different band that you've never heard of before today be a little adventurous with your musical tastes and um be nice to the people around you give someone you love a compliment and give someone you don't even know a compliment to cool cool Anthony Fantana music vinyl forever 
TUPDn9rrY1o,jerath any fist you know the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review of the new earth album primitive and deadly this is the latest full-length album from seattle-based stoner metal and rock outfit earth and over the years the earth has been together they have released and penned some of the heaviest and most influential music in the underground ranging from doom metal to drone metal sludge metal psychedelic rock if this is the first time you're hearing of them try out records like Earth 2 or Pentastar or hex bees made honey in the lion's skull now the band's last few records don't really rank up there as being my favorites of theirs putting these albums out most definitely involved in ambitious risk but I don't think the payout was 100% namely this risk came in the form of incorporating cello into Earth's already very thick and heavy sound and at the end of the day I think it only served to muddy up the aesthetic they've been toying with over their past few records although I have heard them incorporate this cello in the live setting and it sounded great and on this latest record earth is kind of undertaking another risk by incorporating vocals into their music something they've only done on a few other occasions and those few other occasions happened many years ago so they are really dusting off the vocal aspect of this record with three tracks three of five tracks featuring vocals from two different singers Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees actually appears on two songs and then there is rabia oisin Kazi who appears on a single track as well now instrumentally earth doesn't seem to have undergone a whole lot of change they're still building their tracks out of these slow-mo bright shimmering heavy and thick spaghetti western guitar riffs which they honed to perfection on bees made honey in the lion's skull and they play these riffs over and over and over meditatively progressing and embellishing them with each repetition there's a lot of very slow sparse percussion the progressions are very subtle the overall aesthetic is very relaxing it's a very beautiful vivid serene yet ominous sound this is not a record you just want to play on your laptop speakers as you browse social media this album is definitely something that you should try if you find yourself having a spare moment this year and you are a big fan of heavy or psychedelic music and there's not really any need to go too far back into Earth's discography first because the guitars and the drums are executed just as well here as they have been on their past several releases however still because of the sheer amount of similarities between this album and Earth's past several releases I kind of feel urged to suggest maybe a revisitation of the drawing board to maybe think of ways to kind of advance the band's sound forward into the future because in my opinion the cellos and the vocals are not really doing it and I'm in no means suggesting that Dylan Carlsen should undergo the same kind of personal trauma he did in the time when earth was on hiatus in the late 90s and early 2000s to the point where the band actually got back together and started releasing new music again but over these past few records the few new ideas Earth has managed to stir up for me anyway has hardly been justification for an entire album of new material still despite the lack of surprise despite the lack of a feeling that Earth is on the cusp of delivering another entirely new and refreshing sound this is still a pretty decent record the additional guitars brought by Jody Cox and Brett Nelson really thicken some of these mixes up bring a lot of beautiful guitar tones and despite Dylan delivering a few pretty recycled guitar riffs here and there namely on the track from the zodiacal light there are some wonderful guitar riffs and melodies and in mental builds on the five cuts here I love the opening track on here which features a lot of very slow patient heavy guttural chugging I love the hypnotic groove of this track I love the huge rushes of vivid guitar tones the sustain to on these guitars is amazing just how they play and ring out with such clarity and the song even hell has its heroes is one of the better tracks on here too also instrumental and it starts off a little inconspicuous for an earth track but as it builds it gets heavier heavier thicker thicker incorporates some really epic bells and the resulting drone is just really intoxicating it's the tracks with vocals that I actually end up feeling a little disappointed with certainly none of these songs are awful none of the songs are out rightly ruined by any of these vocals and instrumentally these are very coherent and methodically played and performed and very precise tracks for earth again they're beautiful it's the vocal tracks that I feel a little disappointed with at the end of the day and it's because of the vocals now they're not terrible they don't ruin these tracks outright and instrumentally earth is sounding as good as they have on previous songs and I don't even really disagree with their choices of vocalists on these tracks Mark Lanegan considering his musical background and where he comes from geographically it only kind of makes sense that him and earth might share some fans and would probably make for a pretty successful collaboration I don't really think this collaboration failed because of a lack of talent or anything like that but as hard as Mark and Dylan tried I think mark has been kind of given the impossible task of singing over an earth song with the incredibly slow pacing of the track mark kind of feels like he's left out there in the open unprotected unsupported his vocals feel kind of campy and almost as if he's just wandering around this instrumental at his leisure not really sure of what direction to go how long to sustain notes it's almost as if he's singing with the inflection and with the tempo that he normally would over a backing band that we're playing at a normal speed I think it just all has to do with the pacing that earth plays its music with it doesn't really matter how Marx sings it's all really just gonna come out sounding like miscalculated unkempt spoken word and I think this feeling also comes through on the closing track here where mark also sings but maybe not to as strong a degree but the song that rubia is on I actually don't mind her vocals on this track the singing style that she is bringing to the table totally fits the bill for Earth's music she's singing these very long extended notes in this sort of way that makes her sound like a mystical desert siren it totally complements Earth's style even if I'm not totally in love with every moment of her performance and that's pretty much it for this record I mean a relatively short and concise record from Earth on this one just five tracks two instrumentals three vocals all good performances for the most part instrumentally again I like this I'm satisfied with this and I'm gonna look forward to their next project and just kind of cross my fingers hoping for a bit more progression into the future I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition but if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it you have to be Fantan oh Earth forever 
-Ig5-BSXy_8,whoa hi everyone post the new wave tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new airplane death from above 1979 record the physical world these guys are at Toronto rock duo featuring Jesse Keeler and Sebastien Grainger and ten years or so ago they dropped in the EP and a full-length album of originals and then they pretty much like dropped off the face of the planet outside of some live shows and touring and and some not nearly as successful solo and side projects and as the hope that these guys would reunite and come out with new music sort of faded away it seemed like people's interest and appreciation of their only full-length album grew DFA 1979's only full-length album your woman I'm a machine had so much going for it even though instrumental he was pretty strict back mostly just vocals drums and bass guitar with the occasional keyboard making its way in to sweeten a particular song up but oddly enough nothing really felt missing from the Bands formula as far as the drumming was concerned Grainger's performances had a lot of intensity a lot of punk ferocity but he also seemed to have a really deep appreciation for dance music beats and just body moving grooves as well I also really enjoyed his vocal delivery on these tracks he had a good vocal range he sounded impassioned as he was singing he had a lot of swagger and charisma and Keeler's thick distorted bass riffs had both the heaviness and the buzz that any modern rock record should and much of his playing on this album seemed to pull a lot from not only metal music and punk music but funk and dance music - it was great production on this LP there were great performances but in my opinion it's really hooks and songwriting where these guys shined the most because to me tracks like romantic rights and Black History Month and little girl as well as the track going steady are not only great from a performance standpoint but they're really catchy songs - now a few years ago came the announcement that death from above 1979 9 were back effectively they started playing some live shows but it didn't feel real until we got the announcement that new music was going to be coming down the pipe to the first single effectively to come off of this LP and I mean not really the fire starter of a song you hope for to me the track had kind of a mundane start to it didn't really kick things off in an exciting way in the way that I would hope a death from above song would there's kind of a cheap throwaway I roll chorus on the track if it weren't for the piano flourishes on the hook here I would say this song is just pretty run-of-the-mill for DFA but maybe just a little bit more pop appeal and I don't know I couldn't help but pick up maybe just a little bit of self awareness of self critique on the release of this song in the title given that it's titled trainwreck 1979 still though on the whole I don't really think this is a bad comeback album and I felt relatively positive going into it given the last song to come out before the release of this LP government trash was maybe one of the most hard-hitting songs I've ever heard the band released period and even though trainwreck 1979 doesn't really start that excitingly this album itself certainly does with the track cheap talk the bass and the drum groove on this track it is just classic it's classic death from above if you will allow me to use such a word with them those high hats that bass drum and kick pattern just the heaviness of that bass guitar not a bad chorus either the song rules and the this track and really this album altogether it seems like it's mostly focused on just trying to rekindle that same magic that was there 10 years ago when their debut LP came out and it definitely happens for the most part and there are some key standout really enjoyable tracks in the track listing here like crystal ball and right on Frankenstein tracks that feature DFA 1979's trademark slick nicely performed vocals in the rock the dance beats being fused together in the heavy groovin bass riffs however there are some underwhelming cuts in the track listing here as well such as always on which to me would be a pretty inconspicuous track for DFA in 1979 if not for the pretty climactic ending and then there's the song virgins which to me sounds like a kind of pathetic piece of blues rock revivalism a la DFA 1979's usual production and aesthetic it's like this track is for people who think the Black Keys invented blues and then there's the song nothing left which to me marks a clear lack of innovation in that Keeler is almost completely recycling a bass riff that the band used on their previous LP there are a few surprises though in the track listing here there's the song white as red which is the closest DFA 1979 has ever come to a slow jam it's got a load of heartbroken lyrics some young love some abandonment issues here I'm not saying the lyrics or gold or anything but it's certainly a clear storyline applied to a sad sounding song which was kind of a nice change of pace in the track listing here and then there's the physical world the title track which ends this entire LP off and is maybe the most epic song in the entire record Keeler playing a lot of melodies with his bass that are kind of romantic in nature very archaic I think it's a bold finish to the record and definitely leaves a glimmer of hope for future DFA 1979 releases to have maybe a bit more refreshing material a few more surprises within in my opinion this is not a bad record there are some tracks I prefer more than others a track or two that I really don't vibrate at all but many I do enjoy of course to longtime fans this album when you give it a listen it's not going to feel iconic there's no possible way that it could in your mind because the band has such a limited amount of pre-existing material and you've had such a long span of time to listen and ingest that material it would be really difficult to come along and expect this record to knock the old material out of the park especially considering that DFA is making music that is roughly in the same vein as their old stuff now even though I'm not head over heels in love with this record I think it's great that the band has come forward and proven that they can come together with another coherent album do this come back and have it not be a total flop and hopefully on their next release they're able to come out with music that gains hype on the merits of its writing and production and performance versus the hype of the band's return I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that said Anthony Fantana death from above 1979 the physical world forever 
G1XV3yV7jpQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here once again Internet's busiest music nerd here to do a track review or I'm talking about the latest in rock pop electronic hip hop metal music experimental stuff and here we're going to be doing a little talky talk on the new effects twin track single mini pops 67 120 point to source field mix effects to an aka electronic music producer electronic music Titan English electronic music Titan Richard D James he hasn't come out with a full-length record an official full-length record of new material in like 13 years and now all of a sudden he's gonna be dropping a new record on Warp Records it's titled Spyro it's dropping on September 22nd I believe and this is the first real taste the public is getting of this record now if you like ambient techno if you like drill and bass if you like I don't know acid techno definitely check out his earlier stuff specifically his first two records I'm a little more of a fan of the stuff that he did after that but this record this song this new track to me is more in vein with some of that earlier stuff it's very relaxed very cold very calculated it has a kind of scattered set of rhythms very scattered rhythm pattern but the groove of this rhythm pattern is very smooth very easily digestible and across this track Richard does a great job of adding these little variations these flourishes dare I say improvisation zin this rhythm this song is incredibly incredibly detailed he doesn't let one idea or one sound one rhythm pattern go on for too long without throwing something into it you know whether it be just a little groove change here and there or whether it be just some extra drums or pulling some drums out throwing into the drum pattern and he's constantly building the song up and then suddenly stripping it away and then as soon as he creates this vacuum of silence he's throwing some newer sounds into progress the track it's super super super subtle you can jump from one part of the song to another and hear that they have distinctly different things going on but if you just coast through the entire track there's never like that one single moment we're just you know there's like this massive boom and everything changes all of a sudden it's something you've got to eat up and just very very slowly appreciate with repeated listens now the synth work you know the rhythms I talked about the synth work on this track feels like typical effects twin the sense on here are kind of vast they're explorative there's a little reverb on some of them they're very slow-moving they're eerie did I say introspective introspective and they they feature a bunch of different changes across the line of the track too there are some slow moving swell and some stabs that are much more punctuated and these come in a number of different Tambor's and flavors across the length of the track and there are also some vocals on this song too which are also seeming to a change color and change flavor across the track some of them feel like very softly some background vocals too on the first third of the of the song they're like some distorted vocals kind of just you know thrown underneath a lot of the sense and the drums in the last third the vocals come forward and feel just like a little more pronounced a little clearer a little drier in terms of recording it's just like a raw but it feels kind of like melodically out of sync with everything else kind of like it's a little dissonant it's a little weird it's a little sour it adds a little bit of a I guess some subversive freakishness to the instrumentation which I'm up until that point you know sounded very concise and well put together and then also this human voice comes in and kind of you know screws everything up it's interesting that all the electronic elements seem so clean and seems so I guess uh primped and and shiny and new and these vocals come in and they're very inadequate they're very inefficient they're not nearly as concise or clean as any of the electronics or the percussion on the track and and yeah you know just just some observations about how certain sounds are treated in comparison with other sounds or at least how I feel they're being treated or being I guess contextualized um I'm not sure there's really much else I can say about this track sonically stylistically nothing incredibly groundbreaking for Richard on this song but certainly a very good return to the sound that many people have come to love from him many people have come to expect from him and it's certainly a song that I look forward to hearing in the context of many other tracks on this forthcoming album Spiro again it's just a very cold calculated but also smart and intriguing song let me know what you think of it do you love this track do you hate it why what do you think I should review next are you looking forward to this new FX twin album if you are how much on a scale of one to ten let me know let me know Anthony Fantana effects twin mini pops forever 
wANaO05CubY,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new ice age track forever these guys are a Danish rock band they dabble in post-punk noise rock gothic rock I have reviewed their past two LPs love those albums so of course I am looking forward to this new full-length album of theirs that is dropping this October title plowing through a field of love now these guys have dropped a few tracks already from this forthcoming LP and I think it's some of their best material yet prior to this track there was already already reason to be excited because of the song the Lords favorite which took a really surprising turn for Ice Age the band's sound typically just thrashing bash chaos they write some good riffs sometimes they incorporate some good melodies but the performances are so aggressive and yet so sloppy the drums and the bass aren't really totally in sync with one another good the guitars are all over the place the band singer is barely has composure of himself it's kind of like his his singing style in my opinion is kind of like taking a fully automatic assault rifle in your hand and throwing a blindfold on and just spraying in whatever direction trying to hit a target you know not to say that the fact that he's sort of missing the tempo and missing the pocket sometimes makes these songs awful but uh you know it definitely kind of has a feel of emotional distress in just how sloppy his delivery is emotional exhaustion is something that definitely comes through when he's singing and those feelings came through on the Lord's favor too but the feeling or the sound was kind of new for Ice Age is that this tracked the felt greatly influenced by country music from the twang of some of the guitars so the chords the band was picking and the drum beat as well there was definitely a very strong country of influence on this track but the band played like chance and were able to take this musical style and just kind of adhere it and mold it to there typically is very chaotic and sloppy performance chaotic and sloppy sound so now we have the band putting another song out titled forever and this track seems to kind of take on another musical flavor but still stays true to that very noisy and chaotic aesthetic that people expect from them and it doesn't really come out too apparently at first though the band starts off with some very ominous and very clear sort of like guitar chords and III definitely hear the band pulling from Joy Division once again you know III think there's a lot of Ian Curtis and the vocals in ice ages music though I though I don't think they portray a lot of the same emotions but there's also something about the chords about the delivery about the start of this psalm that also reads to me is like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds or something like that but the vocals are nowhere near is just like authoritative and fear-inducing again still we're getting kind of that distress that emotional exhaustion that sense of just not having control over yourself from the vocals and even though the guitars and the drums again are kind of sloppy we're also getting this sense of finesse as we did from the Lord's favor especially toward the end of the track we're very slowly bubbling underneath these noisy guitars and drums were getting strings and for the final climax of the song these horns just busted and build the song up to just a new level of just beauty you know there's that chaos never really left I say just sound but uh there is kind of a refinement to to the instrumentation on this record now I think I think maybe the vocal melody that kind of kicks the track off is a little little throwaway nothing too fantastic about it or if there is something fantastic about it maybe it's just a sloppy delivery of the the band singing that kind of keeps it from truly resonating with me but I did feel it growing on me with repeated listens and I did feel myself enjoying it much more during the second verse of the track than I did the first verse of the track I really enjoy this song I think it's great I think it gives me more reason to look forward to the band's next full-length LP I don't know if you guys are excited by it but I'm just into this track merely based off of the fact that I say just putting out a good song and they're experimenting with you know newer instrumentation newer sounds and that's the direction I was hoping they would go in that's the direction that I'm looking forward to them to go in because one of my favorite songs off their last full-length LP is morals which if many of you remember is the album's like lone ballot and features piano very prominent piano as well throughout much of the track so to kind of hear them going further down that road that I think was one of the highest points on their last record I guess you know is kind of just feeling like getting exactly what I want I guess at the end of the day again what do you think of this track do you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next are you looking forward to this new Ice Age record what do you like about the band's sound what do you like about this song what do you hate about this song I'm curious and I love you alright have a good one Anthony Fantana ice age forever forever 
Kz-87B9GU6o,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Flying Lotus song never catch me featuring Kendrick Lamar yes together on this track there are two musical kings of the west coast right now a king of production Flying Lotus and a king of rapping Kendrick Lamar both of whom have amazing amazing like game-changing albums underneath their belts Kendrick Lamar came through with section 80 came through with good kid maad city people didn't listen to hip-hop the same after that a lot of people didn't whether you liked those albums or not and Flying Lotus as well freaking la freakin cosmic grandma a lot of people did not look at electronic music or hip-hop production the same after those albums and for good reason definitely for good reason so to hear these two I mean envelope pushers on the same track I think means a lot and for Flying Lotus to give Kendrick the endorsement for Kendrick to give Flying Lotus the endorsement is fantastic and so I mean just name wise alone I'm looking forward to hearing this track in this track among others is going to be on flying lotuses forthcoming LP you're dead coming out Warp Records in October there are some other guests on this record as well that are very exciting to me such as Herbie Hancock being a fan of jazz fusion or just you know jazz from the 50s 60s 70s Herbie Hancock is a name you need to know look up a sextant look up headhunters great records Herbie Hancock look him up so anyway going back to Kendrick on this Flying Lotus record again really looking forward to hearing him on this track gave it a listen and was not disappointed at all I think they came together really well and possibly delivered a song I don't know yet because I haven't heard the whole album but delivered a song that really complements the theme or the concept of this album which I can only guess given the title you're dead and Kendrick Lamar comes through to just start with him with that but that this that if you're familiar with his music you know there are points at which he raps with different pitches he raps with different inflections and occasionally he has this inflection he has this pitch where he's kind of riding high in his vocal range and he stays sort of monotone up there and it's really attention-grabbing and he kind of kicks the song off this way with some overdubs with some backing vocals that are maybe a little more intense and I love that as he's rapping he's getting louder he's getting more impassioned he's getting more intense and the delivery is just heating up and up and up and up as the instrumental is heating up as well you know even though Flying Lotus is you know producing he's not a live band it really feels like you're listening to a live band underneath Kendrick Lamar because of how intimate the Kendrick in this instrumental gel together of course I'm sure there are baselines that have been brought to the table by a Thundercat on this track as well which flying loads has worked with him on numerous occasions and they sound great here as they have on previous songs the drum patterns durable to not skip the lyrical aspects Kendrick is talking about life death living after life and it's it's a lot of highfalutin stuff he's really on as highbrow on this track this is not a backseat freestyle or anything like that Kendrick is a versatile dude this is maybe one of his more um poetic and lyrically abstract verses that he's ever written and it does the track well it fits it's it sounds great instrumentally is not where I'm disappointed with this track but maybe not as floored as I was with Kendricks verse and the reason I'm not floored is because I don't really feel like Flying Lotus explores much else on this song other than having a just a traditional-style rapper on his track not to say that Kendrick sounds like everybody else but it's rare that fly Lotus has somebody on his records on his Flying Lotus records you know we know about captain Murphy know he's done production for other people but on his own records just having people spittin that doesn't happen that often you know that's that's not a regular occurrence so for it to happen here is something for him to explore in his music however outside of that this could have been you know just another Flying Lotus beat that we would have thrown into a record like until the quiet comes or patterned grid world the pattern grid world EP if this track had been just instrumental this beat would have fit pretty nicely into one of those two records there are even spots maybe around the 1-minute mark or so where Flying Lotus is doing a little bit of double time with the beat he's throwing those handclaps in there that are just really constant it you know it just sounds like recycled patterns from previous work but still there's some great background vocals on this track the bass lines as usual like I mentioned are great and there's an amazing little chopped-up piano phrase that plays throughout the song too and Flying Lotus smooths this out with some great beats and um there's something else I have to note there's a very nice instrumental interlude on the back end of this track which the song fades into segues into really nicely using um just a little you know sort of bass sample of bass solo of a sample or just Flying Lotus having Thundercat play something but that also sounds eerily alike stuff that has happened on his previous material it is a decent track I will actually say it's it's it's a great track but not necessarily because Flying Lotus has I guess sort of a reinvented himself or anything like that it's it's mostly Kendrick that kind of pulls me into the song and I really like his lyrics even if occasionally in the instrumental he gets a little lost in the chaos but I think to hear these two together again is is really awesome so yeah those are my thoughts on the track where you wowed by it were you underwhelmed by it did it not live up to your expectations I mean to me this song while it didn't blow my mind I see it working very well potentially in a string of other great tracks because to me Flying Lotus has never really been like a singles artist necessarily there are some songs that I think are great by themselves but I've always enjoyed his music more and sort of like an album experience context and if this album does have a really clear concept revolving around themes such as death this track is going to sound great locked into that so again what do you think of this song do you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Flying Lotus Kendrick Lamar forever 
uO9NekVxKxc,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a track review where I talk about the latest of rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion metal and hip hop as well and we're going to be talking in this video really quickly about the new Julian Casablanca and the voids song human sadness Julian Casablanca and from this frontman of The Strokes their last full length album reviewed it I'll throw a link down there in the description box was not that hot on it like the album their comeback album much more and I don't know even though I'm not really looking forward to another album from The Strokes I will however look forward to another Julian Casablanca solo album not that I love the the solo album that he did and not that this album is a solo album because it is him and the voids but still um a side project has to be better at this point than what the strokes are trying to do or might do as a band into the future just sort of wondering whether or not they're going to keep it together let me know in the comments what your opinion on that is but I don't really think they're at an artistic high point right now so my surprise when this song came out this new Julian Casablanca and the void song came out and it already been announced that this album this side project was going to exist and would be coming out soon but I did not foresee what was going to be on this track not only that but I didn't really think the band would be as brazen to drop a song an initial single that is 11 minutes long and sounds the way this song sounds it's not really low five but it has kind of a Lofa aesthetic starts off very vast a lot of treble a lot of layers of fuzzy compress to smash down together guitars lots of vocal I don't want to say improvisation but Julian Casablancas is singing but he seems a little all over the place like he's really exploring this wall of guitar that him and the voids have kind of built themselves and I can't really make out a lot of his lyrics but the vocal performances that I'm hearing sound good they sound expressive they just sound Julian you know it's just Julian as he usually is it doesn't sound like he's doing anything incredibly different which is totally fine with me because I didn't really like a lot of the vocal experimentation he was doing on the last strokes album so vocally this song is pretty straightforward even though he is a little buried underneath these guitars occasionally there are a few hits of really heavy bass drum and basically what the song is doing for a good portion of like the first half the first third is it's really just building up sound building up tension and then once everything kind of dies down and there's the sudden instrumental change in the middle of the track the payoff comes the drums come in there's a load of glitchy synthesizers the guitar melodies get more and thinik and just really sweet and it gets pretty heavy it gets pretty again climactic there is a payoff here at this point in the track and I'll say it again it is worth it if there's if there's a few words other words I could apply to this song it's most definitely detailed it's multifaceted it definitely does a good job of delivering numerous parts it justifies its length effectively and even though it takes a while to kind of get where it needs to go I think the melody is kind of catchy that the song that ends up delving into in the second half or so um the ending is fine as well it's about as good as an 11-minute song could be coming from Julian Casablanca so I would think um I I just have to say I'm really floor I'm floored by how odd this track is yet how sweet it is to I think it has a lot of good things going for it and it most definitely has me looking forward to this new julienne and the voids album more than I was looking forward to the last stroke cell so that already kind of puts this record up there but let me know what you think give a listen to this song give me your opinion if you have heard it let me know what you think already in the comments and yeah that's it cool cool Anthony Fantana Julian Casablancas and the voids even sadness forever 
i6Al4qaREwY,hello my needle drops to thin EPOC tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new bug album angels and devils this is the 4th full-length LP from london-based songwriter and electronic music producer the bug aka Kevin Martin a guy whose musical experience spans decades and ranges from dubstep to grime to UK bass industrial techno experimental hip hop and it doesn't stop there he is collaborated with numerous artists over the years whether that be on full-length projects guys like Justin Broderick of napalm death and yes ooh and he's collaborated with a number of other artists 'as well just on single songs through Google having them come on to his records and under this bug pseudonym which is just one of his many bands or side projects or solo efforts that he's played with over the years he has dished out quite a few sticky singles especially off of his last full length LP which was his most commercially successful to date and I essentially went into this new record of his kind of wondering how he was going to keep that momentum up would he change his sound would he focus more on just putting out more concise singles but I was surprised to hear that this new record of his I think has a little less single power and maybe a little more star power at least for underground music listeners over here in America because among others featured on this LP are Liz Harris aka grouper there's going to Sufi the psychedelic hip-hop mystic and Death Grips which considering Kevin Martin's work in the experimental hip-hop / industrial group ice many years ago is kind of like things come in full circle there are also numerous features of the uk-based rapper Flo Dan who you may remember from a moment or two on the bugs last full-length LP and with these musical guests Kevin indulges in a series of different musical genres ranging from trap to IDM experimental hip-hop and industrial music as well as some experimental dancehall however this albums variety a and is guestlist to me are significantly more impressive than the contents actually delivered unfortunately at least for the first half of this LP Kevin seems to dish out one underwhelming track after another songs that cycle through many of the same parts don't really build that significantly toward the end of the track offer very little in terms of progression a lot of the songs on the first half of this LP feel more like motifs or ideas that could start off or be the first half of more structured more fleshed out more climactic and more well-developed songs with multiple parts the first half of this LP definitely sounds nice it has a nice tone there are a lot of nice textures to it there's a decent vibe going on here but at about two minutes into each of these songs I kind of end up wondering okay where are we going to go next and the answer often is nowhere else there's the song Pandy which is kind of a slow-moving synthesizer interlude several tracks into the album where we didn't really need it the track just builds and builds and builds and builds very slowly and then at the very end it's just we're done the song void featuring Liz Harris is a pretty interesting track as a great vibe I love the heavy enveloping warm resonant bass on this song the ethereal atmospheres which seemed to have been brought by Liz herself some of it coming from her voice some of it coming from like a really weird spare piece of percussion which could be anything from her clapping her hands to smacking a stick on a piece of wood or something the rattling trap style high hats on this track are interesting too it's a very gentle chill instrumental although I do think that Liz's vocals may work so much better in more of an ambient context because they kind of get lost in the haze of this instrumental for the most part it's a beat that to me feel so urban so concrete and yet the whole thing feels like it's underwater and then there's the song save me which might just be the most aimless track on the entire LP and features go into Sufi and it's not really one of his more hard-hitting tracks here it's kind of like having a personal meditation session with going to Sufi where he's kind of moaning and singing very quietly to himself for about five minutes even though it feels like 55 minutes when I'm listening through it I can take or leave many of the tracks on the first half of this LP honestly the only song that I really feel like I have any strong affections for is maybe me lost with misread which takes a very quiet cute and very endearing piece of dancehall music and gives it some very industrial grimy sort of tattered percussion and since it's a song that is as strange as it is smile inducing and then once the second half of this album rolls in it's like a night and day difference we're getting hard-hitting grimy bangers it's like a tale of the two sided album on this record if you get this album on vinyl you're really going to be dealing with two different EPS almost once you flip this thing over there's the song function featuring grime rapper mango which is maybe my favorite track on the entire LP the hi-hats are so loud they're so sharp on this thing the bass kicks are huge his flow his delivery it's just insane high energy if you're a Danny Brown fan definitely check this on out and let's go to the infamous Death Grips song on this record it's a decent track it's like reading another grime flavored instrumental here but MC ride is is over the song doing his usual vocal mayhem thing and this verse for him is is pretty typical but the collaboration still turned out well and it's encouraging to see that this first big collaboration off of an album of Death Grips --is could mean that maybe Zach or ride or flatlander could collaborate with somebody else in the future and make some decent music to the sonic assault continues on tracks like you featuring vocals from warrior queen the instrumental on this track is insane and and so are her vocal contributions to a degree but I do think there are moments where she kind of gets lost in the mayhem of the song however my favorite flowed an vocal contribution comes on the song dirty to me instrumentally this track feels sort of like part two of the song function except Flo Dan is sort of bringing a slightly more conscious and socially aware lyrics in his verses here to tell you the truth even though this side of the album is way more hard-hitting and inherently more engaging than the first half it is a little one-dimensional this is an all-right LP I came out liking it overall but there are some seriously underwhelming tracks in this tracklist not only that but the entire album itself feels a little bit too much like just a random collection of tracks put together with no real attention paid to the flow that they have together outside of putting the quieter tracks the angels on the first half of the record and putting the harder tracks the Devils on the second half of the record I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this LP Tran sweaty if you've given this bug album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh subscribe have a nice day drink your water your fruits and vegetables get a good

W_wb5Tk9fRs,hi my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd lover of all things music except music I don't love and it's time for a review of the new Blonde Redhead album Barragan indie music vets Blonde Redhead they hail from new york they're our musical trio featuring singer and multi-instrumentalist Kazuma Kano one of the most alluring voices in underground music ever and then we have the twins Amadeo and simone pace who handle co songwriting as well as guitars drums singing as well and together these guys have penned some of the most gorgeous sensual dreamy syrupy indie pop and rock as well as noise rock of the 90s and 2000's and some a blonde redheads biggest musical successes aren't that far behind them we have their o for album misery as a butterfly 2007's 23 and their last full-length LP penny sparkle in 2010 while not unanimously decided to be one of their greatest albums by critics and fans I enjoyed it though at the time I remember quite a few people critiquing the sort of change in pace that Blonde Redhead took on this album embracing more electronic elements maybe taking on a little too many of the very trendy chillwave sounds that were popular around this year and even though Blonde Redhead did work on a film score that dropped in 2011 most hardcore fans were most likely anticipating more this new full-length of theirs Barragan and this album is a very apparent sound and direction change for Blonde Redhead it is not quite as electronic as their last full-length LP and it is nowhere near as dense or as lush as their previous albums either this time around Blonde Redhead is sounding way more skeletal and stripped back and eerie and sort of intimate - I think Blonde Redhead does a good job of maintaining a lot of their usual characteristics but they deliver them in a much darker and simpler and more mangle way however I will not beat around the bush when it comes to my opinion of this record I feel like it is a bit of a letdown there are some musical highlights on these standard 10 tracks song listing on this record and for sure this sound change sounds really exciting in concept in blueprint but there are some incredibly lacking songs on this record as well it seems like in the midst of this less is more ideal that Blonde Redhead presents there are some songs here that present much too little like with the song cat on a tin roof a very loosely and shyly played piece of vintage pop music and it doesn't even sound like Blonde Redhead wrote this song it's almost as if they're just doing it off the top of their heads because the performance of this song doesn't really have that much purpose to it it's almost as if the band is just kind of playing to kill time like they're waiting for something to happen I was thinking it's almost as if they're in the middle of soundcheck or something which was something that to me felt sort of confirmed because as soon as kazoos first sung verse is over it's almost as if she says like something aside into the microphone to the sound engineer or something almost as if they're just getting levels on this track and this is just a spare instrumental or b-side that they just tossed onto the record even though the performance is borderline horrendous this song is like the epitome have not given a shit it's almost as if they just put it on this record because there's a 10 track song requirement or something and then there's the 9 minute mind to be had which feels like it was just put into the track listening to fulfil a time requirement the song is a very coherent sort of tightly played jam has kind of a krautrock esque steady repetitive groove to it but the very faint and shy progressions of the instrumentation on this song in no way justify the length and convincing things and then there's the three minutes or so of filler directly after the two minutes of decent songwriting on the song defeatist anthem it is a very coherent and pleasant song up until the point where it ends it has a beautiful haunting melody that kind of remind me of a early Portishead or something like that but as soon as this music dies down it goes to silence and the band just presents one disjointed musical interlude after another essentially killing time up until the track reaches the six-minute mark and there's also tracks on here like dripping which to me musically stylistically are absolutely faceless and to me Blonde Redhead is a band that has been very much not faceless very much bold very much chock full of personality but this track to me kind of sounds like your average jangly pretend shoegaze reverb rock underground soundcloud band trying to do a cover of Daft Punk's get lucky then there's seven to the uninspiring lis redundant closing track of this LP which starts off really promising but it's by the end of the song that I realized that it's pretty much nearly the same guitar part over and over and over as well as the same beat Kazu doesn't really build her vocals up that significantly over the course of the track now most of my favorite tracks on this record are disappointingly short but they are still highlights nonetheless there is the title and opening track on this LP which is a little instrumental feature some woodwinds some acoustic guitar it's gorgeous it's enchanting would have worked really well in like a Led Zeppelin album or something and this track gives way directly to one of the best songs on this entire record lady n the track with an incredibly slow smoky sensual sound this is the kind of sensuality that I expect from and love to hear from Blonde Redhead this song to me just feels like 1930s jazz club spotlight just loads of cigarette smoke in the air red dress red curtains it's just beautiful there's a great beat stellar chorus I love the melody on this track the Weeping guitars and strings it's a wonderful song it's just heartbreaking that there are so many tracks following this song that are absolutely underwhelming there are some other saving graces in the middle this tracklisting - in my opinion like the song no more honey the song is a little rough around the edges but it has a beautiful guitar melody some really interesting loud soft dynamics going on with the choruses and the verses and with the really strange effects on the vocals and the weird buzzing guitars layered over the chorus I think this song is the closest that Blonde Redhead comes to it's shoegazing roots on this record and the song the one I love is a really sparse strange and haunting acoustic ballad that features a rush of drums and harpsichord over the chorus again they're kind of playing with that loud soft dynamic over the verses and the choruses I love how kazoos voice on this song is so still and so stone-faced it's just kind of haunting and frightening and the lyrics she presents on this track as well are absolutely depressing there are some standout songs on this record I love the aesthetic that blonde redhead is shooting for on this LP and again I enjoy the usual characteristics that you find in a Blonde Redhead record but this album is incredibly lacking in song writing sometimes presenting songs that are just absolutely drab and boring whether that be because of the the melodies or the performances and then again there are tracks like cat on tin roof which there's really just no explanation for if there's one thing that's strange and interesting about this album is that it really runs the gamut of just really top-notch stellar instrumentally methodical and very well put together in detailed songs and tracks that are like getting a cold lump of mashed potatoes thrown into your lunch tray in a cafeteria housed inside of a compound where you now live because you've given your life over to a cult yeah it's like it's that bad I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next let me know and you're the best subscribe have a nice day drink water eat your fruits and vegetables hug your loved ones and try to help others okay okay Anthony Fantana Blonde Redhead forever 
BaIc7rttYEc,Oh to theny hot tan oh here the Internet's most humid music nerd and it's time for review the new Opeth album pale communion famed Swedish progressive metal and death metal band Opeth new full-length album these guys have been active since the early 90s I do prefer their gruffer earlier material in their discography regardless the band's trademark sound and writing has put them on a commercial and artistic winning streak throughout much of their discography from their late 90s output to the incredible success of early two-thousands albums like Blackwater park and the band has been able to maintain some incredible momentum building off of this record for album after album after album after album releases that are mostly incredible fan pleasers now in 2011 Opeth sound underwent a significant and surprising change their last full-length album while not their most celebrated record pretty far from being categorized as a loss in their catalog yet the band saw fit to undergo significant overhaul of their sound heritage was pretty much a straight progressive rock record which is different for Opeth in a few different ways one the death metal element in their music was completely erased out of the equation which at the end of the day I wasn't too surprised by that death metal to me a no pets music has always been a side kick a side dish never a main player so to see them get rid of it really only highlights the fact that they are more of a progressive metal band than they are a death metal band and to rather than being a progressive metal band with rock tendencies they are now simply a progressive rock band with some metal tendencies with this new record of theirs and heritage Oh Pet have essentially gone to the past they've gone nostalgic and they're sort of trying to stand shoulder to shoulder with their most obvious influences from King Crimson to Jethro Tull yes Genesis Pink Floyd movie blues and porcupine tree - and the end result on this latest LP a lot like on Heritage is pretty underwhelming just some second-rate hard rock and progressive rock revivalism to me it was like opeth was indulging in the past just to do it and not really bringing anything that new or refreshing to the table a lot like the record that Steven Wilson put out around this time grace for drowning and the album he followed that up with apparently some of these projects are related a part of a trilogy according to Wilson this heritage record is related to grace for drowning which is related to the storm corrosion project that ocker felt the frontman of Opeth and Steven Wilson had together and with this handful of releases that Opeth and Wilson have put out over the past few years they have essentially sapped the rock out of progressive rock with pastel performances that feel more calculated and studied than they are thrilling plain ultra clean sanitized production vocals that are just a tad melodramatic and writing that makes me feel like I'm listening to somebody's school project on progressive rock versus some legitimately exciting progressive rock and this record definitely gets an a-plus on the emulation front on the very clear ability that Opeth has to dive into progressive rock breathin its intricacies and recreate them to a tee but as a standalone piece of entertainment this record comes up short it's too predictable even for opeth I don't see this album completely winning you over unless you're the kind of person that remembers and curses the day that yes ever put out the record nine zero one two five and hasn't really bought many albums since once again a lot like on heritage the musical references on pale communion tend to kind of overshadow and drown out the sometimes legitimately good writing that Michael and his band bring to the table the vocal melody on the opening track here is a dead ringer for Blue Oyster cult's don't fear the reaper and there are some very nice keyboard and guitar solos on this tracks drum fills the band's performance is pretty tight but overall the end result is just really ordinary for this genre of music the next track on this LP is one of the most concise tracks in the track listing here and it's maybe my favorite track on the entire LP of eternity it's got this gnarly nasty dark menacing little guitar riff and groove that rides throughout much of the song it's a really nice jam I love the UH chorus line on this track it's very demolition as some of the very mystical melodic Middle Eastern flavored guitar leads that play in this track just occasionally these sorts of guitar leads actually appear later in the tracklist as well but the highlights don't really get much higher as the album continues on the acoustic interludes are just blatantly reminiscent of King Crimson as well as Jethro Tull maybe a little bit of Led Zeppelin too I don't really mind the song Goblin it's another hard rocker in the tracklist here there are also some acoustic interludes as well so there is some musical and instrumental variety across this track listing the song the voice of treason has a nice symphonic metal edge to it that definitely makes it stand out in the track listening and the closing track here just directly pulls a piano phrase straight out of Pink Floyd's dogs off of animals and ah I don't know listening to this track it's almost as if I could envision Michael playing this piano and as he's doing it he's looking back at me smiling like you know what this is from right we both know and yeah I know and it's not cute it's not a good look not only because this reference is so plain as day and so plainly incorporated but every time this record goes to tap an amazing classic progressive rock album on the shoulder it only highlights how insignificant of a contribution to progressive rock this album is overall to me this album merely sounds like group of people performing music in a genre that I like a lot and nothing more than that if that's all your standards are for enjoying a new album then give this record to listen this record to me is just standard as standard as heritage but maybe a little less entertaining because those are getting the sequel to a movie that was just pretty ok I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana music okay forever

4lsuigFrAjY,hi everyone and chubby fish tuna here the Internet's fishiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cool coat code orange record I am king these guys are at Pennsylvania hardcore and metalcore band this is their sophomore full-length LP they've got a heavy and raw sound they drop their first full-length album back in 2012 on this record they were certainly showing quite a bit of promise really had the whole hardcore world watching with the fact that this album dropped on Death Wish records and they had Curt blue of converge producing I remember crushing riffs on this album type performances good recording some pretty raw vocals but not really much else to me what kind of held this record back was somewhat lackluster writing which in a genre that is typically very fast loud simple and blunt is something that is sort of hard to define or savor but since the inception of hardcore punk and metalcore there have been groups that have run the gamut of creativity bands like converge that are hectic and musically dense the very righteous and wordy and straightforward Minor Threat or groups that are a heavy dark brooding sonic assault like nails and with this new record of there's Code Orange kids essentially sit further on that more dissonant noisy dark and heavy side of hardcore and metalcore right now this record is thrash and bash it does not really have much in the way of finesse nor do I think it wants finesse there are vocals on this record as well not just guitars and drums but I wouldn't really say the vocals come off as having that much to say or communicate the lyrics are pretty unintelligible but vocally there's quite a bit of variation here there are some general hardcore screams just those throat ripping shouts there are some guttural growls metalcore grunts the occasional clean vocal and for whatever reason sometimes muttering yes some of the tracks on here do feature muttering I'm not sure why but they do the vocals on the cell P really are more for sound and emotion and effect than they are a message pretty much Code Orange kids are rather Code Orange now because they have removed the kids sorry they really let their riffs and their production do much of the talking for them together Code Orange and Curt Beaulieu have pulled together and insanely heavy pummeling album the riffs just how thick and how punchy they are along with the drums is just suffocating this record is abusive it's overbearing I really think Curt blue just inches forward into producing his loudest heaviest album yet here so in that regard this record is kind of in advancement it's sort of refreshing but once again code orange is writing is just really nothing to get that excited about or really even remember on track for track book track the band just passes from one indiscernibly sluggish breakdown riff fest to another occasionally devolving into something that sounds like it could have come off of a new metal record in the year 2000 like on the song buying you the intro there or code oranges slow sluggish riff on slots show such little variance that the song just gets stale before it's over like alone in a room even though the the closing track here mercy it is the longest track here it is four minutes but the band does a pretty decent job of keeping it engaging for that duration even though the various parts the band kind of just throws against the wall do feel a little disjointed it don't feature like some really good or creative for fluid segues that bring the song from one part to another the only thing that gives these tracks some significant sonic separation are these tiny trinkets they manage to weave into the heavy riffs like the opener on here which has these just start/stop guitar drones that feel like they could have come out of a horror movie trailer or slow burn which behind the riffs on this track there's this very tinny sharp and very ear grabbing clinging clanking pinging it's very metallic it's very or the song your body is ready which has these very thin dissonant guitar peji O's that kind of bounce back and forth between the riffs the very dissonant shrill guitar chords on my world me me me or the song my world which features the kind of faint distant overly reverb background vocals that I would hear more often in like someone's bedroom shoegaze project versus a hardcore or metalcore album which at the end of the day isn't really that much of a compliment to this albums bone snapping riffs so yeah each track does have a little trick up its sleeve but it's only a small distraction from what is essentially one nonspecific riffey slugfest after another I'm pretty on the fence with most of these tracks there are some songs on here I do like such as I am King and your body is ready as well as unclean spirit but to me these songs are just nice coherent metalcore tracks where the riffs and the momentum seem pretty constant throughout the song the various parts of these tracks either flow into one another or complement one another nicely plus to me these songs don't go so overboard with the breakdowns as other songs do Code Orange despite the name change I've just put out another record that I feel a little on the fence with but maybe I just like slightly at the end of the day even though I think their sound and their performances are very aggressive very

o6Dc8yIZuM0,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pseudo record anchor zoom Udo is the musical project of songwriter and musical sonic tinkerer Nick Muto formerly known as being one half of the experimental music duo of B books the books to me a very important musical project that fused together elements of folk music singer-songwriter music rock electronics as well as a very eclectic array of vocal samples across their discography their final LP before they disbanded the way out is easily one of my favorite records in their discography and this is their debut album as well which is great too now before disbanding the books Nixon Muto had put out music under these a Muto name before but once the books were kaput he came back under this name but kind of reforms Muto as sort of being like a full band as opposed to just a small-scale musical project that featured still a lot of ambient tracks a lot of experimental tracks and this self-titled record that zmuda returned with was a pretty nice straightforward LP it wasn't quite as difficult or as experimental as the books previous album but I still think Nick lived up to his pretty adventurous reputation fusing together elements of acoustic and electronic music along with rock and for all of his odd musical quirks Nick was usually pretty good at bringing things back down to earth and coming together with a pretty coherent enjoyable song with a bit of a pop appeal now with this new and sort of sophomore record right here anchor there are two things that are pretty apparent the imagery that comes together with a record titled anchor something that holds you in place keeps you grounded and Nick is definitely doing that on here on this sequel album where he isn't really wandering too far outside of the sound profile that he introduced on his previous record and my first impression of this album cover and the first track off of this record itself is that this is kind of a winter album it is slow it is frosty it's sort of quiet it's it really kind of feels like just the the stillness that you feel when you go outside when you get that first huge winter blizzard and the very next morning you're going out and everything just seems totally frozen and quiet this opener that I'm talking about is titled good graces and on this song we're getting Nick's typically very young boyish voice singing very gently over these very serene synth escapes there's a very icy sheen on these tracks some very brooding electric piano and bass come and lay down the line and a lot of tracks here follow suit in this mood this album is definitely a mood change in a pretty big way there's the song Henry Lee which is sort of a take on a traditional track that features a lot of very Airy ethereal blizzards of synth arpeggios swirling around Nick's voice and then there's tracks on here like the great equator which are a little more lively in the second half musically for the first half it's a bit of a slow thaw but then Nick introduces a bunch of glitchy off-kilter sort of sporadic synthesizer melodies that really heat the track up this record for sure relies much more on subtlety and melody in comparison with the last Mutoh album and it's not a road I'm really sure I'm crazy to hear Nick zoom Udo move down because I'm not hearing a whole lot of finesse on this record in my opinion not a whole lot of fluidity instead I'm hearing a lot of beats and a lot of since sequences that feel just so lock in step and methodically put together and I don't mind this characteristic of zoom Udo's music it's what really attracted me to his last full-length LP but I'm not really sure it translates to the slow burning beauty I feel like he's trying to conjure on this latest LP of his fully anyway it does a little bit on some tracks I definitely love the song stinker one of the best tracks off this entire LP and one of the quietest to has these beautiful waves of synthesizers just coming again and again and again they have a nice sheen on them and Nick's voice in these waves of synths sounds really broken dreary just oh there's just a really painful emotion that's just so palpable on this track it's difficult to describe but for every patient in vast song that is on this record that I enjoy there's another that really doesn't do much to move me emotionally really sort of blobby faint and listless tracks so you stopped counting and there are some other tracks on here that I find to be engaging too but they have somewhat abrupt endings that kind of kill the song just a tad for me the track needs some Sun which may also play into the winter theme of this album the song hegemony as well as the track io which is one of the album's just Poppaea stand most upbeat tracks it's got an awesome melody I love the black Brant synth tones on this track - really crunchy drums this track sounds like a new wave song with an engineering degree from MIT to me overall this is a decent follow up to the last Mutoh LP it's a nice sister album I'm kind of hoping that Nick's next full-length will have a few more surprises in it and maybe it's just the time of year that isn't really totally vibing with me on this record this could most definitely be your perfect winter album several months from now maybe a wintry mood is what I really need to get into this album but as of right now even though there are quite a few tracks that I like it's the sort of abrupt endings and the handful of a very forgettable unengaging soundscape like tracks that have left me just somewhat on the fence with this thing I'm feeling a light decent six on the cell P transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is fact Anthony Fantana zoom Ito forever

OUzEUsNepC4,hi everyone Anthony Anthony Anthony here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Travis Scott mixtape days before rodeo this is the latest mixtape on Texas based rapper songwriter kind of singer mostly producer Grand Hustle signee and Kanye West's underling Travis Scott thanks to his kanye and good music affiliation travis has received quite a bit of hype over the past year or so last year Travis Scott dropped his mixtape owl Pharoah easily one of the worst hip-hop projects of that year production a lot of the time was pretty muddy flat only a few exceptions really a lot of the songs were really disjointed weaving in two different directions without really coming back and bringing it all together just kind of incoherent the rapping lyrically topically it was pretty generic Travis Scott made it very clear very obvious that he doesn't really have much of anything to say nothing really smart or meaningful which is fine if you don't want to go that route but I don't really find any of his lyrics to be clever or even legitimately entertaining as far as his flow and the sound of his instrumentals go the style of hip-hop that he's making uh Travis just comes off really trendy drowning in his influences a lot of the time which for the most part are Kanye West Kid Cudi a bit of ti a lot of southern hip-hop a lot of trap rap and now Travis Scott is back new year new mixtape this mixtape days before rodeo I understand is sort of the predecessor project to Travis's forthcoming commercial album rodeo a lot of people seem to remember me condemning his last mixtape and were really sort of curious as to whether or not I think there's been any significant improvement from one project to another and days before rodeo is definitely unquestionably a better project but is Travis getting better and if he is getting better what is he getting better at for sure I think Travis is making better decisions on this mixtape like the decision to produce less of it way less unless the rap genius and Wikipedia annotations are incorrect it would seem that Travis has really only produced two tracks on this new mixtape as opposed to most of the tracks on his last mixtape and sonically it has led to an almost night and day difference the structures of these songs are more coherent rarely do they weave into a pointless interlude or just really forgettable nothingness the bass is heavier and more resonant the high hats and the snares are more crispy the vocals are mixed better the rhythms are great the grooves are undeniable and there are a lot of instrumental highlights across this tracklist right with the opener which is produced by Wonder Girl just really nasty grimy boom backbeat with some epic synthesizers hanging in the background it really builds this project up it's a great intro then there's the song mamacita which is kind of a weird trap music flip of the guitar sample that a lot of you might remember from that song nostalgia's was on the last push a tea album not a bad instrumental an FK I beat that me ghost lands on later in the tracklist here is one of the best not only is it a hard-hitting track banger but horns and strings are worked into this instrumental I think it's the first time I've ever heard that incorporated in an instrumental of this style and it sounds great and then with the song zombies produced by lex luger is an interesting take on trap in that the melody playing in the background the synth melody is very eerie it has a very sort of Halloween quality to it to me overall even though every instrumental isn't a total winner the instrumentals on days before rodeo are much more capable than what was on al Ferro stylistically on this project Travis seems to be going down a lot of the same roads I mean you're getting a lot of southern hip-hop a lot of trap rap a lot of auto-tune choruses that seem to be influenced by maybe a little bit of future some migos maybe some Chief Keef some of the hooks are pretty catchy Mambo suit does it does you do screwed up once again on this project Travis Scott's middle name is trendy and he spends so much time chasing these trends he does very little to give himself in an actual edge or significant difference from any of his contemporaries lyrically I don't think I need to tell you Travis Scott's not really saying much of anything money drugs women success partying not inherently bad things to rap about but all the lyrics just add up into yet another self centered rapper and Travis Scott doesn't really bring any justification for the self-centeredness he doesn't really have a flair or a story or a unique angle to any of this because there was a line on the opening track here that caught me where Travis is bragging about his three number one albums and it just in my head is mama huh whoa Bela you're talking about three albums that you co-produced one beat on each the gifted Jesus and Magna Carta Holy Grail and these albums are not climbing to the top of the charts because people know that Travis Scott is producing for them and I can't see Travis Scott's solo albums climbing to the top of the charts because nearly every track on this project sounds like a track from another project as much as I love the beat on the intro the overall vibe of this instrumental as well as Travis's delivery kinda reminds me of something off of schoolboy Q's oxymoron just really dark grimy aggressive but sort of atmospheric and nocturnal - there's the cantana sequel on on this mixtape who's only saving grace is the TI verse toward the end and at this point the song has essentially been reduced down to just sort of like a Chief Keef or amigos ripoff with all the auto-tune choruses and so on and so forth the song drugs you should try it sort of sounds like I'm listening to a bunch of depressed robots moan with autotune effects on their vocals out into the night and on tracks like zombies and don't play in basement freestyle here and there and Travis Scott's flow I get like you know these cute little Kanye inflections when the songs aren't sounding like other artists they're just kind of blending together because sonically they have a little bit too much in common what does make some of these songs stick out are either choruses or hooks or lyrics that are just in bad taste the most memorable moments on this project are not really good moments maybe the instrumentals but the most lively and entertaining and memorable verses on this project come from other rappers even as he is slurring every other word I find young thug more entertaining on the few features he has on this thing and I guess what Travis Scott pulls together a song that I guess sort of means something it's it's not really anything I can applaud him on the song Skyfall which I saw on Twitter I guess is about maybe older artists falling off or failing to connect with younger fans who want to hear new sounds not really something I would have gathered from reading Scott's lyrics alone because lyrically and topically the song is so scattered and disjointed there are so many blanks left unfilled that there's really no way somebody could have come to the conclusion that this song is about that not that a songs meaning needs to be blatantly obvious but I guess I'm sort of just scratching my head why he would make a song like this it is because of older rappers and entertainers that you are popular I am totally in 100% for the out with the old and in with the new mentality but can we actually get a young artist who makes good music to say what Travis Scott is saying because hearing him say this is sort of like that whole Trinidad James Atlanta runs New York comment that everybody got angry over in conclusion this mixtape it's got some decent beats it's got some good beats too it's got a pretty decent features list nearly every rapper surpasses Travis Scott's ultra-low lyrical standards even Big Sean passes with flying colors lyrically there's not much here and I am very much Pro dumb fun but this album isn't even fun it's just dumb it's just auto-tune trap flavoured expensive sounding dumb I'm feeling a strong 3 to a life 4 on this thing transition if you've given this project to listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Travis Scott forever 
-9H3gaVgbUs,hi everyone it's big Finney boy Channel here sorry the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new rusty album green language this is the sophomore full-length LP of Lascaux electronic music producer rusty I first came across his music a handful of years ago through the album glass swords it dropped via Warped records and I thought this record was just maybe a tad one-dimensional but still easily one of the most bright glistening fun bubbly and good mood inducing electronic music albums that I had heard in a while very punchy rhythms tangy synth melodies as well as very sunny synth Tambor's stylistically there were fusions of UK bass and experimental wonky hip hop production a little bit of trap it's nice to hear an artist who's so early on in their career sort of has a very distinct sound so I was looking forward to this new rusty record however even though it may not seem this way to other listeners rusty fans I think this new rusty album is an incredible disappointment the most surprising change of pace on this new LP is this influx of vocal guests that rusty brings to the table now I understand rusty is not the most diverse producer in the world it's something he may be conscious of and I was hoping he would bring some changes bring some experiments on this new LP of his but I did not really assume or think that vocal guests would be what bring Rusty's new album diversity especially since a lot of these vocal guests in my opinion take away from the record more than they add not only in terms of their performances because there are no prodigies or diamonds in the rough on the tracklist here but many of the vocal guests on this LP have a reputation that is nowhere near as large as Rusty's there's the song up down which features vocals from D double e he sounds like a rapper from Rusty's neck of the woods there's some very sharp eighth we asked snare drums on this track some banging bass and some grading sense that just play very slowly and mundane ly in the background rusty does not really attempt to create some of the bright sunny melodies that made his last length LP so good and the lyrics from D EE the vocal delivery is just really obnoxious and kind of repetitive stylistically I think the song is a little different for rusty too it's kind of like this weird electro trap fusion it sounds more like rusty is trying to get himself on the bill of the next big EDM festival versus crafting a legitimately interesting song there's the song Danny Brown is featured on a tack it's a bangin beat but let's be honest here lyrically and flow wise - this is a pretty average verse for Danny there's the song lost with red din oh I'm sorry but this track just sounds kind of like a talkbox auto-tune Bon Iver Chromeo nightmare not only that but the vocal mixing and the vocal effects are a lot like the sense and some of the scenario on the ears there are some questionable mixing and EQ initial over this record rookie mistakes songs like Tempest have synthesizers that sound like nails on chalk and vocally I don't know who is appearing on the song dream on but this track is just yet another sort of generic vocalist melody and song just rusty is bringing this sort of sunny bright synthesizer window-dressing to the table to sort of bring it into his trademark style as far as the deeper cuts on this project goes there are really any meaty songs the first two tracks feel like intro tracks the song workship is kind of like a very spacey ethereal OneNote Rick's point never style synthesizer scape that just lasts two minutes and with the track a glimpse it's sort of like this bubbling series of synthesizer sequences which are very pretty but doesn't really go anywhere and then at the very end of the song we're getting this pummeling rhythm some downstroke guitars but then the song just ends immediately it's like it was going to go into this on a mono gucci style instrumental but it just stops because of how sadly rusty cuts off and structures some of these shorter more instrumental tracks they just kind of feel like unfinished filler it's like rusty is providing a series of interludes in an album that's barely got momentum like I don't need to take a break from the lack of good songs I just need you to give me a good song the song Raptor another big single from this LP it's not bad it's got some EDM style rhythms very driving very heavy some cycling thick walls of synthesizer it kind of sounds like deadmau5 and buttons rushing through a collaboration they were forced to do at gunpoint then the song velcro one of the few outright decent tracks on the entire LP really funky lead synth melody I love the rhythms of this track it's got a really sunny upbeat feel stylistically sonically I think this song is the closest to what fans would enjoy and expect from rusty but given that the mixing and the effects and the layers on this record are nowhere near as good this song in comparison with tunes on glass sword sounds kind of flat and dry colorless overall I was not into this record I was not into this record at all there were a few songs that I liked but mostly I disliked the tracks on this LP and I don't think I loved not a single song here the sound and the mixing and the eat cueing a lot of the time is sort of out of whack the structures of these tracks are less multifaceted less complex less exciting and challenging there are tons of filler tracks in this song list or songs that really aren't that long or don't make that much of a commitment to a sound or a structure or progression or much of anything and on top of all of it there are some really unentertaining guests in this tracklist too I'm feeling a strong to to a light 3 on this thing Tran yeah if you've given this album a listen what did you sweat it did you sweat it did you sweat it why and what should I sweat next anthony Fantana rusty green language sweat sweat 
K-o3nS4o1Eg,hi everyone Bethany Manzano here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rory album indigo child there's been a lot of talk of in my goes in the underground music slash hip hop scene right now underachievers good guys but overall I think there's been a lot of talk of just higher planes of thinking and alternative ways of thought all that stuff that comes along with having a third eye vision thing Rory seems to be following suit with that he is a 17 year old multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter and see there's been quite a buzz gathering under his name thanks to a few singles and music videos that are on the internet right now for songs such as God's whisper and cigarette song and these two tracks essentially seemed like fusions of hip hop style production with very large grandiose far-reaching indie folk music it's as if he's listening to new and current hip-hop as well as some stuff that might have been high in the 2000s maybe he's a little into the Neptune's Pharrell maybe some future maybe some of the cloud rap that's out there on the internet right now but he seems to enjoy just as much like some boney vert or some flea Fox's maybe some Lumineers or other more low-key but very mainstream friendly singer songwriters and even though I think in a sense these songs are an interesting combination of these two worlds I can't really say I'm a fan of either track the song God's whisper while it does start off really well becomes really incessant and redundant with its constant unchanging acoustic guitar phrase its incessant handclaps the tone of the guitar is very thin the drumbeat gets stale before the song is even over and Rory as a vocalist is really boring such a spacious instrumental could have used a singer that was a little more involved in the track but instead Rory seems to just say or sing rather as little as possible and just merely plays second fiddle to his own beat I was kind of on the fence because it seemed like the song or rather that image that was being put forward for this project was kind of progressive or forward-thinking but then I was knocked over onto the more negative side of the fence as soon as I heard cigarette song which not only has one of the most inconsequential instrumentals on this entire LP but has some really silly lyrics as well about who wants to live forever and I shared my cigarette with her and I fucked her on a Wednesday evening most appealing thing about this song is the music video which is a very cinematically shot teenagers wet dream where he has no real responsibilities and he's got the sexy girl around him and they're just smoking and being bad and living in this magical tree out in the forest so I can't really say I went into this new Rory album with incredibly high hopes because with these songs thus far Rory has sounded like every bland guitar strum er I've ever heard for the past 14 years but with much less pop appeal and an image that seems a little more green for the hip crowd on the deeper cuts of this LP like on the song Superfly Rory continues to bring sickeningly saccharine instrumentals I feel like I'm listening to a combination of Jason Mraz and Bon Iver and the song Armour is almost like a reboot of the imagine dragons track radioactive but instead of a dubstep drop reading this wailing guitar line and on these tracks as well as others Rory always seems to slip in these faint very quiet young boy rap verses that are very fast but instead of being just sort of on point and really coherent and articulate all the words just kind of melt together it just sounds amateurish and nothing of note really occurs instrumentally most of the songs here are pretty coherent though the mixes are fine the beats are pretty well executed for the most part there's just not anything vocally chorus wise or songwriting wise that I really see being carried into next year there's no definitive sonic style to the songs on this record the songs on this record drown in their own influences they sound like they've been put together by somebody who's relative young and musically inexperienced somebody who hasn't really had the time or the opportunity to hone their own musical thumbprint and this inexperienced feeling also comes through on a series of tracks that I'm baffled as to why they made it onto this album it seems to be Rory arguing with his mother these tracks are really badly recorded they're unpleasant to listen to and with how short these tracks are we don't get a whole lot of context as to what the argument is about for the most part he lets her talk more than he showcases himself talking or arguing or posing questions and even though she may sound really aggressive and may sound kind of like a bully with how she's shouting at Rory a lot of the stuff she sang makes sense she seems to be really concerned for her son's future his education especially as she says to him look I'm not trying to get anything from you I'm not trying to grift anything from you but these people who you may be dealing with definitely will they'll want their 20% they'll want their 30% and maybe this is something that Rory is aware about maybe this is something that he accepts and understands but if he does it doesn't really come through in these snippets and it especially does not come through on these songs which for the most part are pretty breezy and forgettable there's the song wildfire which to me kind of feels like what would occur if you had a collaboration between Pharrell and the underachievers with the worst possible outcome the song kinda feels like a kitty pryde song pre removing the pride from her name it's very Spacey it's cloud ravish it's very ethereal their twittering high hats playing throughout the instrumental the delivery of both Rory and his guest singer feel very unaffected underwhelming but there's no cute factor here there's nothing endearing about it it's just boring the song Chariots of Fire tour the back end of this LP turns out to be this really sort of cheesy rock song with more size than stroke they're these huge backup vocals pummeling drums but the song really goes nowhere and ends up sounding as redundant as gods whisper then there's the absolutely mundane closing track on this LP which is eight minutes long and features a bunch of vocals forgettable Ian needlessly a moaning over a very bland beat it's kind of uninspiring although the it seems to be kind of getting down to the idea of youth and being inexperienced and being just stubborn however the song instrumentally vocally doesn't really show off this youthful brashness this idea that hey listen I don't care what anybody thinks I'm gonna go ahead and do what I feel like I gotta do no instead the track just sounds kind of uninspiring like Rory's mother says and one of these arguments it needs direction in the future I could see Rory at this point he is at now producing for other people or songwriting for other people writing hooks or just writing like musical parts for other singers that may have more of a defined sound or delivery to their singing or rapping or what-have-you but until the day comes where worries somehow miraculously pulls a definitive personality out of anywhere I don't see myself enjoying a Rory project I'm feeling a decent too strong for on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh Rory forever 
b9tESaZ6hFc,hi everyone amputee Bam Bigelow here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new pallbearer album foundations of burden these guys are an Arkansas metal band who is fantastically good at picking hilariously depressing album titles here's their last full-length LP their debut full-length LP sorrow and extinction came out in 2012 enjoyed it quite a bit when it dropped initially I reviewed it and today I'm still somewhat fond of it and this LP of theirs is a traditional doom metal album it features five slow heavy dreary metal songs with a strong sense of melody and a very eerie and a cult vibe think st. vitus think Black Sabbath but there's something in pallbearers music that also reminds me of bands like Jethro Tull it just feels like they listen to just a touch of progressive rock enough for it to turn up in their melody writing and their vocals this first full-length LP was far from reinventing the wheel but I thought the production was really good maybe the vocals and the lead guitars were a little buried but the riffs were very heavy and basic just gargantuan and the melodies on this record record record lead guitar melodies I would say are where Paul Bearer gets most of its musical power to me this record had just about everything it needed going for it except variety varying ideas this album to me while very good in parts is kind of like a monotone monolith and from here I was definitely looking forward to whatever the band would do in the future given that it involved maybe a little bit more exploration with their sound maybe experimenting with some different metal styles or even writing some more concise songs even to direct straight into the point songs could really do wonders to break up a five-song tracklist I have no real issue with any one song on this album or really any one song on pallbearers newest album - but how can all of these slow epic melodic tracks feel significant or dramatic or stand out if all the backed up against our slow melodic epic tracks and this album is even longer than its predecessor and the band does not really spend this extra time diversifying their sound not really this album is a sequel to the first one in in like almost every sense from the sluggish pacing of these songs to the melodies to the sort of Barry vocals and again no song is really horrible on its own again we are getting these haunting fiery guitar leads the most sinister of which end up on the very last song here we get these thick and bacey heavy riffs monster drums and despite being 10 minutes in length nearly every song here is pretty engaging from beginning to end these songs are multifaceted they bring a lot of different parts to the table and the melodies that they have they just escalate and escalate and escalate them to the highest point of intensity before the band sort of breaks off into something else are sort of just ends the song entirely but finding any significant contrast or flow to these songs as a group as an album is kind of like trying to read into the finer details of a portrait where the painter decided to only use shades of the color violet to create this image nearly everything here reads as the same color so it all kind of just bleeds together no matter how many times I revisit it you can take the songs on this record and rearrange them into really any order and you're going to get nearly the same vibe there are some instrumental highlights on this LP however these song foundations breaks itself down to the point where it just has this lone eerie guitar playing by itself completely before the band breaks back in with full instrumentation just all guns blazing the song watcher in the dark has one of the most fiery and intense instrumental builds on the entire LP and immediately after brings through one of the few keyboards that appears in the tracklist here there's also the song ashes which I wish was a little bit longer because of how beautiful and tender the keyboards are on this particular track it's just kind of a shame that this song sort of just fizzles out and serves as nothing more than a mere interlude in between what just would have been yet another five track album from pallbearer where all the songs have a pretty uniform vibe there's the closer like I said it has some of the most menacing melodies on the entire record and the ghosts I used to be was sort of a lead track from this album to kind of promote toward its release and while I do find some of the melodies sticky I'm sort of wondering if I'm gravitating toward this track or if I'm remembering it just because it was merely the first I was introduced to off this LP though I will say there is a part where the tempo and the riffs kind of pick up on this track to a point where the song kind of rocks there are variations between these songs but the differences again are so slight that the tracks don't really work that fantastically as a whole record from beginning to end in this time the band is working with nearly an hour's worth of material and on their past album they barely had 45 minutes of fresh very material again not a terrible LP in a lot of ways a likable album but sort of like a hot bath it just gets colder and colder and colder the longer you sit in it I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition if you've given this a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that is it Anthony Fantana Paul Bearer forever 
S47nKJ8n0tk,hi everyone banan thony WAMP tanto here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new uncommon nasa record New York telephone uncommon NASA is a new york-based rapper producer label head and sound engineer this dude has a deep history was in the rap outfit the presence in the late 90s started uncommon records in the early 2000s was the pretty much go to sound engineer for definitive Jux records from 2000 to 2005 he has a number of collaborative albums under his belt with watu and Willie green as well as short fuse a number of solo records as well whether it be under an uncommon NASA or his other pseudonym Adam warlock however my personal first introduction to this guy's music was shortly after a fight I had with him over Twitter over the I think the last Raekwon album we did not see eye to eye and I had no clue who this guy was and you know we were just having a pretty heated and and lengthy discussion over whether or not this album was good or not that good it's so so as you can imagine coming fresh off this very impassioned argument impassioned on both sides maybe I was not totally in the perfect mindset I could have been in to listen to this man's music especially after seeing in a few different places online that he has categorized himself and his label as dabbling in progressive rap I did give uncommon asses last full-length LP a try it came out last year it's titled the land of the way it is I was impressed by the Prince Poe feature on this LP by a number of conceptual tracks on this project but I thought some of the rapping and some of the production was just a little too rough around the edges to get excited about it however I have come to learn that this is a very intentional characteristic and a characteristic that runs throughout this new uncommon NASA LP to NASA's vocals have a characteristically muddy feeling - either the way they recorded or mixed a feeling that doesn't really ring through on a lot of the guests versus here and the instrumentals on the self here absolutely cacophonous just really clunky bass lines heavy punchy just very muddy drums and samples that include screaming guitars subways sirens their shouts on this LP synthesizers scratching vinyl scratching this album is just pure underground grime plain and simple but is the style where the sound of these songs progressive not really in the sense that NASA is a flashy rapper at least he doesn't come off as one on this record he is no exhibit or Eminem or tec-9 or Busta Rhymes but NASA's material is progressive in the sense that it is different and sort of experimental rhythmically a lot of the beats on this LP are very loose they don't feel quantized they're not very tight just everything is very spaced out and just a little fluid and NASA's flow is pretty much the same way he seems to take away a lot from the rudimentary flows that a lot of rappers used to showcase in the 80s the early 90s sometimes he's on tempo sometimes he's off tempo he kind of borders between rapping and really expressive spoken word a lot of the time and he's rapping on top of these really oddly shaped instrumentals that have grooves in the background I don't think most rappers would even try to touch like the songs curmudgeon or destiny which had these really odd shuffling drum beats or the excitingly noisy instrumental on desperate times which I think there are very few emcees whose voices could really punch through everything that's going on in this beat this instrumental sounds like it was pulled together using the steam coming out of a sewer that was in the middle of the most crime-ridden Street in New York City in the early 90s there's the song 574 s which maybe has the most disorienting synthesizer line on the entire LP like weirder than a lot of stuff Death Grips has even done there are some very tight and steady beats on this LP - they have a very ARC edge to them like this bodega is trying to kill me or the title track on this record that kind of reminds me of old LP or old Def Jux or company flow records I think NASA takes away a lot from MF DOOM special herb series as well but just way weirder and more experimental there are a few sad and very dreary beats as well in the tracklist here there's a lot of variety across these instrumentals and even though they are sort of hard to get into at first because of how muddy they are they are very subtle they are very layered their blood pumping they're eerie they're creative and sometimes they're beautiful what is clearer than the sound quality of these instrumentals are the concepts or the stories behind these songs the song feedback loop is kind of a walk down memory lane with NASA directly referencing 9/11 in the hook of this song kind of marking that time as feeling long ago along with 1999 saying is this my memory or is this just my youth ending the song 574 is is another walk down memory lane but this one sort of orienting itself a little bit more around shoes specifically the 574 line of the New Balance brand and along with this shoe NASA dropped some inspirational lyrics and talks about things like working at a temp job which brought him to working at Wall Street at one point in time where he met mad jerks this bodega is trying to kill me is maybe one of my favorite tracks on this entire LP features a killer verse from a lucid of Armand Hammer and it's essentially a song kind of talking about this bodega filled with either seedy characters or bad omens and really unsanitary food there's paranoia or destruction which hit me as being kind of the one of the worst tracks on the LP at first merely because of how the hook is paranoia is always there just the way that it's sung it just feels very amateurish but the more I listen to this LP the more this hook really fit the aesthetic of the entire album and I do really love the lyrics and the sentiment of the song even though a lot of people paranoia seems to torture them and eat away at them and it seems to do that with uncommon - he sees it also as a plus something that continues to protect him deeper in his life and the song curmudgeon which has the saddest beat on the entire LP in my opinion kind of follows in that same kind of cranky loner vibe where NASA's talking about not wanting to meet a whole lot of new people or formerly strong relationships with really new people because instead he prefers to maintain the relationships he has with a lot of the people who he knows already he doesn't want to flood his life with people or just things that he feels are unnecessary he only wants to carry what are his essentials and then there's the title track to this LP another song I love and not really a track that has a story to it or anything but a lot of phone imagery a lot of phone folklore as well as one of the best hooks on the entire LP and this whole phone thing is an interesting concept that plays throughout this entire album as uncommon NASA presents this instrumental that samples a little bit of Frank Zappa off of the LP hot rats and over these instrumentals it seems like he's putting vocals snippets of people talking most of whom if not all seem to be related to this album in some way and they're all talking about why they love they left or they live in New York I think it's a nice segue from track to track it adds a lot of character to the album I think it pulls all the songs together and the entire record if you exclude the intro is bookended with these two songs which are maybe the most difficult to digest on the entire LP though I do think they do a great job of finishing things off with a really eerie feel or setting the tone with something kind of lofty and ambitious and very abstract you know uncommon NASA makes great hip-hop songs but there's something about tracks like destiny that is really difficult to classify and I really enjoy this track and I think it's a great start to the record even though it was a little off-putting at first but the more that I listen to it and the more that I appreciate it it seems like it's harder to put into words what it is about this track that makes it so great because the off kilter groove the Spacey flow the really esoteric meaning of a lot of what uncommon NASA is saying certainly makes it difficult to address some of the feature verses on this LP for a little bit I do think the songs that have more guest rappers on them tend to be a little less conceptual unfortunately I do think that is a little little bit of a hindrance though the guest verses are still good like with the stakes which features Billy woods you may know him from Armand Hammer and his solo stuff and BMS a rapper that I'm not really familiar with though his flow and his delivery reminds me quite a bit of guilty Simpson and then there is Curley Castro and Prem Rock / the song numb overall I think this is a great record one great track after another with an interesting theme and concept uncommon NASA writes of great hooks there's some very good guest features NASA picks and produces some wonderfully scuzzy beats and even though I don't think NASA is the most technically proficient or technically entertaining rapper he makes up for that a lot with his personality his subject matters his lyrics he's definitely one of those artists that when it comes to lyrics he's very much quality over quantity he is concept over catchiness there's some artists that can't really pull that dynamic off there's some artists who can and I think NASA is one who can I'm feeling a strong eight on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana uncommon NASA forever 
-obIKHZvohA,hi everyone Mantha me bro tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Michael Cera album true that Michael Cera is an actor multi-instrumentalist songwriter he hails from Ontario Canada at this point I don't think I need to list out all the successful TV shows and movies that he has played key roles in because if they didn't exist I probably wouldn't have gotten a large influx of requests to review this album this album which he has dropped out of the blue on Bandcamp true that it is 17 original tracks a cover a lot of tinny lo-fi odds and ends there's some indie folk tunes on here some piano pieces instrumentals either this album is the quaintest soundtrack I've heard in years and the movie is just on the way has been put out yet it's still in production or this record is just a bunch of musical loose change Michael had jangling around in his pockets and even though there's nothing really game-changing in the tracklist of this record there are some highlights like the sort of wonky guitar intro it's got a three four time signature really eerie melody definitely sets the tone of the album and then there is a cover version of blaze Folies clay pigeons not a song I'm terribly familiar with but it sticks out very plainly as a cover with its steady finger picking and ethereal pianos and really sharp melodies sharp lyrics poetic lyrics as well as clear structure it's easily the most coherent song on the entire LP which really makes us stick out like a sore thumb in the tracklist and by default kind of makes it the best song in the entire record there are a few other acoustic ballads in the tracklist here but they are nowhere near as memorable or as immediate tracks like Oh Nadine and steady now and the song Ruth which may in fact be the the saddest story that Michael Cera pens on this record all these songs are way too weak voiced and gently strung they're too faint to faint melodically structurally when it to the performance as well there's the song what gives which is kind of a sour strange little one-minute rock track that kind of sounds like a unicorns demo unicorns being abandoned not really surprised Michael Cera might be into given that he has played bass for mr. heavenly which does have a unicorns connection to me the brightest spots on the entire LP are the instrumentals are the little piano pieces and that may in fact be because the the the expectations are lower it's not like there's anything big to expect in terms of structure from these tracks it's not like there's a lyrical component to these tracks so Michael Sarah's voice which is maybe one of his weakest points on this record isn't really showcased and for the most part these instrumentals are very cute they are very as I said before quaint they're sweet they are loosely performed they're rickety they're endearing they're relaxing there's the piano piece go she's kiss which is very nice the humdrum track the guitar piece on that song is very cute even though there are some sour guitar notes on the song here and there the song 20/40 another track in 3/4 if you give it a listen to this album you will hear that Michael Cera does love that time signature and this is a little drum machine keyboard piece at least it sounds like drum machine I can't really tell with just how bad the recording is but it's got this sputtering little beat some very charming keyboards and I really like the song Old Grey Whistle as well with these really grand rich saloon-style piano chords matched with some acoustic guitar it's really just a mixed bag of hit or miss songs there's no overarching theme or anything to really pull these songs together outside of just the generally subpar recording I'm kind of feeling a 5 on this album like a light decent 5 and you know what I don't really think Michael Cera had any ambition beyond making an album of that quality because he sounds like a hobbyist which is totally fine there's nothing wrong with being a hobbyist many of them send me their music however I don't review it I don't point it out to you guys until these are to sound like they've got their together they sound like they know what makes for a catchy immediate time spanning or interesting song until it sounds like they're putting together a professional grade or interesting recording I know that lo-fi is a genre now and that people have gotten past the idea that you need to have a good clean recording in order to give fans I understand that and I like that it's great that you don't need to have a recording as clean as like a Nickelback record in order to get listeners but from my perspective what really puts Michael Cera above any of these hobbyists that may be sending me their music at any point throughout the week aside from the fact that he's Michael Cera nothing I'm going to be 110 percent honest with you right now if this record blew your mind you don't need me you don't need any music journalism website currently in existence right now what you need to do is go on Bandcamp type in indie Foulke and you will have your mind blown numerous times over and over and over and over just like one musical mushroom cloud after another because there are so many internet albums that are floating around right now that are either at this level or higher in terms of songwriting or recording transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Michael Cera true that forever 
7z-GBzgZ9Y8,low fight a no EP review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd gonna review an EP really quickly for you right here to get a check hydrate it's important these guys re swiss death metal band they have a handful of eps out so far that came out with one of my favorite metal eps of last year and it seems they are following that EP which a lot of people have buzzed about with yet another EP titled soma and it's really not that surprising of a release given what the band has put out thus far EP wise i think i myself and maybe some other people in the metal community are kind of sitting and waiting to see if these guys are going to be a face worth following and worth remembering in death metal music and what's going to solidify that is if they drop a solid full-length album whether or not that's going to happen this year i'm not 100% sure but I don't think this EP is necessarily doing them any favors if anybody excited by that EP gives a listen to this new EP right before the release of that album I think it may dampen the excitement just a bit and maybe because uh the release here is not only unsurprising for Boulder but um I guess a little unsurprising for death metal in general for one in my opinion the recording is not quite as fantastic or as spectacular as what was going on with their last EP there are just two songs on this release one of which is about five minutes the other twelve minutes so we do see in in one respect the band sort of getting a little more ambitious really trying to pull together a longer meteor song but with this opening track that the EP kicks off with it's a fairly straightforward song it alternates between just heavy chugging riffs and these wailing tremolo picked eerie death metal leads there are of course some growl vocals in there but um they're kind of lost in the haze of the sort of rough and mud recording and I don't think the the performance is all that fantastic either there are some points where it's just noticeably a little sloppy a little off the first half is a little bland I do think it picks up in the second half though there are a few very aggressive and very adrenaline-pumping musical passages that the song kicks into before it finishes off of the variation on one of the original riffs of the track and just kind of ends out it's the second track that um it's it's really just as muddy as the first recording wise but there is something incredibly ambitious about this track not only in its length but there are some clean chorus vocals in here a few different vocal change ups and some interesting instrumental interlude work it is a ferocious 12 minute track definitely kind of kept me engaged for much of the tracklisting not track listening but track length and it's I guess I guess I could just say it's it's it's just more epic in scope and you know other than the ambitious coming through this the ambition coming through the structure of this song I can't say there's anything else really to hype up about it because the the performance here is also a little sloppy like I said the recording a little muddy yeah you know it's it's it's it's just an OK EP nothing that I'm gonna be freaking out about at the end of the year but given what I've heard from this band previously I'm still looking forward to when and if they drop a full-length record maybe they haven't been signed yet I'm not totally sure about that I can only speculate about that stuff all I can say is as far as the new material goes on this new EP not quite as floored by it as the last EP if you've given this release of listen what did you think of it did you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana bolt sir so much forever 
HtCwSGD4HMY,whoa fight a No EP review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new armand hammer EP furtive movements these guys are a new york-based hip hop duo Billy woods and a lucid I have been a fan of Billy with solo stuff for a while whether it be his albums like history will absolve me or his recent released our candy I have gone back and listened to his old stuff with these super cron flight brothers and there's also lucid and together as Armand Hammer they dropped a mixtape a while ago but a full-length album very recently called race music which was definitely some of the most grimy and esoteric hip-hop I heard of last year I'm pretty sure is on that album dropped and now they seem to be sort of cementing this duo they've been collaborating you know under this name they've been collaborating under cementing it with a new post album EP which is certainly what this new EP sounds like nothing too immense I think I think I think just like a release for the fans to be completely honest some loose ends on on here I think some original tracks some remixes or revisions as well and the tracklist there's nine songs on this thing it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of rhyme or reason for these tracks to exist other than for them to just be out there which again if you're a fan is not not a bad thing and I happen to be a fan but I do think that race music or maybe even their original mixtape or maybe even Billy woods solo stuff might be a better place to start if you are unfamiliar with arm and hammers music I will put information down there in the description where you can see some reviews of that stuff and maybe start yourself off on the right foot with Arm and Hammer and with Billy woods in general there are some tracks on here that I'm not a huge fan of the opener isn't the most gripping track that I've heard Billy and lucid collaborate on then there was the on dust jackets which kind of feels like two different songs with two different instrumentals just sort of fading into one another in the middle of the track it just kind of feels like a one song pasted onto another one and like I said earlier there are some remixes on this thing some revisions both of which I like there is the Willy bas skit remix if you remember Willy BOTS get one of the better tracks from the race music album that Billy and allusive collaborated on and this beat revision it's it's just an instrumental revision the verses are exactly the same but the beat on this track is stellar this is a stellar beat I just love the tone just the change just how wild the changes from one instrumental to another if you remember on Willy basket it had kind of a trap rap flavor to it but this beat it's got like this pep rally marching band groove to it like which is a really unusual rhythm for not just this rap track but really for any rap track to have there is the song Duffey which has a guest verse from curly castro it's roughly the same song just he adds the verse on to the end of the track and he does bring a different style a different flow than a lucid and billy just his verse is nothing but nasty gnashed teeth and aggression but subdued in a way it's not like over the top or anything like that and lyrically he does fit in with the theme of the song dealing with family death funeral tradition ritual superstition there are a few original tracks on this record that I think are great touch and agree is a fantastic song in my opinion a theme song that grabs my attention because from what I can put together again Billy woods an esoteric Billy woods in a lucid they pull together some esoteric stuff that they don't make songs that are that obvious as to what they're about on the surface and on this particular track from what I know about Billy woods Billy was his history and from what I know he's wrapped it out before this song sounds almost as if like he's rapping to a younger version of himself like this song is advice he would give to his younger self if he could and and an elusive follow suit on that theme as well and I think it's one of the most creative tracks I think they've put together thus far and the closing song on here which is a very dream and Nightmare themed very surreal lyrically and has one of the scariest beats on the entire LP is a fantastic finish and I also might add that there is quite a bit of production on this EP too that has elusive either producing cooperatively with somebody or just producing by himself so maybe into the future we will see more production from elusive on future Armand Hammer or just Billy woods projects and there's also a beat from blockhead on here on the song FUBU definitely one of the catch here instrumentals on the entire LP but again it's another one of the tracks in this track listing that feels a little too short of breath to be all that excited about the song itself again to me this EP is a fan of fair and I happen to be a fan so I do enjoy it it may or may not land on my favorite EPS of the year list depends really on what other EPS drop if anything sort of ends up surpassing this but I do like it and I think if you had been a fan of Billy's and lucid stuff in the past this is well worth a listen cool cool if you've given the sepia listen what did you think of it did you loved it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Armand Hammer furtive movements forever 
gt70XZHH5AI,500 times you watched that video yes and you're gonna review it will you eat as they say in Europe hi everyone its Cael - Chester here with a special report and the new nickname Manoj Sen eken makanda this head video is full of butts if you look at the video real close there's butts here here here here and over here down there in the description box we will put time sections where you can see the butts I noticed there's fruit there's fruit at several different locations in the video which i think is symbolic for good health also I found this many Lupin addi triangles when looking at this part of the video what would we do without you I don't know I what would you do with help hmm I do something sceptic there you go hi everyone shots the knee fired tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Watsky record all you can do Watsky is a rapper songwriter a poet a harmonica player he's been pretty active in slam poetry since the mid-2000s but in the late 2000s when he started releasing music with some mixtapes with his commercial debut later on he would go on to produce viral video sensations such as Watsky raps fast a video where he shows how much technical skill he has when it comes to rapping so much so that this video caught on for him like wildfire and even though watski may be really technically proficient and have an incredibly fast flow his light-hearted humor in his Rhymes and his boyish charm kind of make him hip hop's answer to micheal cera this this this is pretty much my first Watsky review however this is not my first run-in with his music i am fairly familiar with his style and I'm fairly familiar with what aspects of it don't really appeal to me that much I tend to think a lot of the humor that turns up in his rhymes runs a little cheap his serious moments feel a little melodramatic and when he does entertain or explore some interesting ideas or concepts in his songs it seems like he kind of tailors them for an audience of people who need things sugar-coated or oversimplified or given the most radio-friendly instrumental backdrop as possible to me Watts Keys music even though there is a really strong sense of technical proficiency to it is more likely to turn the heads of top 40 radio listeners than it is true hip hop fanatics I don't really think Watts Keys music is for the heads and that's fine it's not necessarily a bad thing I'm just letting you know what you may be getting into with this record however me I don't really care for this album and it's not because Watts key is a hateable person or that there's a terrible personality running throughout this record or that this album is just despicable Watsky definitely means well from the very start of this record there is a strong sensation of cuteness even though Watsky may be telling an expletive filled story about trying to join the 27 club Amy Winehouse in the afterlife saying who the fuck invited him to quote watsky himself there's something about this story and a lot of the other stories on this record too that are very Mickey Mouse and this is a character trait he knowingly embraces and that he understands he has and I think he uses it to the best of his abilities most of the time knowing full well there are going to be some people out there that are not turned on by that and I just think I'm on that side of the fence here like on the song stand for something where we're getting hip hop on the verses but on the chorus it's like we're switching genres into this liquor soaked Americana that is just so stereotypical and cliche that every time I hear to just go black there's the song right now which I feel like I'm just totally not into because of its beat which feels like a very muddy kind of low-budget take on a top 40 rap instrumental kind of like something Ryan Lewis would produce but with much more clarity and brightness and exuberant instrumentation the vocal and the farty scents and the kind of stock guitar sound on this beat just do not sound that good there's the song my first stalker which I thought going into the song would be an interesting song idea but it actually ended up being one of the worst tales on the entire record where Watsky is essentially talking about this stalker that he has and sort of tossing out the idea that hey you know you're stalking me but I'm just a regular guy and you know what we know that that's part of your appeal it doesn't need to be explained especially since anybody I pull off the street at random could have written this hook frankly I am flattered we all want a matter I'm just watching Netflix jerking off to porn oh the song let's get high and watch planet earth is about as exciting as watching somebody smoke session through a pair of binoculars and this track also has a disgustingly sugary hook to boot and the song hand over hand with its corny acoustic guitars and it's coffeehouse drumbeat I am not wearing a scarf I'm not about to order a latte I cannot listen to this instrumental not only that but this song merely sounds like another artists song that Watsky is just featured on and I wouldn't listen to this track if it had no rap verses and Watsky doesn't exactly sweeten the pie and those are essentially the lows of the album which are low but there are some bright spots as well at times watsky may be overly sentimental and he may rock a sort of obnoxious inflection it's kind of like this monotone gear he kicks his voice into when he's rapping fast this is my rapping bass voice but he is also passionate and seems to be really laying his ideas authentically out there on to these beats what happens on this record does gel with me sometimes the song all you can do is definitely cute and sets the tone of this record and I do respect the flow the song whoa whoa whoa though I don't love it it is a kind of likable single it's sort of like a McLemore Ryan Lewis style instrumental laced with some Eminem style silliness and lyrics the song ink don't bleed though I think is the best on the entire record definitely my favorite there's a really grimy nocturnal instrumental on this track and why skee delivers lyrics that essentially point out a few different hypocritical characters like a pop star not singing on her own album or a vegan straightedge rapper who after shows and after preaching to people goes and drinks and needs a hamburger the watski does toward the tail end of this track point out the idiocy of the recent 35 foot stage dive that he engaged in in London on the Vans Warped Tour sort of criticizing himself for that talking about the girl he injured in the midst of that stage dive and even though he seems to address it here it's still kind of a hard thing for me to get past I mean almost killing innocent people for your own personal cheap thrill I appreciate that he's apologizing but I'm not ready to see her and be like oh he's so brave really addressing this so boldly and so openly though this is kind of an issue that watsky addresses earlier on the record where he talks about well you can separate the artist from the art but what happens when the art is about that artist there are spots like that and other tracks here where Watsky does manage to pull together some clever moments like the one which is another favorite of mine on this LP a song where Watsky kind of talks about how he doesn't believe in such a thing as there being the one person that's perfect for you and if he does believe in that he certainly thinks that that person would be very difficult to find and then of course with some very intentional irony he backs this song up with a track about boomerang where he seems to be going back and back again to this person who he seems to sort of have an on-and-off-again relationship with and there's the track tears to diamonds which to me is maybe the the second legitimate and enjoyable piece of music on this record were watski displays some pretty serious personal turmoil specifically with meds medication he takes to prevent seizures that I guess he's been going through and he kind of gives us what he feels is an even an unbiased view that people may need these medications to improve their lives or just merely live normal lives but there at the end of the day our people who are profiting off of the suffering of these individuals who have to take these medications to survive the song grass is greener is kind of like an acoustic ballad that Watts Keys heard singing throughout very quietly and very boyishly but it does have a nice weird kind of indie folk tone to it that I think is really nice and there's also the track Sarajevo which is about a couple who died during the Bosnian Civil War who were essentially torn apart by the war and came from different racial and religious backgrounds and even though Watsky doesn't really have any kind of from what I understand familial or personal ties to the death of this couple I think it's really admirable what he did with this song these days there are a lot of artists whether it be in rock music or in hip hop music who are storytelling in this way telling a story giving a vivid rendition of a tale that they don't have any personal connection to they just feel it's a story that needs to be told it's the story they feel particularly passionate about and then there's the closing track on this LP the longest track on the record it's quite an ambitious undertaking Stephen Stills of crosby Stills and Nash sings on the hook there's an incredible drum solo toward the back end of the track which is matched with all this really lush instrumentation and strings Watsky delivers a load of spoken word all over this track and kind of like the end of Childish Gambino's camp this is maybe one of the most likable moments he has on the entire record it seems that he gets really personal at this point in the song kind of talking about a love interest and kind of giving me this iral story about this first tattoo that he got again he sounds overly sentimental on this track but again his his passion is really admirable and the way he delivers this poetry is really convincing as well my only real issue with the song and this record overall again is that the instrumentation just sounds a little muddy it sounds a little flat it just never sounds as big or as grand as it implies it is again as I stated earlier I'm not really into this LP I'm feeling like a strong four to a light five on this thing even though watsky is a fast rapper he is on point when it comes to tempo he's just in the pocket he has a lot of skill when it comes to flow however this album doesn't really focus on much other than then whatever sort of drama Watsky seems to drum up in the storylines of these tracks but there's just something really kind of childish and I think a little immature about the tone of watts keys lyrics and the sound of these instrumentals even at his most serious and depressing on this record there's just something about the tone of watts keys lyrics and his instrumentals that make me feel like I'm just chewing on the musical equivalent to a Twinkie or a marshmallow and that's pretty much how I'm feeling about this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Watsky forever 
d9sGdZvF_R8,"it's not going to have the same sort of effect or Maori and why not what happened Elise it's not going to have the same sort of effect or Maori it's not going to have a thing oh hi everyone don't the nishu tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new anti mask LP its self-titled this is the debut full-length album from two rock musicians who if you are into rock music you should be pretty familiar with by now omar rodríguez-lópez and cedric bixler-zavala both of whom are pretty seasoned vets at this point given the time that they put in over the years with bands like at the drive-in and mars volta and musicians such as drummer Dave LH as well as Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist flea were said to have worked at least on the early tracks of this album from what I understand this LP was also recorded in a studio that flea runs and as happy as I am to see this new project coming out I'm just sort of also wondering what's going on with Cedric's and Omar's previous bands I mean you know they put together at the drive-in and then ended up putting the band on hiatus or really breaking them up and then they came back and played live a little bit and they have been broken up for a second time now and at this point the future of the Mars Volta seems pretty much over Omar and Cedric just had this history of starting bands together and then breaking them up and now they just seem to be starting a band just together and then that's it and of course over the years with the Mars Volta and at the drive-in running parallel to these groups there have been side projects Omar actually very lately has been incredibly prolific with bands like Bosnian rainbows or working with libo Tourette's he has a number of solo albums that have been coming out lately too however there is some kind of impossible to quantify electricity and excitement that I get from an album where Omar and Cedric have worked together on it even in some of their weakest moments of work together over the years there's just this really strong exuberance coming from a lot of the music they collaborate on I loved Cedric's voice which is a little bit of an acquired taste he's kind of like screamo or post-hardcore 'he's answer to Robert Plant and Omar's playing and arranging and songwriting always great though I don't think his guitar playing is as flashy as it usually is and I would say that really rings true for this album overall given the history of bands like The Mars Volta or at the drive-in a fan of Omar and Cedric might go into this record assuming that there might be a really strong element of progressive rock somewhere in the mix here but there's really not because on this record Omar and Cedric write some of their most upfront and hooky material yet just as the lineup of this band is boiled down to its most necessary of elements so are the songs on this record the riffs the lyrics the melodies the drumbeats it's all as instant as microwaved oatmeal essentially in this tracklist you're getting a load of alternative rock songs of power pop songs but they all maintain a really raw aesthetic with the production lots of buzzing guitars dry punchy drum beats the vocals are very loud and bold and in-your-face it's not a very dressed up recording and as a result these songs come off really trim and sharp and just showcase some really good songwriting and playing there's the song for am one of the lead singles off of this LP really twangy guitar leads some crunchy riffs some incredibly dramatic lead vocals from Cedric over the verses I love the hook on this thing - watching way to hanging in the lurch another great lead single from this LP which has one of the most killer choruses and most ferocious grooves at the start of this LP there's 50,000 kilowatts which is kind of this records resident power ballad there are some familiar chord progressions on this thing and melodies some cliche broken heart lyrics but there's something about this track underneath the roughness it kind of sounds like just a Golden Age power pop track that would fit really well on AM radio and there are some other songs here and there that sort of work off maybe a few too many worn-out rock tropes whether that be lyrically or riff wise as well kind of like rad lack the devil Sun or the track drown all your witches which kind of feels like a simplified Led Zeppelin song all the way though I will say there are some moments on this LP where I am picking up a slew of religious themes like on ride like the devil Sun of course with the devil reference but also the the Bible is the truth in the refrain of the hook there's the mention of no godly deed going unpunished on the song drown all your witches there's also the track people forget which makes reference to that old metaphor about atheists and foxholes there are religious and other types of difficult personal situations talked about in the lyrics of this LP but Cedric keeps it more esoteric than he does preachy my only major issue with the cell P kind of comes toward the back end of it and not that any single track gets so terrible that I can't handle it though I don't really like the track people forget the two hooks of this song really do get on my nerves especially the don't kill me that just sounds like a really bad portugal the man hook i guess i kind of feel like omar and saidar together sort of run out of ideas by the back end of this LP or at least limit the scope of their ideas to the point where a lot of these songs feel a little too Sammy samia's seems that they wanted this record to be so straightforward and so to the point that they kind of limit the ways they can venture out and experiment a little bit the entire record overall feels kind of like a mixed bag especially with the last track here feeling just about as urgent and as peppy as some of the songs on the first half of this record not really a magnificent closer or anything like that but I still think overall this is a really solid record tons of enjoyable songs on it it's just not stellar as an album but Cedric and Omar if they continue to work with anti-mask and they certainly seem capable - with all the good songs they've written here if they just sort of take how all these songs sound together as a whole into account on their next record they could have an even more fantastic LP on their hands I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana anti-mask forever "
zI6H-QWAZog,ah hi everyone good Inigo tanto here the Internet and it's time for a review of the new spooky black leaving ep spooky black is an underground R&B singer and songwriter gone internet sensation pretty much off of a handful of tracks from his last full project black silk and the then really careful then really like this tape was essentially just a bunch of very Spacey reverb soaked R&B it's a really trendy sound right now and behind this aesthetic behind this trendy sound I found very little in terms of song or lyrical substance I mean we're talking really unimpressive moaning over a series of kind of bland somewhat lo-fi instrumentals I definitely hear that on this project spooky black is shooting for something that is haunting and sort of sad and beautiful but I don't really think it quite gets to that point at least from a performance perspective a lot of the time I feel like spooky plays second fiddle to his own instrumentals kind of getting lost in the haze of reverb merely sounding like a kind of forgettable vocal in all of the atmosphere however I did enjoy the recent feature he had on the new bones mixtape and I don't know for whatever reason I just wanted to give this EP a try even though up until this point I felt pretty on the fence about spooky Black's work so I did go into this EP with pretty low expectations but I did come out enjoying a handful of tracks from it this new EP is about 20 minutes or so it's 7 songs one of them is an interlude there's a bonus track as well and just on the surface this new EP is pretty much what you would expect from spooky black given his output thus far lots of rattling southern and trap hip hop inspired high hats some sub bass kicks here and there but mostly just kick drums they have a lot of just a deep bassy thud to them lots of watery warped and dreary serene melodies and of course tons of reverb just that ethereal atmosphere I did notice I thought the lyrics were a little more audible on this tape although that didn't really make it more enjoyable because on the lyrical front I do feel like this EP just delivers that cliche love song style sadness baby gonna know what you goin through fingers through your hair do you like it when I stare were you even there like you even fucking care if you give this EP a listen it's safe to say you will not be embarking upon a treasure trove of wordsmith verses in fact a lot of these same rhymes and lyrical themes on the first track turn up in the second track and there's also moments deeper into this you'd be like how can I resist fucking body like that good times so musically lyrically this EP is pretty basic in a lot of ways which at the end of the day leaves it feeling kind of like something that can just drift so easily into the background and there are some things on the CP that I I much rather would be in the background like the incredibly abrupt ending of the first track the very very homely rappers on Hotel 69 or the interlude track we're right at the beginning of the song we can very audibly I mean not even audibly but loudly here spooky black clearing some boogers from his runny nose wonderful you're really setting the tone there sounds great captivating for one the song pull yes not a track where I'm totally head-over-heels for the lyrics but I love the instrumental on this track I'm loving the the Warped warm watery guitar melodies playing throughout this track they're haunting it's just a very tender wonderful just beautiful melody so dreary and sad yet so pretty and again even though I'm not a huge fan of the lyrics I do think the spooky blacks vocal melody is wonderful on this track and his singing is coming off a little more passionate and I feel like the song idle has a lot of these same appeals to a fantastic piece of guitar work in the instrumental I love the spacious beat spookie blacks vocal melody is great and I'm sort of hearing these lyrics about sort of trying his best for somebody and they're not even noticing it I'm actually kind of warming up to the lyrics on this track but then all of a sudden it just cuts off and stops out of nowhere great and the closer echoes in my mind in a lot of ways is definitely a standout even though I'm not a huge fan of the featured singers vocals Wicca phase springs eternal it sort of feels like I'm listening to a less vocally achieved King cruel just go nuts all over the track however I do like that his vocals are getting a little aggressive on this song and I feel like spooky black follow suit when he hops into the song later because he's sounding more passionate than he has on any song he's done thus far at the tail end of this track I am feeling a strong five to a light six on this e.p there are a lot of things about it that I think are appealing that I think are good a few melodies here and there are a few beats here and there but at the end of the day spooky black for me continues to be just all aesthetic and not much else however I do think on this EP he's making some decisions that may actually change that his vocals are becoming a little more audible they are more engaging in memorable melodies turning up in these tracks he's writing lyrics here and there that feel kind of tasteful as of right now I see no real reason to count him out but I'm not really seeing anything to get excited or totally fall in love with either transition but what do you think of this EP do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next and then and and and and that's it Anthony Fantana spooky black leaving forever 
NFpdE2Q3khU,hi everyone fuddy-duddy no fun here the Internet's busiest music nerd some of you may know that recently slammy Jewish the resonant music newsmen over at consequence of sound made a video tagging me to be involved in the ALS ice water challenge which is essentially a challenge where I take a bucket of ice water and dump it onto my head in order to I guess spread awareness about ALS there are a lot of weird internet challenges floating around the youtubes right now a lot of which I think are completely stupid though I can't exactly say that's the case for this particular one because it is for a good cause however I don't really buy into the idea of viral internet activism especially when you're sort of doing something ridiculous in order to spread the word about something I think at the end of the day it just kind of distracts from what you're actually trying to direct attention to and makes people think more about the ridiculousness of I don't know what Martha Stewart dumping a bucket of ice water on her head and I'm not really a celebrity sort of on that Martha Stewart Tom Cruise President Obama kind of levels so throwing a bucket of ice water on my head in my personal opinion would be pretty impact lists and it's not like I'm such an internet celebrity that I think I really have the pull or the weight to kind of demand that load of other people who are more popular than myself do this ice bucket water challenge thing so instead of dumping a bucket of ice water on my head I have given 100 dollars to the ALS foundation that has started this whole ice water bucket challenge head dump thing in the first place let me just drink a fruit smoothie right now so with this decision that I have made to donate a hundred dollars I have come up with my own challenge that I will be pushing on to everyone watching this video okay if you're watching this video you're invited to this challenge but if you don't want to you don't have to it's called the donate your time or money to things you believe in challenge if you really like something whether it be a cause or a foundation that works toward fighting some kind of cancer or maybe poverty somewhere or maybe relief from some kind of tragedy in a place where you don't live or if you really love the work of a particular entertainer or entertainers on the internet or I don't know something like Public Radio then donate your time or money to it either hand them some bucks for doing what they do because you appreciate what they do and it brightens your life or volunteer for that person persons or organization to help them do what they do better or more effectively become or help aid the change that you want to see in the world all I'm doing in this video is coming forward to implore you to think about whatever you care about whatever cause you think is really important to you then do something to help that cause make the world a brighter place make it a better place for the little ones that are going to grow up and become older and most likely depressed with the state of the world if we leave it the way that it currently is Anthony Fantan oh donating helping volunteering forever [Music] [Music] 
LriAU0of3u4,oh man hi everyone Ethan II won't work over here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new fka twigs record at LP one fka twigs or as I will refer to her from now on in this video just twigs she is a UK singer-songwriter dancer producer and she has been making waves in the pop world for the past couple years with her pretty peculiar look which has grabbed the attention of many people not only in her own music videos or promotional photos but in the music videos of other artists who she has been doing backup dancing for since she was a teenager but twigs has also been turning heads with the sound of her music which is incredibly gorgeous mystical subtle psychedelic and slow-moving pop there were some pretty viral and strange tracks that built up to the release of her last EP ep to songs like water me and poppy pacify however I thought these songs and the tracks on this EP as a whole were kind of a little too ethereal and Atmospheric more than they were actual or tangible still twigs had a really interesting pop aesthetic that had me looking forward to whatever she was going to do in the future she was creating some interesting very hushed pop music with elements of R&B hip hop trip-hop twigs singing on these tracks was very whispered very quiet there were loads of weird samples and effects throughout these songs too of course this production was being brought to the table by ARCA a Venezuelan producer who's been turning a lot of heads lately with his incredibly strange production on his handful of releases he also took part in producing for Kanye's last record Jesus and a lot of people have kind of credited ARCA with helping twigs find the sound that she's currently riding on now and there are some other people in this new strain of alternative R&B artists who take part in this album as well Devante Hines does some production on here as well as Inc even though this new strain of alternative R&B records that have been coming out lately have been sort of hit or miss twigs together with a lot of people taking part in this new scene of music come together I think a hit of an album at least an artistic hit this might not be the peppiest or the most instantaneous pop record of the year but this LP showcases Twiggs most captivating material yet structurally melodically sonically the songs on this record are way more coherent I think than anything she's done in the past not just this sort of experimental smudge enos though I will say the intro tract of this record is pretty experimental though definitely sets the perfect tone for this album it's this weird combination of beautifully harmonized vocals from twigs this unruly heavenly like I'm listening to them being performed in a Cathedral or something and then this is back with some really weird twisted warped hip-hop production and sort of sour strange synthesizers this is going to be an album that will be irresistible sweet and sexy but weird as well which is essentially the second track on this LP lights on in a nutshell I love the booming upright bass notes on this track they could be synthesized but they still sound great I love the sort of light very cacophonous percussion and strange samples to help make that percussion up among these samples I think is a car alarm but still the instrumentals is very sort of soft and and kind of faint in a way everything is just so thick these productions are dense but they still manage to come off kind of gentle and tender and have a certain amount of finesse to them I actually think there are very few newcomers in pop music right now that have as much finesse are as dynamic as the vocals and the instrumentals showcased on LP one I love the haunting mantra of the chorus on this song saying that when I trust you will do it with the lights on it's such a short statement and it is said over and over in this track but it can be read into so deeply again the instrumental is so strange so colorful it's so interesting and yet the tune underneath it or rather on top of it is beautiful and catchy as well and this is also the case for the biggest single off of this record two weeks for the most part on this album twigs hangs in her upper register when she's singing but there are moments on this track of she digs into her mid range and it sounds gorgeous I also love the descending vocal melody on the bridge of this track around the 3-minute mark it's very reminiscent of like an old-school 90s R&B jam also the rising instrumentation toward the back end of this track as it progresses this song is produced to the nines some of the beats on this record are so off kilter and glitchy and have just the strangest samples it reminds me of like Vespertine Arab York which is my favorite Bjork record which is also a vibe that comes off on the song hours though I do think that is one of my least favourite tracks on this LP just because of how cluttered it feels there's the song numbers which has some very sour melodies coming through on the instrumentals at the very start but ends up very beautiful everything comes together really nicely on the end of the track and even though it is one of the more lyrically redundant songs it does have one of the more interesting and heartbroken sentiments on the entire LP sort of questioning who seems to be an ex-lover asking him was I just a number to you another person to sleep with or could number mean something else because on the song video girl we have a refrain that almost sounds like I don't know as if twigs is questioning someone about some infidelity or something like oh is that the girl from the video don't lie to me but in fact it is a song about twigs being a backup dancer in music videos and sort of being known for that but her trying to advance herself instead as a solo artist the difficulty she's had on this journey also seems to be expressed on the song give up which is in my opinion one of the better tunes on the record - but lyrically the song talks about how she's not ready to just kind of give up on her dreams because there are other people out there who might doubt her so there are some moments on this album that do feel quite autobiographical when it comes to the point at which she is at right now with her music and sonically I think she's in a really good place especially with tracks like pendulum a song that normally I would not dig tracks that are produced in this way and are so slow in tempo yet this is an amazing song it is so sluggish and yet the really tense twittering percussion on this track as well as twig singing just keep me on the edge of my seat with every bar yes there are some good tunes on this record and good performances but what's so fantastic about this thing is just the production the detail detail detail in these beats in these instrumentals my only major issue with this LP is that there are just a couple songs that pale in comparison to others whether they be ours like I said earlier that is a little too cluttered or the song closer which I think is maybe a little underwhelming Lee bare and strip back and the final track to me while it is a good tune it starts off a little disjointed but I do think it ends off very well it's not really the most immense or eventful finish to the album but still even in this album's most ok moments the beats and the productions remain to be very wondrous and pretty and for the most part imaginative I think this is a great record even though there are a lot of aspects to its singing style and its production that feel very in vogue right now I think twigs has come out ahead supremely ahead with an incredibly creative and an artful set of songs not only can twigs and her producers write good songs but they have a fantastic ear as to how these songs should sound I'm feeling a strong 82 a light 9 on this thing transition but if you've given this album a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana fka twigs LP one forever 
raY3t5Ukt4k,"hi everyone Anthony Fangio here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new mick jenkins mixtape the waters Mick Jenkins Chicago MC he's had a number of musical projects under his belt at this point but he's still so young typically mix songs take a really captivating conscious tone and this newest project of his is maybe his most conceptual yet this album is essentially about water what it does what it represents Mick brings a series of different metaphors for water to the table across this album including truth and knowledge and this water theme runs throughout this album sonically instrumentally as well there is a lot of deep-sea sub bass coming through the kicks on this literally 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea type low-frequency bass there's rattling high hats lots of very murky serene synthesizers a lot of things in the mix here just touched with a splash of reverb the drums the vocals you can essentially turn this mix tape up and feel submerged in it this is definitely not a poppy explosive or aggressive mix tape it can be a little redundant sonically with this very watery aesthetic that Mick Jenkins and his producers are shooting for on this thing admittedly it is a bit of a grower I think a lot of Mick's lyrics take a bit of time to digest in terms of wordplay and the message he's trying to get across and even though this tape addresses a lot of very urgent topics the overall feel of it is pretty relaxed the only major issue I see on this tape is it's kind of hit or miss start the intro track on this LP shipwrecked is actually not that bad it has some beautiful guest vocals an interesting beat change up toward the back end of the song Mick really goes hard with his delivery at this point in the track in a way it kind of sets the tone for this very relaxed and watery album but for anybody who was expecting this record to really come out of the gate with fire this track and sort of be like sonic ambien and I wouldn't really say Mik picks up the pace with the second track either THC which is the shortest track on the tape it feels kind of like a filler song it's really redundant with its hook constantly telling me it's going to get me high but this song really does anything but this track is more sobering than it is intoxicating there's the song healer with gene do I do like the theme the story of this track mix versus about getting together with this girl and kind of describing this romantic encounter that they have where they go out they head up the Starbucks they're having intelligent conversations so on and so forth it's nice it's sweet there's a nice sentiment to this track but I don't really care for the blase singing and sort of rapping or spoken word toward the back end of this track that gene brings to the table it reminds me of something like that kilo Kish would do this type of thing just does not do anything for me and I'm even less interested in the no-name gypsy verse on the following track comfortable it's easily the most boring feature on the entire record mix singing on the hook of this track isn't really that on point but again we do get another series of verses from him that do save the track in a sense and keep it from being completely skippable however once the tracklist gets into songs like vibe it's really smooth sailing right to the very end of the record I love the track vibe it is some sweet intoxicating jazz wrap with an amazing electric piano sample I love the line that Mick delivers on this track for the art and not the hand clap when it's clear you can call it saran wrap I also love the Jill Scott Black Thought reference on this track - and the song jazz is as beautiful as it is philosophical it's a song about the truth choosing the right life path and speaking out and throughout the track - there are references to jazz jazz artists and music but also referencing that jazz traditionally has been used as a term to talk about how people might just spout BS there's also a static selected B on black sheep which has this really quiet droning synth note in the background some sweet soulful chord / Russians and this is definitely attract that to me stands out because of just how urgent and passionate mix flow comes off I mean you don't even need to necessarily read into his lyrics to hear that he's rapping he's writing he's delivering with a lot of heart it's all in his inflection whether he is I guess sort of spinning something he feels very passionate about a bit of truth of the way that he perceives the world or even feeling kind of defeated like on the track drink more water where he's talking about how he can't afford to get his girlfriend into this open mic he performs at but somewhere across the way there is a riff raff concert where people will swarm at there's also an interesting line on this track where it's like he's addressing rappers who seem to make it but then immediately fall off artistically when your stars get chose and your bars get low when you're dull as a butter knife and can't cut I guess the only thing I'm not crazy about what this track is the hook it's a little off just the drink mo water to Cahoon sooo it's just not that catchy or exciting it's not really a I guess an interesting change of pace from the verse it kind of just kills the momentum that the song had going thus far or there's the song Canada dry again not a track that's awful but a song that I feel like mix sort of needs to work on his pacing because the tempo at which his flow and the beat on this track move just feels so mundane but the state does continue with great tracks like hydration the mine does a fantastic job on the hook of this track not only is the singing fantastic but the watery effects laid into his vocals do continue that interesting sonic concept this album brings forward Plus this track also features some of Mick's most dense and aggressive verses yet there's the song martyrs which was another single coming off this tape it's one of the slower and more dreary tracks on the project but stays enthralling because of just how grim a lot of the imagery in Mick's lyrics are and then there's the closer Jerome which is really really really the polar opposite of how the record started very serene very sweet very very quiet and subtle and now we're getting this hard ass rhythm this hard-nosed instrumental with Mick and Joey badass of proair going absolutely insane on the be lately Joey has been dropping a lot of verses where he was just yelling screaming at the top of his lungs and he continues on that hear and Mick does not look like he's going to be shown up on this track either he kind of comes with roughly the same delivery him and Joey are just like neck-and-neck and a lot of these verses in terms of their aggression however it is Joey's verse that ends up wowing me the most though I do love the song overall I love his Goodfellas and then DeNiro wordplay directly after in the next line and how he's saying he wants the dollars he wants the euro just give me this say so I love that rhyme too and that's the project for me overall I think it's really great I have to seriously recommend this mixtape to anybody who is a serious hip-hop fan in 2014 there are some tracks that pale in comparison to others and the worst of all the songs in my opinion is THC it is the shortest does get right out of the way at the beginning of the LP but the rest of the album is just full of nicely written wordy highlights maybe the sonic palette of the instrumentals on this isn't necessarily going to be everybody's style or taste but I think Mick is a very thought-provoking emcee and he's come through with a very interesting conceptual album I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this tape a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Mick Jenkins the waters forever "
XwouQHOyOQA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new underachievers record seller door terminus ex ordem underachievers is a new york-based hip hop duo this is their full-length commercial debut hopefully you've heard of these guys when they were first making waves a few years ago with their first full-length project a mixtape by the name of indigo ism a mixtape on which the two members of the underachievers is a gold and a que we're dropping a series a gauntlet of rapid-fire raps this was a free tape put out through brain feeder records which is also the label this album is coming out on and cellar-door is a concise album it's 12 tracks 40 minutes and no features outside of a very hefty sample from a portugal the man song in the very last track of this LP which essentially makes up the chorus of that song and I think the move underachievers are making with this record totally makes sense for them their last LP indigo ism was nothing if not a little overly long and I think came off a little redundant because of the overabundance of tracks that we're all touching on a lot of similar subjects like having this third eye vision and dropping acid and smoking and beast coast being Indigo's and spirituality and God and love and positive thinking there are times when it seems like the underachievers are more interested in advancing these themes than they are writing a really catchy or high-quality song or delivering a story or a narrative still there were some incredible highlights and characteristics to the underachievers and this mixtape I loved the hard-hitting attitude of this tape the gritty delivery of the rhymes is a gold fantastic flow and delivery on this tape his inflection is so insane a K's delivery though not quite as out there but very fast very focused very just down to the wire laser type accuracy when it comes to the tempo I loved the relentless flows on this tape the mystical psychedelic production and when a que is a gold really just buckled down they can write some really thought-provoking rhymes rather than just referencing the idea of being thought-provoking so I was excited I was looking forward to seeing how underachievers might grow past this tape how they might advance past it artistically promotionally even though I was a little disappointed by their last release which was a kind of underwhelming EP and the end result here on this record is is not bad I think it's a good record but I am ever so tempted to pull out that term of the euphemism of the sophomore slump yeah this is their first commercial release but it is their second full-length project and even though there are some major highlights on cellar-door this album does kind of also have the makings of a sequel that falls slightly short of expectations and the issues for me on this record they range some of them are technical I actually think in terms of sound quality this is a slightly more lo-fi and grimy your record than indigo ISM and not in an aesthetically superior way either there are a lot of moments on this project where issah and a.k have their vocals purposefully distorted and it gets sort of tiring by the end of the album not only that but this distortion makes it difficult to read some of the bars that they're spinning especially as is and a.k seem to be writing I don't know denser verses this time around it seems like more often than on indigo ISM they are writing themselves down to their very last inch of breath really straining to get those last few words out or sort of jumbling or just mashing words all together as they seem to be spinning a little bit faster than usual - unfortunately issah who is typically my favorite of the two underachievers seems to be especially guilty of this especially as he seems to finish off at the line all your tracks is born on the song sonorous or with his verse in the middle of the track for solace which I might also mention while I'm on it has a beat that sounds exactly like the beat that Mac Miller used with rick ross on his recent phases mixtape there's also Issa's first verse on the track ethereal seems to be a little woozy on the tempo as well which you can contrast directly with a Ches verse right after where he is just on that tempo like he's on a bucking bronco and just never letting go you don't even need the beat behind his voice to hear and feel the tempo you can feel the tempo directly off of his voice but with Issa as soon as the beat drops away the tempo isn't really there quite as much I don't get that sharp sense of tempo from his flow like I do from a Kay's to move on to my next issue with this LP which has more to do with structuring than it does with the recording or the technical side it's just the way it's an akr writing these songs are rather under writing them even though I think they're great rappers and I think the writing better verses on this record than they were on indigo ISM I think their rhymes are more captivating more worthy of sort of diving into and reading into here they're actually doing a better job of delivering that food-for-thought rather than just talking about it I think they're doing an injustice to these songs by delivering them without even seasoning them essentially outside of just good verses and good instrumentals there aren't really any decent intros or outros on a lot of these songs not even a decent chorus or any course at all and I know a course should not be the focus of a song with spitters at this level but still courses were one of the biggest selling points of indigo ISM aka Nessa can certainly write them really well as exemplified by tracks on that tape can on this project I would definitely rather listen to the underachievers with no chorus than some other rappers out there but still I don't think their verses are so quotable or that their songs are so conceptual that they can just completely do without them and have a winning standout captivating track songs like luminescence and nebulous to me just go on and on and on without anything incredibly gripping happening and again not to say these songs are awful there are exceptions like the opener where a K and s are just trading these mini rapid-fire verses from the beginning to the end of the track and there's also the track with kind of hits more of a mid-paced tempo the bars are way more readable the beat is sweet and melodic and jazzy has this really sharp electric piano on it even though I dig these tracks it's the song with courses that to me just have way more replay value like the nakka nakka not gonna hook on caprese which I absolutely love or the song incandescent which has that tough just gritty you a we blowin up southern hip-hop feel to it this instrumental feels like something that could have landed on a an early three 6 mafia project and I think it's one of the best and most catchy tunes uas ever put together there's the song which is one of the few tracks on here that hits a really strong concept where it's kind of about building this utopia of people that sort of buy into the philosophy that a K and s are putting forward where it's like  Fame shallow pursuits anti-hype trends pro spirituality anti ignorant there's the song Felicity which I love toward the back end of this LP an inspirational track that has a beautiful sample running throughout the instrumental and lyrically it's kind of about getting out there and creating that world we're becoming that person becoming that change that you want to see and there's the song amorphous like I said has that portugal demand sample that works is the chorus it's a really great sample it's a great beat and even though it is a little grimy it is a little underground in tone I think it's one of the Papias tracks the underachievers have ever put together and I think it's great overall I really like this project I really enjoyed it I didn't love it more than indigo ISM I actually think I'm just about liking it as much as indigo ism but for slightly different reasons are the hits as big or as infectious I don't think so but it's way more filler free and straightened to the point and I think aka Nyssa have done a better job of driving their message of bringing their message home and translating it in such a way where it comes off as captivating intelligent and kind of makes sense definitely give a listen to this tape if you want to hear some grimy underground New York hip hop it's kind of psychedelic as a positive message as a sort of otherworldly agenda and lots of rapid-fire rapping I'm given this a decent strong seven transition if you've given this record listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it underachievers cellar door forever 
Sy_7oh4_kXw,hi everyone anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Otis brown the third record the thought of you modern rhythm powerhouse Otis brown the third a drummer who has been been the rhythmic backing for many a jazz artist including the popular and Grammy award-winning Esperanza Spalding and avant-gardist like Oliver Lake this is his full-length debut LP which caught my ear mainly because Otis seems to have the same affinity as me for 50s 60s 70s era quartet quintet Trio style jazz recordings and particularly for me it is the drum sound of these records that I find to be so attractive so clear so crisp so Bumi's so close so intimate it's like I'm actually inside the drum set this is a sound this is a feeling that Brown and his co-producer Derek Hodge we're very careful to recreate it is incredibly fitting that this album is coming out in partnership with Blue Note Records one of the most notorious and important jazz labels during this era of jazz now being that Brown is a drummer and this is his album rhythm does play an incredibly pivotal role in these songs rarely do I come across a drummer that I find there playing to be expressive and and this is definitely one of those instances usually an adjective reserved for people who are playing more tonal instrumentation but there's an incredible amount of feeling in the way that Brown brings this pitter-patter percussion to the surprise cover of Shania Twain's you're still the one Otis is playing on this track is really busy but incredibly gentle there are also a few gospel renditions on this record my favorite being the one on the very end of this LP I am your song and it is amazing how Brown just enhances the rising horns and Nicky Ross's vocals is just the song grows and expands and gets louder of course there are a load of other musicians on this LP out died of braun himself for one Robert Glasper is on piano key on Harold on trumpet Ben Williams on bass John Ellis on sax Shedrick Mitchell on organ and near Felder on guitar the song choices on this LP whether they be original or covers seem to revolve around themes of family and faith and love specifically love for his wife who there is a few tributes to on this album my favorite being the beautiful wonderful instrumentation on the track the two become one weaved into these gorgeous expressive just really tear-jerking horns there is an audio clip of what seems to be somebody officiating a marriage the bass intro to the track is great Robert Glasper piano flourishes throughout the track are wonderful and the horn harmonies are just killer there's just a lot of mature familial love throughout this LP also on the three parts of the title track of this album the thought of you which features vocals from neo-soul singer Bilal which has a very jumpy nimble jagged vocal melody on the track that just sticks with me the thought of you please mine so bad now this track like I said is separated into three different songs which are spread throughout the track listing of the album the first part of these three songs being centered around bob style jam loaded with fiery trumpet solos and even though brown's band is just water tight throughout this song I guess I was a little underwhelmed by this track because it wasn't really an incredibly refreshing sound for this style of jazz and another thing that I don't really gravitate toward with this track is the fact that it is split up in such a way where like on part two it seems like we're entering the song mid jam which in fact we may be because the end of the first part seems sort of finished with the song just coming to a very slow halt as if in the middle of the track somebody just turned off the turntable maybe this second part would have been more enthralling had it been attached to the first in some way and then for the final section of this song I do dig it a little bit because it does bring a pretty significant change to the table I think Robert Glasper soloing on this track is great really melodic and complex but not too hurried or flashy tracks I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of are like the opener the way truth and life which has this really dizzying strange and angular theme melody that is really difficult to wrap my head around but still is very catchy there's some really intense sax soloing on the song punctuated by piano flourishes from Glasper Brown is playing harder as the band is playing harder almost as if he's egging them on and I love the song stages of thought which has this really ominous looming lumbering lead melody to it that I think is one of the darkest on the entire record it's a really focused fearsome Jam the bass and drum groove on this track is just nasty and then all of a sudden toward the back end of this track Brown breaks into what kind of feels like a hip-hop being Glasper complements it with these weird ascending descending sour piano notes and together this makes for something that sounds like it could come from a wu-tang record then there is the 8 minute gospel medley toward the back end of this track with vocals from Nicki Ross throughout much of these passages and this track is basically like your local Baptist Church's music program on steroids brown and company are are really not writing or delivering concise renditions of these songs in the same way that they did the Shania Twain track they are really just riffing on these tracks but still managing to muster some some really wonderful building intensity especially on tracks like we exalt thee which seems to build higher and higher and higher with every crushing blow of vocals drums and horns overall it's not a bad record in fact it is a very good and varied jazz record there are some tracks I didn't really care for as much as others and I think overall maybe the album is a tad sort of rocky in terms of its flow there are some interludes on this track as well which I don't really care for all that much and there are spots like the broken up in section title track that I don't really see playing that well in between key tracks of this LP but still if you're looking for a modern jazz record with some great composition some great improvisation and a fantastic vintage style recording then I implore to you to give this album a listen I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Otis brown the third thought of you subscribe please forever 
A4YA1ugNEaM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review the new Porter Robinson record world's this guy is a North Carolina based producer and songwriter who is dropping his full-length debut right here via astral works this year he has been making quite a bit of buzz with some of the singles to drop from this record so far like flicker and sad machine he's been grabbing ears in the wider world of pop music but already he's kind of made a name for himself in the EDM world I know he's done a mix for UKF he's also had the Spitfire EP that's dropped a few years ago which was essentially an EP of electro house tunes brostep I thought Robinson's approach to these styles of electronic music was really epic like on the title track to this thing there's this very refined building set of synth sequences that feel like they could come straight out of a sound track and the song also features one of the most chaotic drops I've ever had the pleasure of laying ears on with EDM at the top of mainstream music culture right now I would figure that Porter Robinson could just continue in this Lane continue in this genre and he would just gain fans as a result of naturally being involved in a style of music that's hot right now but instead he's decided to change up his musical style into something that I think has a bit more crossover appeal because on this LP Robinson is essentially making indie tronic music glitch pop dream pop chillwave maybe a little of that French electro house sound that was popular in the late 2000s thanks to justice this whole 2000s era of music actually seems to be incredibly important to Robinson's music just imagine the biggest names in these Styles like Passion Pit and Crystal Castles m83 justice The Naked and Famous Postal Service and Owl City washed-out Neon Indian early early MGMT imagine all of them but with bombastic EDM style drum Tambor's rocking behind them that's what Porter Robinson does on this LP it's not terrible but it's not really exciting in concept to me and it's not exciting and execution either the idea of this album being mind-blowing is like watching someone lose their over store-brand cereal or soda yes for sure at the end of the day some people might prefer honey Oh's to honey nut cheerios but nobody's coming in saying oh man those honey nut oh man they're changing the game man however I could definitely see this LP making waves in the EDM world because it presents a sound that is yet to cross over into that world but for somebody who is a fan of a lot of the artists or have merely just experienced the artists that Robinson pulls from so obviously this record isn't that thrilling to me because in my opinion he doesn't really craft these influences into anything characteristically different the glitchy swirls of synthesizers good limited that occasionally pop up in these tracks feel like they could have come out of an early Crystal Castles track the song sad machine or divinity had these buzzing loud synthesizer chords and bright peppy melodies that could have come out of any number of Owl City or m83 tracks the song years of war has a bright synthetic lead melody that could have come out of an early MGMT single and on top of that the song lion-hearted in its verses and the vocals on these verses - it actually sounds just like an early MGMT song for me this record is just a gauntlet of songs that sound a lot like other artists with the exception of maybe the back end of the LP where you get songs like sea of voices which is kind of a long spacious interlude track with just a sea of synth layers on them very ethereal and then after this track we get songs that have more of an overt EDM influence on them with those driving house beats these tracks are actually lichen and don't quite mind the final track on this LP is actually pretty gorgeous melodically but leading up to that last leg of this album the rest of this LP compositionally is pretty run-of-the-mill however that's not to say that it's inherently bad I mean Robinson seems to take quite a bit of care into recreating this stuff the production is very crisp it's lush it's clean the melodies pour through very brightly and are sticky and catchy the songs for the most part all have a very nice pace to them a very nice groove very explosive exuberant choruses and overall I do think it's a cohesive album with a pretty nice flow with the more dynamic and and gentle tracks toward the very end of the LP it's not a record that really seems to be focused on its singles or focused on creating a series of singles it has a nice conceptual flow to it Robinson definitely grabs a sound or an idea and kind of runs with it so I definitely give him kudos on trying to craft a holistic ambitious record and there are some whimsical melodies buried in the very loud EDM style production on this thing even if they are a little smothered and mostly delivered with these very cutesy female Vocaloid vocals so you're kind of getting this really cute baby pitch the cheeks of a robot kind of feel and then there are tracks like flicker which have a very nice strong funk electro groove to them and a sort of dirty grimy distorted bass line directly after there's fresh static snow which i think has an even more distorted bass line and I love that Robinson can appropriately balance these distorted harsh heavy elements with some very beautiful melodies the dude is definitely a capable producer but I think his songwriting ideas just run really thin not only were they thin at the beginning of the album where it was very apparent where all of them were coming from but by the middle point of the album it kind of gets old to hear all of these decent melodies and kind of cutesy vocals get buried underneath tons of distorted and overly compressed drums and since not only that but some of the tracks in the middle of the cell P have these faux uplifting choruses that feel like they were just crafted to pander to a group of people who get their music recommendations from like Apple product commercials so while no this is not like a god-awful album or anything like that I can't really say I'm enjoying it honestly I enjoyed his last EP so much more and I would have rather heard him follow through on that EDM style I think he was so much closer to a distinct sound going in that direction with that it feels like on this record you kind of hit the reset button because now it just kind of sounds like any other artist toying with these sounds for sure yeah his drums are louder and he's using these Vocaloid vocals more than I think most artists do playing with this style but that's not really enough for me to celebrate it or bow to it or enjoy it it's fine if you're crazy about these styles of music more than I am at least try it out Robinson has been listening so closely that he has the technical side down and like I said it's not like he's doing these styles of music and injustice it's just not anything incredibly exciting or refreshing to me in terms of the sound the songwriting which is why I'm feeling a strong five to ol eight-six on this thing transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Porter Robinson forever 
1NrTqQO-4XU,low fight a no letter from a fan hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's most hydrated music nerd and it's time for a letter from a fan as I've already said dear funfetti egg taco I have a question common thing that I would love to hear your answer on in the always so eloquent way you do since I have been following your channel for a couple years I have had a recurring question on my mind that hopefully does not break the fourth wall of your reviewing process too much simply put it is this your video descriptions say you all know this is just my opinion right so do you ever change your opinion would you ever dare express and give examples of records on which you have had an initially negative opinion but that you afterward after reviewing them have come to like or maybe love or even vice versa or are you too busy to revisit records you initially hate and you speak about the changing of opinion in critic culture thank you also for putting me on to great music such as Death Grips Milo the knife even though I'm Swedish living in Sweden love from skellefteå J F good letter thanks for sending it good question a lot of people ask me this question all the time I do make reviews on a regular basis I do review a lot of albums some people would even say our review albums very hastily I do have kind of a schedule on a pace that I like to keep up and I'm consuming a lot of music throughout the year and while I don't really make videos explicitly stating it like oh here's a single video whoa breaking news my opinion on this record totally changed this is something that I regularly and am readily able to admit whenever I do my year-end list for the most part I throughout those lifts you will find numerous albums that I may have loved or like throughout the year and they have grown on me or albums that I thought initially that would be at the top of the list maybe end up in the middle of the list or even at the bottom one record that I think I reviewed a few years ago that I don't think made on to my year-end lists even though I did review it very positively was the last Beastie Boys record and not that I ended up hating it or anything like that just it wasn't as spectacular to me after repeat listens you know from all the months between the title was released and the time I actually got around doing my lists and the reason I feel no shame and sort of admitting that is because I mean opinions are not these static things they're not written in stone they're not written in religious tomes that we are forever supposed to worship and bow down to and agree with and back necessarily for the rest of our lives perceptions are based on experience they're based on things you consume information that you take in and the more information you take in and the more experience you have the more your perception is probably going to change I just gave the new swans album a 10 out of 10 but it's not like just because I gave it a 10 out of 10 life stops right there you know I'm going to keep listening to music I'm going to keep moving along and maybe several years down the road there will be a point when I'm listening to animal ah like it said for me this is like a 10 right now maybe it's like an 8 it's like a 7 maybe it's like a 9 right now you know maybe there's even a some kind of future life path where I take it and I just hate that record down the road am I going to be bumping like Death Grips on I'm 80 maybe yeah maybe no but I guarantee even if I still am I'm probably going to have a different perception or idea as to how that music feels to me or mine or how that music interprets to me you know what sort of emotional impact it has on me is most likely going to be different when I'm 80 so you know in opinion these reviews that I do they're just like me trying to put my experience with an album down and experience that I had with an album close to the time of its release initial release date and that experience exists within a certain amount of time now currently I haven't really had a review that I've put out that I loved it but then all of a sudden I realized I completely hate it it's the worst thing in the world or an album that I hated it and I thought was the worst thing ever oh my god and then after my review I realized that it was totally for me and I loved it now of course these opinion changes happen but they usually occur prior to the review because in the midst of the review I make sure that I'm listening thoroughly I'm listening numerous times everything that's occurring is really apparent to me there's no question in terms of how I feel and what exactly about the record is making me feel that way it's not like I just come on Cameron I'm like hey this record sucks and I don't know why I just think it sucks you know I'm thinking about what a bit what it is about the record that isn't appealing to me if you're not considering what it is about an album that is making you feel that way I implore you to listen more and listen deeper and figure it out because at the end of that journey in search you might find out that what you're listening to is actually something that you like or vice versa um take the new Africa hi-tech album er new in a sense the last Africa hi-tech album when I first laid ears on that record I thought it was terrible however I didn't review it I just sort of you know let it sit let hang back I revisited it a couple times here and there and I ended up loving it and sort of when I figured out how I felt and what was making me feel that way and I felt that I could explain it and put it into words in a review then I felt right expressing myself sure initially I didn't like the record but I didn't listen deeply enough to figure out why I didn't like the album you know I knew I didn't like it but if I can't put into words why I sort of just back off from it you know because there's no worth and just at least for me anyway there's no worse than just saying something sucks and not you know further explained I guess so opinions do change of course you know and and not even just in my review capacity but there are bands throughout my history that initially I didn't dig but then later I came to enjoy and and vice versa not that I have a list hanging off the top of my head right now but the thing is there doesn't need to be a list because any bands that are on the hate list or the love list in the future could potentially switch because like I said opinions are not static things just because your opinion is one way doesn't mean it can't change in the future and just because it changed doesn't mean it changed in the right direction or the direction that it will forever be in who's to say that couldn't switch back you know or just reach some kind of middle ground where you don't love it you know hate it but it's just alright and there have been plenty of albums that I feel like have slowly made that switch maybe some records aren't so awful but they're just okay to me or maybe some records aren't amazing but they're just okay to me but I kind of feel like that's sort of the natural progression of some art as it sort of becomes really familiar to you you know and some albums I think sort of rise above that noise and sort of become records that we as the artistic community kind of come together and agree oh this is great this is sort of with withstood the test of time this is what makes great art this is what makes great music we remember this as interesting and this impacted so many artists and this is an important record of so many people I think that's great that people still today as a community come together and celebrate music and albums that they think are special however you know just remember personally you have your own perception and it's okay if your perception or your opinion does it play into that narrative you don't have to agree with every single thing the artistic community or sort of you know whoever the critics are say is a classic album from whatever year you know for sure it can be that but that doesn't mean you have to love it or follow suit or worship every single thing that the critics or people music fan at large music fans at large sort of tell you that you should so opinions are not static things my opinions change other people's opinions change okay clearly and obviously my opinions in a certain video don't change once I make a video that that opinion is out there but you know that's not me that's an expression that I made during a certain time I am a person whose mind is constantly shifting and absorbing and thinking you know that opinion is a static thing and the reason I'm happy to leave and leave an opinion up or leave a review up even if I happen to think an album grows on me or Wayne's on the end of the future is because I think that process is interesting and all that review is like I said before is just a depiction of how I felt within a certain period of time after a certain period of listens in regards to a certain album okay and I think I think reactions during this period of time and and album's release are significant they're important of course if an album continues to receive acclaim ten years down the road maybe re-reviewing it is in order because this album has somehow maintained attention it's impacted people in some kind of significant way people are still talking about it ten years post the release and you know sort of a review of an album twenty years down the road if it's still relevant might be important not just you know to sort of talk about how great the music is because even if the music is the same which it is because it's the same record it's in a different context at that point and context is so important so important in artistic reviews because the context of an album can lead you to interpret or reinterpret what it means or its significance or its sound so don't think of opinions or you know sort of perceptions on albums or any kind of art as static as still of course they change of course they shift you can't help it okay you can't help it and there are some people out there who who can't help it in a sense they sort of just put themselves into this bubble and believe that oh you know music nothing nothing since the nineties has been good man everything since the 90s has been garbage I mean of course people can maintain their opinions in that mindset because they're not exposing themselves anything new but if you continue to expose yourself to new things and take in new art and take in new ideas then your idea is there gonna change you know that's just the natural progression of things if you find a way to limit yourself and cut yourself off of new art and new ideas then yeah you're you're probably just going to stagnate you know and and then you'll surely be able to only think that this album or that artist is the best and the greatest that there ever was because you're not open to listening it to anybody else so you know if you have a healthy taste for art and you are invested in the future of art and you want to see where it's going and you want to see use coming up over the horizon and you want to see who's going to change the game next and you want to see who's going to make the best rock record or the best house single or the best rap verse or the best classical composition down the road then yeah your opinions of the stuff that you have loved up until that point are probably going to change a little bit you know you're going to have new favorites you're going to have new mind blow moments that are gonna you know cause this album that just came out to being like your top five albums of all time you know I think that's all I have to say on this so again thank you for the letter opinions change it's just the natural order don't sweat it just listen to music just enjoy it and just be along for the ride you know Anthony Fantana opinions change forever 
8p4Lcyby3ZQ,come in hey is this where the party is next door no this is not the party get out of here you stupid little early hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new partynextdoor album to party next door is the musical project of canadian R&B singer and producer Jaron Anthony breath and he has been getting a ton of buzz lately thanks to a series of song collaborations with Canadian singer songwriter and rapper Drake and of course this new partynextdoor album just like his last project is coming out through Drake's ovo sound record label it seems that Drake is no longer doing business with the infamous weekend so he's sort of reaching out there looking for other Canadian R&B artists who are shooting for a similar cavernous kind of downtrodden and sad R&B aesthetic however I can't really say that I enjoy this new partynextdoor LP any more than I enjoyed the weekend when that project first debuted you can pretty much toss this new partynextdoor record into the list of reasons that modern mainstream R&B is so incredibly dismal right now like I said partynextdoor pretty much buys into that current trend of R&B artists where they're throwing a lot of reverb on their vocals on their instrumentals it's really cavernous it's like the production needs to be a spacey and it's syrupy as possible it's like listening to something interesting slow down to the point where it's no longer interesting of course given how trendy this project sounds there is quite a bit of trap influence in the instrumentals you say trap all the time you see the word trap in every review it's like everything for you is trip well it's a really popular style of instrumental right now it's everywhere and probably the only reason you think that I say it in every review is because you only watch my reviews for trendy records listen I may be totally oblivious to the aDNA presence of trap music in today's matter that music landscape but don't act like you're above criticism you okay with that door vegetables with the vocals and the instrumentals on this record the overall sound is pretty Pleasant the only thing that really sticks out boldly in the entire track listing just like on the weekends last album is the feature that Drake does toward the back end of this album I could definitely see this record playing very gently in the background of a dimly lit party where all the party goers are really like too high to move what is truly offensive about this record is just how nondescript it is and the awful state of the singing and the songwriting on this LP brats most defining characteristic in his singing is that he's so easy to tune out he throws so many soul-sucking effects on his voice throughout this album I feel like I'm being serenaded by a horny male Siri singing over a bunch of cloud rap instrumentals the song structures on this LP bite to pretty much every track just sort of floats in inconspicuously and then just suddenly dissipates into the nothingness from which it came unless we're talking about a song like belong to the city which just finishes so abruptly that it's just like a song to nowhere it's like every aspect of this album is just not trying at all I guess moaning passably over redundant beats for three to four minutes is what qualifies as R&B now it's a genre that admittedly I have more of an affinity for its past than I do its present but still today I think the genre has some worthwhile artists who don't even begin to approach the incredibly low quality standards of the production and the singing that this album has even the lyrics I think on this record are incredibly garbage this album isn't even to me an R&B record it's just like a slowed down and some rap record and I don't mean a good rap record I mean like a trendy hedonistic I don't think about anything I'm in the club kind of rap record partynextdoor has the lyrical prowess of a southern rapper guzzle the gallon of lean and then hit the studio got you so sexy which may in fact be one of the most half-assed hooks on this entire record if a song doesn't have a really corny refrain it has a mundane storyline about a boring sexual encounter or some kind of just drama like I'm grown woman personally this record is not appealing to me but I do see the place that it sits in in mainstream music right now it's it's sex background filler pretty much if there's anything I don't get about this project personally it's why Drake and his producer have anything to do with it I mean Drake is perfectly capable of being boring on his own why he needs to sign and pay some other guy to be boring I don't know I sort of like a few instrumentals on this LP but outside of that I think the lyrics are depraved I think the vocals are incredibly underwhelming the style is completely uninteresting and not new or novel at this point this record is basically like listening to a version of The Weeknd that is way less interesting with way less virtuous vocals and much less I guess in a sense sad and depressing storylines I'm feeling a light too on this LP transition if you've given this record to listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana partynextdoor forever 
0-kjcZRAxcs,all my fridge a bright-red spoon man they're too damn bad bad nigga nigga nigga man and man and man down hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new spoon record they want my soul this is the latest full-length LP from Austin texas-based band spoon an indie slash alternative rock group who penned some of the most commercially and artistically solvent records in these genres in the 2000s albums that might not have been the most cutting-edge in rock music ever or for that time period but they were certainly loaded with catchy songs strong grooves and a really impassioned vocal delivery from frontman Burt Daniel that would have certainly resonated with people no matter what decade you placed it in records like girls can tell and kill the moonlight and gimme fiction and gah gah gah gah gah and one thing that I've always admired about spoon as they have progressed and gotten more popular and and made hit singles that did their reputation wonders they continued to deliver albums with very organic natural sounding recordings the typically warm bass the really loud clear crispy drums the thin crunchy guitars occasionally the band weaving in strings piano tambourine and even in their Poppaea SMO Minh spoon finds ways to experiment add a little bit of noise and grit to some of their recordings either that or delivering songs that are incredibly stripped back surprisingly skeletal now at this point it's been four years since the release of spoons last full-length LP transference not a high point a high watermark in their discography but not really a catastrophic disappointment either and that's the thing about spoon they've put out so many records at this point that have consistently delivered roughly the same sound with some very minor alterations here and there they're a band that I don't think is ever going to really disappoint their fanbase at least not in a boy of unpredictable glory anyway once again with this new record spoon delivers a roughly straightforward pop and rock album that has some hits and has some misses the tracklist on this thing is loaded with good singles or tracks that could potentially become singles like with the song knock knock knock which has this beat on it that has almost like a hip hop boom bap Tambor to it and then acoustic guitars are laid on top of this beat that have this really dramatic chord progression then comes in some whistling some slasher flick string sections spoon isn't always this layered on this album and throughout their discography but when they are it's great then there's the song do you a really punchy little pop rock single that has a nice little refrain to it do you it's got a nice beat to it a sweet rhythm acoustic guitars just a lean mean pop rock machine and there's some other tracks on here that sort of fit that same bill as well what is the most appealing thing about them is that they're really straightforward and accessible and sticky like the title track off of this LP the track rainy taxi resonates with me as well it's got these really water moody melodies rippling across one of the nastiest beats I've heard in an indie rock song in a while Britt delivers some really urgent lyricism on this track there's some noisy pianos scattered throughout the song too this is the kind of weird noisy instrumental studio experimentation that appeals to me on so many Beatles records and as modern as spoon sounds you can really pick up on a lot of musical quirks from that era of the 60s and 70s that that ring true in their music today like the song let me be mine which starts off with the kind of rock groover ii that led to iconic songs like Gary Glitter's rock and roll now there are some songs on this LP that don't really appeal to me that much for one reason or another for one the opening track rent I pay another song where spoon picks a groove and sticks with it nearly throughout the entire track this weird staccato cha-cha-cha and this groove gets incredibly stale by the end of the tracks very abrupt and even though the song is three minutes with how quickly the song just crumbles into dust it feels like almost half a song then there's the song inside out one of the notoriously strict back in minimal tracks in the spoon album track listing this time around however this side of spoons persona has never really Blee Blee been an incredible selling point for me there's another track on here that seems to be sort of about unrequited love and brings a lot of iral lyrics like you said you needed me like an ocean needs sand does an ocean needs sand the ocean has a lot of sand to begin with or maybe she didn't mean it like that it's moments like this where I kind of find myself nodding my head in agreement with the resounding criticism that spoon is kind of generic and that their music isn't that adventurous but for every spot on this LP that's that's like that there's a moment on here like the closer which to me instrumentally is incredibly risky for spoon has all these weird bubbling cascading synthesizer notes just blended in and what kind of sounds like a very spare and in lonely xylophone melody playing itself throughout the song - it's an interesting closer and I think kind of a brave finished this LP again spoon is just kind of a trusty band this record is nothing that really blows me away but I certainly found myself enjoying much of the LP I guess I can kind of liken this band in this record in general to like a car a really good car that you've owned for like a year and you know it's gonna start and it's going to get you to where you need to be safely I know not the most thrilling or envelope-pushing scenario in the world but I think there still should be bands out there that are just writing really concise straightforward consistent solid pop rock records with great production good instrumentation and catchy songs spoon does that hear and they do it well as many people predicted that they would given their back history I'm feeling a decent seven on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan oh spoon forever 
Io2VKXBb-X0,no fight a no album review hi everyone Anthony fan tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and really quickly here in this video because a handful of people have asked and have been asking and just sort of out of my own morbid curiosity I will be reviewing because I have checked out the new mellow hype album slash mixtape I NSA aka I need some answers these guys are a hip-hop duo Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all affiliated consisting of left-brain who mostly does production and Hadji beats who really handles the rapping side of things I've reviewed projects of theirs before the last time I reviewed them the last time I heard from them was on the 2012 record numbers I didn't really make any ifs ands or buts about that record in my review I didn't really care for it I still don't care for it so I can't say I was really anticipating that much of a positive response to this new mixtape of theirs and lo and behold that is what I got but still I do give them props on sort of changing up their sound on this new record of their something that sort of been a defining characteristic of numerous Odd Future related projects across the board whether they be they're more popular stuff or they're more obscure stuff is that there's kind of a amateurish aura to either the production quality or the rapping to the flow which can at times be sort of off it seems like in the the few years or so that mellow hype has been lying semi dormant as far as putting out new studio material they really cleaned up their act and gained quite a bit of technical skill Hadji beats flow on pretty much every song on this project is on point there's not really any spots where I'm sort of catching him off tempo or sounding lazy or sounding like you know he's just started rapping and let brains production sounds near professional quality not only in terms of sound quality but it seems like this time around he's really kind of keeping up with the trap trend that a lot of hip-hop producers are following right now so you know that's the this mixtape of theirs I can't really get down on it for any technical issues like I might have their past projects it really sounds like they've got their shit together on this new project however the end result is not really that unique or definitive honestly it seems like to me mellow hype was more definitive when they had less technical skill to show the world ironically to me this tape kind of sounds like the the average tape that you would hear put out from like a double XL freshman but like a double XL freshmen you're probably not going to remember next year or will be releasing a much more interesting project down the road if Hodgy Beats had never been affiliated with Odd Future and it for some odd reason this mixtape had gained quite a bit of hype I could actually see Haji or left-brain or just mellow hype as a project getting listed on the double XL list just nearly over this tape because of just how trendy and dime-a-dozen it kind of sounds lyrically Hodgy Beats isn't really saying anything that significant to me or even that clever or memorable and to me the production is is maybe the most interesting thing about the project left left brain does bring some pretty interesting samples to the table and being that it is mellow hype and that it is a nod future related project even though this project may sound a little trendy there are some dark tracks on here at least some dark very dark cloudy tones sort of cloud wrap tones coming from the production on these tracks so if you are looking for hip-hop that's in a bit of a darker mood this may be something that you're into but take but for me personally I'm just finding it kind of a tad generic though again I do admit uh Hodgy Beats and left brain do you seem to have up there technical skill so I mean in a way there is kind of a positive you know outlook coming from me on that there is sort of a silver lining in this dark cloud just merely based on that if they were to advance and sort of experiment a little bit and you know maybe find their sound again you know because they certainly did have a sound on their previous releases but find a way to execute it with this more top-notch rapping and top-notch production may be mellow hype will be a project that kind of breaks away from that odd future hype and kind of finds its own crowd or maybe even finds legitimacy outside of that Odd Future fan base who knows but those are my thoughts thank you for watching and let me know what you thought of this album this mixtape and I hope you have a good day Anthony Fantana Hadji beats left-brain mellow hype I need some answers forever 
mwy5YyWse4I,whoa fight a no album review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm going to very briefly talk about the new Jenny Lewis record the Voyager Jenny Lewis is a singer-songwriter songstress multi-instrumentalist mostly known for her solo work for fronting Rilo Kiley's her work with the Watson twins and I sort of have a soft spot for her stuff having enjoyed a lot of her albums throughout college so I figured I would check this new record of hers out even though there haven't been a lot of people who watch my videos requesting that I check it out sort of curious as to what I think about this album I'm sort of wondering whether or not this uh record is sort of connecting with the young audience that she once was in the 2000s right but anyway so I did give this album a listen and I guess my initial reaction and what continues to be my reaction to a slight degree even though I have this record has grown on me a little bit is a sort of utter disappointment and not the record is completely terrible I guess it's just not what I was expecting and I guess what I was expecting the sort of it was the heart-wrenching drama and the finesse that usually comes through on her work and you know III know Rilo Kiley's as far as indie pop goes in the 2000s they're definitely one of the more straightforward groups and it's not like Jenny's solo material is like incredibly avant-garde or experimental or something like that but I'm finding this new record of hers to be just disappointingly straightforward kind of commercial overly slick and subtlety strapped I'm actually finding the instrumentation on these songs to sound kind of like that of the Sheryl Crow record or something like that just not not really something that I'm all that into you know I'm into a Sheryl Crow tune or two but uh you know it's it's not really her instrumentals to me that are the selling point of her songs and and neither is that the selling point of of this new Jenny Lewis record either at least for me given that I do find the instrumental so plain a lot of the time I do find myself gravitating toward the lyrics and the tunes and really sort of diving into the melodies and a lot of the time the melodies on these tracks do lure me in are sweet are seductive are worth singing along with and you know some of the sentiments behind the lyrics as well especially on a track like the new you are kind of cute and adorable I I do think this record is kind of precious and since its huggable its lovable its likable Jenny Lewis's personality might have shifted a little bit on this LP I think it's maybe a little bit more palatable and and sugary and again I guess I guess I guess that's fine you know uh I I do think tracks on here like the opener are really nice as well in terms of lyrical content and the melody and I guess the the beat is nice as well again though it's just plainly commercial I suppose if there's one other thing aside from some of the tunes that kind of that I can kind of praise this record on though I guess it is the variety among the instrumentals and the songs themselves there are some tracks that have kind of more of a pop rock feel others that feel like a touch of alt-country then there is the song slippery slopes which stands out because it sort of has this old slow sort of sludgy heavy 90's underground rock vibe to it it feels like the instrumental is sort of inspired a little bit by either pavement or The Pixies something like that so there is a nice amount of musical sort of pop and rock stylings across this record it's not like this one monotonous tone over and over and over but I guess having heard Jenny's older I just miss the instrumental drama and just the subtlety and sort of the more organic feel of I guess her older stuff that's just personally my preference you know if you're looking for a sweet accessible easy kind of light and breezy singer-songwriter record to kind of get you through the rest of the summer then you might like this LP you know it's sweet on the ears it's it's certainly likeable there's certainly nothing edible about it I just think Jenny is kind of lost just a touch of personality in the process of making this LP and just kind of making an album that I think just about anybody who's like you know heard a singer/songwriter record that they like and come across and be like oh this is pretty good you know but that's all let me know what you think of this LP down in the comments do you love it hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Jamie Lewis the Voyager forever 
LkUQX0Gqo6Q,hi everyone coke that he cain't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Kyary Pamyu Pamyu record pika pika Fantasia this is the latest full-length LP from Japanese pop singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu otherwise known as miss kitty Kodaka muta she has been making musical waves since 2011 2012 with a series of incredibly sugary and smiley pop singles that have been paired with the cutest most cuddliest music videos known to man and kyary's production is handled by multi-instrumentalist producer and songwriter Yasutaka Nakata who has been previously known for creating music for other girl groups such as perfume or creating music within projects such as capsule but moving from these projects to Kyary Nakata's music has seen incredible international success fitting her image and her voice and her character perfectly when Nakata works with Kyary his production tends to run a little more playful colorful silly almost childlike in tone for Miki Ari's output thus far is sort of like the pop music equivalent to first laying eyes upon the inner workings of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory out of like sheesh oh he should he should cover that now I love ki Ari's last record I dug on her debut after falling in love with her last full-length album but I can't say I was really anticipating this latest LP of hers that highly are really expecting it I guess expecting it to come so quickly between the release of nanda collection and pika pika Kyary has basically been a pop workhorse releasing single and music video after single and music video it wasn't too long after the release of nonde collection that we got songs like boy tonight land and kirakira killer earlier this year one of the lead singles off of this LP though not one of my favorite singles of hers it makes me wonder what Nakata and Kyary think the future of this project is because they seem to be pumping out music so quickly and so formulaic Lee I might as well be waiting in line for a Big Mac but still this is a piece of musical fast food that I'm happy to line up for Nakata and Kyary to me are still crafting really straightforward sharp repeatable singles with sticky sweet melodies and the instrumentation across this record is diverse its peppy these songs may be really accessible but instrumentally I think they have a lot of character a lot of layers and subtlety this LP kicks off with an intro track loaded with synthesizers that feel like they're coming out of a Super Nintendo game it really starts the record off feeling like a fantasy like a celebration is about to start the intro is just nothing but balloons and cupcakes and confetti deeper into the LP we get tracks like muy tonight land one of my favorite songs on the entire record because of its rolling marching snare drums the really tense driving rhythm in the background and I love how from the chorus to the verses the instrumentation sort of changes in tone from being a little dark and kind of ominous and creepy and scary to very cheery and upbeat and sweet and of course even in the songs darkest moments it's not really that dark it's kind of like a play place sort of dark of course these musical shifts work in perfectly with the music video that goes along with this song however I find the track to be just as entertaining without any music video at all there's the song serious Satomi which is a change of pace really bombastic loud sharp drums I remember there was a track with some pretty awesome drumming on carries previous album this track seems to be filling that void this time around there's some burning guitar leads on this track as well it's really the album's honest-to-god rock song me me me me there's just an infectious melody leading up to the chorus of this track and the hook is well caught me a little off guard at first because it does kind of sound like Kyary sing shitty ass but she's really saying serious you know sis's soon sis's as it is but here again we get another pop track from Kyary and Nakata that every single part of it is sweeter than the next is a pretty multifaceted well-crafted song and moving further from here I guess we get another slight change in tone with the song ringabel I think this song has more English lyrics on it than any other track in the tracklisting and key arias theme Kyary style carries musical sound is essentially cuteness just everything is cuteness if it doesn't sound cute it doesn't make it into the music but this track seems to just overstep any line or bar Kyary has set with that so far because this is like the most excruciating ly cute and precious song I've ever heard her put out not only is the beat of this thing incredibly bouncing it's just got this wee little dudududu little melody to it but the lyrics about being happy and going to the music studio and wanting her microphone it's just those smile inducing moving from that we get some kind of delicate piano or synthesizer chords and notes on the song Koi Koi Koi this track is almost like a nighttime song it's like a the moon is in the sky and little mice wearing bowties and canes and straw hats or whatever doing a little dance together in a line that that's that's the imagery that pops into my head when I hear that song I just like that toward the back end of this LP Kyary and Nakata seem to be delivering the more delicate songs in the tracklist I feel like this album may be to a slightly higher degree than nonde collection really takes flow into account especially with the closer on here if you do remember in my nonde collection review I sort of remark that the clothes tract on that record was maybe one of the more generic tracks on the entire album and didn't really feel that much like a closer or a goodbye kind of a generally neutral song for me on the entire record however on this album the song Explorer which finishes this tracklist out it really feels like a proper ending the instrumentation has the vibe of like a marching band playing their final song overall it's a good LP it's packed with good singles it's packed with good tracks even though in a sense it might feel a little bit like a mixed bag given that Kyary hasn't really given us a break between her last album and this album and I have a feeling that that's going to happen with her next release as well she's going to continue just dropping singles as her and Nakata and her label see fit to just kind of continue striking while the iron is hot and keep her relevancy high given that this is pop music and there's a lot of competition out there right now like with her last album I do think some songs pale in comparison to others sometimes because of songwriting but mostly because of instrumentation I think the instrumentation on the capsule cover on this record tends to run a little bland to me right now Kyary is like the international queen of Japanese pop and part of the reason she's there is she has pioneered a particularly cute sound within that style within that sound they're just some tracks that don't keep up that pace as well as others and maybe feel a little typical for either Kyary or j-pop in general but thankfully there aren't so many of those tracks that it throws off the tracklisting or even makes this album even a tad unenjoyable I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition if you've given this album a listen what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Kyary Pamyu Pamyu uh car driving by forever 
orhaltpjm7s,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for my least favorite segment but I'm committing to it why you know review alright talk about a series of releases that I either didn't really care for or I just didn't have the time or make the time to do a single review of so I'm going to talk about them in brief here go into my opinion a little bit or what I perceive the flavor or the genre or the style of the music on these records to be so that possibly if it interests you more than me then you check it out or maybe some of these releases they slip past your radar and there's something that you would be into if only you had heard of it so I'm just going to give a little baby tiny mention here let's go the new braids album no coast these guys are essentially an old-school emo act who have records dating back to the 90s emo and indie rock act and I guess sort of maybe wanting to get back together just by natural natural desire to make music or maybe just by seeing the fact that there is kind of a resurgence and interest in MO and Midwest emo now they come back together and they have put together this this new record and to me it's it's actually funny I mean I've been into emo and Midwest emo for a long time however braid has not really been a band that uh I know that much about however the fact that they are coming out on these newer labels or this label that sort of specializes in this stuff now you know they're reconnecting with this new younger fanbase for this music so you know you have a lot of people who are younger now getting into their older stuff and getting into this new record too however this new record to me is about as disappointing as many newer emo and Midwest emo records are I actually went back and I listened to their older stuff after hearing about this album and found it to be pretty fantastic actually it's it's interesting that this band um has been overlooked in the way that they have been and I don't know I mean I I can't say I really like this new record to me it just sounds as bland is a lot of these newer groups however like I said it's an excuse it's a reason to check they're older stuff but if you find yourself to be a younger person or even an older person who is enjoying this resurgence and interest in the genre right now then I see no reason not to check this record out I see no reason for you not to enjoy this new album from braid the new jungle album its self-titled these guys are from the UK they are a pop soul synth funk outfit really big big songs on this record a few strong singles that a lot of people have been championing lately a lot of the songs on this record sort of remind me of gangs if you guys have heard of them if you haven't definitely check them out if you're into this jungle record but if you're in a synth funk there's better more classic stuff to check out in my opinion I happen to think that the songs aren't really that sharp aren't really that memorable nothing that people are going to be screaming about going into next year and I don't know it's it's just really the vocals that consistently I find to be pretty goofy and given that jungle is such a large group of musicians I guess I'm not finding the songs on this record to be as instrumentally lush as as I would have hoped there's just something kind of underwhelming either in the songwriting or Justin just how light the instrumentation feels on on this LP moving into now the new white lung record these guys are a punk band I believe from Canada they had a record come out in 2012 that I thought was pretty good but I didn't end up covering it or anything like that but I was anticipating their next full-length release especially since I had seen them live in between 2012 and now and thought it was a really good performance however this new LP of theirs just kind of sounds like a second-rate bar punk band from the 90s I mean just really weak songwriting all over the cell P in my example just nowhere near the level of ferocity of their past work for people who've been riding with them so far I haven't really seen a strong negative reaction to this record or anything like that I don't think this band is massively disappointing anybody but given the fact they're on a larger label with this next record I think they've kind of taken this opportunity to reach a larger audience have kind of just delivered a kind of middle-of-the-road run-of-the-mill rock and punk album which I mean it isn't as exciting as you know you're kind of larger label debut should be in my opinion but if you're looking for an underground rock record with kind of a punk flavor but maybe doesn't go to over the edge with the aggression and check this out nextly new strand of oaks record heel this album is sort of an Americana alt-country folk rock record and there are a lot of records out there like this right now if you're looking at artists like phosphorescent or Kurt Vile this is definitely in that vein in a lot of ways also of that new war on drugs record - although a lot of those artists do sort of take Americana and and bring it sort of a more atmospheric somewhat psychedelic ambiance this record far more straightforward actually I would say there's a bit of a synth pop worked into the mix - lots of Springsteen maybe a little bit of Willie Nelson here and there on some of these tracks I'm feeling an influence coming from that this is Americana and Heartland rock with a lot of grit a lot of guts it's just in your face it's no BS it's straightforward however I guess I don't find the more electronically tinged tracks on this LP to be that exciting and I'm not really enthralled with the vocals that strand of Oaks brings to the table not that they're terrible in performance but I guess I'm not really sensing a really distinct character coming out of them that would make this set of songs stand out against any other set of americana songs out there you know sometimes when I'm listening to this LP I'm just sitting here thinking I don't know I just I just sort of rather listen to Springsteen or something like that but if you're in the market for another record in this style do look into it the new Matthew David record in my world Matthew David if you don't know this guy brain feeder affiliated producer has some of the weirdest out their experimental hip hop production that you will lay ears on in some ways I think he is stranger and and more ambient in flavor than even Flying Lotus but with this new record of his he does a serious change of pace bringing a ton of vocals into the fold and not just vocals of any style but sort of a in an R&B and smooth pop soul style but he brings it over this really trippy strange production something inferior in blueprint I think could be or I think is really interesting could be really awesome but in practice I wasn't really that moved or excited by I think mostly because I don't really care for the vocals I think the way they are performed is really grating and I have tried this album on several occasions just because I like the concept of what Matthew Deere has going on but in in execution like I said I just don't really care for it but if this clash of styles appeals to you kind of want to hear you know these R&B vocals thrown on top of this really strange trippy hip-hop influenced production then do look this album up the new Sage Francis record copper gone Sage Francis seasoned vet at this point in underground hip hop music a lot of people throughout the years who might maybe in the two thousands have considered themselves backpackers we're most likely very big into Sage Francis and I do consider him a talented emcee I do think he has good flow I do think he puts a lot of heart into his lyrics however personally never really been a huge Sage Francis fan I think he comes off a little melodramatic at times especially on his more recent works such as this album there have been a lot of people who are hip-hop fans are wagging their fingers at me in the comment sections of my videos saying shame on you Anthony shame on you for not reviewing the new Sage Francis record and I'm talking about a little bit here I'm going to say if you're into underground hip hop music if you love hip hop music that really takes the lyrical element of things seriously then do look into this new Sage Francis record however for me it's just not really my style it's not really my taste I'm not saying it's inherently bad or anything like that I just don't care for my MCS coming off like every single thing they're saying is is so am or so powerful and and that is definitely a part of the appeal for Sage Francis you know it seems like everything that he's delivering has a so much emotional weight to it which is fine it's just that for me personally that kind of stuff there's a sweet spot that it needs to hit in order for me to enjoy it and this album is just maybe just slightly to the emotional side of that sweet spot though I will say there are people like sadistic and like grieves who go even farther than sage Francis you know sage Francis to me is is much more palatable next the new pains of Being Pure at heart album yeah I don't really talked about this either even though I reviewed and enjoyed their previous two LPS I mean I love the spans debut album they've recently undergone a lineup change look at Berman is still fronting the band still songwriting for the band and the record sounds fine it's maybe their cleanest record yet in terms of production but I'm not finding it to be as punchy or as immediately poppy as their last full-length album if you're into indie pop from the UK from Glasgow from the 80s and the early 90s if you're into twee pop just maybe a touch of noise pop that's more of the early stuff than it is this record I say check this album out but if you have been a fan of the pains being pure heart up until this point I mean maybe there just hasn't been enough significant change to their sound to justify this new record of theirs plus I mean being a pop and a pop rock group I don't think the singles that came out before the release of this record really did much to start a fire of interest for this new album from the band maybe it's ineffective marketing maybe it's just the singles weren't as hot as the singles from the previous releases I still think it's a solid record overall though just not as exciting of a pop experience as their previous LPS next the new 68 album this is a noise rock album a post hardcore album these guys are essentially a new group from Josh skogen of the chariot and Norma Jean and even though there are some elements of this record that I like it's loud as hell it's distorted at times some of the songs on here remind me of a Nirvana a little but for a noise rock record even though it is abrasive I do like my noise rock to just sound in performance a little more chaotic a little more just bursting at the seams like it's barely in control of itself the recording here is just maybe a little too tight and just down sort of like an every time I die album which is not surprising given the connection this band has to the chariot next the new bleachers record this guy's essentially the guitarist from the band fun a band who's newer output I haven't really cared for all that much though it has earned them a lot of commercial success and this solo record this solo may be one-off project you know who knows maybe there'll be a another bleachers record down the road I do understand this project has seen some commercial success I do think this is the most commercially successful project this guitarist has had outside of fun but I guess what I'm getting down to what this album is that it just kind of sounds like an old New Wave record from the 80s or just an 80s era rock record which I do understand is is kind of the point of this project for him to indulge in that style in this era of music obviously but does he put his own spin on it or anything that kind of just makes me think of him carving out his own niche in the style not really you know and aside from some of the lead singles off of this LP like I want to get better I'm not really gravitating toward any of the songs on on this LP and but still you know it's it's it's not really a slight against those singles just a slight against this album as a whole as far as those singles go like I want to get better I think they're great singles if you could only manage a drum up 10 tracks that are as electrifying and as magnetic as I want to get better I can see bleachers being a pop project to reckon with and finally I will mention the new Big Freedia record Big Freedia she's I guess an emcee and purveyors sort of a pioneer in the New Orleans bounce music scene one of the bigger names out there right now and so big that she can essentially go across the country touring and performing without releasing a new album of tracks in I think over a decade I think this is her first full-length LP in over a decade and I mean it's not a bad mix of tracks it's not anything I mean even her older stuff though it's not anything I would listen to just kind of sitting here with headphones or anything like that it's more music for a live setting which is fine and I think the newer production on this record actually fits that context even better because it's louder it hits harder it's more bombastic I think this is the new set of songs that Big Freedia kind of needed for that live setting to break things up and just offer people something new when they go out to see her and that's pretty much the y-you know review for this month what did you think of these records mmm transition you're you're the best I got in this video right now cuz I gotta go to the bathroom you're the best I love you forever 
OULrYmWzjo0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's in most pain music nerd and it's time for me to talk about some of my favorite records of July because it's like the last video that I made like this wasn't really a June video or anything like that it was more of a hey these are my favorite records for the first half of the year sort of thing there are a few records here that came out in that first half in this list but I just thought I would remind you guys put it down there in the description box as well with the last video I didn't mention my favorite songs of June so I will be taking some of my favorite songs of June I will be taking some of my favorite songs of July and throwing either a list or a link down in the description box where you can see that list of songs from this past few months that I liked or maybe sort of an updated list of my favorite songs of this year thus far off of the needle drop calm cool cool let's start with my favorite LPS or EPS or just full-length releases one Neil Cece Harris mouth sounds and mouths silence these are two sister amazing insane boundary genre envelope-pushing mashup albums that are incredibly fun a lot of people have said to me oh Anthony why don't you leave me alone how come you're making a big deal out of these records how come you talking about these records how come this album you gave it our score than Jesus well it's because it's not like there's just one kind of entertainment in the world you know as much as I do take music very seriously it's not like I like every album I ever listened to to be like serious right now this is saddled this is angry oh I like super sad angry back sometimes I like music that you know puts a smile on my face or might be a little silly and I think this album takes silliness and execute sit-in a very surprising creative interesting and unique way so if you want to have some fun and not sit there all the time like sure then give these sister mashup albums a listen because they're funny and they're entertaining okay okay next another fun entertaining poppy record the new la brew album trouble in paradise even though it does end off with a very weak finishing track I do think the vintage style synth-pop New Wave production on this thing is done very well and the songs are really catchy they're sweet they're well-written and they're accessible I think this is all around a good album a good follow-up to Lara's debut LP albeit maybe a little less radio friendly excuse me I am completely disgusting alright next the new panopticon's record roads to the north this is American black metal with elements of folk music bluegrass all country music weaved into these long epic songs or sort of getting their own little tiny songs that sort of break up these larger more epic tracks it is a pretty diverse album and is all constructed from what I understand by one single person really tight just flurries relentless drums on this record great great great guitar compositions and on top of it a little woodwind little strings some banjo on this thing too it's just got some diverse instrumentation on these tracks it's just such an intense long listen really an epic record one of the more epic metal records I've heard this year this next record comes from a metal band but it is not it is not a metal record it is the new wolves and the throne-room album celestite what could potentially be the sister album to their last full-length LP which has a similar length in runtime and has a similar title but this album itself is in sort of an ambien record sort of a progressive synthesizer record and a bit of worked in there too okay just a bit of heavy heavy drone walls of guitar drone occasionally on these tracks as well it's an interesting change of pace for wolves in the throne room and for this genre I think it's a good record and also I want to give a sort of riche out out because they didn't make it into my favourites of 2014 so far though the first of these two records is certainly grown on me since I did put out that video first open mike eagle dark comedy if you're looking for some alternative hip-hop with just really funny clever messages and some interesting thumb attic songs then do look up this open mike eagle album open mic to me is just an MC who is ahead of the curve in a lot of ways he was doing this art rap thing before it was a trend and he's got a lot to say he's a thoughtful guy and he delivers his thoughts eloquently and hilariously in many of the songs on this record and comedian Hannibal Buress actually does a feature on this thing too and I think it's one of the best features of the good production as well and also apathy is Connecticut casual this dude is a Connecticut based MC pretty much boom-bap flavor on this record he is a total old-school err in style and delivery and it shows and I think what also makes him an old-school MC is that he really cares about storytelling he cares about themes he cares about concepts going into his songs and he goes into nearly every single song here with a concept with an idea that carries throughout the duration of the track and it just it just leads to a lot of top-notch songs even though this isn't the most cutting edge sound in hip-hop it's just a good solid album and it's pretty much it he's my favorite records of the past month or so cool cool transition what have your fear records of July been let me know do the best I hope you have a good day and maybe a subscribe I love you Anthony Fantana favorites forever 
w5Ukeqt65hA,well hi friends Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a vinyl update where I just talk about some recent additions to the old vinyl collection you can find a link down there in the description where you can watch previous vinyl videos basically see from A to Z everything that is in this case back here this shelving ok alright so these recent additions have about a about a dozen records here to show you and just sort of talk about a little bit recommend to you if you're into a certain sound or style and this first one is a recent release and a recent addition as these all are but the new clipping just with all the vowels taken out the title of the album on Sub Pop Records if you're looking for some experimental noise hop then I would look into this record I reviewed it earlier this year it is definitely gonna be one of my favorite albums and good packaging with this record I believe this is an early sort of like an initial pressing of the record I think what Sub Pop might call the the looser edition maybe I'm wrong but it did come with a an additional 7 inch which includes a version of one of the tracks off of this record I believe the song ends but featuring drums from Brian Chippendale of lightning bolt cool so you know we have ends on side a and this isn't side B Brian actually did not listen to the 7-inch yet but the vinyl itself sounds great and is packed into some very nice very gritty sleeving the clipping logo from the mid-city album right here descriptions of the songs doesn't look like there's any lyrics laid into this or anything but it does say who's featured on certain tracks who bring certain sounds to the table such as a derrick basic Estrada bring these scratches on the song summertime and is white vinyl with a distance very very very subtle darker colors maybe there are more chaotic pressings of this record where you know you do get a stronger contrast between the white colors and the black colors mixed in the vinyl itself but it's it's it's very subtle coloring on this pressing the second LP you know essentially looking the same but this is not just a gatefold but like a three-panel gatefold what do you double check out the microphone over here BAM just double checking making sure that the sound is on we're doing it wrong you have picture of the members of clipping that's nice glossy pictures too they look great the the material this is printed on feels like um mat you know or just like plain it's not glossy but uh what's printed on it like the the chain-link fence here does actually a shine it's very nice pressing it's very very nice packaging I love it I love the packaging on this record if if you are into that album it's just all the more incentive to pick it up because the packaging is so nice alright this next one is a deluxe edition of one of my favorite Beck records have mentioned on numerous occasions that this is one my favorite Beck records it's not my favorite Beck record one foot in the grave you may be familiar with Beck's folk and singer-songwriter side but if you have not heard this record this is definitely a different approach to that this is more like a full Punk freak folk noise folk record with some very very rough rough recordings we essentially have one LP of the original album itself and a second LP which I have not listened to of like b-sides and extras I'm actually sort of sitting here wondering why I haven't listened to it yet but a song if you have have heard record once I'd be dude yeah if you have heard this original album then you know what's on it but as far as the the unreleased tracks the second record we have tracks like it's all in your mind whiskey can-can mattress woe on me teenage wastebasket your love is weird favorite nerve piss on the door close to God sweet Satan burning boyfriend Black Lake morning feather in your cap one foot in the grave teenage wastebasket I get lonesome we obviously have some of these tracks being versions of songs that are on the first record over here but uh but still you know if you if you are interested in this and this is one of your favorite releases from Beck just a whole album of unreleased tracks alone you know makes worth makes it worth it to pick up this deluxe version and you know like I said I have played the first record and the vinyl sounds great it's a nice thick heavy pressing this next one is also a personal favorite of mine a personal favourite of mine in the progressive synth genre but this is the first time to actually run across a in good condition used copy of this album for just a few bucks jean michel jars oxygen picture of him on the back if you're into old-school synthesizer music soundtrack music i would look this album up you know uh looks like it was pressed back around when it originally came out and the was this early 80s or late 70s says 1976 although i have not verified whether or not that's when this actual pressing came out it could have been a press a little bit later though I'm not seeing any markings on the labeling itself signifying that it's a later pressing but um but yeah this is an incredibly good condition considering the time it came out but I think there is a bit of a nub cut out right here which if you are into records usually signifies that this might have been a radio station copy or something like that which might explain as to why it was not a it doesn't look like it been played that much alright this next one this is just one of those buys where it's a dollar and you just you see the cover and you're just like yeah that you know that needs to be in my record collection it is the come out cruise free gay and happy I think it's no surprise that this is like a errol dance track like a house track from that sounds like it came out of the late 80s Early 90s let me just verify that yeah I'm not finding a year on the back of this thing but it's just it's a really uppity dance track with a pretty peppy hook free which show we have a phone number on here to wonder if that's still uh working yeah and we just have the song itself free gay and happy from the come out crew along with a few remixes of the song itself like I said totally sounds like it came out maybe 90 to 93 maybe like late 90s but you know like late 90s I guess at the latest you know I can't see this coming out like in the year 2000 and you know if that is when it come out maybe if that is when it came out maybe that could sort of explain why I didn't do too well but it's it just sounds like a lot of songs that came out back then but I do think though you know I don't have much eurodance in in in my collection as many of you may know although this is another dance record that has been a personal favorite of mine but this is a used copy the records look like they're in great condition there's no coroner's cutoff does not look like it was a radio copy or anything like that we have a Daft Punk's homework just the first time running across a right vinyl condition right price it was like 20 bucks and I'm like hell yeah why not you know I'd love a lot of tracks off of this this is the predecessor to discovery a lot of great tracks off of this thing including around the world a lot of their great early singles and I love the packaging on this thing I mean it's real glossy but the pictures are great and the sleeves themselves say each track and sort of have like a little square single looking picture for each song what no masks whoa so there you go Daft Punk homework happy to find a great copy of that just sitting around and I don't know if you saw it initially I don't think I mentioned it but a the other patch on the front here is like raised it's not like you know just some flat surface it's like a raised printing of this and that's awesome this next one is another recent release also has kind of a radius thing on the front you have seen me review this Swann's to be kind spare mental rock post rock noise rock all the babies collect all the babies baby back there too glossy babies too and basically aside from three LPS you get three LPS six sides in total we also get there's a nifty little poster of all the babies oh the babies add a lot of a wolf and basically just sitting in the middle here of this three panel this epic three panel gatefold we just have whiner notes lyrics and all that good stuff just a nice heavy 3lp pressing of this album to complement the fact that it is a huge record all right now with this next couple of records they are metal records because I just figured during this particular visit to the record store I would just go all out and just supplement the metal section the amount of metal records in my collection and if you are looking to get into metal music just in general I would recommend adding any of these records to your collection though I do think maybe a few of them are just a little little deep not deep like oh man it's too deep for you it's like maybe a little too deep into the genre like if you're not in the metal at all maybe you should start with groups like Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden or there's some of the early do max from the 70s and very early 80s this might be just going a little too much but you know if you are willing to take the plunge then I recommend trying out the merciful fate record don't break the oath these guys are a heavy metal act and I and I will say that this this may not be for everybody and not even every metal fan this is a repressing of this record and even though it is great heavy metal music really top-notch soloing great songwriting the lead vocals of King Diamond are not everybody's cup of tea they're not everybody's cup of tea they are even something that it took a little bit it took a few lessons for me to appreciate not of this record specifically I already knew what I was getting into when I got this record I knew I was gonna like this when I was getting into it but um his singing style and and it's it's not your typical at least for today metal vocal you know it's it's not growling or screaming or anything like that it's very much it's it's it's it's a very specific thing but if you do find yourself into bands like ghost for example I could see you getting into this and in all the lyrics all the songs very very a cult a lot of it is uh satanic in theme it's very campy it's very theatrical in in my opinion King Diamond one of the kings of metal camp so and and it in my opinion doesn't really ruin the record or anything like that it's it's just very theatrical there's a lot of theatrics um I would show you but it is sitting on the the record player right now I was just listening to this album but it is a clear beautiful clear orange pressing it is it is a nice thick record it's beautiful orange it's like I said a repressing off of Metal Blade Records alright this next one Judas Priest can't really go wrong with the screaming for vengeance there's actually a sticker on this but this is not what I paid for it but yeah screaming for vengeance one of their early eighties records one of their more hit more well-known songs on this LP you've got another thing coming so if you're looking for some British early 80s heavy metal and this one was not a repressing this one was used then do look this album up Columbia Records really badass leather-clad picture of the band rat they're looking real looking real tough what's this what's this in here I actually didn't like dig too deep into this yet oh that's funny oh my god oh my god this is a little uh but it smells old it smells old it it looks like just just like a little huh it just looks like a little merchandise purchase card you mail it somewhere and then you just say which of this stuff you want to buy merchandise offer from an unknown land and distant skies t-shirts ten bucks whoa $1 each for shipping and handling for these t-shirts baseball jerseys well you get baseball jersey sleeveless t-shirts sweatshirts ladies tops can't forget the ladies baseball cap patch sticker buttons wristbands badges gold pins programs from concerts and poster for bucks for the poster man wristbands says says wristbands are 14 bucks plus one dollar each for shipping and handling sticker two bucks for sticker yeah basically you just put your order down here send it in merchandise comes your way that's how we did it ladies and gentlemen before the Internet we had little catalogs or these cards that were sent to you either by the band themselves or a small punk independent label that you were buying stuff from and you would look at the catalog be like oh that this stuff is relevant to my interest I will check all this stuff off send a check in the mail and then the merchandise comes back your way we will not be getting a score card or a merch card in this pressing however because this is a repressing of one of the biggest albums from the big four of thrash metal Slayer Metallica anthrax and Megadeth Slayer rain and blood if you want to hear one of the best thrash metal records one of the heaviest hardest most commercially successful thrash metal records ever don't listen to this record on American Recordings infamous for being Rick Rubin's record label nice labeling classic American labeling heavy pressing and we have the logo lyric sheet it's not a gatefold or anything like that fairly straightforward packaging still good repressing packaging all the same Oh having trouble having trouble bear with me we're doing it wrong we're doing it wrong bear with me okay there we go Oh wonderful picture of the band on the back here's another trio of badass dudes Motorhead's Ace of Spades pretty much the must hear like Motorhead record if you're gonna try out Motorhead you never tried out Motorhead before then listen to Ace of Spades let me in the game I've been totally badass on the front again this is another album I've heard before and knew what I was getting into but I just saw the vinyl and I was like fairly straightforward packaging again nothing too fantastic about that but you know with a lot of these records you don't really need a lot of flash or anything like that because essentially with a lot of this older stuff you are paying to hear an analogue physical representation of an analogue recording you know it's not like they're taking an analogue recording and I'm buying mp3s of it or somebody recorded their album digitally and I am buying an analogue version of their digital album this is analog analog you know this is this is the way this kind of stuff was meant to be heard you know and finally another repressing this is a new version of this record as well deaths symbolic this is definitely a first record to try out or one of the first records that you can definitely try out or get into if you're trying to explore the genre of death metal alright these guys are technical throughout point productions good the performances are great I made a video recently for another YouTube channel that I can link you guys to down in the description where I give recommendations for five death metal records if you're sort of getting into the genre of death and again fairly straightforward packaging we got lyrics there pictures of the band there with thank yous and all that good stuff Jean and Chuck seem to be thanking a lot more people than Bobby and Kelly but they're just they're just a little more thankful and we have the the credits and everything like that engineered by Jim Morris co-produced by suction the vocalist and guitarist of death yeah we also have their sponsors they only use Marshall amps and cabinets there you go as if there was a question and good labeling as well deadly red yeah and that's it that's it for this vinyl update cool cool we're gonna leave it at that and we did it raw we did it wrong ladies and gentlemen vinyl music blah transition subscribe down there come on come on Brett 
O5WQNBn9q8g,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new common album nobody's smiling camon more like come and get a better name I hate couch' chesta and I wish he was dead I wish God if there was a god that he or she would come down with a lightning bolt of justice and just strike him in the face and long after I'm dead he's still gonna be around in in a disgusting display of evil always triumphing over good common is a famed Chicago MC and actor and a poet in the truest sense of the word and in my opinion one of hip-hop's true hippies in a good way if you're ever in the mood for some classic thought-provoking Midwest hip hop do give albums like resurrection and one day it'll all make sense a listen this guy's career started in the 90s during this decade he dropped some really good features with De La Soul as well as the roots as he progressed into the 2000s he would work with black star as well as Kanye West who has produced for his albums on numerous occasions and into the 2000s his artistic momentum seemed to carry on as well with really great albums like water for chocolate and B which was his inaugural album for Kanye West's GOOD Music label a label that he has been on ever since with the exception of his last full-length LP the dreamer the believer which in my opinion was one of Commons least memorable albums in years even though it sort of did mark a new era of his career plus it was not really marketed or promoted that well I think this album was dropped like five days before Christmas which is maybe one of the worst times you can put out a commercial record and the singles off of this LP weren't even really that sticky or controversial or hot more people were talking about common subliminal beef with Drake at the time then they were the music on this record with this new record of his however I am sensing a little bit more of a commotion around this new stuff though I do still think common might be in the midst of an artistic dry spell that I think he's been in ever since the album universal mind control with tracks like make my day and sex for sugar I think this album has some of his worst songs ever on it a lot of Commons fans might not be head over heels for an album like finding forever but I find this record to be way more interesting and eclectic than the more commercial stuff he's been putting out lately yeah I do like albums like water for chocolate as well as B but I also admire some of Commons more left-field releases like Electric Circus where you get hints of not only hip hop but rock and soul and pop music plus there are a ton of interesting features on this record common being one of the first big-name rappers to sort of bridge that hip-hop indie gap allowing somebody like laticious Adair onto his record now like I said 2011 and the dreamer the believer sort of marked a new era for Commons career with this last release of his I feel like we're kind of getting the story and the mindset of an aging old schooler who's kind of embracing his home and celebrating his untouchable spot in hip hop history though there are moments on this record where I do feel like Kamen might be coming off in a way where it just feels like he's trying a little too hard to be aggressive or badass sort of like on the song sweet which i think is absolutely crazy truthfully I'm enjoying Commons flow and his lyrical content a lot more on this latest LP of his nobody's smiling but I can't say I'm really enjoying it more than the dreamer the believer because it brings a host of entirely different issues to the table now for sure there are some serious highlights on the cell peace songs that I think are great but they just happen to occur at the very beginning and the very end of the album there's the track the neighborhood where Kamen delivers a bunch of grimy sobering Street centric lines that seem really dismal there's a lot of violence referenced in the way a lot of lost hope people just getting caught in the violence of this concrete jungle and this is the type of song that I would expect from an album titled nobody's smiling given that common is from Chicago and has given an album cover that looks like this the instrumental is fantastic on this thing I love the strings weaved into this beat and there is a fantastic feature from little herb on this track to check out his faisal lanin mixtape that dropped earlier this year that I've given a review and did like these same lyrical themes Landover a much more ominous and and quiet subtle beat on the song no fear right after and then we have the song kingdom with vince staples another good feature on this record and it's a conceptual track it's a theme track about somebody who is young growing up in a violent city and trying to find solace in God in religion but having a difficult time relating paying attention finding value in this because it's so hard to survive in this violent urban setting in my opinion these are great tracks so good that there's there's really no reason to lose faith in common as he is aging in his rap career he could still write really coherent interesting captivating songs but he doesn't keep this consistency up throughout the middle of the record there's the song diamonds which could have been a quality track but Big Shot is featured on this song and delivers one of the worst features I've heard this year he basically moseys on in into the song of a hip hop legend and moans and ad-libs ridiculously in between Commons verses common should not have allowed this Big Sean should not have done it everyone should have known better then there's the song black magic which I enjoy lyrically but it has one of the most obnoxious instrumentals on the entire LP black magic black magic black magic and the song speak my piece maybe one of my least favorite tracks lyrically it's just sort of a bunch of forgettable braggadocio from common not that I don't want him to brag when he does see success but it's not like it's that much of a thrill to hear him rap about his spot in the hip-hop industry right now especially when you have people like jay-z who are a little more riveting with it Plus Commons bars kind of stop halfway into the track and the rest of the song from the halfway point is just the instrumental they've been playing through the first half but it just kind of carries the song out until the next song decides to play this same week structuring hurts the title track on this album as well I do like the lines the verse that common brings on the first half of the song he delivers more lines that give a vivid portrayal of the social darkness that Chicago is moving through right now but after that we get a really long-winded and sort of uninteresting spoken word piece from Malik Yusef that really cools the heat down that the song had been bringing thus far it seems like common gets things going and either doesn't really finish off a song or just kind of hands it off to a feature that isn't as good as common I feel like this is one of his most padded out albums in a while as far as features aside from Vince staples and little herb I think the only other feature that I liked was drusy on the song hustle harder which does have kind of a ridiculous hook that makes me cringe a little bit but the song is about a woman who hustles hard she's independent she's badass I like Commons verse I like jay-z's verse even if her delivery seems a little too nicki minaj inspired at least on this particular song i've heard other songs of hers and on other tracks she sounds much more in line with a lot of the other Chicago rappers the young Chicago rappers that are coming up right now sort of like Chief Keef and little Reese King Louie little herb overall this this album is okay they're just so many either underwhelming or utterly disappointing tracks through out the middle of the tracklist and what's even more alarming or worrying is that there are two tracks in the bonus edition of this album that are loads better than the songs that actually landed on the standard edition of this record for one the song seven deadly sins it could have fit right after the song kingdom and would have played beautifully into this religious theme that that song displays it's got a great beat I love how common play is on these different seven deadly sins in his lyrics and it's a common solo track you don't have anybody else coming in and interrupting the song and stealing the spotlight and then there's the song out on bond with Vince staples maybe it's a little redundant given that Vince staples is already on the standard edition of the record but it's still a better track than say diamonds or real this is an alright album from common I like a lot of the tracks off of it and even though they didn't make it onto the standard edition I do have just really strong feelings for some of these bonus tracks I think Commons started well with this record I think he ended well with this record especially with her wine that which is a beautiful song that sort of reflects upon his time in the hip hop industry creating music with different people one verse specifically centering around J Dilla the time when he was making music with him when he received beats from him sort of seeing him pass away before his eyes it's really moving part of this record even if this song was not about J Dilla this would be an amazing track simply because Kamen gives such a personal recollection of the life of a very close friend who is not around anymore if this kind of consistency if this kind of heart-wrenching storytelling continued throughout this record I could see it being a total winner and a standout in his discography but instead we get filler we get moments like Big Sean on diamonds that couldn't be worse for the album's flow I'm feeling hail I six on this LP transition if you given this thing a listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantan Oh common nobody's smiling forever 
cLgarIGTAe0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of two albums or projects from Neil's mouth sounds and mouth silence Neil Simon gay net good name for your band that's like his name that's like his real that's like his real-life human name net a good name for your son I hate how to chesta Neil is a boston-based producer singer songwriter keyboardist he has other insane musical projects like lemon demon and you might also know him if you are a Harry Potter fan because he is the creator of the Harry Potter Puppet Pals web show he's a youtuber he's a musician he's a tumblr he's truly an artist of the Internet age but here in this review I'm talking about two recent musical projects of his mash up projects remix projects by the names of mouth silence and mouth sounds mouth silence being more recently released but is said to be a prequel to mouth sounds I've never really heard of a musical prequel to an album but there you go on these sister mashup albums neil is essentially taking songs that are pre-existing editing them or taking particular parts out of them and fusing them with pieces of other songs and he is taking some serious compositional liberties in the process not only editing pitch shifting or just altering the melody of the songs that he's re mixing we're mashing up but at times adding original keyboards into the mix or sometimes it seems that he doesn't even need to do that and finds tracks that have common ground that I don't even think the most hardcore of music fans thought that they had and then there's a third group of tracks on this LP where there's not really that much common ground Neal seems to know that yet he puts these two songs together anyway and it sounds like garbage there are some offenses on these mashup albums that are musical but I think Neil's biggest defenses are to the sensibilities I cannot imagine a mainstream music fan a fan of some of the songs that Neal remixes and mashes up sitting through some of the weirder parts on this record and simultaneously people who are serious music fans that might be a little bit of a snob you might be into the experimentation and the oddity of these two remix albums but sitting through them will mean listening to numerous renditions of smash mouths all-star there's like an industrially tinged Nine Inch Nails style version of all-star on this record Neal fuses all start together with a pitch shifted sample of the full house theme song he also fuses Daft Punk's better harder faster harder better stronger with walking on the Sun he also puts all-star perfectly over the piano chords from John Lennon's Imagine Neil essentially on mouth sounds treats Smash Mouth like a big awful musical meme at its roots the concept of what Neal is doing isn't altogether new I mean in the Internet age we have been exposed to many a mash-up from mashup artists such as Girl Talk or the hood internet or kids and explosions or Danger Mouse but Neil's combination of songs on these records are so surprising and sometimes so sickening I doubt you will find two mashup albums that will elicit as many emotions as these two will and and strong emotions at that from pure bliss and enjoy ability to disgust to hilarity as mouth sounds starts we get this foe a cappella rendition with samples coming from smash mouths all-star specifically the part where the word sum is sung right at the beginning of the track and basically this sample is turned into its own unique original epic melody to kick the entire record off some some sense and some sense of and then the begins a smashmouth mashup that i did not tell you about and i didn't tell you about because it's scary in cakes the iconic rhythm guitar from the modest mouse song float on and then unsuspectingly over it comes somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me and the song fits perfectly over float on neil at least to my ears does not need to make any melodic adjustments whatsoever through the chorus through the bridge of the song the Smash Mouth whistle from all-star comes through and fits over the track it's pure insanity and then deeper into the record comes a mash-up of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean and Nirvana's smells like teen spirit which worked together really well with maybe the exception of the rhythm guitar from the Nirvana song which doesn't seem to perfectly lock in with the groove of the bassline and the backing beat from Billie Jean and then we get Loverboy's working for the weekend mash together with Smashing Pumpkins bullet with the butterfly wings and we get yet another perfect marriage of two songs that most music fans would assume come from very different places and then there are tracks that just mashed up sound inexcusably terrible there is the Black Eyed Peas with imma be pulled together with let it be and it just sounds awful I'm not even really sure if some of the synth melodies from i'ma be work mono melodically and then there is sexual Lion King where we get can you feel the love tonight bunched together with sexual healing the groove in the bassline and the rhythm guitar from sexual healing and even if there is some melodic common ground between Elton John's voice and the sexual healing groove the key that that groove is in Elton John singing really sounds so much better with the strings from can you feel the love tonight sort of supporting his vocals and there are some tracks on these two records that really aren't as much mashups as they are really weird pop-culture references like the song furries which takes the backing beat and guitar and the up from the Hanson song Bob and then throws Jimi Hendrix's foxy lady lead vocals on top of that that in the lead guitars and the soloing that work into foxy lady actually pair together pretty well with the Bott backing beat but Hendrix vocals are edited to kind of reference furry love with a bunch of vocal cuts at the beginning of the track that reference furries and furry culture and there we have Hendrix singing deeper into the track excuse me while I kiss this Fox it is some serious rock god blasphemy there's also tracks like pokemons where essentially we get against the Jackson 5's ABC instrumental a bunch of vocal cuts and snippets and references of news organizations and even Herman Cain talking about Pokemon but there is one pop-culture reference that rules them all on mouth sounds that I think is absolutely gorgeous beautiful and moving it is a remix of the Tay Zonday song Chocolate Rain where Neal take stays lead vocals samples them and basically uses these samples to create sort of a slinky cascading echoed backdrop of all these robotic manipulated Tay Zonday voices backing him up and the end result is really grandiose and actually puts on display the inner beauty of Chocolate Rain Chuck couldn't read and much of what I'd mentioned in this review thus far only comes off the mouth sounds album there is still yet the mouth silence album and both of these mashup records are about an hour long now for you anti Smash Mouth people out there this record does not really contain much in the way of Smash Mouth so if you want to avoid all of the all-star remixes then you should maybe just go straight to mouth silence but I will say on mouth silence that there is more Third Eye Blind Neal takes the do to do do did it do from semi charred life and creates sort of like what he did with all-star at the intro to mouth sounds on mouth silence he creates a really beautiful actually gorgeous intro where it's just very very blissful and these vocals are sort of pitch shifted and stretched out and really create this wonderful ascending rising action of chorus vocals it's really heavenly and then right beyond that we get this insane fusion of rollercoaster of love from The Ohio Players bass guitar rhythm guitar drums and the vocals from Nine Inch Nails closer and what's even funnier is when when Trent gets to the iconic line if I want to fuck you like an animal Neil totally edits fuck you out and then throws in a vocal cut from a classic funk tracks oh you'll get Trent singing I wanna and then you'll get Berger like in anima this is sort of swapped out for other samples deeper into the track like I wanna funk you there's a fusion of Elton John's Crocodile Rock and system of a Down's Chop Suey and it feels like Neil at least to my ears has altered surges vocal melody a little bit to make it fit in with this Elton John track and it works beautifully well and then Neil puts together the score the theme the string theme from psycho the movie psycho with the b-52s Love Shack just the vocals you're getting just the vocals in just the strings and um it's a completely unexpected mashup and combination and the end result is frightening it actually makes the lead vocals from Love Shack sound absolutely insane and creepy and given the plot of the movie psycho it actually brings new meaning to the song Love Shack we also get REM s it's the end of the world and Billy Joel's we didn't start the fire just the vocals of each track thrown on top of one another and it's actually really interesting my stipe and billy joel actually sort of hit the same vocal tempo and pace on these two songs and melodically they seem to have a lot in common as well and Neil actually throws a bit of a polka type bassline behind these two vocals getting mashed up and it just kind of works but maybe my favorite mashup deep into this record toward the back end of this record comes on the song numbers where essentially we get a lot of samples from various pop tunes one of them being cakes and ever there and carly Rae Jepsen's call me maybe we're getting a lot of samples having to do with calling phone numbers even no Doubt's spider webs makes it into the mix too and this really funny vocal cut of Corey Haim and Corey Feldman giving their numbers away to girls there being some kind of hotline where you can call the talk to Corey Haim or Corey Feldman past this I am I am almost emotionally moved by the song Wonderwall where Neal takes the iconic Oasis song Wonderwall and he seems to grab an acoustic cut of the track rips the guitars off that takes an isolated vocal from the song itself and then seems to toy and just manipulate this voice over these guitars as the guitar stay really steady and consistent as one would expect them to be throughout the song but he takes this vocal and I I can't even explain it I just have to kind of uh I just I just have to kind of show you right here to be honest I got to be honest I love these two albums I've been listening to these two albums I think way more than I should have over the past you know week or so and it's it's to the point where it's really annoying my significant other and and it's because when I listen to these records I really run the gamut of emotion I am angered I am disgusted I am thoroughly enjoying myself I am laughing at some points namely a one point on mouth silence where we get the first few bars of the friends theme song and when the claps come up Neil syncs up the Wow it's moments like that that really make me die a little on the inside and laugh at the world of music burning but I love these records I love how technically intricate they are and how perceptive Neil is at pulling these songs together and finding what works what doesn't and just making these songs so harmonious he's not this guy who's going to remix just some guy rapping over a beat construed out of a famous pop song these are pop songs and rock songs that might clash melodically but Neil finds ways to kind of just fuse them and just mold them together into this one musical Frankenstein monster I think this album is really interesting and awesome exploration of just how much common ground your average pop hit has with potentially thousands of other songs out there even though I have a feeling that this project was maybe kind of a short-lived thing for Neil maybe a bit of a social experiment or some self-indulgence I hope he doesn't stop because he's he's really so good at it I'm going to just give a light to decent eight collectively on both of these records I think they're an incredibly innovative fun interesting listen I'm not going to say there aren't bad terrible or annoying parts on these records there are but just sort of the strong negative reaction to those parts are part of the journey and and I will leave it at that transition if you've given these two albums a listen or are you still live you lived that that's great what did you think did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it mouth sounds mouth silence forever 
o9X_S6MHQ8w,blow fight a no letter from a fan hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and i'm going to be answering a question of query responding to a statement made in this email that was sent to me and i print it out on my printer hey Anthony I was recently talking to some friends about the idea of no junk no soul that some artists need to be on drugs to be creating their best music I'm curious whether you think this is a real connection or bullshit I don't know exactly where I fall to me Alison Chainz was much better in the 90s with Layne Staley than they are now but I also love a lot of straightedge punk ideologically I don't care but I but musically all the band members are entirely drug free and still make some of the best kick-ass punk I'm also curious as to how you think we plays into this I'm a big fan of stoner metal bands like The Melvins bond Ripper weed eater etc just curious as to your thoughts and whether you think this is a bad idea for future musicians to have Kyle L ah good question Kyle good talk I've written down a series of points right here mm-hmm-hmm-hmm and I will be making them in this video all bullet-pointed so I don't forget anything point number one or a preface I do not do drugs mm hmm nope nope I am NOT a recreational drug user I do understand that we we've all like done drugs since drugs are kind of like you know so deeply laced into our society like you know we've all taken aspirin or you know we've probably all had caffeine many of us have probably had caffeine there are probably a few of you out there who've never had maybe even a little bit of green tea not that green tea is known to ruin lives but still I'm talking mostly in this video about alcohol or marijuana or harder stimulants such as adderall or stuff like heroin things that are for the most part illegal in in America anyway mm-hmm thank you drop our anyway now I do not use drugs I have no plans in the near future to use drugs and that's that's just my choice so I'm just letting you know that that's the the ideology that is the point of view you're going to be getting in this video all right just just let you know ahead of time so in my opinion point number two or the first point drugs do not make art people make art I think the person making the music is way more important and way more essential to the music you are listening to then the drug itself even if the song you're listening to is titled drugs drugs drugs drugs I love drugs the person who is singing on the song the person who is playing on the song as a person is more essential to the music than whatever drug that person is using or doing you cannot replace a person on a record with a drug to talk about your layne staley point layne staley obviously a drug user but and you're and you're saying you know right now they're not as good Allisyn chains as they used to be if you took someone to replace Layne Staley in that band and made that person use just as many drugs as Layne Staley did would the music become good again would he be just as good a musician as Layne Staley would we see the second coming of Alice in Chains making their great records again if you took John Lydon John Lennon and replaced him in the Beatles with somebody who used just as many drugs as John Lennon throughout John Lennon's career would you have just as talented a guitarist and songwriter and vocalist as John Lennon was mm-hmm you wouldn't you would not and anybody who sort of comes you know at me in this video or just at any of you sir well well well drugs if you don't like drugs you might as well throughout all the music yeah you ever listened to in the 60s and the 70s because that was all drugs I feel like that kind of person is unintentionally insulting the artists that that person may be a fan of truly and honestly because the reason that these people may have been drawn to drugs in the first place is because they're out of box thinkers to begin with you know and part of the reason out of the box thinkers continue to use drugs as an inspiration point and become drawn to drugs are because drugs continue unfortunately to be taboo in in many modern societies if drugs were more of a norm or weren't something that people got in trouble for doing would it be as big a deal for artists in in their music there are certainly more songs about drugs than there are about driving a car down the highway not to say that there aren't good songs about driving a car down the highway there are but all I'm saying is that on the surface it would certainly seem much less exciting since we've all driven cars down the highway it's all I'm saying all right so my next point is that not only can you just not replace a musician with a drug on a record or with somebody who is also using drugs and get the same results as a talented musician who might happen to be a drug user on record but drugs do not make you a good musician if you suck a guitar if you suck at singing if you suck at rapping if you're a terrible drummer who can't keep time using drugs will not make you a better musician maybe you'll sound better to yourself but you you probably will not sound better to other people because the thing is is that you have not gained a certain level of technical skill or writing skill that can only be attained with certain level of sobriety that would allow you to focus and retain information and retain experiences that allow you to learn what it is to do something well and what it is to do something terribly even people who like let's say John Cage for example or Jackson Pollock who sort of work outside the confines of what it means to be playing an instrument well do at least have some semblance of technical skill or what technical skill means or how to apply technical skill if they decide to do so so even in the avant-garde world you need to have a certain level of understanding of the so called rules that you are breaking and working outside of to merely have no understanding of those rules then do some drugs then sloppily go blue on a guitar doesn't make you a genius mom saying so no no if you do drugs it does not necessarily mean you're a good musician and there are tons of artists on the drug slash total straightedge sobriety scale who make terrible music avoiding drugs does not make you a good musician does not make you special and neither does doing drugs that's just the fact of the matter that's just the fact of the matter it doesn't make you good it doesn't it doesn't it can certainly inspire an experience it could certainly inspire a certain action in you but it doesn't necessarily equate to entertainment for other people who are partaking in the art that you're making my next point is that drugs are an experience drugs are an experience that you embark upon that you choose to embark upon some people choose not to embark upon it and drugs as an experience as a potential catalyst for creativity and in raishin can just as easily cause you to write an amazing song just like I don't know the death of someone close to you can inspire you to write an amazing song or the loss of a relationship you really cared about there are certainly more love songs than there are drug songs then we have I don't know having a kid getting old having a near-death experience maybe there's a food stuff you really love out there that you feel like you couldn't live without there's also music music music also inspires music it turns out there are a lot of things out there that we do travel to another country for me somebody knew that for whatever reason depending on who you are could potentially cause you to have a certain idea that wouldn't have popped into your head otherwise and these ideas and these experiences this stimuli can drive you to make great art if you are in fact an artist and drugs just happen to be one of these experiences now you know you can stack experiences on top of one another you could be having sex with someone that you love in a different country a week after your best friend died on heroin okay I mean you it's it's not like you can only do one experience at a time but drugs are just one of these experiences okay and it least from what I've observed in the world of music whether it be musicians who use drugs musicians who don't use drugs and musicians who write songs about drugs and musicians who don't write songs about drugs there is enough music out there about things that are not drugs or not written or created on drugs to entertain the idea that maybe if you don't have junk you can have soeul there are people like Frank Zappa who I know was a chain smoker and I know might have drank or I know might have either smoked a joint with his band occasionally or been around his band plenty of times as they were smoking but he was a guy who wanted his creativity attributed to the fact that he was a creative person he didn't want psyche even though for his time his music was really trippy it was psychedelic it was out there it was just some of the stuff he was doing was unheard of and really strange in the music world and he didn't want his creativity being boiled down to something that he didn't endorse or that he didn't think was a pivotal part of his creative process then there are other musicians out there who maybe aren't staunchly against drug use but it doesn't really play into their everyday lives there's people like Robert Fripp from what I understand may not have used drugs which I read an interview with him saying that with John McLaughlin there's also one VC Kendrick Lamar who off of his last full-length LP and in interviews as well talks about not smoking not partaking he feels like kind of an odd man out being the only person in the studio isn't smoking but there's a part on his last record where kind of the character he's playing has a traumatic experience smoking a joint that seems to be laced with something else and it's experiences like this that kind of go on to inform his choice not to partake in drugs in the future there's also Henry Rollins in macaé Fugazi and Minor Threat Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull Steve Albini there are a lot of great musicians out there who do not partake and for them being sober is an experience that can be inspirational to them just as much as drug use can be inspirational to another person there's also Bruce Springsteen who I understand the allegedly lives a really clean squeaky-clean life I mean it's real good goes to the gym and doesn't really partake in drugs let's see and beyond that I mean as far as drugs as an inspiration point I mean that they can be but I think in the music industry and maybe this is why we sort of lead ourselves to believe oh well drugs are so essential to the artistic process I think we tend to obsess over or spotlight work glorify when for so many artists drugs kind of go really wrong and either ruin their lives and sort of just derail their entire career sort of like a guy like DMX for example or Gil scott-heron rest in peace or end these people entirely via an overdose like Jay retard or the numerous other musicians who have died over the decades of some kind of drug abuse you know and that's another thing drugs like any other experience you can kind of overdo it whether it be personally or physically or even in your art as well I mean who wants to hear you stretch out the same experience for album after album after album after album and song after song after song only writing songs under the influence of drugs or only writing songs about drugs is about as boring in one-dimensional as only writing songs about this relationship that you you got you know kicked out over somebody broke it off with you so many years ago you know there there are other things to be inspired by there are other things too I guess so write about and as somebody who doesn't use drugs I don't really feel any pressure to use drugs or partake in drugs in order to enjoy songs that are about drugs like I said before in my opinion drugs are just an experience and I personally don't feel like I need to experience everything somebody who is writing a song has gone through in order to enjoy it there are tons of other songs there are about things that I will never go through and yet I don't have a problem relating and under anding and finding compassion for whatever struggle an artist might be going through like nas for example a lot of nas's lyrics and his songs on his classic album Illmatic has to do with the environment that he grew up in in New York and sort of the the the the suffering he and many other people went through just with the area that he grew up in the dangers of it the trials and tribulations of it however people across the world have not really had a problem enjoying or getting into his music it's the fact that he has had a unique experience and he is putting it up on display for everyone to partake in is what makes his music wonderful not that everybody has gone through the same thing as him okay and I think my last point I might have made earlier that because artists are outside of the box takers they may sort of be drawn to drugs or drugs may play a large part in the artistic world just because they continue to be so taboo not the musicians wouldn't seek them out if drugs were readily available for everyone but maybe they're such a big deal because they tend to be such a no-no and in the artistic world especially in the music world we seem to have a lot of artists whose personalities and public personas are based upon breaking the rules and doing things you're not supposed to do like Miley Cyrus recently with all her endorsement of marijuana use in every which way she can publicly allow you to know that she smokes marijuana whether it be over social media or the clothing that she wears or the lyrics that she's writing and I think we can all agree that it has not necessarily improved her musical acumen so I hope I have expressed myself adequately on this topic if you have any questions or expressions you would like to put out there in relation to drug use and art creation and music please throw them down there in the comments and I will be talking with you guys a little bit down there and you know listen whether you use drugs or don't use drugs it's not necessarily a bad thing neither are wrong you can take non drug use so far that you're jumping down other people's throats and looking down at everyone and make yourself look like a dick and you can take drugs so far that you can be pretentious with that as well or you know you can actually overdose the there are fine lines between use and abuse and all I'm saying is if you do choose to have drugs as an inspiration point just make sure you don't step over that line though that would be a point of inspiration as well though not one I would recommend that you hop into voluntarily cool cool all right I think I think that's all I can say on this limit limit let me scan my brain for five more seconds allow me five more seconds to scan my brain you no I think we're good here you're the best I love you and thank you for watching this really long-ass video forever 
kjSTPQQg194,
ZWh7Ns1iS8w,you're looking pretty sexy Thanks hi everyone Anthony Pham tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new how to dress well record what is this heart habit dress will is the solo project of singer-songwriter Tom crow who initially exploded in the underground music world as a pitchfork favorite which he continues to be he was applauded by them and many other publications for his loafie experimental approach to R&B contemporary R&B personally I couldn't really follow suit in the praise the recording of his debut album to me was just unjustifiably crummy and distorted I was finding some redeeming factors in the songs themselves but they're really shrill distortion that many of them were covered in and kind of made it hard to listen although there was an EP who followed this album up with that featured some orchestral instrumentation underneath his vocals which I thought was very beautiful but on Tom's next album which I liked more he really redeemed himself on the recording quality side of things the instrumentation his vocals sounded really nice clean this album brought a series of tracks that were really ethereal and syrupy and a few that were kind of up being catchy too but to me stripping away the low five production and the distortion made so many more things clearer about how to dress well namely that the songwriting was just okay and that Tom Krell is not really the most versatile of vocalists in a genre where vocal virtuosity is kind of emphasized and as far as this new LP goes much of what was the case on total loss continues on to what is this hard with a few exceptions for one there are more acoustic guitars on this record Tom's voice doesn't sound quite as reverb soaked it's much more close and upfront this is I think a slightly more intimate record for how to dress well however at the end of the day this album me sort of like total loss ended up being kind of hit or miss liking some tracks disliking others being on the fence with much of what was brought to the table a lot of the time it's not like Tom is really writing bold captivating songs or delivering them with a top-notch vocal still Tom sort of sings in this very whimper e weak falsetto I guess in a sense it's a motive but it kind of gets stale for me after a while and the instrumentation even on the more upbeat track seems too polite to move me out of the neutral emotional state I was in before I put the album on and moments on this record that I do think are gripping like the opener where Tom is singing over these really nimble beautiful acoustic guitar melodies are really developed beyond anything that I'm hearing at the beginning of the track it feels more like a motif even though it's about four minutes long but over the course of the song it only delivers this middle ground of passion and beauty and when this record does get loud sometimes it sounds really messy it seems that tom is still not past delivering subpar production on some of his tracks like the song childhood faith in love which sounds pretty nice up to the point where these really goofy rhythms and vocal samples enter the picture and it kind of sounds like panda bear of Animal Collective came in and did some guest production and the end result was just the song precious love as well which feels kind of like a demo with how thin all the instrumentation sounds but melodically I do think it's one of the better Tunes on the record there's some straightforward concise songs in the tracklist on this thing like what you wanted which seems like a very simple slow kind of funky 80s era R&B pop fusion something I could see playing on the radio back then if it were actually as catchy and snappy and as enthusiastic as R&B music from that era this is why tracks like repeat pleasure don't really do it for me Tom Krell doesn't live up to the standards of the R&B music he very clearly borrows from not to mention there are some pretty awful fake handclaps all over this song that are pretty gross the instrumentals on this record are underwhelming and unexcited and as our the Vogel's but today because Tom Krell's music isn't as snappy or as hard-hitting as the commercial R&B music that we remember from these decades it's seen as novel and is different and as exciting or even passionate and I do think there are tracks that that that are passionate and are enjoyable like the song face again which has this massive bass line some glassy synthesizers and one of the most winning hooks on the entire LP it's really one of the most stunningly passionate moments on the entire record and then there's the song poor Cyril which is one of these moments of orchestral beauty where the strings and just the atmosphere of the song really brings it to a whole new level of gorgeousness for this record personally I find myself gravitating the most toward the softer and more subtle and more slow building tracks off of this record like the songs I just mentioned or see you fall or a power which has these very beautiful cascading piano melodies falling all over one another like slinkys going down the stairs not every slow building track actually has a beautiful awesome finish or an interesting journey like words I don't remember or the closer but I do find these songs so much more fitting and engaging but there isn't much more on this record that sticks out to me is like a true favorite or a serious highlight again to me this album in a lot of ways is in the same vein as total loss a little more intimate the beats are a little more diverse there's definitely an increase in acoustic instrumentation Tom Krell's voice is more upfront but I just don't see his songwriting as memorable especially with lyrics on the track very best friend which really brings the entire record down to a very very corny low even though I think Tom takes more risks than he did on total loss I think he ends up with an even larger mixed bag of results I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP transition if you've given the Recker - listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it yeah theny Pham tan oh how to dress well what is this heart forever so why don't you and me get together baby person sensual healing or don't play hard to get don't tease Cal Cal is a man who knows what he likes you know what fine be that way I don't I don't know you and I don't gotta know yet 
kG_nR0Pcywg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new fallujah album the flesh prevails before I get into this review I want to say thank you to these cute little babies for the shout out in a recent video that they were in I will link to that video down in the description box and fallujah is a california metal band this is their second album their sophomore album a lot of metal fans passing this record my way telling me to check it out really urgent in their recommendation of this album and these guys are a death metal band a technical death metal band to be specific genre I don't really mind or even enjoy at its roots or with some of its bigger names like Niall death cynic gore guts atheist I also enjoy a little bit of ulcerate bands like this technical and melodic death metal bands find ways to make death metal a little more dynamic and incorporate some really complex compositions and guitar work and melodies into the tremolo Pickett ARS and the beats and the guttural growling that we typically hear in death metal and Fallujah is not only pretty flashy and they are incredibly melodic but they try to work in a bit of atmosphere into their songs as well there are loads of epic soaring guitar solos on top of these chugging riffs and intense drums and these guitar solos are soaked in this really larger-than-life reverb that feels kind of interstellar there's just relentless drumming throughout this record - the rhythms the grooves they're all pretty dizzying and for the most part I think the band does a good job of balancing simplicity and complexity on this album - even though the performances may seem really difficult it's not that hard to grasp what the band is doing on a first listen they might have a slow moving chord progression but then they'll throw some insane drumming behind it or they'll have a really difficult groove the riff is bringing forward but they'll pair that with one of those sweet huge melodic guitar solos Felucia has a lot of good things going for them but I still don't like this album it's it's just a shame and it really for the most part comes down to production I don't like how this record is mixed recorded compressed to death the way this record sounds to me is absolutely excruciating after long periods of time and not in a way where it's like whoa this band's really brutal I feel like sonically there that they're really pushing the envelope it's not because the band feels incredibly loud but again feels incredibly compressed all the sound all the instrumentation just brick walled and smushed down until you're just getting this bodyless chaotic wall of guitars and drums that are just continually smothering one another in this really ugly display frequency clashing not only does the reverb on this LP sound just grossly synthetic but the drums have the tambour of smacking the driver side door of a car with a piece of PVC pipe the vocal delivery and the guitar tone as well are kind of dime-a-dozen as far as this current state of melodic and technical death metal goes even though it seems like Fallujah puts a lot of effort into the composition of this record really making sure that every note every drum beat every vocal is in its place and perform to perfection as far as the mixing on this record it's frustratingly tangled there are some more ethereal tracks on this record that do serve as kind of a counterpoint and a bit of a break a bit of a breather from the more intense and dense tracks on this LP but all the other songs just kind of blend together for me in a really unappealing way I can most definitely appreciate flawless punchy clean metal production records like carcasses heart work will forever be a metal favorite of mine and metal classic and sort of a pioneer in the current trend of ultra clean digital metal production that we see today but bands like Fallujah push this trend so far I don't even feel like I'm listening to humans perform on a record anymore to me this record is like the equivalent adding sex with a robot the most expressive thing to me on this record are the melodies and melodically it's not like this band brings anything forward that a group such as Animals As Leaders doesn't already and to me melody alone does not make a good song if all of your foundational instrumentation on a track sounds like soulless droids are performing it then the melody doesn't really make a difference I know in modern metal this kind of record qualifies as a very brutal sound but to me brutality is very human characteristic it's an animalistic characteristic if you strip your music of its animality of its and you just make it as robotic and as sequenced and as perfect as possible the brutality doesn't really seep through instead for me this record reads as cold emotionless ruckus with some nice melody splashed on top I'm feeling a strong for tool like five on this thing transition if you've given this LP listen what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it why what do you think I should review next and that's it Anthony Fantana Felucia forever 
yW5O5RREgHo,no fight a no album review hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd want to do a really quick fast and dirty review of this um new CD compilation album that I have a copy of in my hands it's a various artists compilation from coal mine records on the earth has over 20 tracks on it coal mine records is a new york-based record label they've been around since the mid-2000s and they're essentially celebrating their 10 year anniversary with this compilation and there are a lot of artists on this label that I haven't heard of before and there are plenty of artists on this compilation that I don't think are officially on the label but the compilation kind of brought them on to get some bigger names on this thing regardless of who is and who isn't on the compilation what has and what hasn't come out on the label this compilation is a party it's a good time it's just really solid track for track 4 track really badass grimy teeth gnashed hard nosed boom bap hip hop with just really gritty gritty in-your-face lyrics and emcees on this thing and there's a pretty nice list of either underground names people who are vets in the industry and and people who are also artists on coalmine records I mean you have rod digger on here as well as Sean there's apathy and self titled on here rex Pharoahe Monch is on a track blues on a few tracks even people that I'm not totally crazy about because I think their lyricism tends to run a little predictable like guilty Simpson and Sean price even they are on the their best behavior and draw up some decent tracks on this comp and the beats for the most part are really good there's a DJ on the first CD of this compilation DJ revolution the CD is actually my CD player and he brings all the tracks together really nicely there's some interludes you know where he's kind of cutting one track into another and on the second CD we essentially have like you know the the no DJ version untagged untag deluxe version of the compilation but the first CD which I have been listening to primarily I haven't listened to the second see all the way through yet but the first CD is is really the cool holistic you know one track segue extreme to another kind of experience I'm not gonna say these guys are reinventing the wheel with this confident with this compilation they certainly are not you know if you're a longtime hip-hop fan I don't think you're gonna hear anything altogether new on this thing but if you want to hear a bunch of relatively seasoned and experienced MCS spittin some really good verses and bars because you know you're not gonna get any of this kind of like low-grade trap swag wah swag rap sort of stuff on this compilation I mean it's just bars bars bars you know I I get the sense that maybe there was even a little bit of a competition to come together with one of the best tracks on this thing between all the artists that were drawing up songs on this compilation the to me there was no laziness on this cop and and that's part of what makes it's such an enjoyable experience even with over 20 tracks in the track listing you know what I would assume that any hip-hop compilation with this many songs on it would have at least several awful tracks in the track listing and that just that just didn't end up being the case that just did not end up being the case I'm gonna give you guys a link down in the description where you can hear this compilation again not reinventing the wheel or anything like that but if you're looking for some solid boom-bap some solid New York flavor in a hip hop compilation with plenty of songs on it then hit that link give this thing a listen and tell me what you think alright cool that was the review anthony Fantana do you love this thing you hate this thing why what do you think I should next and that's it yep any Fantana on earth forever
