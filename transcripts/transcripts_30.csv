q1go3WwvCvY,stop snowing hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing an album review Smith westerns diet blonde before I get into this a couple things I have to mention on the needle drop comm streaming new single from gentleman Jessie and his men and hear an audio review of a new track from parts and labor and also I keep forgetting to mention this rest in peace to the broadcasts Trish Keenan check out in the D box and article on NPR music tributing her in obituary it's very nice with know one artist leading the pack and I'm sure this is also due in part to the blogosphere garage rock has had such a resurgence and it comes in a lot of flavors too from the more punk inspired stuff with Jay retard to the western twang of the strange boys the oddball psychedelia of black lips and even the low fly noisy racket from ty Segall stuff there's a lot more where that came from too and there are a lot of groups who are doing this revivalist thing as well just working with a sound that is mostly if not totally inspired by that old world of psychedelic and garage rock and I would say Smith westerns are cut of that cloth or they've kind of evolved into that because their first LP seemed content to just cause a racket in fact there were some songs on here that were so distorted it was kind of hard to make heads or tails of it and all in all I didn't really like it I mean lo-fi recordings are awesome for sure but there's only an extent to which that aesthetic makes the music interesting but I'm happy to say daya blonde has done a total 180 on the recording quality it's done a 180 on a lot of stuff that I found on that first Smith westerns LP almost to the point where these guys are almost no longer a garage rock band maybe something a little more refined pop keyboards hot fuzzy guitar lips that are pulled right out of the George Harrison playbook some more bass some snappy drums this LP is definitely going to set you to the late 60s to when British psychedelic rock was looking to push boundaries and using studio trickery to just sound larger-than-life another thing to note about this LP to the songwriting the song structuring both fantastic another turnaround from that first album between the four of these dudes they pull off a lot of tight instrumental breaks and huge massive crescendos one of my favorites is just at the end of imagine part three that is a killer ending to a song that just whisks the track up into this gigantic guitar lead freak out all that young is another favorite track of mine this big anthemic lighter ballad that reminds me of just angels getting baked hanging out on some clouds playing harps plugged into amplifiers some Marshall stacks with distortion pedals but the band can play things straight too like weekend first track on the album fallen in love only one just tracks where they're like you know what let's not let's just give him the hook let's just be straight let's be simple let's be right to the point overall I didn't hate not one single song on this LP and it was not the instant turnoff that their first album was by a long shot but that's not to say that there weren't things I didn't like for one in my opinion the singing is just not good it's not the vocals are really really weak they're thin they're rarely on and the production is constantly trying to make up for it by burying the vocals behind the keyboards behind the guitars behind this just wall of reverb and instrumentation on a lot of these tracks so they're really loud hot fuzzy guitars that make the first track on this album so awesome and so catchy kind of makes Smith Western seem like a one-trick pony by the time you're at the last track of the album but if you're looking for an album that you could dance to in the kitchen in your underwear while wearing sunglasses destination Smith westerns I'm feeling of light too decent seven on this it's a likable album most definitely but I fell in love with some tracks not the entire LP so how do you feel about this LP why do you like it why do you dislike it Bieber track we use paper track hmm and what should I review next anthony Fantana smooth westerns daya blonde forever you 
X1nALCk5kMU,almost a 1 after-school special hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the blahdy blahdy blahdy blahdy blah I hope y'all are doing well alright let's get straight down to business no time to lose brass tacks no dilly-dallying the task at hand this is a hip-hop review which I'm sure is gonna make some of y'all go but I'm sorry I've been listening to this all weekend and I feel like talking about it the after-school special mixtape is from California rapper a-one and it's not just any old mixtape it's a concept mixtape the whole story is set out in the intro track of this thing it's the 90s a 1 wakes up to his alarm clock in the morning he's got to go to school his mom's all like hey you got to go to school get up but he gets sick and then once his mom leaves he turns on the TV we've all done it now after that all the rap songs come in but all the beats are made out of television themes that you would hear watching TV in the 90s like The Price is Right which is a surprisingly great beat on this thing Family Matters Golden Girls you get the idea plus you're here little clips of commercials from my buddy and me blow pop operation it's kind of a nostalgic mind phone now as far as rapping goes a1 is not the strongest most definitive personality I've come across but but he's got a flow and his rhymes are pretty clever I know the non sequitur thing is huge in rap right now I like it you like it we all like it we also like the pop-culture references and it's not like that's not here that is here I mean the beats alone are pop-culture references but a1 can also tell a story a lot of stories on here I like a lot The Price is Right is basically about making it and just kind of waiting to be called down from the audience to the stage to play the game Family Matters is about selling drugs getting caught but then after the dust settles your family's there your family's there because family matters but I think my favorite story is on Golden Girls which is where a one tries to get to a party with his friend but he somehow ends up at an 85 year old lady's birthday party hilarity ensues you just basically got these tall tales in this positivist attitude that reminds me of Golden Age rap but it still sounds very modern and somewhere in the middle is all this 90s stuff if you're my age it's a little bit like watching a montage of your life playing backwards set to a bunch of rap beats I do have some issues with the mixtape though like the song black Ranger as much as I think a one spits by ya over that track I really wonder whether or not the Power Rangers theme is is all that good of a background for a rap song outside of that the song goosebumps which is my favorite concept on the album kind of like the Charlie Daniels Band Devil Went Down to Georgia except instead of a fiddling contest you have a one locked into a rap battle with Satan himself now when Satan raps there's this really annoying obnoxious vocal effect that bothers the hell out of me but this is opinion I'm sure you and I are going to differ on what beats on this thing are actually good and actually art may be something I'll think it's really corny to sample the Pokemon theme song or sample the theme song to all that on Nickelodeon but um I don't I think it's pretty funny and awesome and entertaining but if all of the gimmicky television themes on here and the nostalgia are not for you a one does have other mixtapes that are worth checking out because I do think he has a good head on his shoulders when he raps he sounds hungry he's got a good philosophy I think he's a personality that a lot of y'all can agree with I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing but I'm sure you guys are curious as to what Cal thinks a 1u you don't even eat steak and with that I say I hate Cal Church esta all right guys let me know what you think of this mixtape did you like it did you hate it why link in the D box to listen to it download it totally free free free free it's totally free it's free and what do you think I should review next leave a comment keep being awesome forever 
vtDvu9PVcJc,"ghost opus eponymous hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I'm going to do an album review on this new ghost LP opus eponymous on my last review I asked all of you just like I do every review what I should review next and terrier Bram said I should review whatever I want to review and more than 80 of you thumbed it up democracy all now up until the point when I decided I was gonna review this thing it was haunting me a little bit just a little bit my buddy jumble junkie showed it to me I saw it had some good reviews on rate your music also I was seeing it on some blogs and most recently jgc sound reviewed this thing also so basically this album has kind of been like hey hey review me hey you got nine tracks here one of them's an intro and all the songs just span under 35 minutes and a critique I hear of this band often is that they sound really retro and it's just a gimmick it's too gimmicky the retro sound oh it's gimmicky like modern metal doesn't have it's gimmicks like screaming your head off isn't a gimmick or playing as loud as you possibly can isn't a gimmick but the retro thing I have to agree with to an extent a lot of people have compared these guys to Blue Oyster Cult but I think that's mostly because of the sound that these guys have kind of resembles the Erie rock flavor of don't fear the reaper this to me is not proto metal it's definitely definitely metal though it does take a bit from each traditional style of what we listen to today from heavy to thrash to doom long story short ghost has come up with a really cohesive sound on this LP that references but does not walk in the footsteps of any one single band but you could ask who goes back in time and just decides they're going to resurrect these dead sounds of rock and it's a decent question and I feel like it could be answered in saying metal to me has always been a genre of dreams and where those extremes are are relative to when and where the music is being put out like for example if you take Black Sabbath's first album today that LP as much as I love it is not extreme however back then when it was released that LP was pretty intense now in its search for new extremes like volume and heaviness and and speed metal has lost some stuff that made it good back in the old days like songwriting and tune fullness melody you know all the stuff that makes all these other kinds of musics so good this is the kind of stuff ghost brings back into the fold here all that aside there are a lot of things I love about this LP for one the guitar the rhythm guitar just fist-pumping riffs that get me going and the solos are really great too they're not too flashy they're not too up and in-your-face they're melodic they're catchy the drumming just gets the job done emphasizes the groove and really locks in with the riffs on this entire LP some really rhythmic bass lines that vary from the guitars noticeably a really sinister sinister organ playing in the background on a lot of these tracks and the vocals are extremely extremely clean no screaming I would even say no shouting and they're very on pitch I was not enjoying the vocals that much when I first heard this LP mostly because the dude's voice is really really thin I would say maybe even kind of kind of weak it's not a powerful vocal not beefy by any means but there are a lot of harmonized background vocals on this LP and when they come in on a lot of these hooks it sounds pretty and the last thing that has to be brought up about this album are the lyrics the lyrics here have a writers obsession with Satan every song here is either about Satan or mentioned Satan and I know that when we listen to music that is about or just mentioning bezel bub the Prince of Darkness Lucifer el Diablo we're used to hearing the vocals like but these like I said very clean so who would I recommend this to if you're Simon Belmont of the hit video game Castlevania and you're about to enter a manner and this manner has 1,000 vampires in it this should be your soundtrack to slay them I've only got one major gripe about this LP and it's fade one of the worst of them is on the second track of this LP which just kind of shuts down just when the song is getting good I'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this I'm really impressed with it what do you guys think of this album go down there in the d box find some links to listen and yeah anthony Fantino ghost [Music] you "
PD-2gGas94M,greetings everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd its album review time one thing I want to mention on the needle drop dot-com stream a track from the metal band ghost who I hope to be reviewing maybe next week hoping to review that our new LP then pretty good so far from what I hear hmm now I get a lot of comments on my videos asking me to review this album this song and by far right now the album that I get the most requests of is no not the new Decemberists or the new destroyer but the new cage the elephant LP thank you happy birthday if you know Cage the Elephant already it's most likely because of singles that have brought them to this point like ain't no rest for the wicked or in one ear which are pretty representative of that to make a long story short if you're in the market for some punked out bluesy garage rock then most definitely check out this album it was totally reminding me of the hives the White Stripes back a little bit even the Arctic Monkeys to the point where I couldn't really separate cage the elephant from those artists and sadly I announced that that problem has transmitted to thank you happy birthday instead of hammering out a more distinct sound or a more distinct style cage the elephant has decided to just hop on the bandwagon with a whole different set of sounds tracks 2 and 9 here are unmistakably copies of The Pixies to the point where it almost sounds like Frank blacks vocal and the song Aberdeen is it sounds like a sped-up version of where is my mind except with more guitars but the 90s in general kind of seemed to be a reference point for these guys on this album I swear there are some songs on here that if only this album were 15 years older could have definitely been played on alternative rock radio you know real hits up there with Machine Head or smells like teen spirit but this album also takes hint from the 90s underground - jumping into a lot of post-hardcore sounds with really noisy wailing guitars experimental vocals that I'm usually used to hearing on Drive Like Jehu albums or dismemberment plan albums I'm even catching whiffs of McCluskey oh the irony of this band pounding away on their guitars while they play the song indie kids which basically makes fun of you guessed it indie kids kind of a modern take on Frank Zappa making fun of hippies on the album we're only in it for the money and as funny or maybe even as accurate as some of their critiques maybe like whoo I gotta get the the right haircut I have to ask myself are these guys really in a position to be making fun of others who copy or follow a particular style or trend ah it's really hard to bunch this album up into one steady explanation you know you would like this album if and that's simply because Cage the Elephant emulates a different sound and changes gears every couple of tracks on this LP from a strumming guitar waltz to Moody dance rock to Punk abili so maybe it's an album for people who like songs that sound like other songs or people who don't know what those other songs are and believe me there's nothing wrong with having influences this is not a case of being a rapper and then you coming out with an album and it sounds like rap music it runs much deeper than that Cage the Elephant makes music that sounds exactly like that referenced idea and that's the kind of internal battle that I'm having I know these guys are not a cover band and I feel like ripping off and merely referencing that's a gray area and where that line is that you will not cross depends upon the person but I will say it's not like the songs here are bad there are a lot of catchy hooks great melodies good musicianship these guys sound really tight together the recording is pretty dang good lyrics that stick in the back of your head as well these guys drum up original tunes but they basically use the recording studio like a Xerox machine copying every piece of music that has ever influenced them me personally I'm at a point where I would much rather be listening to the bands that cage the elephant references then listen to cage the elephant but if you're looking for a gateway drug into this 90s alt rock world or if these guys have already been your gateway drug to that then sure why not you could do worse so all in all me personally me I am feeling like a light five on this album does that mean you should feel that way no and I got so many comments about this album I assume that you guys will just enjoy the album anyway no matter what I say who cares if you're enjoying the album continue enjoying it hmm so what do you guys think about this album what do you think about influences how far can a band go to copy and influence without it becoming a ripoff quote-unquote and what should I review next anthony Fantana Cage the Elephant thank you happy birthday forever 
4EUEhF8BQOc,Hey it's okay sorry let's be serious Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd here thanks for watching track reviews where we talk about the latest and greatest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the mainstream persuasion this time around this is kind of a double review yes there is going to be a review in this video but also on the needle drop comm linked in the D box there was an audio podcast review of a song from the new tapes and tapes album outside and also on npr.org slash music a big article mix that I did about female post-punk bands has just gone up and you guys should do over there it's linked in the d box this is a new track from the upcoming Kanye West and jay-z album Watch the Throne which is slated for release later this year as many of you may already know I had kind of a love-hate relationship with Kanye's last album which I can just boil down to loving the beats but just not being as impressed with his rhymes and a lot of points on the album plus some of the hooks plus the auto-tune it's a long story just go look for the review but anyway I was still excited when I heard that this LP was gonna get too old hearing these guys collaborate on one album could really kind of mean something for hip hop especially since a lot of reviewers built my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy up to be this game-changing album so let's just give a listen to this first track Kanye and jay-z ham all right let's uh let's discuss I have a lot to say good news bad news good news first the hook is catchy I've been listening to this track on and off for the past 24 hours and I would be lying to you if I did not say that the hook was sticking with me a little bit and it's kind of got me thinking that I do I do want to go hard like a mother maybe there are some other things in my life that I could be doing like a mother but am NOT but let's talk about the B for a second it was produced by lex luger who put together a lot of sounds for waka flocka flame and rick ross on their latest albums and i really didn't like the beats on give those albums in fact i would say this thing almost sounds like a throwaway beat from Flocka Valley and the thing that bugs me most about those beats and this beat is that Lex will bunch all of these 808 snare drum sounds together in such a mishmash of percussion with absolutely no shame as if it sounds good it is a unique sound but I would only say it's a unique sound because most rap producers would not do that because they don't think it sounds good not because it's this amazing thing that he stumbled upon that nobody's ever thought of plus you've got these really bad synthesized string sounds that almost seem like they came out of a bad MIDI program they even sound worse bunched up against these group vocals that sound sampled to me they're singing in Latin and the one part of the beat that I do like is when pretty much all the electronic stuff breaks away and you've got that vocal interlude which to me is nice but gives the song this feeling of epicness that it doesn't really have to me it's just such a dime-a-dozen beat that sounds like it came straight out of fruity loops I'm sorry I'm sorry just my opinion just saying as far as rhymes go Kanye's pretty much singing the same tune here that he did on my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy I mean you know if flaccid midgets Eggman he's got the cockiness a rapper needs if he's going to brag about himself but he just doesn't say anything that ever impress is me which makes me question what is he bragging about as far as jay-z goes he's decent here but it kind of sounds like he's just all over the place I like the references to great whites vultures Mac truck where's the tag-team action where's the collaboration the collaboration I mean I've enjoyed jay-z's solo I've enjoyed Kanye's solo but how's bringing them both together on this track or even this album that we're going to hear later this year any more significant than hearing them by themselves why is this important is this different wu-tang Blackstar Beastie Boys Outkast even - racist these rap outfits understand the importance of tag-teaming these rap outfits understand the importance of when one MC passes the mic to another that MC also carries on the idea or the narrative that the song is trying to portray I read an article on a blog called silence no good that called this track out on sounding like a Chris Parnell SNL short and for the most part I have to agree it's not the worst thing in the world in fact I could see a lot of people liking it more than me I'm gonna have to score like a mother here and just give it a life for what did you guys think about it did you love it did you hate it why and what do you expect from this new jay-z Kanye collaboration do you think the songs are gonna get better from here or do you think this is gonna be a representation of what a what will be on the album Anthony Fantino jay-z and Kanye 
PzKcgB0n5XE,British sea power Valhalla dancehall hi hi hi hi hi hi hi uh Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd thank you for watching it's time for an album review of this believe it or not a few things to mention first a new track review of a song from the new rural Alberta advantage album and a new track from Kanye West and jay-z all linked down there in the D box and also Cal Church esta as promised has impersonated the rocket out blog just click on that or look for a link down there to go watch it what more incentive do you need it's calcio chester rock it out blog together at last let's get down to business British sea power is a British band and this is their fifth studio LP Valhalla dancehall I got a lot of requests for it on yesterday's video British sea power is one of those bands that always tries to do something different with each album and Valhalla dancehall is no different they don't go back and tie what the post-punk sounds on their first LP or the indie pop sounds on their second LP if anything this album is kind of a combination of their third and fourth do you like rock music a title that led to a lot of ball breaking all over the internet for obvious reasons went in a direction that's pretty predictable from just the title of this album but which is supposed to be the soundtrack of a semi-fictional documentary of the same title had the band writing really experimental soundtrack Rock without even batting an eye I mean it's a decent album it's just the issue with its release was that it was kind of unexpected by fans and didn't really turn all of the non-believers into British sea power fans Valhalla dancehall I would say is really straightforward really instant like rock music but has that same gargantuan ambition of man of Iran its anthemic from beginning to end and all you have to do is just sample the first track of this LP to know where the band is going this time around who's in control it's like bsp emulating a power ballad from a Monsters of Rock compilation godzilla-sized hook gargantuan guitar solos tons of reverb on the vocals and the drums so it kind of sounds like you're listening to the band play a giant arena all concept of modesty and just being down-to-earth have been thrown out the window on this album but the whole LP is not about rocking with your crowd for example there's a really dynamic power ballad on Georgie Rey that transforms into a guitar solo that I swear will have you just whipping your lighter out in front of your stereo and even though I'm not the biggest British sea power fan I wouldn't even call myself an expert of their past works I'm still kind of surprised to hear these guys sounding like this any modern band really but it's not like these guys are totally oblivious to the trajectory of their albums or the carefree or macho attitude that usually comes with this kind of music and I think they make fun of that just a little bit on tracks like Luna or living is so easy with the lyrics the band also creates some quiet but very captivating moments on here that kind of call back a little bit to man of Iran that bring in all the extra instrumentation xylophone strings piano horns background vocals on moments like this BSP works to create an atmosphere as opposed to a catchy song and for me the only real speed bump when it comes to this kind of sound for these guys on this album is the 11 minute once more now which could have been pared down just a little bit and as long as we're riding on the complain train let me say that I feel like these guys could have been just maybe a little more distinct in their embrace of this sound for sure because sometimes I feel like I'm listening not to British sea power but a completely different band on this album but depending on who you talk to that could be a good or bad thing but overall this thing is just an album of catchy guitar rock observe the skies stunned annul we are sound with some references to New Wave music like living is so easy heavy water just great tunes if I was talking to you and I said to you hey what do you want to listen to and you said Anthony I want to listen to a rock album then I would say oh you want to hear Rock Album well here you go this is it is the answer this is a rock album listen to it even count your Chester likes it cow what do you think of British sea power well as you know Britain is no longer the naval power that it once was however to plea devil's advocate I do question whether or not the ability to win a sea battle really holds relevance in today's world of nuclear arms and terrorism this is why I hate got your chest so I'm feeling a light eight on this thing I loved it and it's gonna be my first addition to the loved list for 2011 linked down there in the D box whoo that's it for today's review what do you think I should review next and also what did you think of this thing did you love it did you hate it and why and what do you think about British sea power in general hmm Anthony Fantana valhalla dancehall you you 
QT3w-swBFd4,why're red bark tree hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd that's not cool it's time for an album review but before I get into that I want to tell you guys on the needle drop com there's new music from rapper fashion who just came out with a new track building up to his new mixtape higher learning too excited for that and also the latest single from the band paper cuts who have a new LP dropping on Sub Pop this year check both of those out links in the d box and also recently the rocket out blog impersonated me in one of his videos now sammy finished off the video by saying anthony your turn your turn your turn Anthony Sammy I'm busy I've put coucher chest on the job basically he's watching a bunch of your videos right now and he's going to be impersonating you sometime later this week so don't worry about it don't worry your pretty little head about it I did get a couple comments on reviewing this new album although not a lot but if you know me and you've been watching this channel for a while you pretty much saw this review coming I get a lot of requests for doing classic album reviews and maybe I will one day on another channel maybe in a book don't know but the one classic album review I have done has been wires pink flag want a quick review of it easy ten forever seriously pink flag is fantastic in that it blurs the lines between punk rock and art rock just putting this ballsy attitude up against minimalist simplicity once wire came out with pink flag they started toning down their punk rock influence and really turned up the minimalism turned up the straightforward rock and pop I'm talking about chairs missing 1/5 for a lot of the stuff wire put out in the 90s and that's kind of where red bark tree hits for me you can hear it on the unapologetic repetition of many of these songs and even on the bass line in the track clay which sounds a lot like I am the fly and this isn't really surprising wire has been trying in a lot of ways to get back to their roots ever since they started releasing their own stuff on the label pink flag and for me a track like smash on this album is totally classic wire just straightforward downstroke guitars mid-tempo simple drum beat but what makes this track 2011 is that it's got a really slick hook however there are points we're going back to that original blueprint kind of just doesn't do anything for me on this LP like now was and the song two minutes which many of you may know I reviewed last year on this channel just we're underwhelming me a lot but wire does surprise me on the track bad word thing even though I'm not a huge fan of the lyrics on this song the really danceable drum beat the pumping guitars really just scream indie rock to me and even though Colin's vocals are completely devoid of any and all cynicism or snarkiness I'm still enjoying it for me the songwriting is a little bit all over the map I'm loving some tracks hating some tracks and I'm on the middle of the road with a lot of them however what I'm really kind of set on here is the production just the sound of this album which I really don't care for most of the time you've got these really obnoxious chorus effects on the vocals throughout pretty much the entire album you know it's nice to break out the toys every once in a while you know just to just to get a sound just to get a different texture in a given track but it is just unforgiving on this album how much chorus effects that are laid on Colin's voice and the second major thing destroying this entire LP to me is just the compression whether it's either on the entire song itself or just the guitars I'm just constantly hearing this saturation this / modulation that I'm not used to hearing with wire it's not like you guys have never heard music this saturated before if anything at some points on this album wire comes off a little bit like a shoegaze band with a lot of layers a lot of texture a lot of different sounds guitar sounds flowing throughout the mix if you're a hardcore wire fan I'm sure you're gonna see that there are some louder tracks on this album where that compression really works in favor of the band but it really does kill the dynamics on some of the quieter songs here depressingly so I could see some of the songwriting growing on me but just the sound of this album is making that a tough bridge to cross let's say a decent is strong five on this thing even though it's not doing a lot for me I could see a lot of you liking it more than I am and if you do let me know in the comments did you love this thing did you hate this thing and why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana the needle drop wire forever you 
o3aI489UkdI,cake showroom of compassion hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd I'm still kind of trying to figure out the HD thing I feel like I'm on the cusp of figuring out the equation just getting the lighting right getting the picture to not look stupid it's obviously a work in progress all right this review is on the latest LP from the California band cake the title is showroom of compassion it's their first studio album since 2004's pressure chief and last year on a blog that i'll link you guys to in the d box I had a write-up on the album which has stayed in my collection longer than any other album now if there's one band who is seconded by that LP it is a cake with their first four albums yes I proudly own these to me cake is a band's band every single instrument in the mix is adding an essential contribution to this really distinct sound that they have that they've basically been riding since the 90s and though I would never say every band should aspire to sound like cake I think things would be a little bit more interesting if every band tried to sound maybe as distinct as cake because the thing is with these guys you know who you're listening to in a snap here it's cake as you've always heard them these really prominent groovy bass lines sharp guitars bright horns and John McRae's pronouncing correctly thick Basie vocal jammed right up there into the microphone and the interplay between these guys too is always a treat the thing is even when their music is heavily arranged and very planned out they still sound like they're jamming and there's talent here especially in the storytelling which is pretty much always what has attracted me to this band who sure cake has written love songs relationship songs but there are so many tracks that they have put together that are so outside of the songwriting box commissioning a symphony and see meanwhile Rick James opera singer the distance Frank Sinatra stick shifts and safety belts these are just a few who the hell writes songs about this and this tradition carries on to the showroom of compassion with Italian guy a really weird track talking about an Italian guy in a pinstripe suit who's nodding and squinting and nodding and squinting and even though I feel like I have nothing that makes me relate to this song I am NOT this Italian guy I don't know this Italian guy it creates an image in my head that I just feel glued to but also on the cell peak cake makes a couple of attempts at writing songs with words that are a little less esoteric like the single here sick of you which is really catchy can't deny that but it's not exactly like the lyrics are gonna jump off the page if you were to write them out but musically the album is really engaging strong hooks great melodies great recording and what I love is how cake can maintain a style just maintain a sound while jumping from genre to genre to genre on the last track they go for some real baroque pop instrumentation on bound away they do a heavy heavy country thing which I haven't heard them do to that extent since their first LP motorcade of generosity got some piano boundary on the winter also a sultry instrumental on teenage pregnancy just a few things that stood out to me so overall this album is just kind of cake being cake if you've heard their previous stuff this will be no surprise I promise the bad side of cake basically sounding the same being that same band for me is that the question comes up does this LP fill a void or fill an interest that their previous five don't already do for me or just those first four for me that question is still kind of unanswered I know I like it but will I come back to it and I'm not going to know the answer to that until I basically put this thing down and maybe two weeks from now I'll sit there thinking to myself humming a song from this album saying damn that cake album is good I want to go listen to it again you've got to let something go and then you know it's true love if it comes back right now I'm feeling a decent seven on this thing it could grow on me but it's just decent pop music what are you gonna do you guys know that I'm into the experimental stuff I'm into the noisy stuff I'm into the Avant stuff but sometimes I just want to sit back and chill and enjoy something simple and sweet so if you guys have heard the LP what did you think about it did you love it did you hate it why do we even like cake do you hate cake is it just not for you and what should I review next and I feel that I should be congratulated for making a review with absolutely no metaphors involving eating or baking or icing or tasting cake yeah Anthony Fantana cake showroom of compassion forever now you'll remember how we had each episode at the drop it out black you'll need that put your thumbs up and say drop it out wait 
RBaxe3kCsZo,has this ever happened to you let's say there's a venue with a stage and it's called froggies palace now there's all these people there the show is going on everybody's having a good time and the singers on stage and he's like hey everybody we're killer corn collective hotel you went to the show with a friend both of you are illustrated as read here you're chilling enjoying a bass solo but then some person or persons in front of you illustrated in puke green realizes a friend of theirs is standing behind you or you and your friend he's like oh hey sup bro and he proceeds to basically high-five the guy over you and your friends head and this eventually evolves into both hands getting in the mix and once that happens they start grabbing at each other and squeezing each other with you and your friend kind of locked into this abomination you're trapped and it basically seems like there's no way out now this squeeze goes on until the friend in front hugs his other friend until that friend is in front of you now this is what is called a concert hug and it is destroying the very fabric of America it's also making shows a lot less fun to go to now there are some unwritten rules to concerts that we all follow like if you weigh 400 pounds you do not stage dive and if you wait 399 pounds you do not stage dive I feel personally that concert hugs should be one of these rules no concert hug if you're at a concert and you got friend and they're like three or four people behind you and you want to talk with that friend don't be a D and pull that person forward reason with the people behind with you talk with them they're into the same band as you you must at least have a little bit in common can my friend come up is that okay do you mind is that all right or if that friend of yours is really what's going to make this concert boss and make it what it needs to be make it awesome be cool and just excuse yourself back there you know give your space to the person behind you hey I want to go see my friend over there you want to stand over here it's closer closer closer to the stick you'll be with your friend everyone's happy all is right with the world you have good karma and it's just etiquette y'all so has this ever happened to you or have you done this have you concert hugged and if you have did you know it's a sin in the eyes of our Lord and Savior Frank Zappa did you know that oh thanks up question of the week Anthony Fantan Oh concert hugs for never 
iE5p3GCzoxI,all pigs must die oh okay yeah this don't get excited about this because this is not it this is not the thing this is not the kitten caboodle this is not where this ends for sure the camera that I've been using pretty much everyday for the past two years the bed the irony is that the camera that I bought the nice new very very expensive camera that I'm going to be using is still on the way in the mail but I still need to make videos I still need to make videos so I had to go out and buy another camera just to hold myself over until the new new nice new camera finally gets here so I don't know right now this camera may grow on me may keep it it's pretty nice so far um but expect this to get nicer once I figure things out and the new camera actually comes in the mail in the meantime hi my needle drops hitting Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I'm sorry for that if if you're new to the channel obviously as I just said this is a new camera and this is the first time I'm going in widescreen and enjoying it I think so as I promised in yesterday's video today we're going to be reviewing some metal can you smell it can you smell it that's the smell of rotting flesh metal music smell the band is all pigs must die to have a new self-titled EP on the non-believer label me and there's a lot of buzz around these guys simply because of their ties to other maybe more popular bands and that sort of seems like a subject that they don't want glorified so we'll kind of stray away from that now if your 2010 had been rocked by new releases from nails or trap them or black breath I see no reason why you couldn't get down with this five-track EP it is 19 minutes and is a sonic firestorm of angry Hellfire that same classic hardcore punk sound that informed offs new album informs this thing - but all pigs must die reads into metal as much as they read into punk music you've got a lot of pummeling thrash riffs and pretty technical drums that I'm sure a lot of people will liken to Slayer and you've also got really intense speeds tempos and some solos that do not waste any time just really quick to the point kind of a nice little transition from one section of the song to the other and of course there are breakdowns here too which I kind of have a love-hate relationship with but here they're executed pretty well like at the end of the track die ignorant where the band slows down to incorporate a totally different riff or section of the song as opposed to shooting for the machismo cliche and just chugging the same mindlessly for an entire minute and aside from the playing the production is a really strong point on this LP - just guitar tones and drum sounds that are as abusive as the attitude that all pigs must die has but I would expect nothing less of curve from converge because he produced this thing I would say here the one issue for me about this EP is the vocal style not that it was performed badly or that the lyrics are written badly but I've just heard a lot of metallic hardcore that sort of fits into this mold it's kind of difficult for me to separate this angry band from every other angry band because everybody's angry I'm angry you're angry aren't we but I will say for something that isn't totally original this is performed and put together extremely extremely well I'm feeling strong six to a light seven on this I liked it but wasn't really fallen in love with it I definitely think it's worth checking out links down there in the D box where you can hear it I want to mention before I get out of here that on the needle drop calm sort of a double dose of metal review whatever I also gave a track review of a song from the nuke off album that's also linked down there like I said it's a cast not a video so if you're looking for something slow something heavy something brooding definitely check that out alright I'll see you guys tomorrow forever 
qrq1QohxWwU,jay-j kill hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest busiest busiest music nerd I hope everyone's doing well gonna do an album review or a mixtape review but before we get too far into this a few things to mention I got a comment saying that maybe the metal drops have been neglected and considering that my last metal review was over a month ago I'd have to agree link down there in the D box to the metal EP which I'm planning on reviewing the new all pigs must die release a pretty intense hardcore right there also in the B box its remix Wednesday hey download for remixes over at our website Kills is a new mixtape released by the Swedish synth pop duo JJ they've put out two albums and a couple EBS over the past few years and have gotten a lot of acclaim for their tight Dancy beats their breathy vocals and really dreamy sound effects they dropped kills as a free download on Christmas Eve and I am really happy this is a Christmas present that I waited to open because it would have ruined my holiday but first let's get an expert opinion from Cal Church esta on this mixtape before we touch down on any tracks cow kills hay murders against the lab and it should stay that way he just gets worse and worse I can't pad this out with anything nice to say because I just don't have many things that are nice to say leather than that the track was a pretty worthwhile pop tune and kill them as nice it samples the books or really actually kind of samples a sample that they sampled on their sample based album the way out on kills JJ samples a lot of popular music from 2010 for example one of the best rap tracks to me of the year Kanye West's power they also sample even now Cruz's pronouncing that correctly dynomite mi a's paper planes is in here some biggie some dr. dre some jay-z first off the vocals the vocals the vocals the vocals let's call a spade a spade here I'm just gonna say that on this mixtape anyway Elly has about as much personality as a flat 2 liter of soda mixtapes are nice in that they're a little convenient it's an easy way to put out new stuff in that you're borrowing from somebody else so half the work is done for you however there's kind of a danger here because you do risk being overshadowed by the original and that definitely happens here on most of these tracks at best a lot of these songs are like an alright karaoke session however karaoke involves singing and I can't even give JJ that because for the most part there really isn't much singing on this album that is an auto-tuned to the point where it's offensive the worst example is the MIAA sampled kill you it's sort of like an auto-tuned solo throughout the entire track it's really relentless and just bugs me to death and the auto-tune isn't even limited to the singing parts spoken vocals are also auto-tune throughout this album as if it adds something interesting I'm really happy they didn't auto-tune any of the rap verses and the lyrics at a lot of the parts on this thing toes get crunk get drunk these haters in the club why are all of these freezes usually found in radio wrap on this dreamy indie pop mixtape irony I don't know there is no possible way I could call this thing a success for me personally from a personal standpoint its opinion kind of feeling like a light 3 out of this thing sorry but link down there in the D box where you can hear this thing what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it and why and what should I review next anthony Fantana JJ kills you 
j48qLgyg7PE,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd hope y'all are doing one this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic experimental music of the independent persuasion first track review of 2011 forever Interpol thumbs and there are a couple other things I want to get into before we start the review number one steve brule steve brule everybody sort of seemed to have caught my subtle steve brule reference in yesterday's video and the thing is wasn't intentional well I didn't write it out I would blame it more on the fact that I got awesome show seasons 1 2 & 3 for Christmas and I've pretty much been watching them non-stop and so it's influencing me in ways that I could have never imagined and the title of this track review may be confusing you a little bit not only am I going to review a James Blake song but I've also reviewed a mad villain song for an avalanche slash victory lap a new mad villian song link down there in the d box to the needle drop calm it's an audio slash podcast slash listen thing only audio-visual no visual thing review not a video so if you like them bill listen to the mad villain if you like James Blake stay here and watch the video or do both not at the same time so on yesterday's video I also got quite a bit of comments telling me that I need to review the new James Blake album that's coming out in February the one problem is that February is a long ways away and I kind of feel bad that I didn't get a chance to or I just didn't make enough effort to talk this guy up in 2010 when he was kind of tearing up the EP circuit with what seemed to be like three pretty solid releases that ended up on a lot of year-end lists if you don't know him James Blake is a UK electronic music composer producer and a music video for this track which is going to be on that forthcoming album dropped in October it's gotten over a million views right now so some of y'all may be familiar with it already it's a cover of the Feist song limit to your love I don't usually do covers on here but let's let's listen see what it has to offer Wow that was seriously a treat that was nice I just love the I love the sobering piano ballad rehear and not only is Blake a great electronic music producer not only can he you know put together a great sound set but he can carry a tune as well a good singer good singer now when you say something is electronic music I feel like that kind of comes with some assumptions let me just say the synthesized elements of this song are very very very understated this is mostly a piano tune but once you move through that first section of the track you get this low-end earthquake just bubbling underneath the music it also kind of sounds like maybe a helicopter propeller or something like that great sound really trippy really kind of screws with your head just the texture of it just the frequency of it and also it's kind of stark contrast from just the vocals and the piano even though it's very quiet it stands out like a sore thumb sticks out there's also a lot of subtlety in the vocals these little splashes of dub echo just really nice touch and what you're getting into the halfway point of the song you have this ride cymbal could be sampled could be looped but kind of what's grabbing your attention at this point is the vocal and how it's morphing it's mutating it's kind of sounding like something Fever Ray would do on her latest solo LP though James bleak does not lay it on heavy with the chorus effects but it still adds just enough texture just enough progression just enough of a different sound to feel like this is moving somewhere and the thing is he doesn't have to use a lot of chorus effects because everything in this song is just so quiet and just so bleak and just so simple and even Feist's original version is pretty quiet too but I think it's pretty funny James Blake decides he's gonna outdo the song but he's gonna outdo the song by understating it as opposed to just you know adding more instrumentation and just making it really lavish you're turning it into a big Hollywood Las Vegas number I'm gonna give this thing a strong eight and now I kind of see why so many people have been messaging me about this album I'm pretty excited about it now - I'm really impressed on this song yeah let me know what you guys think down there in the comments and also if you listened to the mad villain review that I linked down there in the d box let me know what you think of that - do you like that track do you not like it do you like this track do you not like it and why Anthony Fantana James Blake limit to your love forever 
tmgAH3ytu0Y,m.i.a Vicki leeks hi everybody Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's 2011 and we're going to do an album review or a mixtape review but before we get into that down there if you're on youtube just want to let you know that there's a link to where you can stream the new teen day's album on our website the needle drop calm it's pretty boss and there's also a link down there to where you can stream the new Decemberists LP it's up there at NPR music if you go over to their website they're good people represent alright so I got some requests for this new here mi a mixtape Vicky leaks and as many of you may already know I was not the biggest fan of mi A's last album tracks like xxx so we're just way too poppy for me and meanwhile you had songs like Born Free that we're really wild and distorted but just did not hold my interest here on the production side of this mixtape II of Blackstar Diplo Rusco Danza basically the same group of people that were working on Maya but mi a is aimed for something a little bit different this time around all of the noise and cacophony that made my is so difficult is still kind of here so some of you may want to steer clear of this but what I find so interesting about this mixtape is that it pulls 19 tracks together into this 36 minute uninterrupted mega mix of world beat rhythms it's kind of like a DJ set I might hear on this public radio show that I like afropop worldwide where they may play a lot of modern African dance music with a lot of odd samples and heavy Beach that's kind of the sound that she abandoned a little bit on Maya so in a way this thing is kind of these two different sides of mi a colliding this new noisier more electronic more experimental more cacophonous sound put together with maybe the aesthetic of her first LP where she is playing with a lot of these African influences as far as beats are instrumentals go I'm liking this thing a lot more than I did Maya even though there are a few spots here where I pick up music sampled from that album I love the relentless percussion on super-tight and the vocal sample on let me help you despite that title is pretty freakin catchy m.i.a even revisits some of those dubstep sounds that you played with on Maya and you know what I like them a lot more this time around than I did in that first impression plus there's some auto-tune here that I'm really surprised did not piss me off in terms of vocals m.i.a has not done a 180 for this mix tape or anything like that if you were disliking her on kala you're probably going to dislike her here she's got some interesting things to say some witty lines here and there but she's no Queen of the mic and the thing is to me she's never really been so that's not really something I expected of her on this I love her swagger I love her personality but there's always some kind of prevalent reminder on this mixtape that there is a bit of an amateur element going on to a sway sway sway sway sway sway sway sway woo swag plus you've got these spots and lyrics where m.i.a talks about haters and drama hmmm blogs and I'm not m.i.a so I know that I do not see the brunt of the hate that is lobbed at her however I kind of get the feeling that m.i.a likes talking about her haters more than her haters actually like talking about her and yeah sure Vicky leaks there's obviously a political message here there always is with m.i.a even if it does take a little bit of work to interpret it and some people get down on that whether it's because they disagree or they've heard mi a make maybe a misguided statement or two in the past all I know is that if I avoided music solely because of the political bias of the musician making the music I wouldn't listen to both half of the albums that I do for sure if you love experimental dance music world be mega mixes or even if you're looking for something to work out to in the gym I would go for it plus it's frickin free just download it you turkey I'm feeling it decent to a strong six on this thing it to me by no means was amazing I felt like the lyrics and the vocals could have been brought up to the level of the beats and the instrumentation a little bit more but down there link to hear it tell me what you guys think do you love it do you hate it why and seriously now that we're into 2011 we have new releases coming down the pipe hit me up in the comments let me know what you think I should review next or consider reviewing in the near future once the release date hits Anthony Fantana thanks for watching guys mi a Viki leaks forever 
Cw0jTXZBwDY,Chadd t sol can you even see me since dude oh here we go girlfriend got me this shirt Anthony Fantan oh here everybody hope all y'all are doing well and I'm shooting what I assume is going to be my last video of 2010 next time I put out a video it's gonna be 2011 before I get into this I want to make a huge announcement link down there in the D box what has two thumbs and was featured on the front page of YouTube's trends blog this guy this guy my favorite albums of 2010 video is right there on the front page pretty amazing just go check it out check it out check it out check it out so what does one do at a time like this reviews music review music of course I mean it's like review music so we do here come on we're gonna talk about the new shad album t sol a while ago maybe not more than a week when I said I was kind of in a hip-hop mood somebody suggested that I check out this album and when I checked it out I discovered an MC who to me is really admirable shad is Canadian this is his third LP coming off of the high of the Polaris Prize nominated second album that he put out and if you like your hip-hop to stay away from all of that bragging from all of that tough-guy bull then this should most definitely get you going rather than rapping about himself endlessly shad hops from subject to subject love racism politics family the rap game all that socially conscious jazz and when he actually does get around to talking about himself it's not necessarily a pretty sight the world sucks we all know this and I feel for an emcee to come along and just rap about that is no real feat anybody could do that however if someone can be poetic about it if somebody can be very clever about it if somebody can make a listener think if someone can make a listener sympathize that to me is a talent that to me is a skill and bringing thought-provoking wordplay to the table is something that shad definitely does their tracks on here like Rose Garden and yeah I get it that send a lot of messages in the rhymes on a lot of levels but don't weigh themselves down in a ton of depressing emotions so there's a positivism there but then again there's this reality thing they're going on to like yeah things are hard but we don't necessarily need to beat ourselves up over it however there are points here where I'm really not enjoying the album all that much tracks that to me are kind of like a tear-stained diary page like telephone for example I don't mind tracks like this from a lyrical perspective though what I don't like is when the track basically tries to force these depressing emotions down your throat by using all of this sad sappy instrumentation slow R&B vocals it just feels like you're trying too hard at that point to get some tears welling in the listeners eyes and there are just a handful of hooks on this album that I just can't get down with like a good name for example where shad gets his name spelled out in the hook sh-sh ad it's an O M ETH OD man but whatever and on the track we are the ones where he's trying to sing and the really difficult melody there on that chorus line just not doing too much for me when it comes to rhymes here shad is really on the ball the only issue I really have is that he uses a lot of similes and I know that's popular in rap don't freak out don't freak out all I'm saying is that he goes a little overboard with them this is like that that is like this there's a lot of that thrown around for the most part I just wish the beats and the production were a little bit better in some ways this album actually reminds me of a rap LP I love a lot fashion's Boy Meets World however it's really only reminding me of that not amazing me as much as that is what I'm trying to say now that I know about this guy and I see that he has a good thing going I'm gonna be watching him I just hope that he tears it up on some mixtapes in the near future I think that would be pretty awesome overall for me it's a likeable album I didn't feel like I was anywhere close to falling in love with it though which you know it's kind of making me feel a strong six maybe a light seven on this thing but if you're into hip-hop if you're looking for some rap with an alternative personality then most definitely check this out it's worth the listen okay shad T sol the needle drop Anthony Fantana forever 
oxiaceqXWbA,"fifteen K Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd how's everybody doing it's time for an album review as you guys know I just broke 15,000 subscribers on the channel thanks to you for spreading the word being supportive / awesome and agreeing to disagree when we don't see eye to eye I'm still having a busy week today just like yesterday's video so don't mind me if I stick to the straight and narrow on this new gorillaz album you know sorry Cal oh it's alright I'm not that funny anyway we know well coming off the release of what seems to be one of my favorite albums of 2010 Plastic Beach gorillas have released an album of what seems to be after thoughts you can stream it on their wiki and I guess it's also a free download if you're a part of their super special secret fan club and what seems to be the biggest selling point of this album or just what everybody seems to be bringing up all the time is that it was recorded and mixed on Damon Albarn's iPad over the course of their American tour this past year and I'd really like to avoid discussing this at length simply because I'm more interested in whether or not the music on the album is good as opposed to what it was recorded on plus I've never made music with an iPad so I have no clue what the the thing's capabilities and limitations really are so I'm just going to stick to what I observed between the tracks here now first off I would be lying to you if I did not say that I felt there was at least a little bit of filler action going on with this album guys you're not getting so much songs here as you are a lot of soundscapes short little instrumentals sampled voices and uh Nev all the concepts about a third of the album is built out of these brief quirky electronic piece some of them really explorative and sprawling like the speakit mountains and others more beat heavy straightforward and bumpin like the song detroit but even when i come to like a melody or a beat here and this goes for pretty much all the tracks not just these instrumentals none of the sounds or the textures really grabbed me as having much personality unlike Plastic Beach here nothing is really post produced or floured up to sound all that inviting or sexy if you've ever wanted to hear a very raw side of gorillas here you go but me I kind of feel like I'm eating a freshly grilled steak which is fine it's a freshly grilled steak but there are no side dishes no garnish no salt no pepper no marinade no spices I would even argue you didn't even get a plate or a fork or a knife to eat the thing with it's just a cooked steak so the instrumental side of this album really is not doing it for me just simply based on that reason alone however on the song year side of this album that is a word there are some really awesome moments that I would love to see fleshed out re-recorded revisited Albarn has a great vocal delivery on the song shy town and I just love the cold sensual funk feel of that track really sticks out in my head but I think my favorite song on the album is actually Bobby in Phoenix which surprised me with a lot of acoustic guitar and even as a little b-side Bobby's voice is fan mm tastic the issue for me is that moments like that are pretty few and far between and I find myself skipping over a lot of tracks just to get to them when I'm listening to this album over and over plus there are a lot of tracks here I just cannot stand like the Joplin hillbilly man the opener of this album to all have really obnoxious electronics or effects a lot like some of my least favorite songs on Plastic Beach actually like sweepstakes or glitter fries but the thing is if those tracks on Plastic Beach to me they're still worth listen because they are post produced really well they do have a lot of additional instrumentation and them they do have a lot of subtleties these tracks lack all of that extra production so they don't sound nearly as pretty or as entertaining or as inviting or as detailed or just basically as anything on the fall these synthesizers just sound really rough and unfinished and just not something I would want to listen to when I have an album like demon days at my fingertips so believe me when I say there are diamonds here but they're really really really in the rough for sure so honestly I have very very very mixed feelings on this album and I know a lot of y'all are going to say Anthony it's not that bad it's not that bad man and I have to agree it's not that bad if you're a gorilla's fan and you deeply loved their three albums and you really want to explore into the mind of Damon Albarn a little bit further because this is definitely an opportunity to do that and yeah it's also not a bad album if you just downloaded it or streamed it for free would you pay for this album that's another question because it is supposed to get a physical release in 2011 but who cares what I say you can listen to the album for free go listen to it on gorillas website form your own opinion and after you do that come back here and tell me what you thought of it did you love this album did you hate it and why does it matter that this was recorded on an iPad should it have been recorded on something else or is it perfect the way it is Anthony Fantana guerrillas the fall forever you you "
Uu1_BYX8ars,hello hello hello hello hello everybody Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review I'm gonna put on a sweater because it's cold okay I don't have a ton of time today so this review will have to be a quick one I want to say a couple things hope everybody had a good holiday over this past week hope everybody is relaxed and I've been hearing a lot of chatter about this new gorillaz album the fall should I review that tomorrow that's your question give me an answer in the comments so new album from the main duo big blood said to be a pretty prolific outfit and from what I've read they even put out several albums this year and even though they have put out stuff on vinyl officially release stuff before you're more likely to find this band's music on a CD are as opposed to a record label dark country magic is their latest release and i would love to recommend this to anybody who is into folk music experimental music drone music and psychedelic music all of these ideas come together into this dizzyingly bad trip of an album it's like being high out of your gourd and stuck in the woods and there's absolutely no hope of escape because you're surrounded by trees and dead leaves and you cannot make heads or tails of your surroundings because everything is neon colored and blurry their points where this thing reminds me of the band woods with the odd effects and the weird noises reversed guitar solos lots of reverb on the vocals very rough drums though I would argue these guys are a lot less rock and pop influenced really going for more of a linear song structure just letting their songs swell and grow more guitars in the background more strings in the background just more everything until it becomes just this voluminous cacophonous mess to me the vocals are the most distinct thing this band has going for them and there are some points where they really remind me of joanna newsom just have that really odd joanna newsom vocal vibe to them that I can't quite explain they just add to the very dark menacing mood of this album for sure my only real problem with this album as a complete piece is that it doesn't keep up that mood it doesn't really keep up any idea for the entire LP you have some filler tracks like this is record okay or moo-hoo at the tail end of this thing even the intro could have been brought in with the second track of the album some pretty uneventful tracks like air raid air raid and waiting is and then you've got this one track of the tail end of this LP coming home part three which I just could not get into it all just because it's it seems to be much more of a light bright easygoing track kind of a lost love song all that aside tracks like creep and crazy time have an amazing hook that just gets gigantic or even a song like she wanderer i love the arrangements around that i love the vocal melody around that just very eerie very haunting extremely memorable this album definitely has more good than bad going on for it and kind of reminds me of a combination of joanna newsom like i said earlier devendra banhart and Jefferson Airplane I know that's a weird combination of artists to be putting together but it's probably the closest comparison I could really conjure for this band i'm going to highly recommend that you check this thing out because it does have some extremely extremely standout tracks and moments plus it's free so you can't go wrong just download it whatever link down below i could have seen this thing dropping onto my favorite albums of 2010 list if it had been released earlier but whatever that's the breaks i'm like a decent too strong 7 on this but like i said this thing is downloadable free give it a listen and let me know in the comments what you thought of it loving it hating it why anthony Fantana big blood dark country magic forever you you

szIb95UJ2YY,Hey it's track review Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hi everyone hope everybody is doing well on the build-up to Christmas its track reviews to track reviews two days in a row guys where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion I have a couple things I want to mention before I get into this review number one on the needle drop comm room now you can check out new holiday songs from beach house and jesu and the last thing that I want to get into in this video is the uproar on yesterday's video in the comments on my review of little bees track I'm Miley Cyrus it seems like there were a lot of people who were mad as to why I would review such a song or why did I not give it a zero as opposed to a - and a lot of other fun statements as well to answer the question as to why I would review one of this guy's songs I'm curious as to why he's getting popular and you can't get all the information you need or want on an artist by simply reading their Wikipedia a lot of information comes from discussing the music and reading the points of view of those who are fans of a certain band or rapper or whatever and a lot of people commented and a few people even messaged me with the kind of information I was looking for and I thank those individuals because even though I'm not a huge fan of little B I am curious because I may actually be dealing with his music a little bit more in the future but yeah I bring up an artist I bring up a song I bring up an album you guys comment and this creates a discussion and that's what this channel is about if in case you don't remember discussing music and some of you may say hey wait a second wait a second Anthony wait wait wait one minute I like discussing good music more than I like discussing bad music and you may say that however I know for a fact that that's not true because if we look at the comments for the videos that I've put up over the past few days the little B video has almost two times as many comments as the videos that I've given positive reviews for this past week which I'm also kind of sad to see because I really did like that Ghostface Killah album so even though you guys don't like bad music what you're communicating to me is that bad music facilitates more discussion than good music hmm so when I recommend to you an album or song that you do like and you don't say anything you're communicating to me that it's not worth discussing so remember everybody life is a test and every time you do something and every time you don't do something you pick an answer you fill in a blank and you have to be careful with the answers that you pick because if you pick the wrong answer you just might so be careful and here's my favorite comment from yesterday it seems that I'm just a clueless white boy who would have no possible way of understanding the deep and vast complexities of an artist such as Lil B oh wait in artiste I will say I'm Miley Cyrus I'm highly sad little B rant end alright guys picture of the album that this track comes from the new REM the forthcoming REM LP collapse into now their fifteenth studio album set for release next year they've put out a track from the album for the release it's called discover link in the de box to where you can hear it and let's see what's up first off I can't say that song was love at first listen but I am looking forward to reviewing the full-length album when it comes out basically there's nothing too groundbreaking here three minutes of chorus and verse I love the intro to this track though that gets me really excited what sounds like kind of throbbing keyboards going on in the background with these sharp guitars just a nice build up to the very first verse of this the base is in a really nice pocket in the mix it doesn't feel overwhelming and yet it has a nice push to it and the guitars are really jangling and just kind of ring out almost to the point where they are like a drone and just the ambience of this sound or the ambience whatever you want to call it really reminds me of The Velvet Underground's venus and furs are like gypsy music something like that just very minor tone dark but also light and pretty rhythmic also a little bit like rolling stones painted black vocals on this thing are pretty great as well um Michael Stipe has still got it good job not only did I like the way that the reverb made the vocals sound is slightly bouncy just a very nice bouncy echo but I really liked the vocal delivery the most I think that was the most impressive aspect of this track I like how Michael just doesn't stick to a tempo just doesn't stick to a simple melody but it's more as if he's doing spoken word on this song I think the only aspect of this track that I didn't really like and you guys are free to disagree with me all you like that's completely fine but I didn't really like the build-up into the chorus where the guitar was like Danny I can take a day on iogicai that to me kind of just lifts the foggy cloudy mood around this song just that smokey kind of hookah bar harem feel that this song has and though it's okay to kind of break away from that it does it at a really breakneck pace just BAM introduces it and it's kind of a hard wall and to me just not not a very good way of breaking that ice I did like the hook though which for the most part is built up of the lyric Discoverer but despite that is catchy as hell I could definitely see myself going back to this track a couple more times before this album actually gets released but like I said it's not really love at first listen for me at least at least this song has me expecting a decent album a tolerable album of listenable a likable album like a strong six a light seven on this but I want to know what the REM fans think for those of you have been listening to all if not most of their 14 previous studio albums they have been releasing music for so long and it have been pretty consistent in doing that what could you possibly expect from them on this new album a big change much of the same let me know Anthony Fantana REM discover track reviews dr. Dre forever you 
qQrvfibimlk,"it's track review hello my needle drops you have any Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion I haven't done a track review in a while and lately I've been feeling like I'm in a hip-hop mood or something I just want to listen to a lot of hip-hop I want to review hip-hop I want to talk about hip hop so I kind of wanted to touch down on an artist too I've been kind of waiting to talk about just because he puts out so much stuff and I kind of wanted to get a better grip of exactly what his deal is before I said anything his name is little B or the basedgod he's a member of the California hip-hop outfit the pack who actually put out an album this year too but think that little B he's 20 and allegedly has released over 1,000 tracks this year he has dozens of music videos all over YouTube some independent albums a ton of official mixtapes on the internet as well the guy is extremely extremely prolific and if there's one thing I admire about him you got to give it to a guy for being ambitious it's really kind of hard to pin him down I think he's just trying a bunch of different styles just to get all these hip-hop fans ears in on what he's doing and he has so much stuff out there that it's kind of difficult to just say oh little be sucked the thing is you could just be stumbling across his discography and find 2 or 3 songs you like after you found one that you hate so we're going to listen to a track from his red flame mixtape not to be confused with the evil red flame mixtape yeah I'm Miley Cyrus I know there are a lot of hip-hop fans that watch my video so if you know more about this than I do then please speak up that's all I ask but that was terrible and god-awful and there was no excuse to be making music like that today in this day and age but here's the thing I've heard little B rap before on tracks that were pretty great songs that he's done with the pack or even videos that he's done himself like death of rap or pull your pants up but then again he puts out tracks like this or tracks like I'm Paris Hilton or tracks like pretty boy and then spit a line like hos on my cuz I look like Jesus so there's this side of him that to me seems like he could be a decent rapper and he's getting a lot of momentum right now in the hip-hop scene and he's getting a lot of coverage in hip-hop magazines and it seems like he's maybe going to be putting out some albums next year that are a little more professionally produced working with some bigger names so if he does have this potential in him we're going to see that but as of right now I feel like most of the time there's not a lot of quality control in here not just with the tracks that he releases but even the lines that he decides to spit in the tracks that are pretty good right now there are a ton of tracks like I'm Miley Cyrus out there that to me kind of feel like he's either releasing them because one they're kind of like ear worms I mean how do you forget a line as ridiculous as on Miley Cyrus I'm Miley Cyrus I might be versus in between the hook pretty underwhelming and almost pointless almost like he's just coming up with it off the top of his head it doesn't give him how it sounds and there's also another element to this he could be releasing so much music on the internet and not giving a crap about the quality just because the chances of stumbling upon his stuff are that much greater I think it's interesting that even in an age of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy where the production is fantastic and lush just gorgeous for the most part you still have a huge following in the hip-hop community or just any music community in general for this kind of grassroots do-it-yourself working on your own kind of stuff because if you look up little B's music videos they do not look like big productions they look like they were made on a very very very tight budget so I'm kind of struggling with what the point of this song is um it's kind of funny it's ridiculous and if I am going to return to it it's pretty much going to be for that reason I'm feeling like a decent two on this honestly like a decent - a light - it's it's pretty bad there are better little B tracks but I'm just kind of working out a way to figure out who this guy is or what exactly he's going to do in the future Anthony Fantan Oh little B Miley Cyrus forever you you "
6urd4Zke2os,Ghostface Killah Apollo kids hi everybody Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review I want to thank everybody first before we get into this review who came out to the blog TV last night was freaking awesome at a great time follow us on Twitter and Facebook for updates as to when we are going to do another blog TV in the near future I hope and also on the needle drop calm there's a little bit of music I want to direct your attention to a new album that you can stream and download from the band sensual harassment good name interesting cover lo-fi creepy weird synth pop do it up let's get right into it this is Apollo kids the latest album from wu-tang clan member Ghostface Killah if you don't know who that is you don't know rap go back listen to 36 chambers listen to his verses on Liquid Swords listen to his first album iron man then you will know your shoe cow who's your favorite wu-tang member well you know I really like the juicer and you know don't get me wrong I really like Ghost Buster over here but I think my favorite member has got to be all dirty bathroom I hate counter chesta well ghost face is easily one of my favorite members of wu-tang and the reason why is just his speedy flow his in-your-face attitude and just the pitch of his voice always catches my attention no matter what he sounds like this uppity hype man who finally got his chance to headline the show there was a lot of booze around this LP before it got released and it was mostly around the features list of this thing even though together and how you like me baby were great songs to drop before the release of this album once you read the credits you knew that this thing was like the 90s all over again you God Raekwon Redman Method Man busta rhymes Cappadonna all on here spittin fire and jizz oh how could I forget Jessa and the production brings that same nostalgia to just bangin beats a lot of soul samples just screw the R&B hooks screw the auto-tune screw all the distractions basically all the stuff that Ghostface was doing out his last album so unquestionably this thing in a lot of ways is a return to form and just kind of a middle finger to all the BS that I think was weighing Ghostface down and keeping him from doing what he does best rapping and the samples here are great I love the huge female chorus on the opening of this thing the bandido sounds on black tequila the eerie organ on the track drama that was even a spot where I heard the hook for the song shout sampled but I think my favorite sample here on this album is easily ghetto with this female vocal from a soul track and what I think is funny is that she'll kind of sing this line and then when the verses come in they'll bounce they'll play off of that and tell a story beyond what it's like to make bread in the ghetto what it's like to deal with rats in the ghetto rats some people might get down on the features list here and that's completely understandable there are a few moments here where you don't hear Ghostface rap until a couple verses in which is a little weird but when that does happen it's mostly because wu-tang members are rapping before him and he's been doing this stuff with these guys for years and when that kind of stuff does go down it's like they're working on putting together a story they're doing it as a unit as opposed to one guy waiting for his turn to spit his shoe as far as other features go guys like Jim Jones in the game even though they are kind of critically acclaimed just don't do too much for me about Ghostface has still got it even at age 40 yeah he's 40 on the whole this LP is really nothing new it's not one of these albums that are out there today forging a new path with rap by breeding it with electronics and pop and rock music a lot like Kanye or Kid Cudi have been doing lately but despite its lack of innovation this is kind of an instance of if it ain't broke don't fix it just leave it alone what's wrong with Beats and stories and rhymes this thing is not a big mind-blowing production in fact this is pretty raw and a little rough around the edges a lot like a mixtape but I mean that in the most complimentary way possible I'm feeling a strong 7 to a late 8 on this I may put it on love list and you guys have you've heard this if you're ruechang fan Ghostface fan hip hop fan let me know what you're thinking of this thing do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantino Ghostface Killah the needle drop what should i review next forever you 
9EIhfqzJEnk,it's a baby tree hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and list week is over it is so over so I'm probably going to spend the rest of this month reviewing things that maybe I should have already and I will also be wondering why the hell Ghostface Killah is releasing an album so late into the year should I review this this week let me know a couple of things I want to get into before the review the ban big blood a psychedelic folk rock outfit has a new album out on the free music archive it is totally free free free and its really tickling my ears right now I'm liking it a lot link there in the D box also I want to give a rest in peace to the one the only Captain Beefheart and also I wanted to alert you to a situation involving visual artists Steven Kastner of course you and I both know him from his images his album art from his posters he's created four artists including Isis suma son Justin K Broderick word around the campfires that he has fallen ill and means some help I asked you if that you're a fan of this man's artwork if his artwork has touched you in some way shape or form head down there in the D box for instructions or just info on how you can help and also before I get into this review I want to thank you guys not only for just being really awesome and being really positive during this week and understanding that yes this is just an opinion that's it but also when I named my favorite song this year I can change by LCD soundsystem ollie all went over on the YouTube page for that song and just typed nine pages of needle drop comments pretty insane but really that was extremely flattering alright the review we all knew this would happen that I would put out my lists and then almost immediately after I would find one or two albums that are so good they really should have been on the list somewhere for sure last year I think one of the album's I reviewed that is kind of popular for being shafted with a later review was vectors black future yeah and even though this LP over here is not an epic combination of black and thrash metal it really does deserve some post list love the band is the soul jazz orchestra and the album is Rising Sun there are Canadian outfit and I think their name makes what's going on here pretty apparent right from the get-go a lot of instrumentation ranging from horns to flute to piano even some harp and what I think it's some vibraphone and I love me some jazz vibes thank you milk Jackson thank you the amount of instrumentation here is really too vast to go into great detail with in one video just let it be known that soul jazz really lives up to the word orchestra in their name which is surprising because I feel like their earlier efforts just aren't nearly as gargantuan as this LP here it sounds like the band has dropped all electric instrumentation from organ two guitars and there's not really any lead vocals here either which has kind of been a staple on those past albums the band has really taken this opportunity to concentrate on their instrumental abilities and the effort has paid off in loads of fiery solos never-ending grooves and a fantastic in the moment feel it sounds like these guys are playing live in your headphones the slow whirling intro to this album is just gorgeous and reminds me of something like I'd hear on a modern jazz new album but the LP just kicks into high gear right away with some hard-hitting Afrobeat grooves on egg bara and niggas niggas the heat lowers to a simmer in the middle just churning up the soul influences and the Jazz and winces and the final third of this album is spent exploring Latin sounds my only real issue with this LP is that this last third of the album can be a little bit of a dozer even though they are playing with Latin music most of the time soul jazz waits until the very last track of this album rejoice part 2 to perform it in a very very upbeat fashion which is really how I prefer it other than that the performances and the musicianship are fantastic the recording is great I just love the way this thing sounds it's lush and large like any modern record but it just has this tone this vintage tone that totally comes off like something that was recorded in the 70s that I might find on a compilation from sad way records or analog Africa alright thanks for being awesome thanks for watching this video and what should I review next soul jazz orchestra Rising Sun the needle drop forever Oh Greg thank you for recommending this to me thank you Greg 
yWE3o_6l-WA,albums well hi everybody Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd ah yeah we're here it's been a whole year and we've got to talk about this now before I get into this I want to say a couple things just thank you guys for the amazing 365 days that I've been doing this through 2010 it's been a lot of fun it's been a blast I had no idea that I would go this far in a year basically I came up with the order and the album's on this list by just in my head pitting albums against each other saying to myself which one would I rather listen to which one would I rather listen to screw scores there's no science going on here you guys know by now this is just opinion and if you have any questions about the list if you have any questions like hey why isn't this band on there how come this album isn't number one that kind of stuff I just refer to this link it's also in the D box now yes there are 50 albums on this list but I will be touching down on the first half of it very quickly because I want to get to the other 25 here is the first half of my albums list you should check them out because I think they're pretty cool link in the d-backs honorable mention honorable mention at number 25 we have one of my favorite electronic albums of the year Luke Abbott's Holcomb drones if you're in the synth worship if you're into really odd drum machine beats this is most definitely the thing for you at number 24 easily my favorite mashup album of the year kids and explosions  computer number 23 magic Kids Memphis at number 22 and 21 the tallest man on earth with the Wild Hunt and off with first four EPS at number 20 it's one of the loudest albums I've heard all year nails on silent death and at number 19 an LP that took a while to grow on me but once it did really enjoyable really melodic great songwriting just great attitude and ambience the radio departments clinging to a scheme at number 18 I love this album for its ambition for its eccentricities its catchy song writing Janelle monáe's the arc Android and number 17 Adam greens minor love and at 16 screw the haters MGMT's congratulations I think albums 14 and 15 are where they are for obvious reasons their creativity their greatness I don't feel like I need to make the case for these albums but Arcade Fire with the suburbs and ChromeOS business casual at number 13 one of the most beautifully crafted albums of ambient and instrumental music I've heard all year Brian Eno's small craft on a milk sea number 12 I did not get a chance to review but it's so freakin catchy I can't deny it number 12 Brandon Flowers with flamengo I did not expect it to rank so high but after listening to this album multiple times sort of in the background I just saw it as being more entertaining than a lot of albums I've heard this year even though I was just kind of lukewarm on the single close to done here already y'all with number 11 an album that I expected to hate it but then I listened and I mean actually listened and got really into the cute lyrics the great beats the musicianship the interplay between these guys um they really know how to be a band and they know how to write a catchy tune that I just can't say no to vampire weekend with contra and now we are in top-10 territory number 10 is one of the most brutal exercises in sonic abuse there is a shock value aspect to this album because of how loud it is because of just how abrasive it is however I would argue that once that shock wears off there is more to listen to little women throat to me number nine and number eight don't really need to be explained all that deeply their uniqueness in comparison to many albums that have come out this year for me is pretty much what put them where they are glass or ring and go into Sufis a Sufi and a killer like the little women album that I mentioned earlier this LP really hit me hard because of its tension because of how off-kilter it feels because of how eerie it feels at a lot of moments but also mashes that together with a strong pop sensibility and just a lot of good musicianship I would say women's public strain is very deserving of its spot on this list now number six I did not expect this album to rank so high I said in my original review of this album that even though it wasn't amazing me completely from beginning to end there were songs on here that I would give a ten out of ten for sure no questions asked however I kept returning to this album I kept real istening to it because of those songs that I liked a lot and slowly the tracks that I was kind of lukewarm on and even the tracks that I didn't even care for really really grew on me gorillas Plastic Beach just great frickin album number five should really be no surprise to a lot of you guys I've advocated this band a lot beach house with Teen Dream I just love the beefier dream pop feel that the duo goes for on this album at number four I'm really proud to have this album on here really proud to have a metal album come up so high on this list but I really loved this thing from the moment I heard it and I listened again and again and again and it slowly just grew on me more and more and more very much deserving of a higher score than what I gave it originally a glocks marrow of the Spirit at number three is an electronic album that I loved very early into the year and it stuck with me throughout the year just leaving a lasting impression there was no question that I would like this album when I came back and revisited it for tetes there is lovin you at number two we have an album that I thought about long and hard whether or not this one should actually be number one you guys know I love sample-based music something that advances the idea of that past you know oh here's a pop song that we all like here's a section of it and it's just looped over and over and over this goes much deeper than that to experiment with different sounds with found vocals the books the way out and we have my number one right now and maybe you guys saw this coming after yesterday's video but this album is in the spot that it is not only because it emulates a really strong dance rock and post-punk sound which is just a style of music that I love that's just you know my thing I love beats I love grooves I love something that you can just move to but I also like this album a lot because it's something that whenever I put it on whenever I listen to it it's just good mood inducing no matter how I'm feeling no matter how I'm thinking at this point in my life anyway I can just put this thing on and I feel great I feel upbeat I just feel like I'm taken by the music it's something that I really enjoy and that's all anything this list really comes down to enjoyment if you're enjoying something more than anything else you've heard then that's going to be your number one LCD Soundsystem's this is happening I'm not going to come out here and tell you guys that this is a genius album from the film I don't think it is in fact I feel like James Murphy on this LP more than lcd's previous efforts is a lot less afraid to kind of show where his inspirations and his influences are coming from you really don't even need to read an interview to hear that there's Velvet Underground in this thing that there's David Bowie in this thing that there is Talking Heads in this thing and those just happen to be artists and acts that I love a lot and because of that this thing reliefs struck a chord with me what more can I say maybe some of you are saying yes and maybe some of you are pulling your hair out and you know what that's fine but there's really no reason to it's just my point of view and it's just my list no more significant than anybody else's list just bands and albums that I've really liked from this past year but do let me know in the comments what did you guys like this year does your list look anything like mine what's your favorite album of the year and why Anthony Fantana lists 2010 forever [Music] you

number 50 we have surfer Bloods swim to reach the end this is a song that I remember falling in love with pretty deeply earlier this year just because of its chugging arena rock chords and its epic sound and I also love the little Caribbean transition that this thing makes over its bridge great track at 49 48 and 47 we have Flying Lotus with do the astral plane Duck Sauce with Barbara Streisand and the pains of Being Pure at heart with their new single say no to love at number 46 is a song that I really think my 2010 would have sucked without it's Cee Lo's hmm you I love the track it's obviously gimmicky a little kitschy but still very soulful catchy vocals and y'all know a very memorable hook I can't deny the greatness of this track from a viral perspective plus my review of this song is my most viewed video on YouTube and that's pretty cool at 45 44 and 43 we have Belle and Sebastian with a great track from their new album come on sister Krystal stilts with their new singles shake the shackles and my favorite song from the new Laurie Anderson album another day in America at 42 41 and 40 we have my favorites from new releases from the tallest man on earth burden of tomorrow Owen Pallett Lewis takes off his shirt and twin sister all around and away we go at number 39 its diamond rings with the extremely viral track all your songs and number 38 is my favorite song off of the new roots album how I got over dear God 2.0 even though this LP did not have my favorite rap songs of 2010 on it to me it's easily the most consistent hip-hop album of this year of course the people are really going to disagree with that statement but as far as a rap LP goes this year I loved each song on this album as much as the next so it was hard to kind of pick a favor from this thing at 37 we have future islands with the beat heavy and whimsical opening track from their new release walking through that door at number 36 we have deer hunter with revival 35 blood dries darker from the van woods off their new LP at Echo Lake and the radio department with heavens on fire at number 34 number 33 truly is one of my favorite tracks of the year not just because of its sound but how closely it follows that krautrock blueprint I had big expectations for the album that maybe weren't met on the level that I wanted them to be but I got to give it to here we go magic on the song collector a really badass track great background vocals great guitar sounds great bass line just a lot of retro and vintage sounds this thing that just make it stand out for me at 32 and 31 we have pant the new prints with my favorite from his new album black noise the splendor and we also have that new washed out single you and I featuring chairlifts Caroline pull a check now at 30 is the opening song to the new Arcade Fire album the suburbs the suburbs really great piano sounds on this one wing Butler is as passionate as ever I love his vocal delivery and the hook on this one is great to a fantastic start to this album that I hope you guys are excited to see on my upcoming albums list tomorrow at 29 we have a track that is extremely indebted to the Beach Boys magic kids hey boy at 28 is my favorite track off of the new national album blood buzz Ohio I just love the vocals and rigid drum combination on that one great song great song and 27 one of my favorite singles of the year Fergus and Geronimo's turning blue at 26 is easily the most badass punk song I heard all year ceremonies sick even though this thing takes a little bit just to get started once it gets going the lyrics are really straightforward very political ferocious reminds me of Black Flag's heyday at 25 it's janelle monae with the first single from her new album tight rope with big boy on the track fantastic song and as you guys already know fantastic video at 24 it's adam green's buddy bradley and 23 kind of a pet band of mine civil civic with the song run overdrive off of one of their latest singles a great electro rock duo with heavy drum machines distorted guitars a really interesting outfit that I'm expecting big things from at 22 is a favorite track from an album I actually never got the chance to review the new Brandon Flowers LP flamingos even though I haven't been talking this thing up behind-the-scenes this has really been growing on me I've been giving it a lot of ear time and I just find the songs really catchy even though I was maybe a little lukewarm on crossfire but the song I'm talking about here is was it something I said at number 21 it's happy birthdays girls FM love that track from their new album a really strange lyrical concept though number 20 is DeVos fresh nineteen glass errs mirror Ridge and 18 is the books I didn't know that number seventeen is a song that hit me early this year in a blog TV I believe ChromeOS night by night I love the talkbox I love the beat I just love the harmonized guitars so much color so much texture and yet it's very sexy it's very danceable it's very upbeat it's like flamenco sex dance it's it's awesome I love that song at number 16 what is probably the catchiest song on their new album women with ice or and 15 a song you guys are not surprised to see on here I'm sure Crystal Castles with not in love featuring Robert Smith at number 14 easily one of my favorite hip hop songs of the year - racist with who's that brown and number 13 a song that is a single a digital single that sadly I didn't get a chance to review outside of a blog TV that is automatic Gucci's my skateboard will go on these guys are an 8-bit rock band and I love the guitars in this this thing is like epic in overdrive I absolutely I'm indebted to this band for coming out with this song Thank You Anamanaguchi two fantastic tracks that dominated the blogosphere at 12 and 11 Caribous Odessa and Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti with round and round now I'm sure you guys are surprised to see this guy at number 10 yes believe it Kanye West with the song power yes I wasn't in love with the entire album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but there were some real standout tracks on there for me like I said in the video and this was easily the one that stood out the most to me not only because of just the great lyrics the great beat but the interesting samples as well and I love the way Kanye incorporated 21st century schizoid man on this track at number nine number nine number nine number nine we have MGMT with congratulations and number eight another kind of little pet band project of mine that i made a big deal about earlier this year Dumbo gets mad with the song plumie tail just really gritty quirky psychedelic rock with a really huge emphasis on hooks this project is coming way out of Italy and should have an album coming out next year I'm really looking forward to it great track a lot of expectations at number 7 is going to sufis cowboys and Indians my favorite from his new album and number 6 the first electronic song I really remember falling in love with this year for tetes love cry it is just experimental kind of ambient light house music and I love how the vocal sample just loops over itself and kind of melds into itself with the repeated cycles and layers it's it's a really intricate track but you wouldn't necessarily think so because of how slow it boils and because of how quiet it is at number 5 is my favorite from the new Vampire Weekend LP holiday screw the haters and we are now into my top four and number four is easily my favorite rap song of the year Big Boi shutterbug oh I love the references I love the beat I love big boys flow there's really nothing I would change about this track it's a great great freaking song even though I felt like his new album was a little inconsistent there are standouts on there for me and this is easily top at number 3 my favorite love song of the year and the catchiest for me off their new album beach house with the song take care we're almost to the end can you feel it can you feel it I really love this second song I loved it from the moment I heard it and even though the album it comes off of I was kind of iffy on it when I first gave it a listen but this track kind of turned me around and said hey wait a second give this another go give this another go there's something here I'm talking about gorillas some kind of nature featuring Lou Reed Oh such a great track I love the distortion in the background the piano the way the track builds the hook just a lot of intricacy in this very pared down and straightforward pop structure some kind of nature some God this track is maybe just a little past some kind of nature for me or maybe just on par with some kind of nature for me it was hard for me to pick between these two songs there was a lot of internal debate a lot of internal struggle with this for me guys um I can change LCD Soundsystem I can listen to that song until my ears bleed and I will just you know be singing I continue I love James Murphy's vocals on this I love how the background sense kind of reminded me of a song that I like a lot Gary Newman's cars and the bouncy synthesizer is just the way that the chorus swells this track like many songs on this list I can't possibly imagine a way to make it better however I'm sure there are many of you who see this or a lot of the other tracks on this list and you're slamming your hands into your desk and saying no screwed but do keep in mind tomorrow's album list doesn't necessarily resemble the same structure of this list there are a lot of albums that I actually left off of this list because the songs I felt if you took them out of the context of the album just aren't as strong but still those are my favorite tracks of 2010 you guys let me know what you think do you love this list do you hate it and why and what were your favorite songs of 2010 what should have been on this list I don't know please tell me there are probably a lot of tracks that if you guys comment below I'm gonna go oh crap I can't believe I forgot that song but there's the list I don't assume it to be any more special than anybody else's list I like music just like you guys like music I take take a shower and brush my teeth every morning just like y'all I've been having a blast this past year doing the needle drop for you guys I think it's really amazing that you watch and that you care and most importantly that you get information and just music that you like out of these videos that's what's important and I'm really happy that's happening I'm looking forward to doing another year with you guys I'm looking forward to doing my albums video tomorrow and I'm looking forward to getting right back to album reviews right after this list series frankly Anthony Fantana lists Peru [Music] you 
ltdFjG7VP7M,you know what he's doing in there don't you he's making his lists and I don't even know if he's checking them twice you know it's offensive that people watch because you and me we're the stars of the show I know it's not a big deal at all I can list lists I could I can tell you my favorite albums nobody cares at number one best great band great city oh it's got to be from this year animal collection hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd it's the second day of list week and we have to do a top 15 favorite EPS of 2010 thanks for all the comments all the support on yesterday's videos video where I listed my top 15 videos click there if you want to see that but these extended plays are easily my favorites of this year first I want to get a couple honorable mentions out of the way if this list had been longer it would have encompass artists like Zola Jesus McGruder grind woods Knight jewel but we do have to be a little exclusive here don't we that's the reasoning of a list and what may also be a bit of surprise about this list is that a lot of the EPS on this thing I didn't even get a chance to review this year and you know it's just kind of a show that you know guys I am always listening to stuff I am always trying different things I just don't necessarily get around to reviewing everything that I listen to but you know still represent at number 15 is the new cave EP pure moods if you're in a crowd rock into linear psychedelic rock then this thing is most definitely for you it's got a killer first track and a really long jam for its last song that references The Velvet Underground in its title and interesting ep if you're into that sort of stuff at number 14 it's the cults with their cults 7-inch who with the song go outside kept the blogosphere as attention for a good while I would even argue now that they still have it people are just looking for them to release new stuff my issue with the 7-inch even though go outside is a killer song the other two tracks on this EP are just not as good just not up to par with that particular track still a decent look into this blossoming indie darling band and number 13 is torches songs for singles so really catchy tracks on this one some hard-hitting guitars some great production to me my issue with this EP is just that it sounds like a transition type of phase and torch has kind of admitted this of the EP that they're still kind of looking for their new sound but they've kind of put out this EP to keep the fires down shoo away the rumors of them breaking up since their guitarist juan Montoya has left the band if you're a torch fan if you're a doom metal fan definitely worth a listen but don't expect it to wow you as much as torches two previous efforts for sure and number 12 we have the Gaslamp killers death gate which to me is kind of an afterthought to a Sufi and a killer considering that the Gaslamp Killer produced that album and Gocha Sufi even shows up on a track of this EP some great beats here a lot of interesting textures main issue just a little too short for me but still some good moments number 11 is something that I also did not review a lot of people were asking me to review this band's new album which I just did not get a chance to do but before the release of this LP was the rope and summit EP from Juna which to me is far more interesting even though a lot of people are into the psychedelic full acoustic sounds that are on their new album rope and summit much more beat heavy much more electric lots of synths huge krautrock influence coming in on that June of sound that is on this new album it's a strange way to look at this band if you've heard that new LP first but to me far more interesting I enjoyed it quite a bit and number 10 we have twin sisters your life a couple of killer tracks on this thing there are some potholes here and there it's a little inconsistent but the songs that have strong beats are catchy as hell especially all around it away we go to me the most distinctive thing about this band is just the vocals of their front woman if you like distinct vocals and you loved just light atmospheric dreamy pop by all means at number nine number nine number nine number nine its Dirty Projectors and Bjork with Mount Wittenberg Orca a very interesting concept EP about nature whales mother wails baby wails interesting lyrics and of course the intricacy of a Dirty Projectors album with Bjork's voice on it what more could you want from these two artists at number eight another EP that I did not get to review this year washes smoke weed about it if you are into lo-fi music if you're into instrumental synth pop music this thing is most definitely a treat also it's got a lot of variety on its side there is even a track on here of like lo-fi hip-hop which I liked a lot shockingly and to me kind of paved this idea in my head whoa we can make lo-fi hiphop experimental psychedelic hip-hop and it'll be cool yeah I'm just going overboard here it's very enjoyable and number seven another thing that I just did not get to review Owen pallets Swedish love story though I did enjoy heartland there's something about this that I was kind of missing from that album and that is the straightforwardness that Owen Pallett used to have on his final fantasy records with this EP I feel like he's kind of getting back into that form and maybe with his previous album he got a little distracted with all the extra instrumentation at his fingertips maybe went a little bit overboard the songwriting and his vocals kind of took a back burner while all the strings just went here there's a little more restraint some stronger songwriting and it's a lot catchy here because of it at number six another EP that I'm not talking about until now holy ghosts static on the wire if you're into dance rock if you're into that DFA dance sound then this is most definitely worth your time you got to put this on your ears some catchy and killer tracks on here I could even see fans of Chromeo getting into this as well at number five maybe you guys saw this coming if you've watched all my reviews it's super humanoids urgency these guys are a very interesting la rock band with a lot of krautrock influences heavy synthesizers interesting vocals the frontman of this band kind of sounds like will chef from a Kerrville River to me but still great recording great band great release here I look forward to seeing these guys release a full-length LP in the near future at number four this one's a little tricky I did enjoy it but I didn't know whether or not to call it an EP or in LP some people are calling it one others are calling it another it only has seven tracks on it but yet it is about a half an hour which doesn't make it that short however when I reviewed it one of my major gripes with it was its abrupt miss I'm talking about Sharon Van Etten's epic if you're looking for a new female singer-songwriter to add to your CD collection this is most definitely worth your time at number three this kind of goes even farther to prove that what is an EP and what does an LP is maybe a little bit subjective but we have Sufjan Stevens all delighted people this thing is much much longer than your average EP but still highly enjoyable some great tracks on here many of you know that I wasn't the biggest fan of the age of odds but still I know Sufjan is very ambitious I will listen to him wherever he goes and I'll just like what I like I won't like what I won't like fortunately this was one of those moments that hit me here and made me happy at number two this release most definitely appeals to my experimental side that side of me that loves the sound of sound of course flying lotuses pattern grid world there's a lot of texture here a lot of interesting moments and it's just overall a great afterthought to cosmic grandma and coming in at number one I got it to the CP this thing is like many EPS on this list and afterthought to a full-length album that also came out this year but to me not even so much an afterthought as just another chapter in the story of this artist where he's developing a songwriting ability trying new things testing the waters with electric guitar testing the waters with maybe just a little bit of accompaniment in the background really kind of changing his sound ever so slightly the tallest man on earth sometimes the blues is just a passing bird if you're looking for a singer-songwriter if you're looking for a full artist if you're looking for just nice beautiful catchy heartwrenching acoustic songs with bright bright vocals this thing is a must it's a must it's a must it's a must I loved it a lot and I know a lot of people I did get a chance to review this loved it as well but yeah that's my list pretty proud of this list but what do you guys think what are your top five your top 10 EPS of 2010 does your list resemble mine at all are there some EPS that I forgot and let me just tell you all if there are any questions about my list like why does it suck or how come this EP isn't on there or how come this EP is at number one please refer to this URL it's also linked down there in the D box that will give you all the answers you need coming up later this week I have videos about my favorite tracks of 2010 and finally my favorite albums of 2010 I hope you guys are as excited as I am hmm Anthony Fantana EPS and lists in 2010 
kz2Kg-JxKSE,my needle drops Anthony and dr. what a crappy way to start a video Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's list week I'm gonna be listing all of my favorites from this year it's going to be awesome this video starts out with music videos tomorrow I'm going to be doing EPS after that tracks and singles and then finally ending with my favorite albums of 2010 I think you guys will be surprised and also anger maybe some of you who knows if you guys have any questions about any of my lists like how come this is number one how come this album isn't on there how come this music video got this number on the list just follow the URL below or follow the link in the deeb ox cool before I get started I do want to give some honorable mentions to Insane Clown Posse with miracles who basically gave the whole music community a reason to come together and laugh this year I also want to give an honorable mention to the on twords left side which made it so that I will never look at the Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon album cover the same way again I also want to give an honorable mention to I am I Who am I am I am I am I am I whose viral videos really grab the whole blogosphere is attention this year until we actually found out that she wasn't fever ray Bjork or Boards of Canada coming in at number 15 I think the reason I put this video on the list is because I really love the website everything is terrible and this video appeals to me on that level of course I'm talking about the books I didn't know that lots of strange clips of golfer's instructional videos you can't go wrong and you also can't go wrong with our number 14 spot with its all-star cast featuring everyone from Jake Gyllenhaal to Little John great cinematography and a tennis tournament great video fun video Vampire Weekend's giving up the gun one of the oddest concepts for a music video this year and directed by Spike Jonze I believe was LCD Soundsystem's drunk girls not so much a music video as it was karaoke with people and panda suits beating up the members of LCD soundsystem my number 12 spot goes to that new Mark Ronson video bang bang bang q-tip and also just all of these weird effects that kind of reminded me of Japanese Mecca cartoons my number 11 goes to of Montreal's Coquette Coquette it's got all these prehistoric cro-magnon people battling it out on a beach and it's pretty freakin epic and we're breaching into number-10 territory you basically can't get down on a video that features a gunfight and a car chase with Bruce Willis of course this is the video for gorillas stylo oh my god we're in the single digits already and we're going into him with surfer Bloods swim to reach the end this was a really strange video featuring people dressed in Mickey and Minnie Mouse costumes what I thought was a tooth fairy a cute cute cute little kid with an ice cream cone who gets his ice cream cone smash our number eight video is an interesting one it wasn't one of my favorite albums of the year and really not even one of my favorite songs this thing is just simply for the love of the video and I'm talking about mi A's born free obviously a lot of ginger hate this year on YouTube and a lot of international Wars going on where stuff like this in the born free video does happen however we as the average Joe you could say are able to kind of perceive this situation going on saying well it's kind of weird to see this actually happening to gingers when we know full well there are people of many other races this kind of stuff happens too yeah Maya it's an OK album but still mi a can bring up a pretty good political point every once in a while now guys going all the way back to Michael Jackson's music videos in the 80s I'm a huge fan of dancing in music videos just cool dancing interesting dancing I don't mean some D in the front with like four background dancers just all doing the same moves I'm just interesting dancing and to me a certain video struck that chord of me number seven Janelle Monae tightrope featuring Big Boi and yeah I loved all the old costumes I loved how they weren't allowed to dance I loved how they were just kind of sneaking around in this building and found a secret place where they would dance and going deeper into the concept of dancing but in a much weirder way is my number six spot Caribous video for son all of these middle-aged women just mmm hippy dance you guys could see this right I'm getting more excited as we talk about these videos because they're just I love them they're fun they're amazing they're fantastic and most definitely all those things apply to this next one one of the videos that left a huge impression on me from the moment I saw it really a heavy hitter for me and extremely interesting maybe not one of my favorite albums of the year but I'm definitely thinking liars scissor that thing tells a hell of a story really sci-fi really odd I love the rocks I love when he turns around he sees more rocks and the ending is amazing even though this is number five easily the best twist ending number four it's a video that isn't as surprising but is hilarious fun I'm talking about flying lotuses kill your co-workers of course that came off of his pattern grid world EP and if you've ever wanted to watch computer animations of robots killing people during a parade and blood is going everywhere and people are being turned into icicles and shattered and heads are being chopped off and bodies are being mauled then I highly recommend the video my number three video really stuck with me this year has a true true favorite because of how it just builds tension tells a story and really puts images and sound together in a very cohesive Manor MGMT's flash delirium of course you guys remember my review of the album congratulations earlier this year and MGMT have put out a video for congratulations as well but still this one is my true favorite from them I love the throat thing I love the puppets I love the odd characters I love the dancing I love the laughing and I love how it just comes together into this monster movie esque ending with the camera shaking and things are blowing up my number 2 spot comes off of an album that you guys may be surprised to see on this list comes from a rap album easily the oddest rap video I've seen this year and though I'm not talking about run away oh I'm actually talking about big boys shutterbug oh my god that video the dancers the weird clothes the the cups in the background the car with the thing and the flashing I'm carrying the head maybe it's not as sporadic or as random as I would have liked it to be but easily in terms of rap videos it's one of the best I've seen this year and really sticks to me every time every image every kind of shot really just left a lasting impression on me whether it be because of all the bright colors a weird situation the odd edits and it's alright guys and this last video is my number one for several reasons it was directed by the great Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric awesome show great job it appeals to me on a level that really is into horror movies slasher flicks B movies gore blood you know what I'm talking about by now if you've seen this video the entire thing is slow-motion and I know that's a little cliche but for me it's totally justified in that you have the ability to take in every ugly gritty detail of this thing whether it be from the cuts to the dirt to the ugly faces to the fat man with a machete chasing a in a dress wearing nothing but tighty whities and what looks to be plastic bags and duct tape on his feet as they run through a snowfall in a dark forest at what seems to be maybe midnight 1:00 a.m. I'm talking about the health video we are water I could watch that thing over and over and over and over it is sick it is disturbing it kind of makes me squirm in my chair a little bit and that's what makes me love it now the ball is in your court guys you can be awesome and list me out your favorite videos whether it be your top 5 top 10 whatever or you can go the crappy route and complain that's fine too alright guys remember tomorrow is going to be my ep's list this is list week 2k10 forever fever ray my queen of 2009 and yeah see you guys tomorrow Anthony Fantana lists forever you 
2XID34-aILk,greetings my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here standing in this spot the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album no it's not oh my god I'm so used to this it's time for a question of the week which doesn't really happen every week before I get into this question I want to tell you guys links down there in the D box where you can follow us on facebook follow us on Twitter we should be doing another blog TV soon and chances are you're going to find updates as to when that is over there and in terms of everything else with me next week is when my lists are going to drop my favorite EPS track singles music videos favorite albums too of course and it's going to be so nice that whole week not only am I going to drop the lists but you know I won't have to listen to anything you know for work purposes I could listen for pleasure but here is the LP that was my number one album for last year love this thing but I will give you guys a hint this sounds absolutely nothing like the new record that is my number one nothing so your question of the week is there a perfect album and if so what album is it is there more than one perfect album on the planet are there dozens of perfect albums on the planet and if there are these albums in existence that are perfect what exactly makes them so do they all share this common attribute or do different things make them perfect to me when I give something a score or when I advocate for you guys to listen to something it's just a level of my emotional enjoyment you know 10 is up here one is down here and to me all a ten means is that you know I could see myself listening to this over and over and over and over for a very very very long time of course I can get sick of it you can get sick of pretty much anything but I don't see any other way you could celebrate in albums greatness than by listening to it or sharing it with friends and to me an eight nine totally worth that effort is there such a thing as perfection in music can you attain perfection in music and if so how do you do it or when we say an album is perfect or close to perfect are we just misusing the word and just merely trying to express that we think it's a really really great piece of work and that's your question of whenever guys Anthony Fantana questions perfect albums you 
aVZ9A4Ehw_g,what's up senior hi everyone Anthony Fantana here and yeah its album review time a couple things I want to mention before we get into the review on the needle drop calm is the playlist to the blog TV that we had last week all the songs that I play not necessarily in the correct order but all the songs that I recall playing link down there in the D box also on our website the label bad panda records is celebrating their one-year anniversary and they're doing it with a free compilation lots of instrumental music experimental music pop as well just lots of interesting stuff I like that website a lot because they just feature stuff that to me is kind of a breath of fresh air in the blogosphere a lot of strange stuff a lot of overlooked stuff that is very interesting and finally I guess I have to explain this I had an eye appointment today I had an eye examination and my pupils right now are dilated everything is a little fuzzy a little blurry and stuff just feels a little weirder a little brighter if I take these off and plus my pupils look weird so please let me keep the glasses on I just want to have a log please thank you Royce top is a Norwegian electronic duo and this is their fourth album senior these guys are pretty popular they're known around the world I shouldn't have to explain exactly who they are every single little detail you guys got the Internet but if you are a fan or if you have only heard a few tracks from these guys I think it's pretty apparent that on this album they are not going to be going back to their 2001 album melody a.m. and trying to recapture that cohesive downtempo aesthetic and there's also no way an album titled senior is going to sound anything like its predecessor Junior I think that's pretty much implied now junior developed upon a lot of electronic vocal pop sounds that röyksopp experimented with the understanding by comparison senior is entirely instrumental a lot less be heavy more linear less hook oriented less catchy and most people who jumped on these guys with the jr. bandwagon would say that is to a fault and that sentiment ranked pretty loudly and most of the reviews that I read as well just saying oh it's it's not as it's not as immediate as jr. however I can't say I'm a huge fan of this album either but it's really got nothing to do with it being less upbeat than its predecessor in fact I'd say in some respects this thing is a lot better than jr. the production is more interesting there's more contrast there's more sound there's more texture from dusty old drum machines to fat analog synthesizers and it all adds up in some pretty impressive instrumentals like the alcoholic has this fantastic set of our Peggy owes on it that sound really quirky really kind of unique and the track senior living just has these really weary keyboards this really weary guitar that just sounded so post-rock to me and the track of the fear sounds like some kind of collaboration between John Carpenter and Vangelis on a futuristic sci-fi horror movie but it seems like for every memorable moment there is an equally forgettable one like the drug or tricky to have this really repetitive linear feel that I like but don't feel the stink tour engaging enough for me to really praise them all that heavily I think it's great that we're except put out this record and if you've been a fan of them since melody am I don't see why you can't follow them here I think this record proves that they have a lot of artistic integrity that they have a lot of adventure left in them and that they can produce an experimental record as easily as they can produce a pop record the problem for me is that when it comes to whatever you want to call it experimental electronica ambient electronica just adventurous electronic this just doesn't stick out enough for me especially considering how much I've been able to partake in this year from Caribou to for tet to Pantha to Prince to Luke Abbot to Brian Eno those albums bark up a tree that is very similar to the one that this is and because of that because to me those albums are barking louder this thing kind of falls into the grey for me it's not groundbreaking by any sense but it is nice to know that röyksopp can do this type of stuff with a lot of artistic vision if they wish to I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this it's by no means an awful record no part of it really offended me just didn't stick out to me enough is all and I'm sure the diehards are going nuts for this thing just like I said but you know I'm just not one of them what do you want me to say thanks for watching let me know in the comments what you think I should review next and rikes op senior forever 
iqD6M8V0A5U,I think I'm getting sick sup everybody sup sup sup you should know who it is by now Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd its album review time no no track reviews yet this week maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow I got some requests for this should I do a track review from this tomorrow and if not what should I review tomorrow before we get into this review on the needle drop calm Ghostface Killah as a new track out apparently he's going to drop a new album this month why obviously it's going to be a little too late to consider for my 2010 lists if I do think it's good but I still want to review it for sure and also in regards to yesterday's review I had a little email chat with kids and explosions and he told me that y'all when you went on his site to download his album y'all broke it just be a little more careful next time guys come on come on I'm just kidding even said some of you guys donated when you picked up the album and that's really nice that's really nice for me to know that I can take you to some musicians website and you guys will be polite and wipe your feet at the door and be nice and behave yourselves I like that a lot I'm very impressed by that you guys acted very mature and this yo where's that 2010 list come on next week broseph next week is when I start releasing all my lists I will be doing a two-part video 50 tracks that I like video about EPS some videos that I liked as well although there will be a slight alteration I will not be doing a 50 album video just because that's going to get really long and really tedious what I'm hoping to do is do a video where I talk about 25 albums and then take the remaining 25 that I like and then put them on a list on the needle drop calm cool cool okay this review touches down on an album I was looking forward to for a couple reasons a song had come out prior to the relief state that I liked a lot and also this is on Stones Throw Records which is usually a hip-hop label and this is nowhere near that so I figure Stones Throw is going to step outside of their comfort zone they're at least going to do it for a pretty decent record this thing is named after its front woman Anika and it's actually produced by Jeff vero of Portishead and the band beak right from the get-go on this thing I picked up huge influences coming from post-punk from dub music which I absolutely loved very eery messy and pretty dark too but as I dived into the record I kind of noticed that every song with the exception of two I believe our covers I noticed Bob Dylan's masters of war Yoko Ono's Yong Yong and tracks popularized by Gretta and twinkle Skeeter Davis and the girl group sound is really popular right now I'm just not sure if it's gonna catch on in this style however I decided to stick with it here give it a really hard listen because female post-punk just has a rich history of churning out great covers the mo debts doing painted black the raincoats covering the kinks Lola and who the hell can forget the slits I heard it through the grapevine essential songs and I kind of looked for that same magic here I I was looking for any kind of magic really and I just did not get it I liked the sound and I liked the production very bouncy dub reverb the bass is mixed really high sharp drums this thing sounds like it was recorded in the 60s or 70s honest to god but my biggest gripe on this thing is I really didn't care for the nica's vocals her deadpan delivery does work on some tracks for sure young young and no one's there are definitely examples and the reason those songs work is because they rely more on attitude than actual melody or singing ability however in regards to the chart climbing girl group hits on this thing Anita's complete disregard for the original vocal melody isn't very flattering and just wouldn't keep me interested however we're talking about a seasoned record producer here so I assume that the mistakes were left in for effect I just can't say they're affecting me in a good way for me this thing feels too tired to druggie too weary too taxing just to amateur to keep my attention keep my interest just really get any enjoyment out of me from beginning to end but I'm mostly talking this up because I think it's so odd that maybe some of you guys will fall in love with it for sure after my Tonetta review there were some people who just their hearts were warned with happiness after finding out about that guy and you know easily this is as strange as eccentric I know there's not a middle-aged man dancing in a speedo when you listen to this but still very strange odd music Anthony fan tanto here let me know what you think I should review next and if you listen to a few tracks on this tell me what you think yeah anika self-titled record 
nQe_rTrxGyA,kids and explosions computer anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy music guy nerdy dude it's time for an album review but before we do that there are a couple things that I want to mention number one furgus and Geronimo have dropped an mp3 from their upcoming album unlearn download that over the needle drop calm if you're on YouTube watching this there should be a link down there in the d box and finally before we get into the review I guess some of you yesterday did not like how I treated Cal well I'm sorry Cal I was feeling really bad about how I treated you yesterday so I got you this Oh cash my very own frisbee I hate Cal Church esta all right on yesterday's video I gave a shout out to an album that you can grab on a website in the d box via a pay what you want basis and I gave so much ear time to this album that day I was compelled to make a review kids and explosions is the sample mashup smash' project of Josh Raskin he is a Toronto dude and also the director of a fantastic animated short called I met the walrus link right there click it watch that thing it's really great well not directing but pulling songs apart and putting them back together is this guy's latest effort in causing a ruckus and easily the album computer does that if you're into Girl Talk or super mash brothers or the hood Internet what goes on here should not be too alien to you however this interests me far much more than any of the new stuff those guys have put out yeah I said it I said that I said that thing I love what those guys do but these days it's really hard for me to see them as anything more than like DJs on steroids just take one sample lay it on top of another sample play it out later on top of another sample play it out lay it on top of another sample and play it out don't get me wrong it was mind blowing in 2008 and we needed guys like Girl Talk and Stein ski to get here but this brings it to a whole new level for me I know there are artists on the illegal art label who are just as abusive with their edits but this is what's kind of got my ear right now everything on shit computer gets cut up with the care of a world-class surgeon and it all adds up not just rhythmically but melodically adding Destiny's Child together with Sigmund with the Beach Boys white stripes against blur Otis Redding against Bruce Springsteen and what's funny is that Raskin has said that he's done o pitch shifting at all for this album and it sounds like it it sounds like everything has been put together and the chips just fell where they did to me it's not that surprising we're all subject to the same 12 notes in the chromatic scale and humanity has been creating music for thousands of years we were down to have some overlap now I'm loving this thing however I don't think a lot of people will because the amount of editing here it sputters it buzzes it glitches it really borders on pure wanker II a lot of the time just imagine this as being a little bit like Steve Vai guitar soloing in your face for about 50 minutes and there are points where it gets a little noisy too a lot like girl talks very very early stuff like secret diary there's hardly a sample on here or an audio piece that doesn't get chopped up into fine little tiny pieces and then turned over onto its head it's quite membranes got a flow the flow a little dropping names seen ons go and I'll admit there are moments here we're listening to the album is almost like listening to a CD skip and you would just wish it would frickin play and there are some people who I know will feel that bringing a Drake song anywhere near a Dusty Springfield song is blasphemy and editing rap verses down to pure gibberish is pretty blasphemous as well but for me this is just some a sound manipulation I don't like it for the same reasons I like Girl Talk I like it for the same reasons I like that new books album the way out it's a sound collage with tons of just little bits of voice of noise of whatever just flying past your eardrums at a neck-breaking pace pop music just happens to be kids and explosions weapon of choice that's all now there's a range of emotion here some very beautiful moments some very funny moments as well very creative editing and it's really cohesive and thematic in the way it handles itself slow song is a very slow pretty track Girls consists mostly of female vocals swear'st is loaded with swears Plus it's a record that I can listen to over and over and over and get more out of it each time I revisit and I love that kind of stuff I'm feeling a strong eight if not a light nine on this thing it's fantastic the best mashup album I've heard all year honestly give a listen to it let me know what you think do you like it do you hate it and why and what do you think of sample-based music what do you think of this in regards to sample-based music is this a furtherance of that idea or is it an abuse of that idea anthony Fantana kids and explosions you 
AyzpDXRVbwA,"[Music] well well well well well well hi everyone Anthony Phan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd today I'm feeling great and I have a lot of reasons to feel great number one we recently broke 13,000 subscribers on the channel oh hell yeah I'm feeling unstoppable hey Cal hey there how you doing my greatest buddy in the whole wide world you're stupid and starting next week is when I'm going to start releasing my lists my favorite EPS of 2010 favorite music videos and top 50 tracks and singles and top 50 albums I want to make sure that a couple people see some stuff yesterday I did a review of that Tonetta album compilation 777 Volume one if you're looking for a and if you're looking for an eccentric YouTube personality slash musician go check that out and also on the blog right now the needle drop com there is an album that you can download a mashup album if you are a fan of sample-based music I highly recommend that you download kids and explosions hmm computer as soon as possible link in the debugs come on it's down there this review is mostly prompted by some comments that came up on my deadmau5 track review recently and I promised a few people that I would review this if I got the chance so I have here we go electronica producer and multi-instrumentalist sunny more or Skrillex has been called everything from break core to dubstep to drum and bass to progressive house and I wouldn't say it's because he's impossible to classify but the music on his new EP scary monsters and nice sprites literally incorporates all of those elements there are plenty of house crescendos very glitchy edits that infamous dubstep wah-wah-wah and very manipulated samples as well and it's funny because in this music there is so much flying at you at once it would be impossible to note every single little noise and manipulation that buzzes by the first time around or even the third time around but all of this stuff is very well placed to the point that it doesn't make scary monsters and nice sprites difficult to listen to in fact for me if you're into loud music if you're into dance beats it's very easy to listen to - the holy peace starts off with the track rock and roll that's linked down there in the D box and if you're not into that track you're not going to be into the rest of this EP I don't think because that song is kind of the the manifesto for Skrillex on this EP just blaring blaring keyboards and abusive beat just really harsh bass programming a pitch shifted vocal and just mind-bending repetitive head ative edits but for me the EP kind of goes downhill its second half but not too far downhill though there are some features with penny bear noise foreign beggars and I kind of get the feeling that Skrillex is tailoring his edits tailoring the builds and the Falls of his music just to kind of make way for his guests things get patted out a bit on the tail end of this EP with three remixes most of which don't really bring a whole ton to the table that the original mixes didn't except for that Zedd track where he completely overhauls the song scary monsters and nice sprites it's got a really great beat and is a fresh take on that original version now to me this thing just sounds like a fidgety dance robot really relentless just constantly malfunctioning and sparking in every direction and it seems like it's on the verge of breaking down or overheating or just becoming so overwhelming that they can't handle it anymore but it never quite gets to that point I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing not for lack of / all enjoyment but it just felt a little inconsistent to me I like consistency I like the feel of an album I like the feel of a complete work but like I said on my deadmau5 review when you're talking about music like this your strengths your popularity is really derived from your latest single not whether or not your album is this huge complete work alright everyone thank you for watching Skrillex scary monsters and nice sprites and tell me what you think of this thing did you like it did you hate it and why and what should I review next forever [Music] "
EZOQBqCPQHc,[Applause] so tonita 777 [Applause] there you go ma bro hello my needle drops and Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd you know who I am by now I think and it's album review time this LP to my knowledge has not been requested by anybody so I imagine this is because some y'all need some internet schooling on who Tonetta is if you search the name Tonetta on youtube you will get tons upon tons of videos featuring Speedos cloth backgrounds and lyrics about every type of sex you can imagine chances are your eyes will be glued to the screen whether it is in admiration or horror and even though tone Etta's following would not be what it is without his videos which are kind of dispersed around youtube ever since his account got banned a while back he's got this new album compilation out 777 vol 1 via the label black tent press who I imagine is committed to releasing more of this guy's stuff they already have a date and a cover slated for volume 2 and volume 3 definitely seems like a possibility who knows how much stuff tonette has locked away in his musical vault waiting to be scratched out on some innocent piece of vinyl he's a Canadian singer-songwriter and this compilation is Bill of songs he's recorded from the 80s up until 2009 I believe and they don't seem to be in any apparent order just one odd bedroom jam after another I have to get a comparison out of the way for me Tonetta is like GG Allin our Stevie Moore and Iggy Pop rolled up into one I would also like anit to the mountain goats early stuff in that Tonetta is very DIY seems to be very prolific and doesn't really hold issue with recycling melodies recycling lyrical ideas recycling seong concepts over and over and over for the sake of just putting out more stuff so don't be surprised if over the course of this album you catch a few hints of deja vu and also while we're naming artists he does like to reference the Beatles quite a bit in his songs which happens just a couple times on here in terms of recording I love the lo-fi gritty sound of these tracks just these dirty nasty drums twangy guitars bass that is usually very over driven and thick and the vocals are for me for the most part to die for just really smoky very whispery dark it's like tone Etta's mouth is right up against the microphone and it sounds like he is just breathing down my neck kind of creepy I gotta admit but the only thing prettier than the recording here is the lyrical content and I don't think I need to dig much farther past some of the song titles to kind of illustrate my point like really big I'm gonna marry a prostitute peeping-tom drugs drugs drugs but I'm really kind of polarized on this album I really love some tracks really big is one of them surprisingly so catchy but there are others I really don't care for for me the lo-fi abrasive sound kind of destroy some of the tracks here like John and Yoko or my $10 acts and because a lot of these songs tread very similar water you kind of have to be into the lyrics a lot in order to enjoy them so some tracks for me have ended up being a little more boring than others it's very tempting to kind of treat him and his music like a freak in a cage that you just can't stop staring at but if you can get past that I don't see why anybody couldn't buffet pick some interesting tracks out of this thing for sure I think my major issue is that I don't dig this LP so much because some of my favorite tracks are just not on here like Lady Gaga music is bull my report card boys but I think most Tonetta fans are going to feel that way if you have dug through most of this guy's YouTube videos chances are to hear your all-time favorite Tonetta songs you're still going to be logging onto YouTube to do that if there's any reason to pick this thing up if you're a fan it's to just support the guy so at this point after some prolonged exposure to this and tonette his YouTube videos I'm kind of feeling a decent six on this thing I'm liking it but it's not blowing my mind by a long shot however if I could take my all-time favorite Tonetta songs and put them on an album you know swap out the tracks on here I didn't like and just kind of make my favourite Tonetta mix I would score it way way way way way higher so if you guys have heard this thing or have found Tonetta by now and youtube search engine let me know what you think are you in love are you in hate are you deeply disturbed and what should I review next anthony Fantana Tonetta forever [Music] you [Music] 
_2RPGAA6p4E,Tyler the Creator bastard hey guys Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd this review is a little late but you know it's because I spent all night last night compiling my favorite music videos EPS album's tracks singles I think I'm going to have a pretty good set of videos coming up toward the end of this year just a best-of thing alright we have a long long review this time around and it's because you know what we have to rap about rap there's a growing sentiment in some of my videos that I don't like rap that I don't like hip-hop and of course this foul stench is emanating mostly from my kanye and my big boy reviews people get hung up on the scores don't actually listen to what I say what can you expect but if you did hear what I said in those reviews you would know that some of my favorite songs of this year have come from those albums nevermind the fact that most people gloss over my roots review and tie early hip hop has really been kind of weird for me this year a lot of the major label releases the big ones have been somewhat decent for the most part but it's not like there haven't been hyped artists that I didn't really care for like all the weed wrap on currencies new LPS kind of makes it boring for me and big crits debut was alright and I have no clue why some of my videos are getting waka flocka flame requests there have been indie label releases that I liked for example gangrene or strong arms steady but for the most part Stones Throw rhyme Sayers Def Jux these indie hip hop labels have not been bringing the heat they haven't been bringing the competition to the majors that I would like them to you're not going to climb the charts with the new freeway album you're not going to climb the charts with the new OJ Simpson album you're not going to beat the majors at their own game I have to give it to some artists like no for kind of just changing things up doing something a little different even though it wasn't really doing much for me and guys like LP and Madlib are in mental mode right now when we kind of need the most so most of my hip-hop entertainment this year has come from free albums and mixtapes a few people who have really been grabbing my attention are - racist fat Shawn Mac Miller these guys may not have the beats of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but they're rapping with their heads and not what their didn't and when it comes to putting up free one collective to hit it big has been Odd Future Wolf Gang kill them all their group of teen rappers producers artists weirdos they've had some viral videos around the internet and it's really surreal when I'm watching to hear rap music that is so experimental and sometimes thought-provoking coming from kids that are almost half my age they release a lot of material from all their members and like little B they kind of have an issue with quantity over quality but there's still a lot of gems in there 10 or so albums and mixtapes that they've put out they're radical tape is a really great introduction to everybody in the group Haji beats and Earl show a lot of promise and personality but easily the shining star out of the group the guy who is grabbing the most attention is Tyler the Creator his album bastard is easily the most consistent well produced thematic and creative out of the whole group and Tyler brings a ton of witty rhymes throughout the entire album one that stuck out to me right from the very beginning was screw you like a ratchet screw you like a black teen on judge Hatchett but there's a lot of darkness here - Tyler rapping about rape murder weird sexual desires kidnapping but it all seems a lot like MF DOOM or mm on the Slim Shady LP where he's not being serious but kind of just painting this dark villainous character on the tracks era he does rap about tying up a girl for not going to prom with him but he goes farther to say that he literally wants to take her heart out and eat it creating this dark image is kind of a game for him on this album although there are moments of seriousness here too there's a lot of talk about his father on this album who according to him he has never known and he kind of channels this really creatively through this ongoing dialogue between him and who I assume as a therapist of course Tyler himself plays the therapist with what I think is just a vocal effect that makes his vocal sound lower but it's not really like he needs it either because his voice is the deepest out of the whole odd future collective it's really distinctive and I could easily pick it out of a lineup it's gritty its Basie it's just a really dirty dirty vocal so it's pretty easy to get into Tyler when he's rapping about everything from Animal Planet to Cartoon Network to interracial relationships to Helen Keller there are a lot of drug references on here too but that is kind of where the line blurs it's hard to tell when Tyler's being real and when he is playing this character because there are a lot of moments on here where he talks about not smoking not doing drugs being high on life in terms of production there's a lot of interesting stuff on here too the music gets dark and dramatic on bastard really bubbly and odd on the track seven and very distorted and heavy with the song French there's even then MF DOOM beat on here with the track odd toddlers but honestly not every beat on this album is as good as the next production-wise this thing starts a lot stronger than it finishes another downside of this album is that it's a tap NIT system there are a lot of moments here where it takes itself seriously enough to be very very impressive but then again there are those tracks that clearly from the start are extremely extremely masturbatory and that's not necessarily a bad thing it kind of comes with the territory of being this age I really wouldn't have it any other way personally the album closes up with Tyler kind of talking with his therapist and concluding that overall he's a good kid but he's kind of misled and I believe that to be true but if I'm to use the music on this thing as a guide I'm not really worried about him eventually finding his way right now I'm feeling strong seven a very strong seven to a light eight on this album with more consistency I'm really excited to see where Tyler the Creator and Odd Future are going in this odd future but what do you guys think of this album do you love it do you hate it why and how do you think rap and hip-hop have been for this past year hip hop of 2010 what's your opinion what should I review next and thanks for watching Anthony Fantana Tyler the Creator bastard 
yO9XxNq2njQ,oh boy oh boy oh boy hello everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope everyone's doing well hope everybody's just feeling great feeling good we're going to do an album review here but before we get into that I kind of feel like a freaking jerk there's something I've been needing to mention and I've been forgetting it and forgetting it and forgetting it just because I've been so busy I've written an essay a review of an album that has been in my music collection for a long time in fact this album is the album that has stayed in my music collection longer than any other LP what is that album you have to click on the link in the d box to read the essay it's on this website called my life in review dotnet music is reviewed but from a sort of autobiographical or memoir esque perspective so interesting concept come on click the link mom come on come on come on come on alright so I've gotten a flood of requests for this thing it is the Tron Legacy soundtrack of course composed by deaf Punk and yeah this will be my first soundtrack review ever there have been other soundtracks you guys have asked me to review earlier this year I've kind of just passed by him and you know what soundtracks are just so hit or miss for me just take this video as an opportunity to kind of get a whiff as to what's going on with this LP because as a Daft Punk fan I'm really curious to see what the guys have pulled together on this thing so do we have heavy beats and robot vocals and club bangers no move along but this thing is interesting nevertheless it's an epic combination of Daft Punk's knack for creating interesting electronic textures and an 85 piece chamber orchestra if you're a soundtrack addict you're going to catch a whiff of masters like John carbon that guy's tents busy melodies are all over this thing especially in the strings as they just build gargantuan climaxes of course there are more influences floating throughout this thing the original soundtrack of Tron is clearly a reference point but I was catching a lot of Blade Runner soundtrack Vangelis on here as well of course there are moments that seem overtly classical with very little to no electronics at all the overture for me as an example where they're really pushing that crescendo power of the chamber orchestra their slow soft synth odyssey some rough distorted moments that bring a lot of tension and drama to the table there are really only several tracks that are what we've kind of come to expect from Daft Punk with constant beats just a real dance atmosphere but if that's all you're here for there's not going to be enough of that to really keep you all that interested the production is fantastic it's most certainly more expensive than my car it sounds gorgeous like absolutely gorgeous the sounds are so freakin lush however I wouldn't say I'm enjoying it a lot even though I do find this to be extremely impressive here you're not getting a Juno soundtrack full of popular little cutesy indie bands that kind of feels like a mixtape that you can take home and listen to anytime you'd like this my friends is a score and the thing about a score is that it's specifically tailored to the needs of the film and the last time I really fell in love with the score was the movie there will be blood which many of you may know was written by Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood however I would I would never buy or really enjoy that soundtrack by itself because it's a score it's meant to be enjoyed with the film one hand washes the other there are so many tracks here that just kind of meander and don't go anywhere there are a lot of tracks that as soon as they climax they just end this thing isn't meant to be enjoyed in the same way that you would enjoy a Daft Punk album there's something missing here and it's the film the only thing the soundtrack really did for me is made me want to see the movie so bad so I'm feeling a strong this is a pretty freaking cool soundtrack you should check it out if you're into scores I'm not really but I have to recognize impressive production and instrumentation when I hear it yeah it's a pretty cool thing you should hear it so guys if you've heard the soundtrack heard a couple tracks off of it let me know what you think do you love them do you hate them why and what artists would you like to see make a soundtrack make a score do you think it's awesome the Daft Punk is scoring this thing and what should I review next anthony Fantana Daft Punk Tron Legacy soundtrack forever [Music] 
edXP5f4CFT8,haha happy holidays everyone Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd hope everyone had a fantastic Thanksgiving this past week we are now barreling down on Christmas New Year's and that means I need to start thinking of what my favorite albums of 2010 are I'm gonna try to do a list of both my favorite songs and my favorite LPS but there are some reviews I need to get out of the way not only because I think these albums or releases should be on the list but also because you know what they're just albums that have fallen through the cracks and I want to touch down on them and yeah on yesterday's video a major comment surfaced and that was instead of me reviewing Ke$ha Cal should review Ke$ha Cal what do you think it is oh you know I'd give it a 10.0 sounds fair to me this is one of the few brand new albums I'll be reviewing before the year is out offs first four EPS as if you couldn't already tell this is a compilation of their first four EPS off as a California hardcore punk band a lot of people are calling a supergroup and it's not hard to see why they feature members of Circle Jerks red cross burning brides hot snakes there's a lot of punk and hardcore history between these four dudes especially frontman Keith Morris who spent some of his early days in music fronting Black Flag and when you consider the aníbal Mart here with the old EP album art from Black Flag and also consider Black Flag off insecticides and thankfully the parallels do not stop there they continue on into the music it's a fresh revival of that classic hardcore punk sound the same sound that I championed on that ceremony LP that got released earlier this year there are 16 songs here not one of them reaches two minutes and a lot of them don't even reach one blaring guitars high volume fierce vocals and what love is that this thing totally beats that stereotype into a pulp that punk music is for the young and it's not like that stereotype came out of nowhere as a fan of punk music I've seen a lot of revivals and super groups and reunions just go horribly horribly wrong but this proves that that punk sound is not in the age but the attitude and Keith Morris brings plenty of that to the table with his lyrics he deals with self-destruction negativity mental issues on tracks like black thoughts and there are a lot of moments where he's basically waving his middle finger in the air at society an example would be the song people sure the lyrics are really simple straightforward rudimentary but still there are a lot of moments where I can't help but think about what he's saying where I can't help but laugh at what he's saying especially what he's talking about pissing in the punch bowl on the song I don't belong there points where yeah maybe it doesn't feel as hard as the old Black Flag stuff maybe it doesn't feel as angry as the old circle-jerk stuff but that was then and this is today and today this sounds awesome every year I'm in a search for a balls-to-the-wall no-nonsense rock album in 2009 that was kind of King Khan and barbecue show for me in 2008 it was no age and in 2010 this may be it for me got to think about a little bit more but I'm feeling a decent - strong 8 on this thing I'm loving the hell out of it yeah there's that familiarity element to it there but because I'm so familiar with this stuff it's hard for me to like anything new that comes out of it because it just sort of seems like it's either rehashing the same old stuff or it's the same thing just done with less passion though this isn't exactly anything original anything completely new it's done with a lot of energy a lot of force and that's what attracts me to this record let me know are you loving it already hating it and why and do you think this thing fares when it comes to reviving that hardcore punk sound Anthony Fantana off verse forty Peas forever 
btaQdzwfvDM,maserati pyramid of the Sun well hello everybody Anthony Fantana heey the Internet's busiest music nerd and we're going to review an album from a Georgia band Maserati never again will I intro a video in a foe southern accent anyway guys um before I get into this review I want to mention that something atrocious happened on my last review someone named channel Shannon commented saying that I should review the new kesha album and over 40 of you thumbed it up why do you hurt me I say that because I just got back from the doctors an hour ago had a physical and my doctor dr. Mangum said that I am allergic to Kesha and I am NOT to under any circumstances listen to her music ever he even gave me this note excusing me from reviewing the new kesha album if you're down with instrumental rock if you're down with post-rock maserati is definitely a band you should spend a little bit of time with their early work has all the subtleties all of the slow bills that have come to appreciate in this kind of music but I would be lying if I said I felt it was standout in 2007 the band really changed up their sound though with inventions for the new season which just kind of stopped all the subtleties out of the mix got rid of the slow builds screw all that let's give the people riffs let's give them beats it was a more accessible direction but I can't exactly say it was really excessive me I know this is when the band really started to gain some notoriety gained some attention but still a lot of the riffs on this LP kind of felt a little monotonous to me very repetitive kind of like I was running in circles as I was listening to it but this my friends Pyramid of the Sun is really where the band has begun to impress me last year these guys dropped a split with one of my favorite bands zombie and I really didn't think much of it however I could totally see zombies worship of synthesizers and effect having a huge impact on what Maserati has done here zombie member Steve Moore is actually featured on this album a lot and he brings some really really amazing synth textures to the table and gives Maserati a gargantuan epicness that they just did not have before to me that Maserati sound on inventions combined with that zombie sound on the album spirit animal has kind of resulted in something that sounds like a more rock-oriented version of what kraut rock bands like tangerine dream were doing on albums such as Rubicon in all respects I think this thing is a huge improvement upon what they did on their 2007 album the production is better the guitars are sharp as hell they wail like a banshee the base is warm the drums snapped like a carrot there's more sound here more effects more texture the repetitive riffs are still here for the most part but they've been kind of relegated to the background and they are keeping tempo they're keeping the groove they're not the main focus like they used to be now what's kind of stealing the show for me are all of the bubbling synthesizers are all of the effects that the guitars are soaked in there are some points here where I feel a little underwhelmed that's really my only gripe and most of these parts only occur in the first half of this album I'm thinking moments like the title track for example that to me maybe could be a little more subtle maybe could draw the builds out a little bit more I like surprises in my instrumental rock what can I say that's just me I'm just that kind of guy yeah you know I'm feeling a strong 72 a light eight on this LP it's fantastic stuff but before I close this review out I have to mention one thing the man playing drums on this album passed away in the midst of recording this LP drummer Jerry folks is no longer with us and it's very sad to see Maserati lose an extremely pivotal part of their makeup at a point that I think is probably their greatest however i am in some way at least kind of pleased to see that some of Jerry's final recordings were a fantastic showcase of his talents his abilities and just his sixth sense for rhythms you will be missed you guys if you're a fan of Maserati or if this is your first taste let me know what you think of this album do you love it do you hate it why do you think this is Maseratis most shining moment and where do you think the band goes from here musically also throw me some ideas for future reviews as well Anthony Fantana also throw me some ideas for future reviews as well Maserati Pyramid of the Sun forever you 
ty0id9qHcq8,"hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most Thanksgiving music nerd today is Thanksgiving in America and on Thanksgiving we like to eat and watch football and pretend that the interactions our ancestors had with the native people of this land were peaceful now it's customary not to work on Thanksgiving but I'm doing a video because this isn't work this is funny are you kidding me besides for a lot of my audience it's not even Thanksgiving I mean look look at all those people watching though Bolivia and Paraguay really have to pick up the pace you would think all that white means the people in Greenland are not watching but it's actually just really cold up there and that's why on yesterday's video which was pretty crappy I asked for some requests ideas some review ideas and I got an interesting one from explosions from my but what that's his real YouTube name I'm not talking about explosions from my but I hate khalji chesta well explosion said that I should stop doing requests and do some more underground stuff which maybe I agree with maybe not necessarily underground stuff but just kind of stuff that I want to do which usually ends up being underground stuff and yeah I've been a little burnt out on requests lately but I can't give them up completely your requests are part of what makes the channel expand and grow it's part of what makes the channel dynamic it introduces me to a lot of music that I wouldn't have heard otherwise but I can't lose the main focus of this channel which is introducing you to music that you don't know yet though it's actually really getting hard to find music all of you don't know I mean there are almost 13,000 of you that's almost like a million but I do realize I have to make a mix of this I have to review some Quest's but then again I also have to review stuff that is really only tickling my fancy just to keep a smile on my face and sanity in my brain I will keep reading your comments and suggestions and taking them seriously they're part of what makes the needle drop fresh it's what keeps me from just reviewing one kind of music although I'm not really sure if I'm going to be tackling the new My Chemical Romance album I have enjoyed some of their earlier stuff but I'm pretty sure if I did that there might be a revolt among some of my needle drops well anyway we mio amico says that I am constantly unimpressed which is not true I am unimpressed by a lot of things but one thing I am impressed by is this new Glasser LP ring Glasser had a few songs floating around the blogosphere earlier this year one of the first of them which was home and that track I wasn't too impressed with hmm I just thought it wasn't for me and I gave it a seriously premature pass which I just shouldn't have well a friend of mine actually booked the band to play live in the city near me and I thought it'd be supportive why not just go out to the show and my mind was blown seriously it was a great show I had a fantastic time and I bought their album right on the spot they're convinced that even though I thought that this band wasn't for me what I saw go down onstage in front of me was so good the album couldn't possibly be bad so Glasser is really the solo project of Cameron Mesirow she had an EP on true panther sounds last year which included a few songs that were reworked for this album and so what makes this so great to me the music on this is something you might hear if you were in the jungle and stumbled upon a tribe a communal tribe of women forgotten in time but they somehow were able to write songs using nothing electronic drums synths and MIDI controllers on that foundation Camryn sings these really otherworldly lyrics and I absolutely love her voice the vocals on this album are great she doesn't have a thick and B C voice but there's a lot of force there she sings with a lot of power a lot of clarity and a lot of strength and she does a lot of experimentation on this album too with her voice there are points where she is squawking which I really love it doesn't hurt me years but it's just another really interesting sound to add to this album there are points where she's chanting there are points where she is harmonizing with her own vocals using multi tracks but her voice is so dynamic she's able to sing in so many octaves that it doesn't sound like you're just hearing the same person saying over and over and over it doesn't sound redundant it's very fresh plus it is kind of an added bonus there's a lot of extra instrumentation on this thing two strings there's also a great saxophone on one track here I'd say if you're looking for something really simple straightforward heavy-handed with the hooks immediate you may want to pass on this even though there are moments on here that are kind of ear worms for me that I just can't get out of my head like the freaking chorus on mirror Ridge but if you're looking for something really rhythmic really hypnotic very primal then this should most definitely do the trick or I could just take the easy way out and compare this to York Fever Ray and Laurie Henderson the whole thing lasts about 38 minutes 9 tracks but it feels so much longer to me than that it's so easy for me to just get caught up in these tracks and it's not hard to see why the sounds on here are so lush so thick so heavy the bass rumbles the drums hit really hard and the instrumentation surrounding those things is just mixed very very well I think my only real complaint about the LP is that sometimes the synthesizers the extra instrumentation sounds really really sin and that's because it is and even though I'm okay with the instrumentation being mostly synthesized sometimes I kind of don't like facing that harsh reality although it is kind of an interesting juxtaposition to hear this music that feels so primal created by this very modern technology maybe that's the point either way it's a really minor issue I'm loving the album from start to finish and I'm giving this thing a huge endorsement I'm gonna put it on the love list it's growing with me on each listen and at this point right now I'm feeling like a strong eight to a light nine on it it's really really freaking good and that's the review guys stay sexy I'll see you later if you're from America have a happy Thanksgiving and Glasser ring forever you "
4fbSlv4whH4,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and thank you for watching track reviews where we talked about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion kind of happy track reviews is really making a comeback guys on yesterday's video we got a ton of requests for this track and before I talk about it there are a few things that I want to mention to you album of the week king khan and the shrines what is fantastic LP number two future islands have a new music video for a split single they've got out on friends records you could watch that at our website the needle drop calm and also there are a couple links to where you can download to atlas sound b-side and covers and rarities albums and the thing is a lot of y'all were asking me to review those maybe it's in the cards maybe it's not a short review if you're into Atlas Sound you will probably like it and also on the needle drop calm you could stream the first off album compilation whatever you want to call it it's their first four EPs if you're into hardcore punk you owe it to yourself to put your ears on this links to all those d-box there's one more thing I want to mention the jam recently reissued one of the most popular albums sound effects there you go it's a deluxe version has a second disc of all sorts of demos and alternate versions and single versions of tracks I mean one of the Bands favorite LPS of mine is actually this is the modern world so most definitely check out either this or this or the band's first album if you're into that early punk and new wave sound cut copy they are an Australian outfit who a lot of people call electro pop alternative dance music but I wouldn't exactly say that was the case after the last track review I did of their new single where I'm going where I'm going had a surprisingly 60's pop rock sound to it though it did have a lot of modern editing techniques that kept it from sounding old hat the song is kind of a departure and the question on everyone's mind is what is this new album going to sound like well hopefully this new single take me over clears that question up maybe just a little bit I don't know link in the d'box to listen let's go well alright okay is this upcoming cut copy LP going to have an identity crisis or what in comparison to where I'm going this song is a little bit more of a return to that dance style of music that we're used to hearing from these guys for sure but it's not exactly doing an electro-pop thing it's more of an 80s new wave vibe I mean the Aerie synthesizers are reminding me of Gary Numan I'm hearing parts that I just think Thompson Twins Tom Tom Club even some of the drum fills were reminding me of like toto or something and I'm not saying those are influences just merely pieces of sound from that era that are kind of just rolling through my head as this song plays and of course if you're going to mention New Wave and Australia in the same breath you have to mention men at work now even though I'm digging this track a little bit a little bit there were things about it that kind of reminded me of where I'm going the thing about this song is it's very very well written it's very well-structured the band makes sure to introduce just enough sound in each piece of the song so that it doesn't feel repetitive you have these guitar upstrokes kind of just adding a little bit of color these foreign drum fills these very soft since just splashing against the mix and of course you have all these other little quirky noises going on in the background just kind of plinking away and adding just a fun little texture to this song you have a synth solo a heavy disco be coming in on the drums over the bridge there's like Jung noises and stuff it's a great sound my issue is that i'm having a hard time just thinking who this is cut copy it doesn't really feel like cut copy to me not that they should go back to their old sound what I'm saying is this doesn't really feel like they're putting a distinct sound on this their stamp on this it just feels like a Malaysian the emulation isn't necessarily bad you don't have to be one hundred percent original to make music that I like most certainly not the case in fact this thing copies a lot of cues from soul and funk music almost shamelessly I'm feeling a decent six on this thing just my opinion nothing to freak out about but nice to listen to wouldn't shut it off wouldn't tell a friend not to hear it I hope I like the upcoming album a little bit more as a whole but that's not going to happen until about februari of next year so we wait Anthony Fantana cut copy forever 
iBvPmPp4Xbg,girls broken dreams Club my needle juror this shirts there we go effects we are going to do an EP review it's been getting a lot of requests girls broken dreams club I'm sure you guys already know we have any Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd there's been a lot of talk around this thing ever since the first track heartbreaker was released just weeks ago weeks weeks weeks and if you guys have seen my review of it I freaking love their debut album and in fact I mean I think I actually like this thing now more than I did when I originally reviewed it as this EP was announced frontman Christopher Owens wrote a letter to go along with it that kind of explained that this thing came about due to the band making money on tour and just having this cash to spend on some extra production value he really explained this thing as being a snapshot of the horizon and this change is not something you really have to search for on this thing it's clear as a bell with a lot of extra instrumentation with organ with horns backup vocals pedal steel and a really crystal clear sound it just sounds really professional there are things about this EP that remind me of album kind of like the stylistic variety the opening track the oh so protective one kind of reminds me of something coming out of Everly Brothers territory while the following track heartbreaker is just a piece of phaser fed hippie pop broken dreams Club shoots for some tear in your beer country substance is a sad surf rock ballad there's really enough separation between these tracks to tell them apart easily but this thing really does come with a gigantic gripe for me girls this time around have really kind of toned down their eccentricity their wackiness their youth more often than not people see instrumentation people see added production and they automatically assume maturity has occurred and sometimes it's yes sometimes it's no I wouldn't even necessarily say that girls haven't matured with this EP I guess basically my issue is they've kind of swapped out their personality and kind of put instrumentation and production in place of it the debut LP felt like it just had so much more danger on there just felt really wacky felt pretty distinct and how it presented itself plus I think this thing is a little lacking in the songwriting department I'm hearing a lot of melodies that are either concoctions of or direct copies of melodies that came off of album especially Carolina to me what made album such a huge success is that it did so much with so little it says right in the liner notes this was not recorded in a studio and even though it wasn't the sound is fantastic and instead of going down the road of grabbing a ton of instrumentation it built a pretty vast soundscape just by making some tinny tracks making some walls of sound emulating a couple different styles of music it felt like it had so much to offer even though it came from very meager beginnings it's like a MacGyver of an album broken hearts Club just kind of sits complacently in the fact that it has added instrumentation at its disposal there are moments on here I like I love heartbreaker hits hard with a lot of passion and mood but songs like the title track are nowhere near as dramatic as they try to be that song just kind of sounds like a Bright Eyes impersonation to me something that could have come off of lifted this thing just didn't reach my expectations and I feel like the added production the extra layers of instrumentation are no replacement for that hard-hitting youthful immediacy that is on that debut LP like I said this does a lot with a little this thing does a little with a lot I haven't given up on girls it's not like I'm just gonna ignore their next album when it comes out and it's not like I just like instrumentation it's not like I dislike added production but I like lyrics and I like personality too I hate to see one suffer at the hand of the other I think girls can get both they just only have one here right now it just didn't have what I was looking for I'm feeling a strong five on it that may be an unpopular score but it won't be the first I've given it's only a reflection of my enjoyment of the album it's just an opinion but if you guys are digging on this thing what did you think of it did you like it did you hate it are you excited for this new horizon that girls are approaching let me know until girls next LP comes out I'm just going to enjoy album and listen to the song lust for life on repeat okay you have any Fantana girls broken dreams club 
1uhI4H6dAG4,it's track review no my needle drops Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd here with another edition of track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion now as I said in yesterday's video which you can watch if you click over there Mogwai has a new track out from their upcoming LP hardcore will never die but you will I asked you guys if I should review it and I got a ton of answers saying oh yeah hold on before I go on any further I want to mention I hope everybody had a good weekend I had a good weekend I saw a glass or play live got their CD it's pretty good might make sometime in the near future to review it I don't know anyway in case you don't know the Mogwai is a Scottish post rock band and this upcoming album will in fact be their seventh studio LP the song to have come out of his Renault pano pronounced incorrectly there's a link down there in the B box where you can hear it and here we go alright on this track guys I'm gonna say something that may leave some people who are not fans of Mogwai yet in the dust but I really can't help but think back to this band's last album the hawk is howling and what kind of surprised me about that LP especially the first song that was released from that album the Sun smells too loud was that there were a lot of straightforward sounds on that LP I feel like I really didn't know what to make of that album I'm a little iffy on that album in fact I feel like the band is making some kind of attempt to distanced themselves from that stereotype that all they do is play music that starts off and finishes loud and that's it and I will admit I'm a fan of this band but in that respect these guys have been a little bit of a one-trick pony some of the group's most popular songs are of that style most of the tracks on their new live LP are of that style but this song was way way way more straight forward I mean I feel like I could have shown this to somebody who wasn't a fan of the band and the beginning wouldn't bore them or they wouldn't be sitting there thinking when is the song actually gonna start when is anything actually going to occur because this thing if you're gonna call it post-rock there really is more rock than post here though the song does get a little louder as it goes on it starts off pretty voluminous right at the start with a distorted guitar the first thing that caught me was the extremely extremely odd rigid melody which I wouldn't say is catchy but somehow ends up being so anyway through how weird it feels through how robotic it feels and I first caught an eargasm on this track as soon as the drums came in the guitars are playing the melody the keys are playing the melody just this big wall of sound is occurring maybe not massive but pretty big and there's all of this texture just kind of floating throughout it not really all of this imagery of cinematic climaxes just reaching for the stars that you usually get on a Mogwai track though I'm sure the soft to loud formula is never going to leave MOG wise wheelhouse they have been making steps toward some more accessible sounds some more accessible structures I feel like this is the first time they really really succeeded and pull together something that is as dramatic as it is kind of easy to swallow I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing I'm liking it liking it a lot Sub Pop is about to drop a single for it in January I might pick that up too totally I'm digging this more than the first track to drop from the Hawk is howling and I'm expecting bigger things of this album expecting bigger things of this band and I hope you guys are digging this as much as I am let me know what you think of the track do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review tomorrow should I review this should I let me know Anthony Fantino Mogwai Reno piano forever 
2LVs5Ki7bjE,it's track review everyone you have any Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's a Sunday this past week was pretty good but I'm ready to just kind of just leave this week in the dust get the next one coming excited for this coming week and a couple good things to know one thing I want to direct your attention to or two things on the needle drop comm is there's a website all these samples that you guys can go to if you dug the new Girl Talk LP click on that if you want to see my review of it this fantastic website shows you all of the samples played inside of the album as you stream the whole LP really function and the second thing the band Mogwai of course has released the album art and the release date for their upcoming LP hardcore will never die but you will and they have also released the first single from the album there is a widget on the website where you can download the mp3 take a listen to it mm-hmm should I review it tomorrow should I track review it tomorrow should I should let me know but that is not what we're here to talk about on this particular episode of track reviews where we discuss the latest and greatest and worse and rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion the band in question is death spell Omega these guys have been getting a lot of requests in my most recent videos I gotta say my metalheads you are very diligent with your requests mmm now honestly I've never listened any of this band stuff before so prior to this track review I went back streamed a bunch of their old albums so you guys pretty much broke my death spell Omega cherry so Pat yourselves on the back for that one as I was digging through certain parts of the band's discography I really liked the thrash eNOS and the harshness of their early stuff but then they kind of evolved into I don't know just black-metal balladry just something that kind of reminded me of bur graven but this EP was really ambitious I love the lengths of the songs on here and this thing was a pretty tough shoot too now with their latest work the band has evolved into something that a lot of people are calling very progressive I would much rather label as highly technical music a very highly technical brand of metal that is also inspired by black metal the track in question that we're about to take a listen to is devouring famine link in the D box so you can hear it too let's see what it's got to offer Wow just uh I feel like I have a lot to say about that song I know that death spell Omega is most commonly associated with the black metal genre but I feel like at this point they're not even really playing black metal and that's not necessarily a bad thing I just want to know how interesting I think it is that they've really really just evolved past what they used to do on their earlier stuff into something that is much different whether you like them or hate them you've got to admit that these guys have really gone above and beyond to make sure that they are not a one-trick pony and not just rehashing a lot of the same stuff that their contemporaries have been in the black metal genre so now that we're past that this really reminded me of in some ways some bands I'm already familiar with in that they really like to take their technical ability and bring it to a point where they're constantly throwing new ideas new things different riffs or just dissonant sounds in-your-face to the point where it's just a sensory overload and it's just difficult to interpret much of anything that's going on I'm thinking bands like ruins thinking bands like portal or behold the arc to push or even to an extent the locust though I wouldn't necessarily say fans of this band will like any of those bands they all very similarly go for that idea of just throwing all this at the wall at once and just kind of seeing what sticks there are some more straightforward more melodic tracks on this new LP para Cletus but this one in particular is maybe just an example of what I'm not a huge fan of on the album it does sound like an assault it is an assault it is a red ass beatdown but the thing is none of it is all that captivating to me even after multiple listens nothing really sticks with me or interests me and though I like the fact that death spell omega' on many parts of this LP including this track are able to take something planned but make it sound so cacophonous so random so chaotic so unplanned it sounds almost as noisy as like free jazz but it's clearly been written I find the technical ability of this band very interesting but that only brings me so far you know what I'm saying who knows what the hell chords are being played on the guitar the drums were just so relentless at many points of this track the vocals were maybe just a little lower than I would have liked them it was kind of hard to make out a lot of what was being said all the overwhelming sound has kind of just left me underwhelmed because after all the noise just stops I'm kind of left feeling empty with no memory of anything that I just experienced so even though I am digging their earlier stuff a lot more and I do thank you guys for turning me on to that I can't say I'm a huge fan of this track and I'm surprised I didn't like it as much as I did because I did hear it in my latest blog TV but I don't know just on first listen I was much more impressed with it than I was after repeated listens so I'm kind of feeling a light too decent 5 on this track I don't hate it I'm just really mad on it there are songs on this album that I do like the closer for example and I like that track a lot because it is very well written it is much more melodic but most of the tracks on this album aren't like that one you guys heard the track let me know down in the comments what did you think of it did you love it did you hate it and why and what should I review that forever 
gg6CNWsotFc,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and we got to do a question of the week haven't done one in a while what do you want me to say some weeks I have questions some weeks I don't know a lot of my questions have to do with how the Internet is impacting music culture and that's because I'm very interested in music as a business before the internet was the main tool you had the radio which is pretty much how the mainstream was represented if not on television but all these independent bands these small labels function mostly around their local community people being interested in that scene who lived near it and it's kind of got me wondering does local music matter anymore do you support the bands that are local to you if you do why do you go out to a lot of shows where local bands play are you yourself in a local band or in an Internet age is there really no such thing as a local band I mean you can have no fans near where you live but a ton of fans in Japan who are buying your records to me in a way every band is local to somewhere this band for instance I've talked about them before album of the week procedure Club doomed forever they're from Connecticut but they're on a New York label and Internet wise they're promoted internationally you could even say for example on no waves or black lips even though these bands that are known to independent music fans around the world that doesn't necessarily mean they're huge they're big they're big-time within your town within your city your state your country does music that has made local Eligius musical events that are happening near you do they have any relevance are they important remember don't leave any review suggestions down there in the comments I'm not going to be taking any on the question of the week video I just really like to know what you think local music is it or is it not forever 
GMKfsj1fg5g,girl talk all day hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most opinion giving every day all the time music nerd guy thank you for watching it's time for an album review let's not beat around the bush let's just get right to it no one is going to take me seriously if my shirt is not buttoned now as I told you guys on Monday Girl Talk released a new album this week and then you guys started telling me he released a new album this week which doesn't make any sense because I told you I told you the title of the new LP is all day and if you don't know who Girl Talk is Girl Talk is a solo project created by Greg Gillis and Greg creates these long continuous dance jams mashing together top 40 favorites new and old if you enjoyed girl talks last album feed the animals this is really a no-brainer not much has changed since then of course there are newer samples here sounds from Drake big boy Rihanna Lady Gaga stuff that couldn't have possibly been on the last album but there are a lot of old staples here too Ludacris jay-z little Wayne get a lot of face time here just like they have in the past and there are some pretty surreal moments as the samples sort of flow into one another play over one another it's a pretty big mind food to hear Weezy rapping over New Order's bizarre love triangle it's kind of funny how I associate so much of this stuff as being so far apart from one another but they just sort of seem to mix together so well when Girl Talk is putting them on top of each other that sounded almost dirty if Girl Talk has gotten better at anything with this new LP it's mixing together things melodically there are a lot of moments here where I hear a guitar part maybe a chord progression from an oldies song a rock song and there maybe an R&B vocal piece over it and the chords actually work it actually comes together and functions like hearing sing over a Fugazi baseline or hearing hold Dirty Bastard sing ooh baby I get wrong over the course and Radiohead's creep who would think but aside from all that this LP really is very similar to feed the animals for me the build ups are similar the breakdowns are similar and a lot of the samples here have already been used on feed the animals and part of me says hmm I've kind of already heard this before but then again how exactly can you get down on a style of music whose sole purpose is recycling I guess I just kind of see girl-talk playing mostly with 80s new wave 90s alternative rock and a lot of modern hip-hop and R&B of course their shout outs to metal and punk on here and a lot of classics show up as well like u2 Iggy Pop Rolling Stones Michael Jackson and a lot more this LP if I'm correct I think is almost 20 minutes longer than feed the animals I think the mixing of the samples is a little bit better in I did notice that there are a lot more guitars on this thing but no change in Direction is so huge that this thing feels like girl talks really gone 180 here guys if there is a concept to all day it is to just cut up our mainstream music culture into their tiny baby baby pieces and then mix them together in this big-ass salad if that idea does not appeal to you then go far away from this album another reason to enjoy the cell P though is that it is free and how can you look a gift horse in the mouth I know I can't it has been growing on me more and more with each listen and I'm kind of feeling the light ate on it as of right now part of me kind of sits in fear and wonders man what if he puts out an LP that sounds exactly like this again what if I get sick of it but as of right now I'm not the kind of guy who can say no to this kind of stuff what do you guys think I should review next and thanks for being awesome thanks for being my needle drops Anthony Fantine oh girl talk all day 
ASYMfU7wpiI,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest isn't fizzy as is he busy Asst usik nerd very busy this week yesterday's Kanye review insanity it seems like my review either wasn't scathing enough or wasn't positive enough or just wasn't Anthony I'm really happy for you I'm gonna let you finish but you should really stay on topic here because this is not your your Kayne review you know what he's right this is the new Agalloch record mero of the spirit these guys are an Oregon outfit whose music just seems to kind of be a term magnet black metal post rock folk do metal and in a way it's true this new LP and a Glocks three previous albums are pretty genre-bending but from my point of view black metal really is the most obvious stylistic influence for fans of the more classic more popular sounds in black metal for the most part they're here tremolo picking the really thrashy drum beats of course the retched vocals but in a way we're kind of sailing on a very different ship here unlike a lot of black metal artists the recording quality on this thing is very clean and frontman John Hagen hope I'm pronouncing that correctly if I'm not okay he does scream on here but there are a lot of chilling whispers on here the sound as if death is kind of breathing down your neck on the watchers monolith there's this really strange eerie old man vocal that kind of comes in it's very clean it's played straight but it just sounds very archaic I don't know and on the fourth track around the seven-minute mark he lets out this really tortured hell that just chilled me to the bone and just got me standing at attention really fantastic there's a heavy fulk influence on this thing too which shouldn't be a surprise if you're already a fan of these guys there are a lot of acoustic guitar strumming chords underneath harmonized guitar solos lots of of Nordic melodies and it's not just like this thing switches off between oh it's electric now it's full whoo it's electric now it's full this thing is constantly blending the two in different fashions what I love about Agalloch on this LP is they have an extreme extreme appreciation for dynamics and layers and in a way it reminds me of how overworked folk elements into their early work another band this LP reminds me of and maybe you guys saw this coming is wolves in the throne room also a West Coast metal band also very black metal influenced also very ambitious very atmospheric music I especially see a lot in common with these guys in terms of song lengths the tracks here are long as hell one of the longest being 17 minutes and one of the most amazing things about this may be the biggest success of that album is that a gallant manages to stay engaging throughout every moment of this LP for me the track may start with some crickets maybe some water just some nature sounds build into a guitar intro some grumbles some weird sounds bring in the drums bring on the vocals start building it up layer those guitars out change up the vocal style bring it to a climax boil it down to a drone another guitar interlude explode one more time bow wow close curtain these tracks are constantly changing from one idea to another none of them are stagnant it's a really progressive record but it's not flashy it's very well recorded but it still manages to maintain a dark atmosphere and some harsh sounds as well and in terms of gripes I really don't have many in comparison to their earlier work especially their last LP ashes against the grain this album is not as heavy I would say it doesn't get as pummeling it doesn't reach that point of high volume but I feel like that was a conscious choice here the band has kind of swapped out that overbearing distortion for more sounds and more melody and it might not have been a bad exchange if you're a person who likes their music be varied immediate I could see this thing dragging on for you and even for some black metal fans the vocals here might feel maybe a little silly maybe a little jokey who knows but from where I'm standing this album doesn't feel like that at all I'm feeling a decent eight on this thing but I feel like I'm still yet to understand the album completely it really unfolds there's a lot to listen to and there's a lot to uncover with repeated listens it's one of those albums and I love music like that I'm putting this thing on the love list what did you guys think of it did you enjoy it do you take Agalloch seriously are they an important black metal band or do most black metal fans shun these guys for their popularity outside of the genre and also should I review this tomorrow should I review that tomorrow and if not this what what should I review Anthony Fantana Agalloch marrow of the Spirit forever you 
Jo4S2qlQGs0,Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review an album that everyone has been begging for begging for look hey Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy before listening to this album I had all this stuff just running through my head things I would say to kind of preface this review stuff like hey you know stuff like the VMAs The Today Show interview the Katrina slash George Bush debacle all the media gaffes all that stuff that's just context man it's not important this is music pay attention to the music leave your hate at the door it's a very similar argument I made when I reviewed mi a's last album but the more I listened to Twisted Fantasy the more I kind of came to realize that that position is total and utter bull not because Kanye's gaffes are so unforgivable that we need to scrutinize this album using everything he says that's not the case the reason it's hard to ignore context on this LP is because Kanye's favorite thing to rap about is himself on here he puts both his strengths and his flaws on display and it kind of makes me wonder what his Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is is it himself is it his life is it an album about his life basically the music here and Kanye West's personal life are pretty inseparable on this album the lyrics here reference everything to the fish sticks joke on South Park to the dudes very emotionally damaged love life rhyme wise flow wise I feel like Kanye's really creative here very much on the ball like the opener dark fantasy there's a point where I laughed my ass off when he said you got too many Oracle's on your team that's why you Winslow dad I'm loving a lot of the rhymes here and even when I don't like a certain track they are a little bit of a saving grace for me and I think that track is a particularly awesome start to this album just kind of paints Kanye's rise to the top and it's a little exciting but Kanye does not just think of himself as a rapper he also feels he is a singer and I will say singing is not the strongest tool in Kanye's toolbox sometimes his singing is a little off but it basically gets the job done but the best thing this LP has going for it for me is the beats the production just great sounds interesting samples I remember when watching live performances of the song power I didn't exactly know how to feel about the King Crimson sample in that track but I'm really loving the studio version the song clips flow together really well in that song and makes something that's really really cinematic it's just kind of a brave new world for sampling in my opinion I've always been a fan of sampling always been an advocate always felt like there's so much more potential for it but copyright is kind of standing in the way of that I would say the song power is a great example of that the artistry that sampling music can offer if the artist is freely allowed to do so and there are other tracks that surprisingly enough do a lot with a little like the song monster just has not really lush sounds but very kind of stripped down and simple primal drums minimal synthesizers but still sounds really dramatic and kind of eerie the track blame game kind of fits that bill too very dramatic but not overdoing it their soul samples on here a really firing classic spoken word piece delivered by Gil scott-heron crowd sounds just a lot of clips flying by every moment on this album whether you like Kanye or not this thing is ambitious as hell especially from a sonic perspective all the tracks flow together really well it's very cohesive Kanye takes most of his guests emcee spots and relegated them to a few Posse tracks that come together really well and even though I'm not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan the biggest Rick Ross fan they contribute some pretty good stuff to the album but gripes gripes cripes because there are gripes that I have and sort of the first one maybe an appetizer are the hooks a lot of the hooks on this thing either to me anyway just an opinion kind of come off a little corny or a little generic I'm thinking of tracks like hell of a life so appalled all of the lights maybe something that I could just kind of come across on any new rap song in the mainstream on the radio and that kind of lets me down because most of this album doesn't really strike me as being that type of music I'm going to say something that may spark a lot of angry comments but at least half of what I'm hearing here feels very artful to me for a mainstream hip hop album but my biggest gripe with this LP is something that I mentioned earlier in the review and that's how essential it is to me to be a fan or at least be interested in Kanye on a personal level to enjoy this I think even someone who hates Kanye can get into some of the storylines on this album at least a little the position that I'm in is that I don't care there's fantastic production here there's great rhymes but I'm not so interested in hearing about Kanye West's mood up social life so much that I'll just be sitting on the edge of my seat through eight minutes of the blame game or nine minutes of run away I get kind of bored what do you want me to do but people love the sick little details people love dirty laundry and I could see this album appealing in a big way because of that especially with how expensive and impressive the music sounds I enjoyed a lot of what I heard here I just didn't like a lot of the drama that this thing served up because it just doesn't feel all that relevant I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing but that's just my opinion you guys you were asking for this let me know what you think of this album is it Kanye's greatest work yet should we even be taking context into consideration when enjoying this album and what should I review next anthony Fantana Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 
S0igfnHzYwM,trolls man trolls everywhere it's track reviews hello my children Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd should I just be I should just be really boring and uninterested in everything today it's a Monday and there's some stuff on the blog that I would love for you to to look at fashion has a new mixtape out grizzly c3 yeah and Girl Talk just released a new album this morning awesome also there's a blog called lazy eye I officially made their awesome list for people who were particularly awesome this year I don't know why I'm on there who's an idiot and has two thumbs this guy and there's a video of a guy who I sent to a record too recently and then he sort of made a video about that record it's like funny it's like link in the d bucks and one more thing before we get into the review album of the week procedure clubs doomed forever these guys are a noose I need to Slumberland records they're a connecticut band and if noise pop is your thing behold there's some great LPS coming out week but I'm going to touch down on a track that has been out for a while now it's just kind of taken me until now to realize that I should comment on it yeah I've really been failing at track reviews for the past few weeks guys and I apologize for that of course I'm talking about the new Crystal Castles single not in love featuring Cure frontman Robert Smith this song was originally written by the 80s rock band platinum blonde and I learned that through listening to the song first on their second LP and you guys know you've seen the review I wasn't the biggest fan of the second album I like the first album or kill me but what they've done here is taken their cover and covered the cover which is pretty fucked up the single for this thing is out December 6 the via the fiction label let's give a listen to it Crystal Castles featuring Robert Smith well I get it I get more impressed with this track every single freaking time I listen to it obviously I can't give Crystal Castles and Robert Smith songwriting credits on that thing but they really have this is one this is one of those covers that really really reinvents the entire ambience of a song now I know what you're thinking bull hmm but I'm totally serious about that just compare the two go listen to the other version link in the D box this thing is much more electronic it's much more chilly much colder production-wise I love the lute boots since just kind of bubbling in the background as the track is building and I love just the way the percussion sounds to the dude nice Timbers nice textures now of course all that is very robotic very calculated but Robert Smith comes in and just adds a whole new dynamic to the track he is just overly emotional overly dramatic sounds like he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown kind of what you know made all of his material and the Cure so appealing the pumping bass in the background of this thing just turned into such a treat just adding a whole ton of tension to what this thing is heading toward and that's the chorus and the course is absolutely to die for it is like an explosion of color in my brain I just see all these neon lights just flashing before my eyes at lightning speed it is totally 100% unstoppable rave mode people are throwing glow sticks in your face and dancing in circles and taking E that's what the chorus is here for me and I think this version of the track is just such a welcome just such an amazing amazing contrast from the version on the album which isn't as dynamic doesn't have that explosion that I like here the action is a little tinnier not as hard hitting and the constant squeaky robot kind of vocoder vocals that are on that version it's okay it's alright it's not offensive it's just not my favorite thing in the world of course little snippets of those robot vocals make it into this version of the song and I like them more as kind of a counterpoint as just a little extra sound as opposed to the featured vocals on this track I'm feeling a decent 9 out of 10 on this thing I'm loving the hell out of it I'm sure a lot of you guys are too let me know in the comment box what do you think of this thing do you prefer this version or this version or this version and does Robert Smith still have it do you think that him working with Crystal Castles is not just a collaboration but kind of like an endorsement and should I review this tomorrow mm-hmm Anthony Fantana Crystal Castles not in love featuring Robert Smith forever [Music] 
oPQy0fn2Ypk,well my needle drops Anthony Fantana here long time no see today is an album review yesterday it was a track review and someone once told me variety is the spice of life someone anyway yesterday I got a lot of comments saying that my videos are finally turning up in some people's sub boxes maybe not other people's sub boxes I'm not completely sure how YouTube is working this thing right now all I know is that you should just continue revisiting the channel to make sure if there's a new video up you want to do this because there are some pretty good albums coming up soon and I've also been getting a lot of comments on this the new Teebs album ardour this thing is like the album review that won't die weeks before it was released I was getting comments about it and weeks after it has been released I am still getting comments about it so teams I congratulate you on earning your hardcore fanbase the sonic proof says he's obsessed with this album and awesome a says that I should review this or the new Kanye and with options like that I have to say Teebs is a California producer producer and one of many on the ever-growing brain feeder label created by Flying Lotus who is basically handpicking all sorts of musicians to release electronic music that combines elements of downtempo dubstep ambient music and hip hop also plays a pretty pivotal role for a lot of the people on the brain feeder label and our door is no different with his 18 tracks it's 51 minutes of beat heavy soundscapes but even at its most bumpin our doors not going to be bringing anybody out onto the dance floor this will be the last album to ever give anyone a heart attack believe me but that doesn't mean it's not interesting aside from a vocal contribution on track 15 and a couple songs that number over 4 minutes most of this album is short lucid instrumentals as one track starts to wear its welcome another one is starting to be introduced and the most impressive thing our tour has going for it is the army of sounds flowing throughout it all sorts of clicks weird percussion with room ambience on it swirling harps twinkling pianos jingles jangles vinyl hiss and crackle synthesized bass shakers wah wah wah wah this thing has a huge appeal on a DJ producer mentality there's a lot of howdy-do at moments if you're the type of person who is into the creation of sound into the manipulation of sound our tour offers a lot of that my major gripe with this LP though is kind of its song structures there's a lot of sameness there on a lot of these songs many of the sounds just kind of go file and rank and March one by one into the mix and then kind of peter out by the end of the song rinse wash and repeat until boring but to kind of play devil's advocate it is very warm and relaxing music not really mind-bending but mind massaging kind of best kept on headphones for me I tend to favor music that's maybe a little more upbeat maybe a little more experimental maybe a little more adventurous and that bias has affected me in the enjoyment of this album for sure but if you're looking for a calming experience in your beat music this is definitely the album for you I kind of imagine this as bats with no vocals and a little less weird or maybe even Toro y Moi but a lot more sober or even more straightforward Kozma grandma maybe this is a sad thing to say and then again maybe this is kind of the point of the album I mean a lot of people have labeled this as downtempo but this LP is never ever ever going to take up my foreground but it's fantastic and kind of just painting my background if you know what I'm saying if you're zoning out this should be your soundtrack I'm not on the fence with it I did like it it is listenable and I was impressed with some of the production I'm kind of like a strong six on this but all those people who were asking for this review let me know what you think of the album are you in love with it are you kind of feeling the same way I am about it but you love chill moods more than I do hmm and what should I review next anthony Fantana Teebs ardour forever 
iJ5o99-MO7I,it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion quick one second this has nothing to do with what we're going to do today there's the magic of video right there all change on the needle drop cabra now stream a new track from deerhoof slowly they are leaking their entire album Deerhoof versus evil track by track by track I guess until its final release date next year and also new single from automatic Gucci that I got turned on to via our blog TV this past Monday downloaded for free have a good time stay safe almost but first before we get into this track review some good news and some bad news the good news a lot of people maybe even you are subscribing to the channel we're closing in on twelve thousand subscribers we're going to be there very soon my friends very soon the bad news is that for some reason for the past week my videos have not been showing up in my subscribers subscription boxes Thank You youtube I have no clue why nobody's watching nobody is watching this right now you're not even watching this so I figured what I need to do is take my rage out on something that deserves it I hate nature if you are watching this video just keep in mind for the next week or so who knows how long it's going to be my videos may not be showing up in your youtube subscription box so come back to the channel check and see if there's something there there probably will be I haven't failed you thus far picture of the LP that the track we will talk about comes from the new asobi seksu album fluorescence these guys announced the release of this LP just this week it's going to be out in February 2011 they have leaked one song from the album so far the album covers looking pretty 90s right there the track is called trails and there's a link in the d'box where you can download it and stream it ok ok I'm feeling that I'm feeling that you've got to be careful with these headphones this is their fifth studio LP gonna be coming out I dug this quite a bit it was kind of a surprise to hear from these guys I mean I know they've made louder tracks before a lot of guitar distortion on this one a lot of volume a lot of layers on this particular track but what shocked me here is that the sobe well this really breaks away from the dream pop Leibel that a lot of people slap on these guys I'm sure they're going to be softer tracks on this album but still this song kind of a powerhouse a little muscular a little beefy you can wrestle with it but we'll make this thing kind of stand out for me is that it really wasn't straight forward and catchy and hooky like I've come to expect from these guys this thing is certainly way more experimental way more linear kind of building like a roller poster in falling and just not a very common song structure on this thing I really wasn't sure what to make of the beginning in fact I don't even really know if I like the beginning all that much it felt so awkward maybe a little out of place there was a lot of dissonance going on with the multiple guitars layered over one another that really didn't fit with you communities vocals but i'm sure that sound was intentional but it gradually moves past this into something that i would say is just really dramatic there are points where I feel like Yuki is just kind of in the spotlight and just singing her brains out and covering the mix in emotion there are some spots where this is kind of reminding me of bjork combined with some of these early shoegaze sounds and the ending on this thing is such a rush nothing is recycled nothing seems overused this thing is constantly developing one idea into another and I like that it's kind of a fresh sound for these guys to me I was impressed with the production impressed with the songwriting impressed with the vocal delivery I can't say I love this song so much that I'm going to be repeating it until the release of this album but I am very excited for this new asobi seksu down there in the comments let me know what you thought of this track did you love it did you hate it and why and I want to thank all my needle drops who actually suggest to this to me in the comments on my more recent videos those of you who actually are getting them in your subscription boxes Anthony Fantana trails so be sexy fluorescence forever 
yetM0u9wqck,weekend sports okay hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd gonna do an album review fresh off my nerd track review yesterday and now that I got a track review in me I'm pumped Pumped to talk about a full-length LP yeah I'm ready I'm ready I'm tough what's up I can take it okay forget it sorry let's be serious because music is serious business Before we jump into this one thing I want to mention on the needle drop calm you can stream the new caribou remix album stream a new song from the new deer of LP coming out next year and you can see the blog TV playlist from the blog TV we had this past Monday it's all linked there in the d'box so anyways speaking about being tough this album is tough oh yeah it's tough it's not like Henry Rollins tough it's more like getting a ton of bricks dropped on you tough their new signee to the slumberland records label their name is weekend and this is their album sports these guys are a California trio whose music I could really only classify as as noise rock but like I said earlier these guys are on slumberland and slumberland has housed some of the serious powerhouses of shoegaze like black tambourine and some new favorites like the pains of being pure at heart or crystal stilts so there's definitely an element of that classic shoegaze II slumberland sound in there too this thing is 10 tracks spans 45 minutes and I'll get my number one gripe out of the way right now there are several tracks on here that are either filler or are kind of bordering on filler not much happens it kind of meanders may be boring but the tracks that i do like are much longer it doesn't feel like the album gets derailed I don't feel cheated I don't feel gypped maybe these tracks are more transition periods the songs that do excite me though on this album are hard-hitting pieces of noise punk psychedelic Adelia punk because the drums are so fast the bass lines are pumping the tempos are high this thing just has a really hot energy it is a pot boiling over it is a car about to overheat it is a plane with a blown engine it is that kind of tension and I say psychedelic because this thing is soaked in reverb the vocals the guitars I think the drums to nearly everything it just is this wash of sound however even though a lot of bands are pursuing this sound a lot of bands are doing the reverb thing what I like about the reverb in this particular instance is that it doesn't take away from the brutality of the songs it doesn't take away from the percussion it doesn't take away from just how energized the music feels because usually a lot of the shoegaze these stuff a lot of this cavernous production has the tendency to be sleepy and though there are some moments on here like that maybe noise ambient tracks I guess you could say the parts on here that are upbeat that our fast-paced come together really well I wouldn't say the production here creates a dreamscape as much as a whirlwind of pain and the final thing is is just the noise which maybe is this albums biggest strength the guitar sounds here gets so ugly and gets so distorted I mean just take the opener for example coma summer you can stream that one in the in the d'box the tone on the guitar is there man it sounds like somebody's trying to open my skull with a giant electric can opener distorted guitar layered over distorted guitar and on this track and a bunch of songs on this album a lot of weird atmosfera comes that I really couldn't even begin to describe is it feedback is that some kind of effect is it electronics i'm not sure but it's there I love the production and not to say the sound here is crystal clear or comes off as if it was recorded in a one-hundred-thousand-dollar in our studio Sports is just loud aggressive proud not catchy but haunting because they don't really find myself humming along with melodies or mouthing lyrics when I'm finished listening to this album as much as I am just kind of sitting back and admiring the dent weekend has put in my eardrums this thing just barely squeaked by with a light 8 i'm going to put it on the love list which is linked down there in the d'box a list of albums that i loved thus far this year and let me know in the comments what you think I should review next album reviews track reviews whatever reviews thanks for requesting this thanks for being awesome Anthony Fantana weekend sports forever click the like button for justice 
YQL2E353bPw,Hey it's tract review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd on the Internet and we are gonna do a track review where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music but before that we have a few things on the agenda first off we did a blog TV last night thank you to everybody who came out it was a freaking blast if you guys want to know when and if we're doing a blog TV in the future follow us on facebook follow us on twitter that's where we usually announce it first and also two songs linked in the d box a new single from the band's civil civic who i've talked about on this channel before great track on their Bandcamp stream it downloaded for 50 Cent's too and also a lot of y'all we're talking in a couple past videos in the comment section about a new single from smith westerns they have a new album coming out next year this is the cover of it and the single is pretty freakin good I don't know if I'm gonna track review it no plans right now to but down there in the D box give a listen to it it's a lot poppy or a lot sweeter than anything that they put on this right here which is sort of their debut full-length on Fat Possum records it's decent if you're into the low fight garage rock lo-fi pop rock but this little sweeter a little nicer little catch here and I know I'm gonna be reviewing a nerd track on this track review but you know I'm just so much into the new Duck Sauce song Barbra Streisand and I just feel like oh it's just stuck in my head I can't get it out of my head I just feel like maybe my videos could do a little bit better with some or restore sort of picture of the LP that this track comes from the new nerd album nothing nerd is a trio and they're very hard to classify they've been called a lot of things from hip-hop to R&B to funk to soul they hit it pretty big when I was in college and Pharrell kind of came into his own as a rapper and it sort of seems nowadays you you can't turn around without seeing the guy in a music video or on somebody's single and of course him and Chad Hugo two-thirds of this band make up The Neptunes who have seriously been one of the most essential production duo's in the 2000s well nothing is nerds latest LP and because a lot of you are asking for it want to make you all happy I am gonna take a listen to the latest single from the album link in the debugs nerd with hypnotize you there we go hypnotize you let's get into that I have to say the first thing that I kind of noticed is that there was a lot of repetition in this song not necessarily that whoo the verse was just repeating repeating repeating repeating over and over within that section but the first verse was the same as the second verse which sounded the same as the third verse not really any variation throughout this track but it didn't really bother me however I can't say that the song wouldn't have been made better if there was just some more subtlety some more build some more texture some more detail but why I didn't really hold issue with it is that the sounds were so good I loved that that was like a really nice rumble in the background and the soft sweet synthesizers just sort of swelling in the background fantastic and you know of course it sounded like considering Pharrell's vocals like a French electro combined with prince because farro was singing Barbra Streisand if you written French electro at all and you picked up that sound it shouldn't be surprising that Daft Punk actually produced this tracks the lyrics were a different thing of course Farrell singing about sex here which isn't surprising you know he touches upon that subject and a lot of his songs but the only people who I've known to ever have a problem with sex in music are either people who think it's a sin or people who aren't getting any yeah I like the picture that was being painted clothes being taken off it was just very sensual but you know here's my issue there's a fine line between being tasteful and not being tasteful and this is kind of an issue I have in general with nerd and they'll pull together a great sound a great vibe some decent lyrics or a great flow and then they'll somehow find a way to shit all over it with some kind of stupid useless lyric like in this track where it was just repeated over and over touch a crowd touch across and there's that part in the bridge where he's like one's bubs tends to unless this song is about prostitution money and sex should have nothing to do with each other so that's kind of my good and bad about this track and like I said in general just nerd when they want to be they can be very conceptual very kind of working on your brain they very much were on their last album but then again they always kind of remind you oh but we also like to rap and sing about the same old crap everybody else does so I'm kind of feeling like a strong five to a light six on this song I was impressed by the production I was impressed by some of the lyrics and though I'm sure some people may be getting down on the fact that you know the falsetto singing on this track isn't exactly you know all that experienced it seems kind of amateurish I dug it I thought it was cool I just thought maybe the lyrical content could be a little bit better and maybe that some more variation could have been thrown into this thing but you guys let me know down there in the comments what you think I should review next and what you thought of this track what do you think of the new nerd LP is it amazing is it fantastic is it blowin your mind you know and even though I didn't dig on this song I still have to give it to nerd an artist like Flying Lotus or Kid Cudi or you know what even Kanye West because a lot of these people are taking hip hop and making it more of an art form experimenting with it incorporating different sounds and different ideas they're not just doing the same old thing most of the time nerd nothing hypnotize you Anthony Fantana of Montreal cherry peel forever you 
x217SO9VPwE,"CeeLo green lady pillow did you hear the news it's the needle drop he's got reviews every day yeah then don't stop so it's time to hit up the new CeeLo green so listening and wise up if you haven't seen how cool he is CeeLo is great he's a great guy hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most busy music nerd on the Internet at this very internet moment in time Internet I hope everyone had a good weekend I want to tell everybody that I uploaded a few reviews this past weekend want to make sure they don't get glossed over the new gold Panda and the new matin Kim if you're into pop music or IDM there most definitely worth a try links down there in the d box now CeeLo if you don't know this guy get on that search engine you can also check out a track review I did earlier this year of the first single from this LP mm which I had no idea no clue but that this would happen but my video just kind of became my most popular overnight and right now it has over 180,000 views man forget you I hate count your chesta this is the Ladykiller Cee Lo's third studio LP and right from the start on the intro you have a track full of faux James Bond music gunshots a narration about a license to kill ladies it's pretty obvious that what we're in for here is an album that isn't afraid to get corny for having a good time though maybe it does go a little overboard once in a while like with the sexy spoken word on bodies or the gun samples on love gun which kind of ruin the song but that's besides the point once you get past that this thing is a love hungry sentimental piece of neo soul I like that new roots John Legend collapse raishin it just puts an updated view on the classic sounds of donny hathaway Curtis Mayfield Marvin Gaye Al Green actually in comparison to that new John Legend LP I would say this is even a stronger embrace of that classic sound I was surprised that I didn't hear Cee Lo rap on this thing even though there's some pretty impressive rhymes on his first solo LP but I think kind of kickin rap to the curve this time around resulted in Cee Lo's most consistent album yet but the problem the Ladykiller runs into to do though is that sometimes the music is so close to that original soul formula it's like oh what's the point this has been done before but Cee Lo is so good at singing this it's almost a travesty that he was born too late to be putting out this album in 1972 but it's not like this LP is a dusty old piece of vinyl full of crackles it's not the case it has a very smooth modern sound almost at the point where the production is so clean that it's sanitary I would say that the instrumentation the music and the background maybe the album in general kind of just lacks personality I would say that if it weren't for the fact that Cee Lo is just flying in on the vocals and just dousing this album in his character his vocal range his lyrics they steal the show every time and that's a good thing nothing outshines Cee Lo on this my only other issue with the instrumentation is that you know what sometimes it's pretty apparent that the percussion is being handled by either a drum machine or some loops I would have preferred to just hear some more live drums but that didn't really bother me overall there's way too much going on here to get hung up simply on that there are string sections female backup singers just shimmering guitar upstrokes dynamic bass just bright horn hits this thing is a pretty expensive production a lot of musicians were brought in on this project aside from Cee Lo's vocals the best thing this LP has going for it is the songwriting whether or not let's take a track like you whether or not the lyrics there offend the melody is just too good to deny and the same goes for tracks like I want you no one's gonna love you it's okay just songs that grab me by the shirt and drag me from beginning to end and it's like awesome this LP has its strengths and its weaknesses fortunately it's got more good than bad going for it but enough potholes in the ride to kind of keep me from ranting and raving about it a lot of people sent me in requests for this thing so I gotta ask what do you think of this help II did you love it did you hate it I know a lot of people were excited by that single mm you so did this album deliver in your opinion and make sure to let me know what I should review next anthony Fantana Cee Lo Green the Ladykiller forever "
WjH-L0Pke7Q,"Matt and Kim sidewalks my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest it is he is music nerd and thanks for watching y'all I'm flattered by the fact that you guys watch and I just wanted to tell you that you know the channel is approaching 12,000 subscribers we're growing and as the channel gets more popular it doesn't get harder to review albums I mean the album's that come out next week are gonna come out next week whether I have 100 subscribers or 100,000 subscribers but it gets harder to meet the demands of every single one of you guys who are sending me requests all the time but you know what that's not a bad thing it's a good thing I'm up for the challenge of meeting as many review ideas as possible as you guys can try to throw at me and besides if it all gets really overwhelming I can handle a few review spots over to coucher chest up who cares this is an album that a lot of you guys have been requesting in the comments on my videos and it's the new Matt and Kim sidewalks and I'm kind of surprised I did not know I had that many Matt and Kim fans in my nyl drops I mean who put all these Matt and Kim fans and my needle traps man but whatever that's diversity and diversity rules now if you don't know a man Kim Ari New York duo this is their third officially released LP and they hit a pretty big last year with the album grande which didn't get the most rave reviews from critics but somehow managed to get the band a really strong cult following anyway that's a good thing reviewers that album to my knowledge was self recorded by the band had a very rough in the moment sound strong influences coming from both modern pop and modern Punk it wasn't the most focused thing in the world but extremely lovable because of its sheer energy on sidewalks though Madden Kim pretty much throw all of those rough sounds from their earlier stuff out the window violently they've got a shiny new studio sound here and it's almost like they're a completely different band if it wasn't for Matt's vocals you would have a really hard time convincing me that this is the follow-up to Grand and that's because a lot of the piano sounds from the last album are gone replaced by much more synthesized keys and Kim's drum sound huge and bombastic almost like something out of a drum machine or a hip-hop single there's some moments where the instrumentation gets an upgrade with a lot of glockenspiel there even some moments where some flutes pop up and add a really nice texture but instrumentation isn't the flashiest thing on this album for the most part sidewalks just kind of aims to make nice straight and to the point pop tunes really the only unchanged element on this LP is the lyrics and personality that man Kim have to offer this stuff is light-hearted synth pop with heavy drumbeats it's bright and shiny music it is good mood music it is so unpretentious and unassuming it's all about having a time hanging with friends going out to eat staying up late just going outside and enjoying the world around you and I'll admit you know what I'm not a huge man Kim fan I never have been they've never really appealed to me however it's impossible for me to hate this band or hate their music in any capacity if the songs here are any show of their personalities of the way that they are in real life then they've got to be really likable people now you guys know that there are moments where I may let go of my inhibitions and enjoy something that is completely shameless in its joy but this sadly is not one of those occasions the only real danger you run into on this album and music like this is that it gets so happy and so smiley that it's obnoxiously waving it in your face maybe something like owl city but I don't think sidewalks goes all that far down that road there are some moments where yeah it's kind of too sweet it's hurting my teeth I might be getting a cavity but there are hooks on here that are really too good to deny like the song cameras or the opener block after block my only real issue with this LP overall is that it's much more confined it's much more orchestrated than Mankins earlier efforts not a lot of danger and no extremes but really I'm on the fence with this album and I wouldn't blame that on anything more than it just not being my cup of tea I know a lot of fans may be a little sad that Matt and Kim have gone in a much poppier direction on this album but if they're bright and upbeat personalities have been what attracts you to their music then this thing should not be a disappointment I'm like a strong five on this right now but I want to know what the man Kim fans think are you in love with this LP are you hating it and why favorite track least favourite track and what should I review next thanks for watching man Kim sidewalks Anthony Fantana forever "
hWJ40emz1ew,hey buddy have you heard the news it's album reviews hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan Oh the Internet's busiest music nerve here sitting here on this chair and we're gonna take a look at the new gold panda album lucky shiner this guy has received a lot of chatter in the comment section of my more recent videos this new LP is out now on the record label ghostly international and gold Panda is a UK music producer who a lot of people are dubbing chillwave wait wait you wish bill white gel way show chilli yes everyone's new favorite genre chillwave but I don't buy it so I'm just gonna throw that right out the window because labeling everything chillwave rules okay personally on this new gold panda help II I'm feeling a lot of four to the floor beats a lot of house and techno influence and a little bit of hip hop in there this new album I could see why a lot of people who watch this show are talking it up because it treads a lot of the same water as albums I've loved earlier this year like Pantha new Prince's black noise or baths cerulean so the strength the sound of this album sort of seems to come from loops and samples which I know in theory isn't all that exciting a lot of people are going down that road but go panda goes about in a very interesting way there are some moments where you may pick up an original synth part something like that but most of the sounds here have either been lifted from other pieces of music or a beat program but all these samples that gold panda uses they're cut really short they're layered on top of each other they're manipulated to a point where they no longer resemble their former selves like take the first track for instance you which features a woman singing murder let that singing voice is sort of chopped and repeat into the squeaky noise that flows throughout the mix very weird but also very catchy kind of caught me off guard most of us on this record is kind of difficult to define origin wise but there are some spots where it's clear that gold panda is sampling some Chinese music some sitar some thumb piano I think strings and there's even a moment where a track sounds as if there's this drone in the background created by cutting and looping the sound of an accordion sort of opening with all these loops cycling over and over and over in the mix it can get a little repetitive unlucky shiner but there's so much going on at any given time it's hard to get totally bored there are a lot of different sounds here but what I like is that it all builds into a similar theme which is just chill easygoing beat music there isn't a song I hated on this album but like I said earlier this thing does hit a lot of the same targets that albums I have loved earlier this year already have that kind of makes this thing fall into the grey for me but only a little bit there is some interesting stuff going on here and some pretty standout tracks as well some songs aren't as captivating as others but I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this LP Gold Panda is formulating a sound this album is part of that what I heard was very nice but not distinctive enough to make me go 8 but if you guys heard this album did you love it did you hate it why let me know and also what should I review next that'd be nice to know Anthony Fantana Gold Panda lucky shiner 
KOLkwwzrn7w,Oh Kid Cudi the man on the moon Oh Oh my needle drunks Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest and most aerodynamic music nerd here thanks for being awesome and watching it's time to do an album review the album in question is the new Kid Cudi man on the moon - the legend of mr. rager and this thing has received a lot of hype in the comments on my videos and also has been reviewed by two fellow reviewers of mine sushi goat and three creation the last of which just reached a thousand subs good job man good job even Cal Church esto think she did a good job great job be cremation so all this influence has led me to believe that I should put my two cents in on this album of course this is the follow-up to man on the moon the end of day and this new LP is an extremely ambitious and introspective five act set of songs that spans an entire hour right from the start on this thing I feel like I'm listening to something fancy something expensive lots of strings on some of these beats a little piano plenty of backup singers and a lot of good guest spots too from CeeLo mary j blige Kanye West and I was surprised to see that even the cool kids Chuck Inglish gets producer credits on a track even though there are a lot of musicians and engineers and producers sort of tweaking this project Kid Cudi's narrative stays strong the lyrics paint a really dark picture of Cuddy's life relating to depression suicide friends family love Fame there's even a song here called marijuana and it was the first pot song I'd ever heard that wasn't like yeah we that's gotta count for something this thing might be a breath of fresh air for some music fans to kind of stumble upon a rapper who isn't endlessly rhyming about how cool he is and for the most part I dig Cuddy's voice a lot I feel like it's pretty distinctive I can pick it out of a lineup it's like slightly raspy but there's some smoothness there too I think the best way I could describe it is maybe as smoky but that's the rapping when it comes to the singing Cuddy can be on and Cuddy can be off when I think of a good track a song like mr. rager comes to mind where he's playing these two parts where he's kind of singing and rapping at the same time but then he just totally lets go of the rapping in the chorus and just lets a lot of passion into his voice he's just playing these two roles extremely well not even playing two roles but blending the idea of singing and rapping together but then their songs like erase me which is the album's like soul rock anthem where Cuddy's singing voice just isn't as dynamic as it is on other tracks Kanye spits a really good verse on that song but most of the lyrics don't really appeal to me and this isn't the only spot on the album where I'm feeling disconnected from the emotions here this LP actually feels a lot like the new Drake album for me where there's a strong narrative a strong idea of personal struggle and sorrow but I feel like I'm observing more than I'm sympathizing Cuddy is worrying about everything Cuddy's friends are worrying about him but I have no clue what the hell everyone's worrying about I have no idea why everybody is so down and so depressed sure you know life isn't just this really long stroll down Candy Cane Lane but nobody gets shot here there are no time bombs about to go off there's some decent lyrics here some decent beats Cuddy has a decent flow but what he lacks for me is just this urgency in his voice I guess a delivery this personality that makes me feel ooh is urgent ooh I should really be sad when I hear a sad thing my only other real gripe is that some of the beats get a little monotonous but it's nothing that ruins the LP as a whole especially considering how much variety there is here I have to recognize a great idea when it's happening and this thing too despite its personality flaws does a great job of fusing hip-hop with rock and electronics and pop music we're only going to see more fusions like this in the future I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing you guys know that's just my opinion I feel like what I'm dealing with here is just an album that isn't for me but let me know what you guys think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why and tell me what you think I should review next in the comments below because if you don't tell me I don't know which just means your thanks Anthony Fantana Kid Cudi man on the moon forever 
XvPpOLp-8LM,you needle drops Anthony Fantana the Internet's least racist music nerd here about to do another album review and I'm going to jump on the bandwagon with something that is not only pitchfork but Stereogum calm approved it's also been requested like crazy that's right it's a dough three mega noble mixtape big review whatever that means - racist is a New York rap outfit two MCS and a hype man and they hit it pretty big earlier this year with their first mixtape shut up dude and this thing is not your average rap LP and whether or not this is better than your average rap LP is kind of for you to decide but it certainly is different right right right I think the biggest separator between this and this and everything else is I don't know seriousness the way I see it 99.9% of rappers from the toughest thug to the most socially conscious backpacker want to be taken seriously they all want to be taken seriously even Asher Roth wants to be taken seriously even one of hip-hop's biggest clowns Ludacris on some level wants to be taken seriously but that's racist seems a lot less concerned with how people perceive them whether it's a joke or oh no it's really serious in fact a lot of the lyrics between these two mixtapes actually play with the idea of them being novelty or not I think at the end of the day they just kind of want to keep people guessing why do you got to pick just one I see the whole thing is more eccentric than novelty but I wouldn't be surprised or offended if people just took this as kind of mm-hmm the thing is it gets pretty ridiculous with - racist here like with the track combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell guess what that songs about but it contains use with more tracks like fake patois which is very jokey but also one of the most interesting and funny critiques of modern rap that I've heard today good on these two LPs MCS Victor Vasquez and Manchu Sri lazily sing along to their own sampled hooks rant rave and make rapid-fire disjointed references to just about anything that's been on television radio magazine covers movie screens and restaurant menus for the past 20 or 30 years I'm talking Smurfs Inspector Gadget falafel fast food the days of our lives the Land Before Time racism following the sensibility of these rhymes is literally like walking through an endless maze trying to figure it out is only going to lead to an aggravating dead-end so it's kind of best to just Bob your head and let all of the references just kind of play out in your brain because they all meld together into this sensory overload of mainstream and underground culture that appeals directly to college aged males and females but shut up and sit down are two different experiences and what separates them is sit down is a little more refined for me some moments on shut up get a little too repetitive to keep my attention for the whole track and some of the hooks get pretty obnoxious toward the end of the album but that album had a ton of potential and sit down is where - racist cashes in on it with a fresh set of producers and guest emcees who also felt like there was something special about that first LP every song on here has a different production credit it's got more collaborators than most major label rap releases and it's a testament to - racist talent that they still maintain the same personality the same goals the same direction throughout this album even though they are taking on a lot of different creative input the rhymes are still weird the flows that sir Ian Vasquez have at their disposal are a force to be reckoned with and if you only listen to sit down man I see no reason why you wouldn't take these guys as seriously as MF DOOM or wu-tang clan or the cool kids or LP or the newly hyped West Coast rap outfit Odd Future I think the bees here are better the production is more impressive and because the production is higher Vasquez and Suri are rapping at that different level too you know they want to match the sound quality of this album lyrically for shut up dude I'm kind of feeling a light six on that thing but from where I'm standing sit down man is a decent eight easily but good or bad you all know that this is just my opinion there are links down there in the D boxed or you can download both of these mixtapes for free legally so you've basically got nothing to lose if you're a fan of hip-hop thank you for the likes thank you for the loves and thank you for the lulz Anthony Fantana - racist forever [Music] you 
RkumjdJ-Eew,my needle drops Anthony Fantino here here in this spot the Internet's most excited music nerd because we're about to tear into the new Brian Eno LP small craft on a milk see now if you don't know who Brian Eno is I did a track review of a song from this LP recently there click on that you can go watch it and there's also this really cool underground website with random articles about random things called Wikipedia and yeah they have been just kind enough to put up a great page about Brian Eno that you should check out yeah now I've received a ton of requests a million-in-one comments about this LP but none more interesting than this it's Act says that Cal Church esta gave me a ring the other night and told you to convince me to review the new Brian Eno LP his words his words Cal oh yeah how do you know Brian you know is it is it ambient one I know I don't know the Bambi one is it taking Tiger Mountain by strategy mm-hmm no I don't like Tigers is it Coldplay oh yeah I love the Coldplay get out get out like Coldplay you didn't predict new trucks did you blow it look guys girls don't give Cal to chesta your phone number okay it's just it can't possibly lead to anything good now this LP even though it just simply has Brian Eno's name on it he does not act alone there is quite a bit of Sonic input here from guitarist and studio musician Leo Abraham's and electronic musician John Hopkins who actually has a great LP out on Domino Records in sides after decades of making music Eno has not changed all that much I mean most of this thing does go in an ambient direction but Brian is always looking for new sounds new ideas to develop this concept that has made him such an essential musician I can tell you right now that there really kind of two sides to this LP one side being the one that is most likely to catch people right from the start songs that are in the vein of what everybody has probably heard from this LP already like horse and two forms of anger very vast very tense pieces of electronica that are just full of noise and percussion lots of treated sounds and things that I just could not even begin to identify or even theorize as to how they created it just sounds like something that could totally soundtrack a fight scene in the matrix but only about a third of the LP is like that the rest of it is something that is more likely to get people tuning out if you're not into exploring wide sprawling sound scapes I absolutely love the atmosphere the Brian Eno pulls together on some of these tracks I mean seriously some of these really really get to me if I'm listening to them on headphones it's like I am the only person for miles and yet I'm also feeling kind of paranoid too like I could turn around in any moment and someone will be there with a knife or nunchucks it's seriously what purgatory must sound like if there is such a place there are those moments of darkness those moments of eeriness but there are also parts that are pretty relaxing here as well like the track Emerald and stone I just can't help but think of floating when I hear that song just the really slow piano arpeggios and the airy sense and the background and that's really what this album boils down to for me like soundtrack music and even though there isn't really a movie to go with small craft on a milk sea I don't necessarily soundtrack music is something that is just set to images but something that also brings images up my one major issue with this LP though to me at least on the surface anyway it doesn't feel like there's any theme or concept pulling all of these tracks together sure most of these tracks do fit into the same genre but I feel like they could just be arranged any old way and you'd get nearly the same result it's loose change in my pocket happen to be honest I love this album I'm really loving it the sounds are so clean and pristine and yet they're so unique and well arranged - it's a very synthetic album where the melodies are extremely captivating the effects are memorable the highs get my blood pumping the lows really chill me out I can't say much that as negative about it outside of the yeah the cohesion I'm feeling a light - decent 8 on this thing but an 8 all the same but I want to know what you guys think about this thing I know there are a lot of Brian Eno fans in my needle drop subscriber base so yeah do tell do you love this thing do you hate this thing and why thanks for watching Anthony Fantino Brian Eno small craft on a milk sea forever I didn't I didn't predict that 
wumo4Urajx4,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and I hope everyone had a good Halloween weekend recovering from all that candy eating all that Satan worshipping don't act like you don't do it I know you're sick disgusting habits and what better way to indulge in those habits than by reviewing the new electric wizard album black masses I've been anticipating this review for weeks mostly because you guys have been requesting it like mad with comments like this one and this one one this one this one this one but but also electric wizard is one of the toughest acts to follow in doom stoner sludge whatever you want to call it metal for over 15 years they've built a reputation on their thick sound and heavy riffs but this LP is a change in that formula even if it is just a small one the most obvious change for me between this album and electric Wizards previous LP which called today is the overall tempo of this thing electric wizard is not stopping to smell the roses on this LP like they used to which may disappoint some people hoping for another dope throne though black masses does have its slow moments this thing is not a gigantic lizard monster stomping slowly through city streets and punching buildings and smashing cars which is usually how I like to picture some of my favorite do metal albums black masses feels a lot more like a down-tuned psych rock record which isn't necessarily a bad thing because electric wizard really labored over the mix on this LP some of my favorite songs here start with a riff and kind of build into this wall of sound that is just impenetrable I'm talking about tracks that build up into a density that is so intense it feels like I'm about to have a mental breakdown kind of like Sater 9 Scorpios curse Venus in furs and these walls of Sounders is built out of swirling phantom noises just stuff I have no idea as to how to identify freaky guitar solos some drones as well kind of hanging in the air it sounds like a dense doom lasagna but there are some tracks on here that play it kind of safe by electric wizard standards they're not too slow they're not too noisy the riffs are maybe a little nondescript they kind of feel like electric wizard is playing it a little safe they're kind of like electric wizard singles focusing on what's easygoing what's accessible as opposed to what's experimental my major gripe with this LP though is a slightly slightly muddy sound just enough so that some of the riffs some of the sounds some of what I really want to come out of the speakers and hit me hard is getting maybe just a little lost in translation intentional or not it's not the most appealing thing in the world I love that electric wizard is trying to maintain this 70s aesthetic with their recording style really to call back to those classic bands in Doom like Black Sabbath like trouble but the more I turn this record up the more difficult that becomes for me to kind of decipher what's going on I really don't feel like I'm sunbaking in this massive sound as much as I am kind of just like getting a spray tan I didn't hate not a single track on this LP though even the closer's pretty good the Crypt of drug EULA which is this drone II noisy piece full of lightning strikes very kind of ambient but also ominous at the same time but then again it's not like this album had me on my knees speaking in tongues and worshiping at the Black Mass either it took a little time to grow on me but I'm feeling like a decent two strong six on this thing I like it but I'm not in love with it I know there are a lot of hardcore electric wizard fans watching what do you guys think of this record how do you think it compares to their early stuff especially dope thrown and especially which cult today and even their self-titled L as well and I'm sure you guys will also tell me in the comments below what you think I should be reviewing next Anthony Fantana electric wizard black masses forever 
Gcxdgfr9gpw,happy Halloween at how to address well laugh remains hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and it's time to dish out some more unadulterated opinion on a new album review how to dress wells love remains this LP has seriously been ravaging the comments section on a lot of my videos it's been requested by people like b53 sterics which jewish and one sane maniac but seriously there are way too many requests for this album to count so while the hype around this thing it did get a glowing review from pitchfork it did get pimped out by some experimental music blogs and the general consensus around this album is that it's unlike anything else you'll stumble upon this year and I could hang with that last statement this thing most definitely is unlike anything I've heard in 2010 but I wouldn't say how to dress well is completely coming out of left field ooh totally unpredictable all the elements and the concepts of love remains I am familiar with but it's how they're combined that makes this thing so unusual original and strange from my point of view this thing is very much an album of ambient music a lot of electronic elements but kind of the kicker with this LP something that people really make a big stink about is that there is a heavy R&B influence coming through on the vocal melodies and the lyrics but all R&B influences aside lover means is an album that very much gets its strength from atmosphere much like the new AV tere album down there listening to this is a lot like being somewhere feeling like you are in a place a very cold dark cavernous eerie lonely place to me and what are the sounds that create this atmosphere it really depends track to track but no matter what song you're listening to you can usually count on some samples some loops very chilly synths and mastermind creator Tom Krell's very high pitched vocals just drenched in reverb to me it kind of sounds like if lust more collaborated with woods on some cover songs of obscure R&B jams from the 80s and 90s to me it's an interesting take on a style of music that just isn't championed all that too often in the indie sphere my main gripe with love remains though and I know everybody's going to be disappointed to hear this who loves this album but the low fire recording destroys this album for me destroys it it's hard to enjoy the sounds and the ambience of this album when nearly every moment is being interrupted by the shrill over modulation the shrill peaking of Tom Krell's voice every single time he sings above the volume of a whisper and this isn't just any over modulation just any kind of peaking it's the sound of pins and needles being rapid fired into my ear canals over and over and over until blood starts pouring out of my eyes at best love remains sounds like it was recorded on a MacBook at the bottom of a well now I don't think I need to defend myself on the whole recording debacle by now there are plenty of albums that I love that ride the lo-fi lightning what makes this LP the exception though is it's not like the songwriting is so stand out that it makes listening past the lo-fi worth it and that's not necessarily because Tom Krell can't write a song but like I said earlier this LP isn't really about songs it's not about the catchy hooks it's not about the sweet melodic guitar licks it's about atmosphere and I see I hear the fidelity of this album destroying that atmosphere that I'm trying to partake in I felt like a majority of the time I was not enjoying what I was actually listening to but kind of imagining how much I would like it if it were recorded well I'm feeling a strong three to a light four on this LP but you guys know that's just opinion nothing that you need to take seriously if you enjoy this album if you're enjoying it enjoy it let me know in the comments below what you think I should review next be it an album or a track and that's it thanks for watching guys and I hope everybody's doing well hope everyone's having a good autumn Anthony Fantana how to dress well love remains forever you

j7BRmTNLRTc,hello my noodle drips it's Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd and you know what it's my birthday and they say that when it's your birthday you can cry if you want to and when I feel like curling up in the fetal position and weeping about the pointlessness of life I like to put on an album that's going to crush my head with the ease of a Godzilla size stomp so here is the new Bond Ripper album satan-worshipping doom this is the Illinois band 6 LP and the album title the band name the album art could not be any less misleading you'd have to be a complete idiot to not know what you're getting yourself into over here not that I expect everyone to have memorized the heavy hitters in doom metal but you know you're really not in for the next installment of Kidz Bop on this thing obviously this thing is more like now that's what I call music 6 6 6 now I understand many of you may look at this and say Satan worship bong not for me but I promise you don't need to join a cult or sacrifice a virgin to enjoy this album might help them what metal fans will get on this album is a fresh take on a familiar sound bong Ripper takes the classic riffs of electric wizards dope throne and runs them up against the long-winded psychedelic and trippy ambition of sleeps dope smoker but the sound on this thing is really where it's at it's where this thing becomes new and shiny bong Ripper whips out a pretty punishing mix on sane worshipping doom something that rivals their contemporaries like torch and Baroness this thing is even meteor than the new Kyle Issa record and the entire room is completely devoid of vocals so you know they're concentrating on that badass sound as bong Ripper rips across these 4 tracks which are creatively titled hail Satan worship and doom they bring some variety to the table they just don't stick to the same sound the whole time the first track has a classic doom aesthetic and kind of reminds me why I love the genre so much in the first place just a great tempo and exemplary heaviness and bond Ripper takes that heavy sound and brings it to the second track as well but crossbreeds it with black metal of all things harsh chords blast beats some extra reverb for added atmosphere honest-to-god black metal the third track worship is the longest and most evolutionary of all of them on this album and that's why I like this LP so much these tracks really shift slowly from one idea to another you realize that the shift is going on but it's very subtle many doom bands are just content to have a heavy sound and then just sort of with it for about 20 minutes at a time but BOM Ripper they'll take a groove they will slowly put more of an emphasis on a certain note it'll get louder it will get heavier the drums will get more massive more distortion will get thrown on the mix it's just constantly in a state of flux the last track is really where the head banging fun stops though it's much noisier much more experimental way more droning I would say though the drums are hitting pretty constantly it's really where this band stops rocking and just starts kind of creating a ruckus I mean if this thing were a video game that song would be the final boss this thing is massive it's dissonant and not all that Pleasant my only real gripes with this LP the last track meanders a little bit toward the beginning and you know what fade out it's really aggravating to hear fade outs on some of these tracks especially when you're hearing something you see what I'm saying well believe me that's not an issue you run into too much considering that there are only four tracks on here that run just short of an hour I'm feeling a strong a - a light 9 on this LP I'm enjoying the hell out of this album it's just got a great sound great riffs great ambience good progression it's a high point for doom this year I think I spoiled myself with the vinyl for my birthday that's on the way in the mail but you guys can go on their Bandcamp page down there in the D box string the entire album and pick it up digital for five bones so you know that's a nice price let me know what you guys think of this album is satan-worshipping doom the next plateau other stoner metal bands must reach or do I just have my head up my ass Anthony Fantana bong Ripper satan-worshipping doom forever [Music] 
F-Fd5YG2pWs,hello my needle drops I have quite the review for you today before we get into it though two things I want to mention two things I want to mention we hit the 11 k in terms of subs yeah and the second thing I want to mention before I get into this review is that I was on Norwegian television believe it or not and there's a link down there in the d box where you can watch the episode I was on this is square pushers show the leader one two demonstrator hope I'm pronouncing that correctly if I'm not I felt like what are you gonna do when I was a little needle drop and I didn't like electronic music Square pusher or Tom Jenkinson became that gateway became that bridge for me to jungle and drum and bass and techno and numerous subgenres so I kind of feel like I owe a little bit to this guy because of my musical tastes but let's stop here a worshipping and start reviewing so there's been a lot of talk about this LP and what's surprising for me is that it's mostly talk from the fans and the fans are saying this thing is coming out of left field this thing is totally out of character Foursquare pusher however I would argue that there were baby steps up until this point leading up to this LP was the album just a souvenir which was explained by Thomas being the result of a dream or fantasy about a futuristic rock band with weird powers and this album was basically kind of a rough sketch of what that band would sound like well this album happened because of a group of musicians looking to collaborate with Jenkinson's so he basically took the opportunity to make this fantasy band a reality and in terms of who Tom's working with on this album he is not naming names the most info he's given up is through a Q&A on warp records where he says most of them come from a metal background and that's not hard to believe considering the last track of this album maximum pluck that one has lots of Chuck thrash-metal chords dissonant keys and it all kind of builds up into these electrified black metal blast beats but that track is just kind of an anomaly on this album most of the songs here do have a cohesive sound and that sound being these robotic reinterpretations of funk smooth jazz R&B and a little bit of rock as well but what I think is mostly going on here is Jenkinson is just feeling out the possibility of this band and just printing their highs their lows and kind of everything in between just seeing what works out and what doesn't you've got a couple of heavier tracks on here one of them being the song laser rock which I dug quite a bit thin drums lots of space eqi's heavy heavy robot vocals and what was funny about this track and many of the tracks on the album is that everything is so synthetic especially the guitars below and the sound of this track and a couple of others on this album has garnered some comparisons to Daft Punk for this album and though I can see it I wouldn't really say show bleed or one shoots for the same atmosphere that Daft Punk is some of my favorite tracks on this thing are actually the softer ones like the song Frisco wave just synthesizers that swell over and over and over in the mix lots of dry guitar just very pretty atmosphere surrounding this track it sounds like sitting on a beach at night in space and I love the opener of this LP - it's just so synthetic but there's a lot of softness and there's a lot of subtlety there - it's like listening to robots with emotions but it's time to get to the gripes on this thing and it is a major major major gripe something that ruins most of the songs on this thing for me the mixing the sound is so bad in most cases I don't mind vocoder vocals I don't mind vocal effects I don't mind talk box vocals but here the vocals are just mixed so high that they're overpowering everything else in the mix it's so disruptive to me and the next thing that ruins many of these tracks for me especially the louder tracks especially the rock tracks is the sound of the guitar I mean yeah it is really processed it is really digital but the sound is so tinny it's like listening to a thousand tiny little chainsaws tearing apart my skull at once don't get me wrong on this LP I do like that square pusher doesn't stretch beyond the physical abilities of a real live band I like that the songs here are more straightforward I like that there's more of a focus on songwriting instead of heavy editing there's some really great interplay between the instruments on this album too even though there's some tracks here that I do love and can go back to again and again I feel like I'm observing here more than I am enjoying to be completely honest I'm really feeling about a strong five to a light six on this album but that's just my opinion and I really want to know from the sqaure pusher fans what do you think of this album are you in love with it do you hate it and why and where do you think Square pusher is gonna go from here if there's an album or a track you'd like for me to review let me know in the comments below and that's the review guys Square pusher show the leader one the demonstrator you 
Cy_FBsloKIk,diamond ring special affection hello my needle drops Anthony fan tanto here Internet's busiest music nerd I mean I'm excited yeah excited to talk about this before we get into that you know what guys we have a facebook we have Twitter there's links down there in the D box go and follow us say what's up say hi tweety tweety tweet tweet and yesterday the band girls came out with a new track by the name of heartbreak they have a new EP coming out in November I might review it might do a track review might just wait for the entire EP but it's a great song link down there where you can hear it in the D box this is the new diamond rings LP special affections and this guy is a Canadian singer-songwriter who just realizes the power of video I mean I'm on video so he took a bunch of singles and paired them with some eccentric fun music vids and he basically started taking the internet by storm think of it as like the D Act would story except with a much less lackluster ending so what does diamond rings offer up on this LP well some no nonsense honest to god no bull drum machine pop and it's funny to kind of be listening to this album outside of Diamond rings music videos because the quality of the album the quality of the recording really shows when you're simply just paying attention to the album it sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom I mean I should know but for something that sounds self-produced this LP is extremely concise very much to the point you may not find an album this year that is more point a point B to go back to the production it just kind of gets the job done the guitars are a little tinny all live drums sound kind of flat the synthesizer sounds aren't all that special but what really hooked me about this album was the hooks this thing really comes out swinging with the choruses a lot of sweet melodies and just this I'm cool you attitude this LP just has a lot of strengths though it's not exactly you know booming against the speakers because it's all lush and heavy it doesn't have a lot of nice dance rhythms a lot of downstroke guitar a lot of gentle synthesizers kind of just building up in the background even though it's elements what it's comprised of it's pretty simple it's all structured extremely well it's like building a fully functional fighter jet out of Legos but I think the best thing this LP has going for it is just personality and of course that all comes from diamond rings frontman or founder or mastermind John oh and I love his vocal delivery on this album it's got a lot of passion he's extremely playful in his lyrics too which is kind of where some of my gripes come from on this LP more often than not you're getting these lyrical gems like retaliating with silence running away in place just stuff that makes my mouth go ear to ear I'm just smiling my face off if you can do that but for every line like that there's a cheesy moment as well and even though yeah I smile at this album I cringe at this album I got to kind of take the good with the bad because I know that if this was a self-conscious album it wouldn't be half as fun in terms of other gripes I do enjoy a nice self recorded album but I can definitely tell that you know if this thing had better production it would sound way more banging the type of pop that diamond rings is shooting for really does sound better with a high fidelity though the singles that are on this thing I wouldn't touch him I think it's a light to decent eight on this thing if you're looking for a good time if you're looking for something with hooks if you're looking for something that's just instant instant pop instant instant instant pop then BAM diamond rings special affections no question there's a link down there where you can stream this entire album from beginning to end so take a listen let me know what you think do you like it do you hate it and why and what should I review next guys what should I review next and Fantana diamond rings special affections forever you 
6IBcwokLzbI,"hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd with an itchy here it's time for an album review but before I get into that I want to say you know we are so close to 11,000 subscribers right now yeah and you know what my birthday is this Thursday you know it'd be awesome eleven thousand by the birthday that would make me so excitedly happy good feeling yeah real good so we're going to take a look at the new warpaint album The Fool war paint is a California band that plays this very light ethereal brand of rock music something that's kind of like psychedelia but without all of the drugs everybody in the band is female do you hear that everybody it's a band with an all-female lineup that doesn't sound like the garage rock rehash of the shangri-la's what I do well anyway this album got tons and tons of requests on yesterday's video from Luke Pilate jurmala G stone guerrilla plus it got way more comments on previous videos my channel and war paints the fool is also out today so I figured why not what's a review it a lot of what I'm hearing about this new album is that it's a grower and I have to agree this thing is most definitely not a flaming roller coaster ride of explosions and zombie decapitations the full burns much slower it's not just an LP built of immediate and simple songs nearly every track starts off pretty understated but eventually unfolds and blossoms like a flower and all these petals are layered on top of each other made of shimmering guitar and intertwining vocal harmony is in lyrics about a relationship gone sour and all of that is well and good and nice and nice and well and good but really what caught me the most about this LP what kind of made me want to stick around is just the drums and bass of this thing there's definitely a bit of a post-punk even a post-hardcore influence going on in the rhythm section here very tight very technical and totally adds another level of enjoyment for me to this record I wouldn't say the lyrics on this album are spectacular it's not like if you wrote them down they would jump off the page not really but this album isn't really about that it's not really that word player being a wordsmith it's more about ambience than action much like yesterday's album that I reviewed Matthew dears black city the full really has a sense of place it's like being somewhere in my head I get all these images of old pyramids and just archaic architecture maybe like the Colosseum just long hallowed walls and lots of echoes lots of reverb just something that feels much older than it actually is just all these eerie dark buildings but there's also something that kind of beckons to me about it it just feels like kind of seductive as well it's well produced it's well mixed it's very well performed the only thing I see keeping this album from making the splash that it could is that for pop fans it may not go in a papi enough direction and for psychedelic fans it may not go in a psychedelic enough of a direction I wouldn't say we're painting pioneers with either of these sounds but rather just creates a pretty well blended combination of the two my major gripe about this LP is that it does not finish as strong as it starts the band starts introducing more electronics and acoustic tracks some really heavy-handed piano on the closer and the album just kind of starts to lose character at this point because warping is really starting to drift away from the smoothness the linear sure's that made the previous song so good so hypnotic so mesmerizing so entrancing and just like that statement earlier that I made which kind of applies to me this thing doesn't really stretch far enough into the accessible or the experimental for me but kind of sits in the middle though I can't totally see the appeal here there are some really great standout moments for me on this thing like composure shadows the opener set your arms down all really deep groove something that kind of reminds me maybe a little bit of bright black morning light but much much much more upbeat so how much am i enjoying this thing I would say a strong six or a light seven on a good day a light seven on a good day it all depends this is just my opinion but if you're looking for something that is going to chill you out something that is very immersed in its own sound I would recommend more paint the fool but let me know what you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana or paint the fool forever "
rzj_j93PWdw,Matthieu dear black city hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd gonna do an album review it actually came as a result of a comment this review is actually a request from youtube user nice Ellis Brown who said I do like that p-word it's irresistible politeness so we're gonna take a look at the new Matthew Deere album black city this thing even got the you're wrong I'm right stamp of approval so I figured why not let's talk about it for those who are familiar with Matthew Deere he's an electronic musician and also one of the founders of the ghostly international record label highly recommended and this is his fourth LP now what do you get on this album I would just like to simply put it as dance music dance music dance music dance music it don't get much simpler than that beats synths sound effects and Matthew dears very low chilli vocals but I wouldn't say this LP blends into the grey with every other dance music album that I've heard thus far this year and what makes it stand out is its mood its atmosphere honestly for dance music it's pretty dark it's like listening to neon lights and leather bound pole dancers in a futuristic city where it's dark 24 hours a day not to mention everybody in this post-apocalyptic city is very sexy and dressed to the nines kind of like a fashionista or something like that I have to give it to matthew dior for kind of creating a sense of place on this album I think I really wouldn't fit in in black city personally but still seems like a pretty seductive setting in terms of musical influences this thing pulls from the early days of techno the dance of your side of post-punk disco music there's some pretty ambient and shoegazing moments on the thing to it just subtly genre hops without breaking character it's a feat in and of itself that the last song on this album a very morose very slow very depressing track named gem doesn't feel in conflict with a track that is kind of a 180 little people which is 9 minutes long and a total it's my main gripes with this thing is that there's a lot of repetition on this album though I would say that's mostly because Matthew Deere isn't really aiming for the headphones isn't really aiming for the home stereo on this thing but like I said earlier the dancefloor so the repetition isn't necessarily a buzzkill but for me what can be a total buzzkill on this thing are the lyrics words about monkeys big black cars big black mansion it's okay but I wouldn't say it's a problem every track suffers from necessarily I wasn't in love with every block in black city but there was still enough standout moments to make me want to give this thing a decent too strong 7 a lot of irresistible beats lush electronics memorable vocals if you're in the market for an electronic album that is going to make you squirm uncomfortably in the club then I would give you the go ahead and visit black City as much as possible again thank you to nice Ellis Brown for the request you guys let me know what you would like me to review next and let me know what you think of this LP did you love it did you hate it and why and what would you have scored it anthony Fantana Mathew dear black City forever you 
fawZ5QbzcdE,hey it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan out here Internet's busiest music nerd so glad you could make it I know you've got a lot to do today I've got a lot to do today so you know let's just try to get through this track review first a couple things that I want to mention number one rest in peace re up member of the seminal female post-punk band The Slits came out with one of my favorite LPS a cut this is the back of it just google the front of it you guys know I've advocated this album before it's a fantastic LP please take some time the slits cut next item on the agenda on another YouTube channel I actually submitted a video a super note for this thing called the supra note contest that's going around YouTube right now and there are a lot of big-time YouTube partners who have supernote teens well one of my needle drops saw the video and remixed it into a song and it's just over a minute pretty freaking awesome link in the d'box this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and I'm extremely excited to be able to talk about one of my favorite bands a lot of people ask me hey what are your favorite albums of all time what are your desert eyelet albums and you know if I had to make a list this album would most definitely beat on it wires pink flag many of y'all know this album to be the only album that I've ever reviewed on this channel that straight up got a 10 out of 10 and it deserves it wire has announced a new LP for january 2011 the LPS title is red barked tree they have released one song from it thus far and it's titled two minutes man I feel like I just watched the teaser trailer to a movie that my friends are probably gonna drag me to even though i think it's only just gonna be okay it got me excited at the start it had a nice guitar drum going on very ominous sounded like something badass was coming down the pipe but then this riff kicked in and though it had me at the first few bars it didn't take long for me to kind of realize that it just felt really flat it felt as if the riff were just kind of being cut and looped and pasted as opposed to being performed which you know kind of disappoints me makes a sound much more robotic makes a sound a lot less alive another thing that I didn't really dig about this was Colin Newman's vocals they were they were snide they had a lot of swagger he was putting his politics into the music just like he usually does all the things that I've come to expect from the guy but for some reason his his vocals were just buried in the mix behind all this distorted guitar and you know just like these light atmospheric drones kind of just very subtly placed into the mix there was a lot of noise in this thing intentional noise with all the distortion the weird vocal mix the repetitive drums it actually kind of reminded me of the new fall record and the track just kind of Peters out the way that it came in just kind of everything just fades down and then the drone comes in and then it just ends um like I said at the beginning of this review it feels like a teaser doesn't feel like an actual track to me and I know wire has written shorter songs much shorter songs that feel way more satisfying feel like I've actually gotten something out of them this thing just kind of started meandered and then just fizzled if it were any other band I would say yeah it's just okay but because it's wire it kind of makes it even more disappointing for me I mean I know they're more recent releases haven't been as mind-blowing as their early stuff but still this is just leaving me empty so really unlike a strong three on this track I see no reason to revisit this thing unless I were listening to it in the context of the entire album for sure but let me know what you guys are thinking of two minutes did you love it did you hate it and why what do you think this new wire LP is going to hold for us wire fans oh and thank you guys for suggesting this track in the comments of one of my past reviews if you want to suggest an album or a tract review in the future just leave a comment on this video or my most recent video the needle drop wire two minutes forever you 
Oblv8bB5ZLQ,Zach Hill face tack hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd thank you for watching thank you for subscribing and thank you guys for suggesting this in the comments of yesterday's video as many of you all may know I made this announcement a couple videos ago I killed the mod box and now if you want to make suggestions for future album reviews do them in the comments of my most recent video so let's get into this thing if you know anything about the best and brightest of modern drumming then you know Zach Hill hearing Zach play drums for the first time can be a serious shock to the system especially if your introduction to his work is on one of his many albums with hella but even though hella is pretty much where Zach made a name for himself he has stretched far beyond that band since its inception if you follow independent music if you follow underground music it's nearly impossible to avoid the guy he's like that dude at a party who's just talking to everybody the guys worked with a lot of artists and the ones that I'm familiar with our Marnie Stern Mick Barr he's also worked with waves he's got a nice little collaboration with Tara mellows by the name of bygones and on Zach Hills first solo album astrological streets he's had the guys from no age and les claypool on that thing as well but this is AK he'll second solo LP faced at and with all honesty I think this is one of the most original releases of 2010 because really the only album I can compare this thing to is Zach Hills first album or a project that Zach Hill is already involved in depicted their elements of rock music in here Noise music punk music electronica but I would not label this as any of those not for a second every song on this album is constantly shifting from one idea to another at a pace that makes it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything but I'm not completely sure if I would want to concentrate on much of this album drum beats that are completely jarring production that's extremely harsh and abrasive synthesizers and loops that literally burn on the ears and lyrics that defy interpretation when you stand back and get far away from these tracks and maybe listen to them with the volume low they seem a little gimmicky they seem a little tacky kind of repetitive no builds no real transitions no segues just one section being switched out for another section being switched out for another I keep much of these loops these repetitions don't last longer than just a couple bars of music but when you get into the grit of these individual sections that are being repeated that's kind of where the magic happens that's where everything gets really intricate and intense it's like staring into a Jackson Pollock painting made of lava but there are some accessible moments on here accessible maybe kind of stretching the word but most of this album honestly does not sport songs as much as it sports mutant mind-numbing noisy motifs my biggest gripe about this thing is honestly the production it's mixed extremely extremely messily just like it was mixed just in a couple minutes like just throw it together just throw it together just throw it there if you can hear it then it must be good still it's not like that accidentally happened it's totally intentional it adds to the harshness of these songs it adds to the abrasion that face tat shoots for and yeah I would say that may be a highlight of this album is the musicianship hearing Zack Hill on the drums is quite a treat always always always but still he's not playing any more intensely here than he has on his past releases and Zack Hill is conscious of the fact that he has a fan base he knows these people have heard him drum before so I don't think drooling over Zack Hills playing style is really the point of this album I think the point of this album is to just overtaking in the noise the psychedelic sounds just the sensory overload that is face tak this album is literally the sound of no restraint whatsoever if you're enjoying this it's because it's pushing the envelope it's because it's tearing at your sensibilities and overall I would say the name face tat is extremely fitting for this album though I may not want one if some dude has one unless he's looking at me I'm going to be staring at it I wasn't a huge fan of this thing and my reasoning is that you know while I was listening it was extremely noisy extremely abrasive just like I said but I just felt empty afterwards like I had gone through four years of college and learned absolutely nothing which is sad I don't want that feeling but it's what I've received after listening to this thing multiple times I'm really like a light five on this album for all the reasons I just stated but down there in the comments let me know what you guys think of this album did you love it did you hate it and why and what did you think about this LP in comparison to Zak Hills last solo effort Anthony Fantana Zach Hill face tap for it you 
xBxvMXOjHM4,Kings of Leon come around sundown my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and we are going to do an album review first I need some tea got it now I need some carrot what that is so gross that is disgusting before we start this review I want to thank everybody that came out to the blog TV last night that was so heartwarming Oh y'all needle drops make me want to get up every morning and do this an album review this is the new Kings of Leon LP Come Around Sundown it's their fifth studio album and you know I don't think Kings of Leon is a dime-a-dozen band but their progression it's kind of something that we've heard time and time again they handle releases raw Hungary first album and then band continues to release LPS that get more and more and more accessible but the story doesn't always go that way every once in a while you get a congratulations you get an embryonic to a lesser extent you get a Hurley and I don't think we should necessarily automatically reject bands heading in a more accessible direction if you're going to have that mindset you're just going to more okay there are plenty of artists who have release albums that are more accessible than their past work but have maintained their current fanbase and open their music up to a new ocean of ears animal collectives and example deer hunters an example and waves to certainly cleaned up his act with that new record king of the beach but come around sundown is not some impulsive change in the direction of Kings of Leon these guys have been heading in this direction for years honestly the wild-eyed references to hard rock and indie have slowly been kind of burning out for these guys and I would argue on this album they are completely smothered and these sounds have been replaced with a rock album that kind of sits comfortably beachside with a fruity alcoholic colorful drink underneath an umbrella next to a kind of beautiful woman she's like someone you grew up with she has that girl-next-door appeal if you're looking for a soothing calming rock album then by all means this should be where you should go if that's your preference then go for it and I'm not going to sit here and fold my arms like a pretentious hmm act like there's nothing to like about this album because there is the opener which is titled the end that track really just gets to me fantastic opening to the album a lot of lyrics that reflect upon what I think addiction great hook shimmering production and a nice bass groove as well and on a lot of tracks one of them being the face the band's frontman Caleb just lays a really really great vocal delivery on that thing I have a feeling that no matter how this band changes or alters their sound that voice is going to always be what makes the magic happen really passionate really attention-grabbing but what's sad is that everything that made these guys exciting or interesting or just stand out from every other band out there has just kind of been dulled down when these guys used to play southern rock on their albums they used to sound really hard and rootsy but here they're playing something that sounds so much more fitting for CMT when they're going in that country mode overall the album has some very shimmering production like u2 for example and totally takes a lot of songwriting cues from the boss Bruce Springsteen those are great influences to have but here Kings of Leon do not have a quarter of the guts that those artists did in their prime this album really kind of listens like a Prius and that's cool some people like driving Priuses but please get me behind the wheel of a GTO or a hovercraft I just wish it was more eccentric I wish it was weirder it's not a bad thing that this album lacks that but if it's going to appeal to me it's just gonna need just a little bit of that just a little bit which leads me to believe that Kings of Leon did not write this album for me or anyone who has musical tastes that align anywhere close to mine so though I can't see the appeal here it is really well produced like I said earlier the vocal delivery is great some of the songwriting isn't bad it's just too complacent and cool and calm to really get me all that excited or suck me in so I'm kind of feeling like a decent too strong for on this thing it's not offensively bad it's just not my cup of tea this is my cup of tea but that's where I'm sitting on this thing as you guys know these videos are opinion not a huge deal but let me know what you're thinking about this album do you love it do you hate it and why Anthony Fantana Kings of Leon come come around sundown forever [Music] 
9ZQyNDad3c0,"the Gaslamp Killer all right my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's Monday I'm talking I'm excited we got to talk about music album reviews yeah website status the website rules the needle drop calm you should go there subscriber status the subscriber status we're nearing about 11,000 subscribers pretty soon that's gonna be awesome do you count status we're almost a 2 million that's also awesome and sickness status yeah feeling pretty good don't feel stuffy feel like I can talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and drink this tea this is the latest release from California producer and DJ gas lamp killer he's one of many musicians you can find out flying Lotus's label brain feeder and I was actually first introduced to him through some co-production credits on flying lotuses 2008 album Los Angeles but my first conscious introduction to the Gaslamp killer was through the 2009 album verses Finders Keepers now if you guys know about the label Finders Keepers they reissue and dig up all sorts of weird weird music from around the world and this album is fantastic simply because the Gaslamp Killer just goes back into the Finders Keepers discography and samples tons of music from that thing and create some very eclectic lis that's a word crafted beats he's just got a great ear for loops and samples now from that album he went on to produce most of ganja sufis new LP a Sufi and a killer where his psychedelic post-production and hip-hop beats were put to good use that album is literally like taking peyote and just wandering through the desert for an entire week singing and freestyling to yourself this new EP death gate features five tracks it's 16 minutes and the first song I really want to make note of actually features go into Sufi on vocals and that song is and that song is directly connected to the artery that bleeds into a Sufi and a killer so much so that it would really be a shame for any fan of this album to not hear that track it's got a really fuzzy recording tinny guitars just warm bass fat horns and of course going to Sufis tattered vocal cords it's a serious tree three songs on this thing that number around two minutes and though they are short and most certainly will be leaving your ears wanting more the Gaslamp Killer still brings a lot of subtlety and detail to the table the shorter songs are ok they're like nice little tidbits to munch on but the the centerpiece for me is the six minute shattering inner journeys which features a collaboration with computer Jay this track is an eerie synthesizer excursion that is just in time for Halloween and what I love about this song is that it sounds so so improvised so in the moment just bass drums guitar Keys rotating in and out of the spotlight it's like you're listening to a live band the song is always building and falling and changing it's just in a constant state of flux and makes me kind of disappointed that all the songs on this thing are six minutes it's extremely impressive it's something that I really love for you guys to hear and I'm actually kind of wondering what Cal thinks of the Gaslamp Killer the Gaslamp Killer why would you want a yeah - laughs kill a lamp full of gas No well that wasn't No all in all there are several really impressive moments on this EP it's priced extremely low and it's a nice follow-up for anybody who may be wondering who the heck this guy is because of all the attention that go into Sufi album has garnered I'm gonna give this thing a strong beefy judo chop seven it's about as eight as a seven gets if you know what I'm saying the only thing that's really kind of keeping me back from putting this on the loved list is that it just feels so criminally short I really did want so much more from this thing just shortness briefness abruptness a lot of stuff just mmm I want more I want more I want more me want cookie man it feels good to feel good I am just going insane today and that's where I am on this thing thank you for watching the Gaslamp Killer death Gate Anthony Fantana the needle drop also follow us on Twitter and Facebook link in the d box forever you "
BNBfo24nEE8,baby tear down there hello everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and this is the youtube channel where we talk about rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion for great justice the needle drop and yeah it's time to do an album review avy tears down there maybe tear is one-fourth of the experimental electronic psychedelic pop outfit animal collective and this thing has been one of the most highly anticipated albums of this year mostly because people just want to hear how an AV solo effort will match up to that of a new album from his partner-in-crime panda bear and maybe you're glad to hear this i don't know but if you're an animal collective fan nothing on this album is really going to be much of a surprise though it's not accessible in poppy like Merriweather Post Pavilion or sporadic and electrifying like strawberry jam AV still dives into a lot of the same sounds he's developed with Animal Collective watery vocal effects a lot of lyrics that are sung in rounds to the point where they're just overlapping one another lots of trippy loops lots of found sound field recordings ambient interludes really odd vocal melodies bouncy synthesizers and the sounds here pretty fantastic they're clearly down there's greatest asset this thing is not a kaleidoscopic treasure trove of mind-bending color overall this thing kind of keeps it simple with how much it layers upon itself doesn't get too busy doesn't really become a I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of head-scratching moments on down there even though in comparison to animal collectives more recent releases this thing is much simpler in fact I would say many of these tracks kind of start off in the same way an animal collective song would I'm getting a lot of deja vu with the water sounds with some of the rhythms just the atmosphere surrounding this music but that's just the start of these songs where these songs actually end up going is an their story and that's kind of where my major gripe about this album comes into play where these songs go of not really much of anywhere just imagine a guy walking out into the middle of a field but as soon as he gets into the middle he doesn't exactly go anywhere but just simply start spinning around in the middle which I'm not really happy to say but after multiple multiple multiple listens to this album I still feel like I'm anticipating this big build-up to something something going somewhere but maybe going somewhere isn't the point maybe staying somewhere is the point because down there certainly does create kind of an ambiance kind of a place some surroundings an interesting mental picture in my head what kind of comes up is a very hazy cave setting lots of water stalagtites weird but I still can't help but feel gypped by some of the tracks on this LP like one of the songs three umbrellas starts off really cool but just kind of stops before it actually has a chance to grow into something awesome still this thing has its moments and its lyrics are actually very personal one of my favorite moments on here is Heather in the hospital where the songwriting actually is really great I love the lyrics as well and the song actually lacks that build that all the other ones do but it has this really insane transition into the closing track of the album lucky one and that to me it was just like a genius moment just such a flash in the pan I was just went wide-eyed with awesomeness I for one would have loved an album of that just one song overlapping into the next just evolving into the next song it would have made this thing feel a lot more like this one big holistic idea as opposed to either just a bunch of unfinished concepts or just short motifs long story short this thing just really underwhelmed me severely it kind of felt like Animal Collective but with less psychedelic sound less songwriting strength less effects but that's just kind of my stigma with solo projects if you're going to go rogue if you're going to go do your own thing and separate from the rest of the pack then do it artistically do something different don't give us deja vu I'm kind of in a spot where I'm really a light five on this album I didn't hate it and I would say I didn't merely for how fun some of the effects are on this thing let me know what you guys think of this LP what did you like about it what you hate about it what was your favorite track or almost I'm just wondering whether or not it's gonna have an appeal outside of animal collectives fanbase as you guys know by now everything I just said was just my opinion avy tear down there forever 
B1Rlw0HL2JE,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd stuffy nose oh I know and I'm here right now with a question of the week this week mmm but right now before we get into that just one thing recently on Stereogum calm in a section that they titled where's the beef where they actually talked about all sorts of infighting with the indie scene it was an interview sections of an interview with Steve Albini in GQ where he talked about how Sonic Youth signing to a major label in their prime had a negative impact on independent music he had this mentality that major labels are bad the industry surrounding major labels are bad long story short he really made the music industry look like a meat grinder with the way he was talking about it and if you would like to see more of Steve's point of view he has this essay called the problem with music it's linked down in the d'box I didn't really find his point of view shocking because I do share some of his views on the matter however what I find shocking is that I don't really see much of anybody talking quite like Steve was these days in that interview people even talk less and less about the idea of selling out look at of montreal they're still making weird as hell records they're still taken very seriously by critics and fans and they recorded that outback song and recently major labels have been releasing co releasing distributing co distributing a lot of adventurous albums as well look at LCD soundsystem look at Janelle Monae look at Flaming Lips does this mean these labels are getting more open-minded but then again we still hear stories about look at that new klaxons album that album is the way it is because the major label said hey this is too experimental go back and rewrite it and as reported by just Paul via consequence of sound on October for Thunder youtube channel wrecked radio MGMT because of how wildly weird their new album is apparently is going to be getting some label help some labels supervision on their next LP yeah hmm I think overall hatred of the major labels has died down but why is it because they're behaving more or is it because we don't really have to deal with them all that much these days with the sea of independent bands and labels that the Internet is just full of you know and a lot of people aren't saying this but I feel like a lot of the indie labels are guilty of the same BS the majors are don't get me wrong I'd rather support one over the other however a lot of small bands even when signing to an indie label have to deal with the same stupid business practices like signing over the rights or the publishing of your music in order to get it on the label what is evil and once you've figured out what evil is are the major labels that are the indie labels that are all labels in general that and that's what I want to know if there's an album or a song that you guys want me to review in the near future leave a comment on this video comment comment comment and yeah that's about it music industry evil Anthony Fantana Steve Albini Sonic Youth forever you 
edCRJuyXjl0,Sharon Bannock hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd feeling almost 100 percent better I'm a lot less stuffy I feel like my my nose is almost completely breathing hmm and before we get into this review I just kind of wanted to mention that you know what I'm really out of favor with the mod box I have been for a while now at least a couple months and a lot of people it doesn't work for them a lot of people don't even know what the hell Demont box is so let's just say this from now on when you want to request that I review an album or a song or something like that just comment in the comments below requests whatever the heck you want and y'all could go through the comments if you like and just kind of thumb up each other's suggestions and you know what I read the comments so I'm gonna see it if you guys like thumb up something a million times alright let's get into this review Sharon Van Etten is a New York via New Jersey singer-songwriter and this is her second LP I don't know could be an EP it's titled epic and her early demos releases even though they're just based on voice and guitar sounds pretty plain and unoriginal on paper Sharon Van Etten came up with still what is a very very distinct sound just very minimal guitar playing a lot of simple chords and her haunting haunting voice which just seemed otherworldly to me at the time and there are plenty of Sharon's live performances on YouTube if you want to try to get a grip of what I'm talking about now epic of seven tracks 30 minutes and it's kind of throwing Sharon's more skeletal more linear sounds to the curve in favor of just more fleshed out instrumentation behind her songwriting the opening track crime is one of my favorite songs on the album and is just unforgivingly bitter and tells a tale of lust and restraint basically kind of seeing love at least with the person in the song as a bad bad thing a weakness and Achilles heel it's kind of like an addiction so just say no and as far as the rest of the song subjects go I think I hear some selfishness on save yourself I'm pretty sure the song don't do it is about suicide and I'm hoping the song peace sign is about pacifism but in the face of aggression a couple tracks on this thing even go a little country to carry things out with some pedal steel in the background just to give it that a little bit of extra twang Sheeran hasn't really given up on experimentation though on the songs D sharp G or even the closer love more there's a drone in the background accordion drone just kind of making everything really hypnotic and mind-numbing and there's a ton of atmosphere on these tracks a lot of space and the percussion as Sharon just kind of lays a thick layer of paint all over the mix with her vocals but like I said earlier there is a lot more instrumentation on this thing and I can see as to how some old-school fans may see it as this is too much salmon ooh this is too much instrumentation although it feels well arranged to me in some ways because of that maybe it's a little less definitive that's kind of a gripe but still that's not too much of an issue my only other gripe is that even though it's thirty minutes with seven tracks it does feel just kind of criminally short maybe like you're not getting the full breadth of what Sharon can actually do if she had an hour or 45 minutes of time on this thing I think I'm gonna give a peck a hey cool check this out seven because hey I really would like you to check it out and I think it's cool if you enjoy music like tiny vipers or you're on the lookout for a new female singer-songwriter there's no reason you shouldn't be putting your ears on this honestly but there are some tracks below you can listen to in the B box let me know what you think of this thing loving it hating it and why you have any Fantana Sharon Behn and epic 
czrckuVdzUk,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerve I'm a little sick still still but I'm on the mend I'm getting better I feel more energy I feel more appetite you know really the only thing that I feel like is holding me back man is this stuffy nose before I get into this review I want to thank everybody who's been commenting and everything saying get better get well feel better feel well it's flattering to know that I'm in your thoughts and thank you let's start this thing this album is from a bro named Luke Abbott Abbott is an electronic musician from the UK and he's got a lot of singles and EPS under his belt but as far as i know this is his first proper full-length album holcomb drones now don't judge a book by it's cover or an album by its title because holcomb drones is not just this weird psychedelic Spacey drone odyssey disappointing I know instead this thing is actually an incredibly fun listen over an hour of material that kind of genre hops like mad this thing just keeps me on the edge of my seat and just kind of keeps me curious keeps me engaged and that's mostly because of all the twists and turns Luke Abbott takes over the course of this album this thing starts off with an extremely extremely slow tempo this fuddy-duddy old-school drum machine that sounds like something out of beach houses devotion and warm analog synths as well just bubbling bubbling arpeggiated chords and it all sounds like some kind of lost synthesizer expedition from the 70s something that I'm sure maybe vangelis or definitely the guys in craft work would get teary-eyed to to go back to the percussion it really adds to the vintage aesthetic of this album too you've got these clicks that sound something like snares you have really bouncy base hits and the symbols are kind of what get me the most they don't really sound like symbols as much as they sound like little hissing snakes crawling all over the mix I don't want to say this but I can't help but feel it it just sounds cute the drums actually remind me of some sounds I would be hearing a lot when I was a kid sitting indian-style and from the TV and playing an infuriating game of balloon fight but I wouldn't mind playing a game of Metroid to this thing either and it's not hard to see why many of these tracks are based on repetitive layered melodies that are hypnotic and soft and don't adhere to structure or time constraints very explorative stuff I haven't heard synth worship modern synth worship like this since Matt Moses supreme balloon and I absolutely adore that album but to go back to the genre hopping that I mentioned earlier there are other sides of this album this isn't just some kind of one-dimensional thing there are tracks on here that feel inspired by the earliest days of house music something that the DFA Crowder LCD soundsystem fans might go nuts for and there are tracks on here that really dabbled in minimal techno despite that the since still sound kind of old-school the drums still sound kind of old-school the music really grabbed me in a pantha du prince kind of way and of course there are songs and moments that basically straddle these musical ideas as well incorporating bits of one bits of the other really the only thing one hundred percent cohesive about holcomb drones is just its devotion to these vintage sounds but this music is still executed with a very contemporary ear and when it does get it weird it does get experimental it doesn't sound like you know old outdated archaic experimentations it sounds like an adventure of today if you're open minded I could see this thing appealing to a lot of different fans of electronic music and for me it works on multiple levels of listening you could be paying complete attention to this and still get a lot out of it still see a lot of subtlety here and still pull a lot of secrets out of this thing really dive into the nooks and crannies and then again it sounds really nice in the background is just kind of chill out music just mood setting music my only real gripe is that maybe on several spots of this album to me it meanders a little bit it would have been really awesome if there were some more of those dance tracks on here which initially are what kind of caught me and made me want to stick with the LP and really explore it more and more and to me even though everything else the slower moments really have grown on me these dancey or tracks really are the showstoppers of this album right now on this thing and pretty much feeling a decent eight I really enjoyed the hell out of this thing and want to listen to it more i'm going to add it to the love list which is linked in the d box and give it a listen let me know what you think are you loving it hating it and why and how does this thing measure up compared to the other electronic albums of this year that you've been enjoying hmm Anthony Fantana Luke Abbott holcomb drones 
9J9VqG7mBxE,cow cow what might easy to come on do this review no way no you you got me sick okay there hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana the internet sickest music nerd here about to talk about this album hmm the freshmen onlys are a california garage rock outfit and this is their third album play it's strange the rough recording on their previous two LPs got them a lot of praise from low five fanatics but they really didn't seem all too happy with that label in some interviews that I've read and maybe that's a monkey the band has finally got off its back because this LP has really cleaned up the fresh and onlys act it's not Las Vegas but the quality isn't unbearable if there's anything really to note about this LP production was it's got a very vintage aesthetic sort of like it was recorded in the 60s or something like that just shimmering reverb on the vocals lots of jangly guitars kind of something like you may be familiar with if you've dug the new best coast album pretty deep this year the band is sticking to a cohesive sound this time around to sort of taking the moody psyche rock they played here and there on their previous LP and just exploring every nook and cranny of it for about 37 minutes there seems to be a lot of country and western influence on this thing too there is just a ton of twang in the guitars and the band really makes sure to play it up on most of these tracks put that together with the dreary side rock attitude and you have an end product that kind of sounds like The Doors trapped in a spaghetti western and the album has some really great standout moments - like the song waterfall you can download that track in the D box that song has really immediate lyrics about the TV and the radio just great guitar leads and just this haunting clarity - the vocals that is really lacking on many of these other songs most of the vocals on this LP and intentionally so are really muddy and really smudgy and just kind of buried behind everything else and you know what even though I'm not 100 percent of vocals guy it kind of bugs me a little bit I mean when your band writes a song called be my hooker I want to hear the words because the lyrics are varied the songwriting gets kind of buried and as a result the band just kind of relies on this psych Rock Country blend that they put together to get them by through every minute of this album and that kind of ends up just creating a lot of sameness for me now it's not like a bad sound to be working with I enjoy a lot of bands that sound similar to the fresh and onlys like ganglions for one or even woods in a sense but the deja vu on this thing doesn't go away even when the band is trying to fight it with an organ or an Egyptian melody a guest singer just some kind of sonic addition to break things up it's kind of driving me nuts because I've at least listened to about half of this band's past releases including both of their previous albums and each time I just end up kind of finding one or two songs that I like and the rest kind of just fall into the gray area for me even though I'm not digging it I'm kind of feeling a strong four to a life five on this thing I'm bringing it up because y'all may be interested in some dreary garage rock that may be best suited for listening around a campfire in the middle of the forest at midnight on Halloween but that's kind of where I'm sitting on this album and what did you guys think of it if you listened to it did you love it did you hate it have you heard the freshmen on these previous albums why is it that they get blogged everywhere but it doesn't seem like people are falling in love with them I don't know this week is depressing so far in fact the past 4 5 reviews have all been either negative or lukewarm mmm plus I think I'm going insane fresh and Olney's play it strange forever 
MNnibsPJSDY,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here I'm a little under the weather right now but even though I'm cold and my nose is stuffy I have to put on this sweater get warm roll up my sleeves and do an album review of new Belle and Sebastian LP write about love Belle and Sebastian is a Scottish band and this is what I believe to be their eighth LP of original studio material ensure these guys are labeled as being an indie pop group a tweed pop group baroque pop chamber pop whatever you want to call it there are a lot of bands that fit into that genre or style but Belle and Sebastian more than any other group to me has always represented the pure sound of sweetness of soothing innocence music that if it were a person it would be just the most the the nicest most unassuming guy you would ever meet he doesn't have a bleak outlook on the world but does admit his problems admits his faults and feels almost anything can be resolved with either love or prayer it's a narrative we've heard the band play with lyrically again and again and again and I'm right about love they round many of the same bases but the band does make a conscious effort here and there to not repeat themselves stylistically on this album like on the track little Lou ugly jack prophet John that actually features guest vocals from Norah Jones which is a collaboration that on paper in my head seems like awful terrible but in practice kicks complete ass I'm not living in the real world kind of steps outside of Belle and Sebastian's comfort zone a little bit because it is so mind-blowing ly upbeat and not that these guys aren't an upbeat band but this track is so bright it really took me off guard even though I wasn't really enjoying it all that much another track I'm not really digging is the title track the lead single write about love which actually also relies on a little bit of star power from actress Carey Mulligan on vocals and the reason I didn't really like this track too much is just that it had this really cinematic or theatrical narrative to it that might have fit a lot better on an album like god help the girl now despite a couple lows Belle and Sebastian still write some seriously great songs on this thing an example for me is the second track of the album come on sister which I'm pretty sure from beginning to end is just made of pure magic and the song I want the world to stop is is just as catchy just as a media and there's some real growers on this album too like the ghost of rock school which comes on very easy very sleepy but has a great groove to it and as the song progresses it only gets softer but in that softness that it grows into it feels like it just gets so much more distinct so much more defined it borrows from a lot of 60s garage rock and has a great groove going for it too it reminds me a lot of The Velvet Underground actually if the Velvets had converted to Christianity and dropped the drugs and artsy attitude for me the rest of this album is just filled with a lot of mad moments that are kind of created by just my familiarity with Belle and Sebastian's earlier work and it's really hard not to compare this new album with the older stuff simply because balance of Bastion as a band are roughly shooting for the same target that they have been for over 10 years as far as this type of music goes a brand of pop that takes its coffee with a lot of cream and a lot of sugar Belle and Sebastian is still going to be your number one destination for this year the band is an established name when it comes to this stuff if you want more of the same than head right here because these guys know how to spin this yarn they've had years and years of practice I'm feeling a weak week week six on this thing maybe a strong five however I still see this LP as a possible entry point for somebody who has never heard of Belle and Sebastian before and may be interested in checking out their music getting acquainted with it what do you guys feel about this album is it the best thing Belle and Sebastian has come out with is it a decent follow up to 2006 is the life pursuit and what did you think of god help the girl and also what's your favorite Belle and Sebastian album and favorite track from this LP alright guys you know any Fantana Belle and Sebastian write about love forever you you 
0_2WZbMsIeI,Sufjan Stevens the age of odds hi Jeremy well well well well well well well well well well hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time to do a little bit of an album review Sufjan Stevens the age of odds this is Stevens first full-length LP of original singer-songwriter material since 2005 s Illinois and we've all been just dying to hear him come out with this kind of stuff again especially after hearing some really impressive orchestrations throughout the all delighted people EP something I reviewed earlier this year you can click on that cover or head down in the d box to see my review of that but this album came with a bit of a stipulation there was a lot of talk as to how electronic the age of odds was going to be especially after the blogosphere kept bringing it up and Sufjan released a little single digitally from the album I walked now over the years tons of songwriters have experimented or flirted with the idea of electronic music look at Neil Young with the album trans and sometimes this kind of adventure can be career changing I know a lot of people in light of this album have been bringing up Radiohead's Kidd a left and right and when you dive into the indie sphere they're even more examples some of them are inspiring and highly influential while others just didn't fare so well as time drew on even though a lot of people are making a big deal of this LP this is not Stevens first foray into electronic music I mean look at the album enjoy your rabbit that thing is highly highly experimental bold challenging instrumental colorful fun you can really call that album a lot of things but if you're simply looking for a return to rabbit on odds you're going to be sadly disappointed I'm going to try to break this down as simply as possible despite the fact that this thing is over an hour long now if you're enjoying all the orchestrations the arrangements on albums or releases like BQE illinois all delighted people then chances are you make it into this quite a bit I think I hear woodwinds of course there's also brass piano strings all that instrumentation that Stevens is basically built a reputation on is here most definitely this thing is not geared toward those who side with the simplistic certainly in terms of how songs are structured the melodies some of the lyrical content this thing isn't too far from what we've heard from Sufjan recently in fact the title track on here has a hook that is very similar to that of the title track on all delighted people but the 300 pound gorilla in the room or what makes the age of odds odd is it's beats though there are synths on this album effects indulgent busses and bumps those things aren't contributing to the electronic feel of this release as much as the rhythms are and a lot of them are noisy sputtering messy and intentionally so the sad part is I'm not really enjoying them all that much all the electronics for me just feel so out of place against this album's more traditional instrumentation all the orchestrations plus all these bleeps and bloops certainly do make a sensory overload and there are a lot of albums that have come out this year that have just bombarded me with sound and I've enjoyed that most certainly but I really only like it when I'm being bombarded with sounds that I like the really low-end beats the claps the fluttering clicks the white noise snares on this thing just leave a bad taste in my ears it's something I just can't ignore even if a song itself comes off as being really good like the age of odds like get real get right even like I walked one of my major issues is that the volume or the dynamics of the electronics don't flow with that of everything else on most of these songs making many of the tracks feel kind of one-dimensional or just flat but not every song is like that there are some interlude like moments on this thing songs where they really kind of take it back on the beats like the intro or the song bad communication and even though these parts of the album are pleasant and I wouldn't take them away from the album they most definitely don't feel like highlights when it comes down to is it's just not something I'm digging I know there are tracks on this album where the beats the electronics are a lot more dynamic and do flow with the music a little bit better one track in particular the second-to-last song I want to be well has more shifts more changes more contrast in its six minutes than much of this album does in any of its ten and the closer the 25-minute Impossible soul despite my met attitude toward a lot of the songs before it is extremely impressive there was a lot more subtlety they were builds there were falls the electronics didn't take precedent over everything else there were not only synthesized beats but acoustic drums much of this track as well I love the noisy guitar solos on this song the huge choruses when it broke into sort of a dance moment even the three-minute acoustic part at the end of it was pretty good even the auto-tune wasn't that bad I'm honestly feeling a strong six on this thing it might make it to a light maybe a decent seven on a great day but yeah pretty much just a strong six on this and despite that I would be excited and interested to hear Sufjan Stevens go down maybe even a little further into this electronic direction I mean this thing for me kind of feels like Sufjan even though he has put out that album enjoy your rabbit he's just kind of simply dipping his toe into the electronic arena on this thing many of these tracks would sound pretty much exactly the same if you just recorded them with acoustic drums and just replace these beats it's not like the electronics have really altered how Sufjan writes music they have just kind of become another tool that he uses to make music and that's how I'm feeling on this thing what do you guys think about this Sufjan Stevens Age of odds is this thing as electronic as it's cracked up to be and did you like soufiane going down this particular road what's your favorite track what's your least favorite track and how would you score this thing and are you going to pick it up mmm Anthony Fantana Sufjan Stevens age of odds forever [Music] you [Music]

wpzMfharbwE,"mark ronson hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd thanks for watching we're gonna do a little album review action right here but before we get into that I want to tell you guys first there's a link in the d box to a website scene mags comm where I do video reviews for them as well for other albums and I took on the new John Legend roots collaboration wake up it's a pretty decent LP go check the review BAM and also linked in the d box on the needle drop comm is an album of Russian hip hop instrumentals which leads you to a label where you can find more Russian hip hop instrumentals yeah they exist and on our Twitter account we are so close to 2,000 followers it's not even funny I'd like to jump that hump just like we jump 10,000 subscribers so twitter.com slash the needle drop Mark Ronson is an English musician and a DJ and this is his third LP record collection back in 2007 Ronson raised eyebrows with his album version a full release of cover songs that got him way more kudos in the UK than it did in the US I guess Americans just weren't ready to hear Britney Spears toxic remade with old dirty bastard spittin rhymes and a saxophone that LP love it or hate it at least displayed a wide array of tastes for Ronson he's clearly a guy that has his fingers and a lot of different pies musically and that's displayed in the collaborations in the feature list for his past albums he's worked with Jack White Rivers Cuomo Rhymefest mos def Robbie Williams Lily Allen the list goes on and on and on and on and on the record collection is the next chapter in Mark Ronson's ever-widening musical palette and if you want to get a whiff of this LP one would not need to look further than its four single bang-bang-bang that track is loaded with electro-pop synths really quirky group vocals some French lyrics breakbeats a hook sung by the electro pop outfit Mandar and q-tip of A Tribe Called Quest Fame actually comes in and spits a lot of great verses that track is like neon colored hip-hop it's as diverse as it is fun it stays engaging by mixing so many different influences together at once and the next couple of tracks follow a similar suit with different singers different MCS another one of them being Ghostface Killah but this thing really hits a dry spot for me in the middle it's extremely extremely front-loaded it kind of drifts away from the hip-hop influences and goes toward synth pop balladry on the track you gave me nothing to hold on to which for me has really mediocre B and I guess the album figures that while it's throwing all these tracks at me that I don't really care for it might as well incorporate a lot of filler instrumentals as well thankfully this album gets a hold of itself by the last third and starts working with the same magic that made the opening track so good just John were crossing beats strong emcees and a variety of singers some of them being the London gay men's choir and I just had this nagging nagging feeling that this album is reminding me of something that I've already heard this year it just has so much in common for my point of view with the gorillas album Plastic Beach in that it's trying to jump from influence to influence it's trying to cross over it's trying to just blend things together to the point where you don't recognize them however it's doing it in a much less ambitious artistic and interesting way but don't get me wrong Ronson's heart is really in the right place on this one my issue is just that a lot of these tracks end up in a bland bland spot for me this album's best moments just kind of stay in their little safe electro hip-hop bubble if you know what I'm saying been a lot more adventurous in my opinion kal what do you what do you think about the record collection what do you mean they thing no I didn't mean that record collection okay good cuz that's full of hipster garbage and bull for me this album is kind of like an all right five I'm really on the fence with it and not because the whole thing is boring but it has a lot of highest but just as many lows there are a couple tracks that I would take away from this especially the singles and I wouldn't be surprised if most people did the same but let me know what you think of this LP what is your favorite track what are you liking about it what are you hating about it and that's the review anthony Fantana Mark Ronson the record collection forevers "
ZPPDUHY6QIs,it's track review hello my needle drops how you doing that's good to hear Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion hmm and I have a few things that I want to get into before we actually get into the track review first off there's a gigantic megamix over at the needle drop com called creative controlled from a mashup artist by the name of Al lover link in the D box it's pretty badass a message to my Connecticut needle drops if you're from Connecticut tomorrow I'm doing an event a couple bands are gonna play I'm gonna be there it's free come on down link info D box and album of the week the unicorn's who will cut our hair when we're gone hmm got a couple comments yesterday one of them being this one saying that Brian Eno came out with a new track and I must listen to it and even though a lot of people say you must listen to this you must listen to this this is one of the moments where I fully and wholeheartedly agreed now a lot of you may be asking Anthony isn't Brian Eno the famed producer who helped guide the artistic visions for such bands as u2 Talking Heads Devo and Coldplay I would say yes and didn't Brian Eno influenced a lot of today's electronic music as well as pioneering much of ambient music yes and hasn't Brian Eno produced fantastic collaborations with such artists as David Byrne Robert Fripp and cluster Brian is gearing up to release a new solo LP on Warp Records yeah and the title of it and picture small-craft on a milk see it's due out November 2nd but one track is out now you listen to it in the D box it's called two forms of anger hmm wow this isn't really a disappointed face this is more of a confused face guys I don't know what to think uh I guess I'll start with the good because I only really have one complaint about this thing what I absolutely love about this track well uh geez the start the things it sounds like a spaceship or the shuttle just something gearing up for launch or maybe just the the introduction music to an action movie or something like that I just love the sounds in this thing all sorts of flutters all sorts of swirls distortion in there um maybe the only thing that I thought was questionable in there maybe felt a little out of place was the guitar which was really dry no effects on it whatsoever it was just like really hot maybe pretty compressed well anyway so you have all these electronics all these textures bubbling up just bubbling up boiling reaching the boiling point and then building slowly underneath that just fading in you have these drums that to sort of be I guess the antithesis to all the electronics all the sequenced sounds that are going on in the foreground these drums are building up in the background that sound very much like something out of the jungle just something very tribal very primal very fur or like a gorilla about to smash something it was a really great fusion between electronics and rock music and a lot of people are doing stuff like that today but it seemed like Brian Eno was kind of taking a krautrock angle from it which doesn't surprise me considering how involved with krautrock he's been over the course of his career I gotta say though I have a major major complaint with this thing that kind of ruins it for me ah it's criminally sure it's criminally sure my gosh I feel teased I feel like the song brought me right to the point of climax just before it and then just took it away do I want to come back to this song by itself and listen to it over and over and over not really however I am dying absolutely dying to know how this thing works within the context of the rest of this I really am feeling a strong seven on this the production is amazing but it teased me that much to the point of where mmm now I just feel let down a little bit again this new Brian Eno LP is going to come out November 2nd on Warp Records and hmm what do you guys think of this track again Lincoln the D box where you can hear it what did you like about it what did you hate about it and why Anthony Fantana track reviews Brian Eno two forms of anger forever you 
CB-HKdkM7hg,"wet wet wet wet wet wet wet wet Twin Shadow forget wet wet wet wet hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd excited excited to do an album review and talk to you guys and do do a video I love doing videos that's why I'm doing this thing yeah thanks again for 10,000 subscribers expect a 10,000 thank-you video this weekend I will be plugging some of my favorite channels and just you know being humble and thank you before I get started on this thing there's a link in the de box to a new going to Sufi remix album of course all remixes of tracks from his new LP a Sufi and a killer that I gave a 9 out of 10 to when I reviewed that album on album reviews it's out now on warp records just like I said down there in the D box stream the whole thing pretty good alright this is the debut LP from Twin Shadow which is the solo project of Brooklyn musician George Lewis jr. a lot of you guys were asking for it I got a promo copy of it and I guess it got pitchfork with a good score too so I figured why the food I basically saw no harm in reviewing this and I'm glad I did because what I didn't know or didn't remember rather is that this thing is on terrible records which is the project of grizzly bear member chris taylor who co-produced this album with twin shadow and if you've been watching the channel for a while you know i have expressed before that I feel like chris taylor is an amazing producer almost everything that guy touches sound-wise turns to gold but what is this thing what can you expect if you put this on your ears well I'd like to call this just bedroom recorded dance pop with a ton of ambition it's true there is a bit of messiness a bit of shabby nough section recording wise on this album maybe a flub here a very slightly off note there however I wouldn't say it makes the record difficult to listen to the songwriting is still real goodness sound effects post-production top-notch some moments on this LP get really slow and moody and lurk like a mutant the tracks castles in the snow or even the opener of this album kind of come to mind very dark moments here but still keep a very steady beat while other tracks kind of feel like they're we're living the heyday of the dancer side of post-punk in the 80s a lot of disco influence something that kind of reminds me of bands like shriek back on classic singles like my spine is the baseline just that type of music that was highly highly influential to that DFA record sound songs like for now and shooting holes at the moon kind of bring that to mind I am enjoying it even though it's not the most amazing dance music I've ever heard I do kind of want to warn you guys that I am a little bit of a sucker for this kind of stuff whether it's a slower track or a faster track there even a few intros on songs that I don't really care for with this thing but no matter where a track may start or end up the hooks are always razor sharp they're pretty much one of the best things this album has going for it I know that even if I'm somewhere for a second where I don't want to be I'm always going towards somewhere I do want to be the recording could be a little cleaner could be a little less money but what you have here is just the basics of a good album a strong foundation guitar bass drums and vocals just colored and layered with splashes of synths strings harmonized guitar solos background vocals kind of executed with a slightly retro sound that's really popular right now and I'm telling you if you're a songwriter and you have a good song you want to produce it get Chris Taylor to do it he will pour magic all over the mix I mean I know I'm loving it but of a cow what do you think about forget I tell you about forget but I can't remember yeah yeah I hate cow Justin even though there is room for improvement here most certainly it could be more distinct I'm still feeling a really beefy 8 on this out a beefy one I think of Twin Shadow shoots for more well produced LP the next go-around he's going to come out with something amazing if this as is is as good as it is that's where I'm sitting on this thing do you like this album do you hate it and why and what's your favorite track off of this thing I really do want to know I want to see where it kind of compares with some my favorite tracks on the LP Anthony Fantana Twin Shadow forget forever "
fNVNPtj1IsM,eight pagoda crush it's called Bush hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd I just shaved we're gonna do an album review right now but before we get into that I just want to mention that on the needle drop comm right now there's this really interesting intense psych rock album that you could stream all the way through link in the d box alright let's get started Abe Vigoda west coast band and this is their fourth studio album crush a pagodas first major wave of publicity came in 2008 when everybody was freaking out about the music scene based out of the California venue the smell I'm talking about bands like no age like health or me Kumiko hoop disbanded recently the bands that come out of this venue have a track record of being kind of catchy but also not shying away from being experimental being noisy just turning up the volume able to go to fits into that mold and though their albums have never amazes me I love that release after release after release they're always looking for a new way to step outside their comfort zone the album skeleton was a much more shoegazing much more effect heavy release than its predecessor Kid City right after skeleton came the Reviver EP which really explored a lot of darker sounds a lot of somber atmospheres it was a really Moody moody release but still maintained a lot of the sonic experimentation that we've come to expect from these guys I'm just gonna say for the sake of maybe condensing this review that Abe Vigoda is really going kind of new wave on this thing there's loads of synthesizers repetitive guitar phrases danceable drumbeats light touches of reverb here and there just a slightly retro sound but of course with a contemporary point of view here Abe Vigoda is favoring a lot more straightforward structures they're kind of handing the hooks to us on a silver platter I know Eva goat isn't the most hook oriented band but when compared to albums like eliten this thing is hook city and though the noise and though the experimentation hasn't left a pagoda sound completely they have really kind of toned it down in that department it's really easily their most accessible record yet but I'm kind of finding that I have a hard time accessing it I do have some favorite moments on hear the song crush for example maybe the only albums real rock song really the perfect combination of a pagodas old-school sound but new-school direction just that perfect combination of noisy sounds and pop sensibility and the song repeating angel I just find myself attracted to for a number of reasons it just has a great great build going on in a very memorable hook and groove but to be honest a majority of these tracks I was either on the fence with or just not all that interested in for one reason or another that's the thing there's no real one issue or problem that I have with this LP it's just kind of as a result of a Bogota experimenting trying different things throughout these tracks but some of these experiments go over really well with me and some of them don't I think the most consistent issue that I have with this LP is the vocals they sort of have this deep bellowing croon going on but they're either maybe a little sharp or a little flat maybe a little dissonant on some moments in these songs which i think is intentional much of the time but still isn't doing much for me they're just some moments here where I'm feeling an out of place drum machine maybe the song is getting a little monotonous a little repetitive or maybe it's too cacophonous to really make heads or tails of the song whatever the issue depends really upon the track for me it's kind of what you might get if you had a forced collaboration between the Cure and shoo-shoo both bands that I appreciate but mmm I don't know the sound just isn't working together in this instance however I'm not worried because I know the next time around a pagoda is just gonna be trying something else and I may like that more I mean you know I did enjoy skeleton Reviver was pretty cool too this is just not appealing to me all that much I'm kind of honestly feeling a strong four or a light five on a good day with this thing what do you guys think of this thing are you loving it and why and what's your favorite track and what's your least favorite track that's all I want to know Anthony Fantana a Bogota crush forever 
MzYQR6ePkiw,"Hey hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most excited music nerd because our YouTube channel just broke 10,000 subscribers I don't know how it happened must have happened by accident there will be a 10k vid coming up in the future but you know what let's just celebrate with some good music with reviews what made this channel Wooden's in the first place this is the new the tallest man on earth ep epically titled sometimes the blues is just a passing bird now if you want more background more context on the tallest man on earth I recommend watching my review for his previous LP the Wild Hunt click on that or look down there in the D box for a link just months away from the release of that extremely well-received album we have 5 tracks of wild hunt afterthoughts here on this new EP overall the artistic mindset of singer-songwriter folk artist Christian Madsen isn't too far from where it was on the wild honk honk honk honk honk you've got warm acoustic guitar the perfect amount of reverb on the vocals and just a really great ballad just classy stuff classy even on songs where I'm really not all that captivated by the melody the opener being an example Christian really still catches me with his lyrics I just find myself hanging on this guy's words and it's because he's so descriptive the words that he uses are so visual hearing it really is seeing it when it comes to his lyrics and there are moments on these five tracks that are just as impressive as anything on any tallest man on earth album the song like the wheel is an example you can actually download that track through a link in the d box and that is an extremely strong song I love just the the tone the emotion of that thing it's like just having the the Sun hit your face on the perfect spring day there's some very faint piano keys in the background of that song and I'm pretty sure I hear a dog barking here and there too but yeah accompaniment a surprising and subtle shift away from what people may be used to on other tallest man actually very skeletal just acoustic guitar and vocals combo and we have another surprise on one track the song the dreamer actually has electric guitar of course it's still very soft and easygoing and hard on the ears at all but it's just a nice change of pace for the tallest man there are multitrack guitar melodies just sort of tinkling in the background as well as a few swells I guess you can call them with just one big guitar chord casting out with a lot of reverb on it if the wild hunt is going to be one of your albums of the year for 2010 I highly suggest that you give this a listen this is a must an absolute must for people who are that down with the tallest man on earth for anybody who is into acoustic music into folk music and is maybe curious about the tallest man on earth this is nice but I suggest starting with an album of his instead because 5 tracks to me is just not enough material to understand the depth of this guy's talent yeah I'm thinking I'm gonna borrow a score from my Flying Lotus EP review on this one and just give this a light too decent 8 it is a really great set of songs and like I said something that must be heard for tallest man on earth fans but what are you guys thinking of this are you loving it are you hating it and why and what do you think of these several sonic shifts that Christian makes on this EP in comparison to his previous LP and also what do you think of 10000 subscribers you have any Fantana the tallest man on earth sometimes the Blues is just a passing bird "
_TUBP7-tuNE,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope everyone's doing good um yeah hadn't seen this in a while because yeah last week instead of doing a question of the week I decided to review the new Deerhunter instead that was good yeah good times the memories I usually do a question of the week me but I didn't think anyone would complain if I did a review the new deer hunter instead mm yeah and anyway before I get into this question I have a few things I want to mention number one we are less than 100 subscribers away from 10k 10k is on the way sorry the second thing I want to mention is that on the needle drop con there is a new song from none other than Gang of Four who apparently has a new LP set to be released at the beginning of 2011 yeah announcing a comeback 2010 is the year of comebacks so uh link in the DI box over there and listen to it let me know what you guys think in the comments or on the blog alright guys and here's your question of the week and it has to do with a video that I made yesterday a review the New Salem LP king night in that video in the d box i linked to a video of them playing live and it was one of the worst live performances I've ever seen ranking up there with I don't know that YouTube cover of the final countdown that everybody laughs at link and it got me wondering what is the worst live performance you've ever seen and did it take you by surprise did you expect it to be bad what was so bad about it were you laughing were you crying were people booing and here's the bigger question here is the bigger question my needle drops in an Internet age when you could essentially just put a ton of albums up on the net people fall in love with that stuff and download it or buy it show their friends listen to it a million times ah does it matter if you suck live because then the people going to see you live and they're disappointed maybe it is really really bad but they forgive you because they like the album is that more the case today then it would have been if it were 1995 so yeah what is the worst live performance you've ever seen and today currently with the internet do live performances matter anymore do they make a difference as to how people really perceive a band and that's it thanks for watching thanks for 7:00 thanks for commenting and making me feel like there's a point to life the needle drop wears live performances forever [Music] you [Music] 
pwDvi7BFJGw,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd I hope everyone's doing okay thanks for subscribing thanks for watching thanks for being good needle drops we are going to do an album review before we get started I want to mention that on the needle drop calm many of you may remember back to when I reviewed a song from a project by the name of Dumbo gets mad gave that song 9 out of 10 loved it well DGM came out with a new song it's up on the website right now linked in the d box you could stream it download it show it to your friends show it to your mom whatever okay the band is salem this is their debut LP king night now i have heard a lot of music this year thanks to you guys but when it comes to stuff that is gaining ground on the blogosphere this album is 2010's most unlikely mix of influences and unless you're already a fan of salem what this LP has in store for you can be quite a surprise it's like watching a horror film and that part when you first see the monster and the monster pops out it's like ah it's horrifying it's hard at first this LP starts out with your average set of shoegaze e synths and bedroom quality production there's some female vocals floating over the tracks but if anything makes this stand out it's the meaty bass in the beats and just the overblown sound despite how soft and slow this music can be at times it's kind of like listening to sleigh bells gone goth I honestly wasn't expecting much but then this LP showed its true colors because it's not just Halloween keyboards and breathy voices it's also a rap album and I don't mean just any rap due to shelter up drugs I mean this thing is is crunk for people who hold séances all the wrapping is pitch shifted so that it sounds a lot love or there's a weird vocal effect on some of the vocal tracks making it kind of sound like fever ray producing a Gucci Mane single or something and though I really do think this crossbreed of ideas is a bad one maybe a little bit like Neil Young's venture into noise and drone I still am open to this idea this could totally work and these guys are a part of what I think is an up-and-coming genre which house and though I'm not really enjoying this all that much so far there are artists under that label that I think deserve at least a little recognition like or at least I think that's how you pronounce it to get back to my point there are moments where this LP actually flirts with impressing me like the rhymes on the song tear actually aren't that bad there's some nice swagger there as well and the song red lights has some really great synth melodies and just really good ambiance plus a lot of the droning synthesizer sounds are kind of doing it for me they just cast out into oblivion and just have a huge presence but this album suffers from a much bigger problem than just having a strange mix of sounds much much bigger I mean it's almost completely lacking in any and all subtlety the samples the percussion the sound effects the loops just so bad the snare drum sounds so thin the cymbal is really shabby it sounds like the preset drums on a $50 MPC some tracks have the sound of car crashes and prison bars being shut and they just repeat them over and over and over as if it's interesting or engaging if you throw the Rhymes and the pitch shift and rapping on top of the pile this album just breathes tacky which doesn't make sense you can't really breathe in tacky so it actually does suffocate in tacky it suffocates itself to death with tackiness it's like taking a taxidermied head of an elk and throwing it up on your wall and then putting a clown's wig and rubber nose on it just for extra effect geez you know what just just look at this video it's it's right there it's also in the D box just look at that video uh count your chest up beatbox oh boy I've been practicing for weeks boom boom your one name's MC pick a bar trade chai got candy corn grills and a pumpkin bread Deepu I don't drink Cristal that's a hate gym team when my throat gets dry I grabbed a couple wishes broom how did I do well you're no Biz Markie I hate Anthony Fantino I'm feeling a strong two on this album yeah a strong - like I said the synthesizers at times are kind of a saving grace there are a few tracks that I think are okay and overall the album has potential but really doesn't cash in on much of any of it but what do you guys think of this album do you love it do you hate it and why and that's it Anthony Fantana Salem King night forever [Music] 
qMsnKVtohy0,here yeah you do in there yeah the women public tree hey my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd before I get into this thing I want to say that I have an interview that I conducted a couple months ago down there in the D box link and it's on our tumblr account with one of the members of women about this new LP came out pretty good all right women Canadian band second album public's train in 2008 these guys came out with a self-titled LP and that thing wasn't one of my favorites of that year however the band's sound had stuck in my head which is kind of funny because they're really not the easiest band to define although I could try um I would call this garage gone sour with a deep affection for art rock and noise I don't know I guess if you were going to slap a genre name on it or something the words post or wave would probably be in it I mean you could just call post wave after that 2008 LP I assumed that women would just refine their sound come out with another LP and they have they definitely have just not in the way I expected them to usually when a band refines their sound it's sort of like sticking to one idea or getting catchy or getting more immediate and for me public strain is a huge left hook with 11 little left hooks packed into it this album just refuses to be normal and women doesn't do that they don't accomplish that by being completely noisy they kind of do something worse they flirt with the idea of being sunny and sweet and then suddenly they just Jam a wrench into the gears and shake them around oh wait here's a pop song here's a verse here's a chorus there's a melody oh wait here comes a sour note now there's a lot of noise in the background here some drone uh-oh you want a rock song okay here's a beat oh wait a second it's like in 13:8 why would you do that Oh dissonant chords ouch ouch why this mesmerizing Jam why all these eerie deadpan creepy vocals the thing is no matter what on every single track women find a different way to not be accessible and be expectations and if there's any consistent idea or theme on this LP it is that the production is also pretty consistent and I absolutely love it a lot of moments on public screen are messy and cacophonous but also very labored over and detailed as well women are always throwing different ideas into the mix different sounds at your ears but there are also tracks that go in the opposite direction on this thing where they are trying to put as little sound into the mix as possible just very bleak just the sound of of emptiness even track five which is a three-minute drone which sounds like it was produced with an organ has a certain kind of charm to it that I can't deny now a lot of people will call this record low fie and maybe I wouldn't go that far it's not the most lo-fi thing on the block though it does sound self recorded and it is but if calling it low five will get you to check out the record it's lo-fi if some comparisons will get you to check this out it kind of reminds me of Eric's trip if maybe they were going for a creepier vibe or maybe even woods if they decided they wanted to be a rock band it's something that on a lot of tracks on here I'm just totally feeling Velvet Underground but not in the sense that hmm they sound exactly like the Velvets but maybe in the sense that it's very otherworldly very kind of off-putting part of me wants to kind of call it druggie but I wouldn't necessarily say it's druggie because in in the same breath it's it's also kind of sobering in how desolate this album feels this thing really does create a lot of tension for me and it's because it difficult to define that just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat it's just really dark it's just really restless kind of like a fat bald guy in a night robe sitting in his living room with the TV on and lights off shaking in his recliner with a coffee and a cigarette but I want to say this is for a specific listener if you're looking for a straightforward easygoing pop record don't go here if you're looking for something electronic something that's clean and well parsed don't go here but if you want something that is strange off-kilter a little far out something that's just going to make your eyes go wide with a spooky beauty then look no further I have little to no gripes with this thing it gets a little underwhelming at points the first track isn't my favorite but damn I'm feeling a light 9 on this thing I feel like such a pushover I've doled out so many nines over this past month or so but the thing is you know we're coming to the end of the year and a lot of these great albums are being released now so that they could be considered for everybody's year-end list because if you're not released by October pretty much people are not going to talk about you until the next year rolls around alright guys this has been another album review women public strain anthony Fantana thank you for watching I really appreciate that forever 
kxHrdmYZrxE,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd I hope everybody's doing good today and we're going to do an album review of the new Neil Young LP Leno's Neil has more albums than I have had years on this planet and though I've been known to enjoy his classics from time to time we're gonna focus our attention right here on this thing this LPS title is a play on words sort of named after the producer of the album Daniel annoy Daniel Lanois who knows how many records Neil has left in him but even if he puts out 20 after this this LP will still go down in history as one of his weirdest moments for you Neil Young dorks yes it will be stranger than trans and it's strange because it's really not what you'd expect for me what's happening here is kind of an essential idea but I just never expected Neil to take part in it I mean the effect of this LP is taking any solo acoustic performance from a Neil live album and then combine it with earth - and I am NOT both of course Neil is on songwriting duty with this LP but together with Dan he has produced some dark atmospheric new-age folksongs with tons of amplifier worship lots of distortion what sounds like doubled guitars texture tape slack reverb loops just a lot of studio trickery on this thing to the point where at a lot of moments throughout this LP it kind of distracts from the song or maybe takes precedent over the song I'd say but maybe I'm blowing this a little out of proportion because the thing is this LP doesn't have anywhere near as much low end or thickness as the heavy hitters in Doom and part of me wants to kind of scoff at it for that because in a way it is kind of dabbling in that same arena and this coming from the point of view of someone who loves son loves earth loves drone music so of course this album doesn't take it far enough for me lyrics wise on this album Neil is still sharp his attack when he wants to be and I love the moments where he's reflecting upon his life as a musician as a human being as a lover on tracks like hitchhiker or love and war for me two of the most fabulous moments on this LP just undeniably good and there are points where I feel like Neil Young is getting lazy in his songwriting on this album Neil repeats himself a lot or will just sort of aimlessly strum in a very messy way and I think he's kind of assuming that the noise and the effects are so interesting he doesn't really need a melody or a song to carry the track he's just gonna strum and let the noise speak for itself but I really don't find the noise all that interesting it's not all that subtle it's not all that detailed especially in the department of all the reverb on Neil's voice I love reverb when you're not overusing it it can add that little certain something to a song but this is just in your face blatant overuse to the point where it's really not adding much to the song now I like Neil's voice on his I guess you'd say classic albums but the thing is yeah his vocals have some flaws he is very nasally there's a bit of a line there I could take it in doses it's fine I've got no problem with it but when you put all this reverb on Neil's voice to the point where his vocals are repeating over and over and over and over these flaws just become so much more of the parent they are magnified by 100 this LP is most definitely listenable for me it held my interest but I'm not gonna lie that interest was mostly there because it's Neil Young and it's like drone I'm intrigued by this for the same reasons I would be intrigued by bacon flavored ice cream if some random musician came out with an album extremely similar to this before this thing came out I feel like it would generate a lot less pandemonium because it's not Neil I did love two or three tracks on this thing a lot but a majority of this LP was either just okay or I wasn't enjoying much at all and because then I'm kind of feeling in on the fence 5 for this LP yeah I'm really kind of on the fence with it because it could have been really great if Neal and the effects just took it two or three steps further just go further get louder make the lyrics more abstract make the songs more apparent if he comes out with another LP of this stuff I'll listen to it but I feel like there was much more potential here than there was actual success but that's just my opinion what is your opinion do you love this thing do you hate this thing and why Anthony Fantino Neil Young llinois forever 
w8Bs5XGU1vg,no wage okay hi my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd going to do an album review and get right into it no ages new LP everything in between these guys are a California noise rock duo and this is the follow-up to their 2008 album nouns which for me was the rock album of that year I loved the way that that thing just combines atmospheric shoegazing production with a fast-paced punk rock energy and on everything in between no age is still the same band but this is most definitely not a repeat of nouns or even the 2009 EP losing feeling the most noticeable change on everything in between is the almost complete lack of reverb on this thing which is a pretty popular sound right now and no age has indulged in it nouns is completely loaded with reverb but this thing is extremely dry and it's almost Lent no age a newfound clarity now don't get me wrong I don't want to say that they're not still noisy and cacophonous they are it's just as if there's a little less mystery to it now the fog has been lifted and you're kind of seeing it for what it is lots of distorted guitars squawks loop samples very callous apathetic vocals and simple yet urgent drums which has always been at the core of no ages sound but they throw some piano in there they throw some synthesizers in there and I think the opening track actually has a drum machine maybe no each feels a lot more skeletal this time around as well everything in between is really not as densely layered it's really not a noise rock casserole maybe more of like a buttery croissant and that could be a spot of good news for somebody who was completely in love with weirdo rippers because a lot of these tracks for me kind of come off like a more well produced version of the single and EP tracks on that release now overall the tracks here feel disjointed it's kind of like a mixtape their various song styles and sounds and mixes sometimes the vocals are buried sometimes they're right in front different guitar tones honestly this thing has the formula and pretty much all the aspects that made me enjoy their past work but I'm not enjoying it as much in comparison to those on nouns the instrumentals here don't feel as formless or as vast not like this deep ocean of sound that you could dive into but kind of like a bedroom demo or a puddle and as far as the harder tracks and the faster tracks on this thing go though the heart and the tempo is in the right place the sound is just just barely there for me and not that it necessarily means a ton of reverb but where is the bone-crushing sound on tracks like teen creeps or sleeper hold god when I listen to tracks like that from nouns it's like a fire is burning in both of my ear canals and I just need to dunk my head in the sink to put it out here it's almost like maybe the guitars are a little more dull a little off or something I can't explain it it's just it's tough because I really wanted to enjoy this album so much all of these problems that I have with the album haven't added up to a bunch of songs that I hate a bunch of songs that I just have disdain for but really a bunch of tracks that are just okay there are some highs for me like the very melodic tracks common heat or valley hump crash and I love how noisy the tracks fever dreaming and chemtrails get the last of those too I actually think has fireworks in it or like bubble wrap being popped just really noisy fun rock and roll though songwriting has never really been no ages strongest point there really sound writers they deal in sound the experiment with sound it seems like they base many of their tracks around just something that sounds interesting this just doesn't sound as interesting as their past work to me that's all but I can't see why a lot of you guys are digging this it is fast-paced it is high-energy it's noisy as hell and it has a very admirable low Phi aesthetic to it I'm feeling a light maybe decent six on a good day for this thing but you guys let me know what you think I really do want to know how everybody's feeling about this help he especially people who enjoyed weirdo rippers and nouns to death please let me know what you're thinking about this thing why are loving it why you're hating it Anthony Fantana the needle drop no age everything between forever you 
z1ahI9rAFgU,okay my needle drops oh my gosh I have quite an album for you right here but before I get into that I want to say this past Friday I reviewed the new Deer Hunter album I just want to make sure nobody missed it so you know right there click on that or go in the d box and you can watch the review and second thing I want to mention on the needle drop comm there is a track from the new fresh and all these LP play it strange link down there in the d box download it yeah all right my needle drops do you know I started this channel you know I started this channel so that I could talk about and expose music that you don't know now that has become increasingly more difficult because there are of you and you're all listening to everything but let's just give that a try right now nails second album unsilent death nails is a trio started by the ex Qatar's for the band terror Todd Jones now todd has left that project for something here that is much much more intense something that should have any terror song shaking in its camo shorts on this release you have ten songs that span 15 minutes which doesn't leave a lot of time for each song you got 30 second tracks that's for a lot of grindcore influenced extremely abusive flurries of drums guitars and distorted bass playing so fast that they just blend into this wall of noise that just shatters your ears along with the drums it's amazing for anybody who is not only into grindcore but into noise also and I would say the longer tracks on this thing bring just as much fury to the table if not more actually the longer tracks is where this thing really gets memorable catchy lyrics coming through catchy by hardcore standards anyway lots of breakdowns and with the way some of these power chords are just ringing out on a couple of these tracks you think there's like some doom metal or stone or metal influence flowing throughout these songs too now the title track and the closer are the only two songs that break the two-minute barrier and here nails prove that they're not just abusive they're not just noisy they can structure tracks as well throw some guitar solos in there there's actually a part that's enjoyable but a little funny to me the solo slash interlude over the title track unsilent death sounds a lot like the solo slash interlude or bridge in the song walk by Pantera just the tone of the bass the way the bass line is just throbbing against the mix the drums and the dirty filthy filthy guitar tone as well yeah the guitars on this thing are very very abrasive at a lot of points the bass guitar blends in with that on a lot of this LP but still at the points where it separates from the guitar you can tell that it is adding a lot of thickness to this mix making nails feel much heavier the drums have a ton a ton of punch to them and the vocals I'm absolutely in love with this entire album I would liken it to something like a wind chamber you know you're if the wind is just blowing in your face and your eyes you can't keep them open and your lips are flapping back and you're just like a 90 mile per hour winds in your face for 15 minutes straight now the lyrics play on recurring hardcore themes traitor ISM religion control being forced upon a person conformity things like that I'm not building this thing up to be the most original album in hardcore or grind or metal out there it's most definitely not it has a lot of influences much of them being contemporaries so don't be surprised if maybe for some moments this sounds like some of the same maybe something you've heard before because sometimes what's awesome what's amazing what's the best thing out there right now isn't necessarily the most different thing or the most original thing but maybe merely an improvement upon what we already know exists that's what unsigned death is for me and because of that I'm feeling 109 on this thing I have just fallen in love with how Oh Moo mean just mean this thing is it's mean yeah ah okay Anthony Fantana nails on silent death forever 
LP-Vdm27vS4,- hood housing on digest hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd I know today I usually do a question of the week but I didn't think anyone would complain if I did a review of the new deer hunter instead before I start there's an album over at the needle drop calm link down there in the D box and you can download it for free the name of the group is soft powers and the name of the LP is bad pop it's very low fie fuzzy catchy stuff maybe if you're a fan of Ariel pink are Stevie Moore that kind of thing you'll dig on it just has a nice fun self recorded sound alright this is deer hunters fourth studio LP Halcyon digest and if you're not familiar with deer hunter their band a Georgia band who's a part of this new wave or newfound appreciation of my generation for psychedelic music their discography dear hunter has proven themselves to be experimenters but they've always managed to keep pretty much most of their albums very welcoming very immediate there's a lot of adventure that goes on in their music with strange effects weird sounds but they beef that stuff up with just some great songwriting so you could really enjoy this band for one reason or the other if you enjoyed deer hunters past LP micro castle this will not be too hard of a transition for you especially if you're into frontman Bradford Cox solo work under the name Atlas sound because this LP to me is actually sounding maybe more like a fleshed out full band version of Atlas sounds last album logos and to go back to Micro Castle though that album didn't have its quiet moments its ambient moments that thing feels like so much more of a rock album for me is it especially considering the tracks like nothing ever happened or on that thing this LP never really gets as distorted or as abrasive as that album it really lacks the tension for me of micro Castle and even cryptograms what little aggress you may have found on deer hunters past work is really not here on this LP however that's not a bad thing the band has replaced that feeling with something that is much more easygoing the tracks here range from being gentle to being playful to being blissful plus there are some things on here to suggest at least a little bit of a stylistic shift for deer hunter like the piano and sax combo on the track Coronado or the opening groove on the track revival or the hook on desire lines or the Everly Brothers like vocal on basement scene a lot of these tracks scream pop record but I wouldn't say Deer Hunter has lost their taste for experimentation the noise the phantom sounds all that stuff is still here it's just more condensed and weaved into the songwriting so much more a lot of the instruments in deer hunters previous LPS bleed into each other sonically kind of making some of them hard to pull apart that is even more of I don't want to say an issue but just the case on Halcyon digest which is completely intentional and maybe makes this LP feel a little dirtier than Micro Castle in some respects even in it sketchiest moments a couple songs like the opener like the fourth track sailing are very repetitive maybe a little minimal maybe a little skeletal and are somewhat dreamy just wandering linear sort of and this is really the only point in time where Deerhunter is kind of just letting everything cast out not really adhering to a structure and though these songs may not be the most thrilling pieces of the album it's still a nice counterpoint from those more straightforward moments and of course one other song that fits this bill is the closer he would have laughed which everybody is talking about everybody's building up a lot of buzz behind this song because Bradford Cox has said that it's actually about Jay retard now you guys know I love Jay the first out my reviewed on this channel was a Jay album I own the guy's solo stuff and I interviewed them once too for the website however that doesn't necessarily mean I'm in love with the last song of this LP it's okay it starts with a good groove I like Bradford Cox vocal delivery in there but it just doesn't engage me for the entire 7 plus minutes that it lasts so to kind of sum up here you've got some very lush production on this release some great personality for Bradford Cox coming through on the lyrics very memorable melodies very memorable hooks Plus this is the most I've ever heard the songs take precedent over the experimentation and the sonic aspects of the album from Deerhunter my only real gripes that there were probably three tracks that I didn't hate but just kind of paled in comparison to others I'm feeling an extremely extremely strong 8 on this thing almost a light 9 but I just enjoy the hell out of a lot of these tracks yeah a lot of course I'm highly recommending this I'm putting it on the loved list and yeah that's it of course many of you guys have already heard it and if you have let me know down there in the comments what you thought of it what was your favorite track what was your favorite moment and what did you think of this LP in context of deer hunters previous album Anthony Fantan oh dear hunter Halcyon Digest forever [Music] [Music] 
N7LyYAx3bpU,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd and I have quite a review here twice as many nodes as I usually have yeah I want to let you guys know that down there in the D box there's a link to where you can stream the entire know age LP everything in between in full of course I'm going to review it just head down there if you haven't heard it yet listen to it the New York band swans this is their new album my father will guide me up a rope to the sky and it's their first full length in 14 years and a lot of y'all young uns may not know that swans is one of the most significant bands in experimental music the band's discography shows that in its prime the comfort zone was pretty roomy if there was a genre or a style that was outside of the mainstream at the time swans have been labeled it noise no wave industrial post rock post-punk avant-garde outsider music although some of their work in the 90s did get pretty poppy at points the intense sounds of swans older records especially records like holy money and cop and those records are intense even by today's standards the sounds they're of course influenced two of my favorite bands Earth and Sun so you can imagine with all this influential mess and the reputation the 14 years until this album there is a lot riding on this thing there's a lot to expect my first observation with this LP is that it really sounds nothing like any swan album and I realize there's kind of a tendency for people to just fold their arms and say well this doesn't sound like squads I don't like it but to these people I would like to say where have you been there's stuff in the early 80s sounds different from their stuff in the late 80s which sounds different from their stuff in the early 90s which sounds different from their stuff in the mid night these they really aren't well known for sticking to one idea but really the direction the style of this new album isn't all that difficult to comprehend if you've been following the solo work or the solo projects of swans frontman and mastermind michael gira it's not like he's been on vacation for the past 14 years he's been putting out solo LPS and the side project that he's put albums out with most consistently has been the Angels of Light which stylistically carries a lot of folk music roots music but also psychedelic elements noise - and of course Gira's solo work has turned up on this LP and it's not just because of where he may be artistically a lot of the musicians in this reincarnation of swans are actually from Gira's personal band and in ways it kind of sounds like a glorified electrified version of that jeer of solo stuff and it may also be another way for him to draw attention to the stuff that he's been doing I mean after all what is a reviewer or a music fan more likely to gloss over a new geo record or the first swans record in 14 years so kind of to get to the record even though swans here still very adventurous still very heavy this LP is kind of easy to pull apart at eight tracks the opener is extremely noisy just starting out easy with some bells but then just kicking the doors down with guitar riffs drums and all sorts of dissonant horns and strings building up in the background it's a pretty dark intro but it eventually builds into somewhat of an art rock type of verse and it's here where I think swans lose a little bit of their steam again and again and again the rock parts just don't feel as intense or as gratifying for me as the noisier moments because on this first track the drums are a little muddied by all this room ambience around them and the guitars come off a little dull - the heavier rockier moments the kind of stuff that you expect from swans for me was just okay the parts which I actually felt went over really well and we're great was maybe a little bit closer to what michael gira has been doing for the past 14 years the acoustic moments the song reeling the liars in is one of the best parts of this album really shows that JIRA still has a great sixth sense for writing very dark lyrics you know flames licking the black sky mass genocide of people who lie very extreme stuff and also he has a knack for arranging on this song too it's not only very disturbing but very beautiful I find a lot of that same haunting beauty in the track you people make me sick which is also very kusik great melody and just kind of sticks there in the back of my brain like a shadow or something shadow creature when the band tries to rock like on songs like eat in prison or my birth the music just isn't all that subtle it's in fact kind of repetitive just monotonous went on this Madonna and I just don't feel the same charm coming from Jerez vocal delivery he doesn't write lyrics as poetically when the band is playing loud as opposed to when they're playing quietly at some points I kind of hear a little bit of Lou Reed in his vocals and at other points I'm kind of reminded of grinder man but like less intense and with less storytelling I didn't come across any songs on here that I have a deep-seated hatred for however there were a lot of parts on here that just instruct me as memorable just didn't strike me as being all that grand the acoustic moments the noisier moments especially that piano part at the end of you people make me sick amazing just had me floored I was just wide-eyed and freaking out considering that kind of stuff is the stuff michael gira has been doing and the rockier moments are what he's kind of getting back into the swing of I think this is kind of maybe a display of what you don't use you lose however I'm of the opinion that jeera actually has a lot of great years left inside of him and I think that if you were to come back to swans again please do he could put together a much more mind-blowing record feeling like a strong six almost a light seven on this thing but what do you guys think are you are you totally in love with this thing or are you totally in hate with this thing does Jared legitimately want to come back and bring swans back to life or is he just trying to do his own thing under a different name if you've heard it let me know your favorite track and yeah Anthony Fantana new swans record forever you 
F2HofRWJrc4,Flying Lotus pattern brick world my needle drops sup Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do an EP review not an album review but before we get into I want to mention that up on the needle drop calm right now you can stream a track and download a track from a new album coming this November through Slumberland records the LP is called sports the band is called weekend if you are into noise rock this thing is going to rip your face off so do uh yeah dude give a listen to that link in the de box this is flying lotuses pattern plus grid world EP and Flying Lotus is a California music producer who's made a huge splash this year with his last album cosmic grandma now if you want more info more context on this guy and that album I highly recommend going to watch the review over there and down there in the B box if you don't mind I'm just gonna get down to brass tacks with this thing so seven tracks almost 19 minutes and just over 5 bucks if you go digital on this thing go grab yourself a free thumb down there because that's a nice price and people like me who maybe didn't take to the slow-burning nature of flying lotuses last album should hop on to this EP pretty quickly it's straightforward and to the point like flying lotuses second LP Los Angeles but without being dark or brooding I have no clue where these tracks came from they could totally be throw aways from cosmic gramma maybe these tracks weren't cosmic enough I don't know but if that is true it wouldn't be surprising considering how close this releases to that album plus I could see a couple of these tracks just sliding into moments on cosmic grandma very easily like the opening track on here clay which is very chill a little jazzy as well I love the aesthetic just the vibe that that track gives off I think if that song was ready in time for cosmic grandma it might have made just a nice replacement for one of its many in your ludes but that's just me but even if this EP is a little bit of cosmic RAM or run off it still stands well on its own very well the tracks don't fade into each other each one has its own kind of thing going on which is nice if you're looking for something that is experimental but also light and easy to listen to my favorite moment by far on this EP is the song kill your coworkers second track on this EP it's got this beat that's almost kind of warm and then these scents just rise up very slowly like a sunrise or something and they sound a little bit like flutes almost but the track eventually just bursts into this beat heavy set of 8-bit fireworks it's kind of like a more colourful more melodic approach to the whole breakbeat thing the chill moments on this thing go over really well too like time vampires which is extremely hypnotic and the song camera day has a great beat but the melodies over it just feel so kind of soothing just very relaxing that's a that's one track you can stream down there in the d box for me it hits a few issues the song Jurassic theory slash em notion doesn't end all that pretty and the track pie-faces maybe just a little repetitive little monotonous still the toy box of sounds that Flying Lotus is playing with on this thing is no less varied no less gripping no less interesting than anything he's put out in the past really just as interesting as listening to J Dilla's doughnuts the songs are a little shorter than I would have wanted them to be but it's an EP can't expect too much of it it's not a full-length album it's not a full meal it's a snack it's price like a snack it's about the length of a snack if you come into this expecting a long mind-blowing change of direction and flying Lotus's music that's not going to be here but the sounds the eccentricity the beats everything we've come to know and love from this guy is here just because this thing is short or doesn't mean flying lotus has kind of skipped out on the quality now your general underground or experimental hip-hop fan your general electronic music fan I wouldn't say you'd be missing out if he didn't listen to this thing however I we'll say that is the case for a Flying Lotus fan because of the nice price because of the decent songs it's not mind blowing but highly highly highly enjoyable this thing is just squeaking by with a light eight I'm gonna put it on the love list and just recommend it to the FlyLo fans for the noobs please listen to Los Angeles it's right here and that's the review anthony Fantana pattern plus grid rolled EP forever 
9pVPVR_oYuM,Black Mountain Wilderness Farms greetings greetings hello and how are you to all of my needle drops Anthony Fantan out here internets busiest music nerd thank you all for watching and subscribing we're gonna review this thing in a second but first I want to mention two awesome things number one crystal stilts new single coming out in October I gave you the b-side last week streaming now the a side is streaming on the website it is great link in the d box and the second thing I want to thank everybody who went over to that South by Southwest website a while ago and voted for the vlogger panel that the rocket out blog and I wanted to host over there this coming summer because the panel got chosen yeah Black Mountain is a Canadian band and this is their third LP wilderness heart longtime viewers of the channel may be familiar with this group because here and there I've kind of peppered my videos with a lot of love for their second LP in the future and without getting into too much detail of their repertoire I think you could pretty much sum up this band by saying they like to cherry-pick various forms of rock and roll from the 60s and 70s anything from psych to garage to early metal if you're one of these classic rock dudes this is definitely a band that you must be listening to wilderness heart is no less into that blueprint coming off sounding a little more complex than their first album but kind of taking it back a little bit on the wanker II the indulgences of their last LP in the future you guys already know I love that last album but if for some reason you were looking for these guys to get a little more straightforward a little more to the point you got your wish the solos here pretty contained the structures are very straightforward let's just say that there's very little little fine print on this album and there's an interesting dynamic going on with this album to its pretty black-and-white really two sides to this album and side number one acoustic folky lots of lyrics about how modern society is going to hell in a handbasket kind of like the opening track to this LP the hair song and then there are other acoustic tracks that are much more quiet much more eerie but maybe a little forgettable and underwhelming at points side number two to this album is the rougher side the dirtier side the distorted side chugging ATAR riffs heavy bass a very stoner rock sound but I would say it's got kind of a sober delivery if you get what I'm saying not really any danger to these latter tracks which is sad because I like feeling that when I hear a loud song there's little to no menace when these guys get voluminous my main issue is that the trains just run on time whereas with this type of music not just with Black Mountain in general I'm used to them not being so regulated I mean really Steppenwolf was more experimental than this that's not a joke I was really looking for Black Mountain to kind of just get loose on this LP the first moments where that feeling does kind of come about or like on the last three tracks but by then it's like Oh too little too late now I understand Black Mountain doesn't want to repeat themselves again with this new album and I also can comprehend the pressure if maybe you wanted to make a more accessible album because this is most definitely that but I want to apologize I'm kind of sure selling this album though there is a lot about it too like I did like this album I didn't hate it it's just I had very very high expectations because of how amazing I feel like that last album is which I'm sure everybody here can relate to everybody has that album they love and they want the next one to be just as good the lyrics are really great consistently good even on the songs that I didn't like I just found the lyrics were catching me I like the vocal mix there is a lot of attention on that part of the song the musicianship is great the bass sounded really good the drums are spot-on I just wish it sounded a little more wet and wild so I'm feeling like a decent six but what do you guys think of this saying do you like it do you hate it and why is Black Mountain reviving this style of rock music or are they kind of just copying it let me know Black Mountain Anthony Fantana wilderness heart forever 
KJUXbD0MlHU,Black Milk album of the year hey guys it's Monday it's Monday time that means the album review time yes want to tell you guys before we start the review there's a new podcast up on the needle drop calm and down there in the B box there's actually a link to where you can subscribe to our podcast feed Oh Black Milk is a hip hop producer from Detroit and if you know anything about underground hip hop and the Detroit seen this guy sort of seems to be a given for fans of guilty Simpson J Dilla and slum village now his latest LP is album of the year a humble title but in the opening track Black Milk goes on to explain that basically this album is a summation of all of his experiences of the past year now if you're unfamiliar with Black Milk he's one of these double threats like dr. Dre or Kanye a guy who not only produces his own music but raps over it too and his beats definitely shares some similarities with slum village and J Dilla like I mentioned earlier but those are also guys who he has worked with in the past too and I think he may also appeal to fans of Jake one or Madlib two guys that he gives shoutouts to in the very lyrics of this album but I wouldn't say the production here shares the same level of glory or mastery as any of those artists there's a lot of pervasive generic nasaan a lot of these beats especially on the two opening tracks welcome in 365 a lot of tracks are based on a horn keys electric bass and drums combo and he's really not bringing anything new to the table but it's not like Black Milk doesn't try there are some moments on here where it seems like he's bringing live drums into the fold however it actually ruins the song not that live drums sound bad but the way that they were recorded is is god-awful they sound so thin and shrill what's sad is that like four to five tracks actually actually who have this drum sound so let's move on to lyrics where this album hits a lot of potholes as well because what's wrong with this LP is very apparent by the time that black milks first guest MCS hit the mix they're rapping light-years beyond him don't get me wrong milks Flo is OK and one thing that I actually do like about this album is it really does live up to that promise on the opening track that this album really is about those experiences that he's had over the past year so it's nice to hear just a story told in the lyrics but it seems like most of the time black milk just kind of wants to talk about how awesome he has thought he is for the past year and I'll give it to him there are some clever and funny moments in the lyrics like when he says my is Martin Luther your is Martin Lawrence it was even a funny line that I laughed at when he said he's saving the game like a memory card however I was showing this song to my youtube colleague you're I'm right you should subscribe to that guy and he said hey wait a second didn't MF DOOM rap this before and he looked it up and surely he did on his vaudeville villain album under the name Victor Vaughn but Black Milk really does think he's saving the game which is kind of sad because he's kind of giving us like the same thing but less most of the time I'm really annoyed by his unfound cockiness because this thing is nomads philony it's it's no donuts it's no two shinin it's no 36 chambers but should I compare well on this album Black Milk does say that this LP is the greatest thing since thriller which he may be exaggerating for comedic purposes but he'd love it if you believed him and besides even count your chest and nose that off the wall is better it is true mr. milk after all is better see overall there's just a lot of stuff working against this album for me just really bad hooks okay production some very bad mixing some bad sounds in there some okay rhymes I mean black milks not awful but I actually enjoy every guest rapper on this LP more than him in terms of what's influencing this album it's clear as day he gives all these guys shout outs in the lyrics but what separates them from him is that these guys at their core are not only just hip-hop fans and hip-hop producers but they're also experimenters they ventured into the unknown and pioneer to sound the sound that has become a beaten path because of guys like Black Milk which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I'd much rather listen to what the adventurers are doing I'm kind of feeling a whack light played out four on this thing almost strong three I know kind of harsh but I really didn't enjoy much of this album sadly so apologies to anybody who may have enjoyed it hardcore Black Milk album of the year Anthony Fantana forever 
RXEfX-diMwc,future islands in evening air hello my needle drops hope everyone's doing well a new t-shirt got it over at my favorite record store red scroll records future islands this band their new LP has been staring me in the face since May and I apologize it's taken me until now to review because sometimes I just thanks in evening air is the title of this thing and right from the get-go it is pretty apparent that these guys are huge fans of New Wave considering all of these synthesizers and drum machines and lightly reverb bass something that sounds a little similar to maybe Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures this LP is on Thrill Jockey in the past these guys have released LPS on upset the rhythm and they're a part of the ym city collective which includes artists such as adventurer and Dan Deacon who this band has actually had a split come out with so easy to say here that if you were to listen to this LP you're in for something that is fun and kind of eccentric as well this band has put out a lot of music since they're starting Oh 6 a lot of it actually being self released CDRs under a different name art Lord and these self-portraits however this LP doesn't really make me all that curious about their past work some songs I literally have just nothing but love for but there are moments that just leave me wanting more they're so close so close to something just amazing evening their future islands really belt out some fantastic ballads like the opening walking through that door that track for me is really the closest they come to perfection on here great hook good melody super emotional vocal delivery and as long as we're on the vocals we really need to talk about them for a little bit as much as I don't want to boil this band down to one thing it's kind of unavoidable the vocals really are the most distinct thing that they have going for them there's a lot of rasp there this guy's voice is rough dirty but it's very melodic too it's not like it's just yelling and loud noisy a lot of people I've read and have heard in conversation kind of liken it to that of Tom Waits though I don't really see the comparison yeah it's rough and it's raspy but it's the dudes voice what are you gonna do however it's not as if it's not intentional there are some tracks on here where he actually kind of pulls back on the rasp eNOS and his vocals sound very smooth and then there are moments like the track tinman where he just lets it all go just you know so at least he has control over it there's some great song ideas on this LP but in one way or another I feel like the band kind of falls short like on the song Tin Man where I feel like the production kind of hampers the tracks enjoyability especially when it gets loud and distorted and the song inch of dust is really one of my favorite moments on this thing but like a lot of tracks on this it leaves me kind of cold because the song just ends abruptly as if an ending couldn't have been drummed up you've got a filler instrumental a really repetitive closer and just all of these men and skippable moments just add up into an album that feels a little lackluster despite the fact that there are some great tracks on it along with a pretty unique sound I'm feeling a decent too strong 7 on this because for me it's kind of just stopping short of being amazing but I am talking about this thing not because I want you guys to necessarily know how I feel about it but because I think this could actually be the band of 2010 for a lot of people if someone is in fact looking for just some electro pop with a very dark moody edge and unique vocals this is certainly a mutant of an album right here and I just had to just put my two cents down on it because whether or not I am in love with every song on the album it is a noteworthy thing isn't know where the LP but that's how I'm feeling on this of course links down there in the D box where you can hear a few songs off of this thing and if you've heard this LP let me know what do you think about it and if you've heard this band's past work as far back as their first bad name what do you think how was their progression been is this the best they've ever done or have they put out better stuff and there we go Anthony Fantana future islands in err 
gLH0xZ5O-Fc,sup y'all anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd thank you for being here we're gonna do a little question of the week action before that I have a few things want to mention on our tumblr account link in the d box we didn't interview recently with singer/songwriter bill Baird frontman for the band son said he has a new LP out it's fantastic check out the interview stream the entire album over at our website to the needle drop com also over on the needle drop com there is a little button that brings you to a page it looks like this but anyway this button brings you to a list a loved list a list of albums that have come out this year that I reviewed and if I gave it a score that ranged from an 8 to a 10 then it makes it on the list if I didn't give it a 8 to 10 if I gave it a lower score then it doesn't make the list sorry so any albums in the future that I give an 8 or 10 to I will put on the list alright guys I did a blog TV this past weekend someone suggested a song from a group by the name of the home run and apparently this is a pre Vampire Weekend project for lead singer ezra cooling and this was some silly ass white boy rap the track was called pizza party now of course there was quite a bit of comedy to this track it's pretty much a joke just every lyric there's something to laugh at and it kind of made me wonder what is the validity if any of funny music or comedic music or music that is merely meant to just be a laughs I feel like funny music it's kind of a bad rap sometimes like if I were to compare you know if I were to ask Oh funny music music that's supposed to be ha ha ha can it be as deep or as important or as relevant as the new LCD soundsystem can it be as affecting as the new Arcade Fire can it be as important or as I don't know somatic as the new titus andronicus I feel like most people will say oh no no no that's real music that's actual music that's music that's that means something you know what it makes me wonder what the musical landscape be what it is today if not for guys like Weird Al Yankovic and there are great musicians who love to put a joke in their songs like Frank Zappa half his songs are ridiculous what do you guys think of funny music of comedy music music that's meant to make you laugh is comedy music just nothing but cheap thrills and it's not important at all in it will never affect anything see you what is the funniest song what is the funniest band who makes the funniest music what is the best comedy oriented track you could ever recommend to anyone let me know Anthony Fantana pizza party funny music forever you 
KdoJNfTm-Hc,"it's track review hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here to do a segment that we haven't done in a little while track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent nope not today of the more mainstream persuasion before we get into this track review I have a few things I want to mention a first new radio department mp3 over at the needle drop comm really great song download that thing for free link in the d box also i've gotten a lot of requests to review the new linkin park album and i actually did for this other website that i do reviews for scene mags calm there's a link in the de box you could see a review it's not a score review it's kind of a copied or drop it kind of thing anything my CeeLo new review has over 100,000 views right now and I want to thank you guys because I know it's all y'all just click it on it over and over and over we are so close to 10,000 subscribers yes yes yes and what I would really ideally like is to get there before or on my birthday which is October 28th that would be a fantastic birthday or early birthday present all right picture of the LP that this track comes from the new Brandon Flowers album flamingo of course many of you may know Brandon Flowers originally as the frontman for the ever-so-popular band The Killers and say what you want about The Killers I think they have good taste I may not love every single one of their songs but they do clearly show a lot of influence from one of my favorite bands new order see this see this see this see this this is good to this week Brandon Flowers has made his full-length debut and we're just gonna review the single Brandon Flowers link in the de box where you can hear this track crossfire hmm okay all right my needle drops this thing was a no-holds-barred ballad my gosh it just pulled out all the stops and just made you want to pull out your lighter your though I don't really have a deep history with this kind of music not exactly 100% my forte maybe it's a little too clean it borders on overproduction very very closely but seriously if you think that I am completely beyond enjoying immaculately produced radio rock you sir are wrong because my copy of u2's the Joshua tree is right here so the production here does have a very very modern sound it's taking some cues from The Killers but the songwriting just how am emic it is really calls back to guys like Springsteen Petty Mellencamp it's something we all look back on fondly I know but one thing to note about this track and pretty much the rest of the tracks on the album I have heard this LP all the way through there is a lot of country influence on this thing and that shows up in the slide guitar sort of hidden in the back of the mix on this song there's a really nice galloping bass line that goes along with it too and another piece of instrumentation that stands out in this track for me is Brandon Flowers voice he's a really good singer and I love especially when the hook comes in and he's singing that's in terms of structure you got a pretty standard thing going on here verse a little bit of course more verse and with the chorus getting really long and epic have a bridge with an acoustic interlude talking about the devil which brings me to the lyrics just a lot of slightly cliche imagery going on here lyrical themes that we've heard before again and again and again which is kind of what makes the track so catchy to begin with caught in the crossfire secrets on your pillow it's a lot of stuff we've heard before but just kind of rehashed for today maybe it's not the most special thing on the plane maybe not the most original thing on the planet not the most different not the most innovative but I feel though I do have to recognize good songwriting good balladry when it is going on especially in the mainstream because as we all know that is really where it's kind of needed the most so I'm kind of actually feeling a decent two strong seven on this it is really catchy as I'm listening to it I get into the hook as I do with most of these tracks but after I'm done listening after the music is over I don't really have this lasting feeling going on of of love and lust like who I need to listen to that again I need that again so what do you all think of this track what do you think of the new Brandon Flowers LP does it live up to your expectations that's basically what I'm wondering and how do you think the next killers album is gonna sound now that this thing is on the table Anthony Fantana Brandon Flowers crossfire forever "
NTqEw597UZI,chromia business you know albums like this make me wish I had some sexy clothes to wear this is about as close as we're getting to sexy today guys but it's not how we roll first off before I start this review I want to say hey there's this really awesome French garage rock band that you guys should check out on the needle drop calm download a track from their new self-titled LP link in the d box hi Kevin and I also want to thank everybody for coming out to the blog TV last night I announced it on our Facebook page on our Twitter page links to those inside the d box so you can stay up to date whatever I'm feeling like doing a blog TV alright no more stalling chromeo is a Canadian duo and this is their third LP business casual and there's nothing to really get about chromeo I mean you gotta love an act that you could just take for face value what makes this album good is not a mystery it's dance music hahaha with a very strong funk influence coming in on the synthesized bass lines in the top box backup vocals there's a lot of New Wave and disco all over the mix on this LP which shouldn't be anything new for longtime fans of these guys I have to say the biggest change that Chromeo makes on business casual is that they take it down a notch on the electro you know the kind of sound that you may find on a Chromeo track like fancy footwork which from what I understand has actually gotten the the guys some recent attention because that song actually showed up in the movie step up 3d this album has I'm gonna warn you a lot of Kitsch to it a lot it's a very distinct sound that caters to a very specific type of music listener someone who is looking for some sexy smooth dance floor ballets with lyrics about nothing but love lust and longing in that respect Chromeo is slightly one-dimensional but they make their biggest effort yet to kind of rectify that on this LP songs like night by night and don't turn the lights on are untouchable pieces of moving perfection but Chromeo sounds equally as comfortable and tracks like going to butcher some French here shakeela poor which is this acoustic LED pop song sung in French and business casual ends with the song grow up where Chromeo kind of indulges in a very Huey Lewis and the news type of sound it was surprising to hear them go in this direction and they took to it like ducks to water though I am loving this album I will bring up its biggest issue corniness there's just a pervasive corniness throughout most of the songs on this thing that's kind of what makes it enjoyable but there are some spots where it even gets to me kind of on the longest track of business casual you may get rough there's something about that song the lyrics are narrated it's about an unstable woman putting the main character through a living hell and just the sparse synthesizers in there just kind of the talking it's it's a little it's cheesy however that is much much much less of an issue on this album than it has been on ChromeOS past efforts where I've kind of cringed a lot though I'm not with them 100% of the time I understand that that's just the nature of this band they're just over the top in their slickness they're just so slick there's so slick slick and that slickness how cool these guys feel and sound on this album the great hooks the fantastic mix which I really have no issues with whatsoever the synthesizers the influences this thing is squeakin by with a light 9 yes a light 9 we're doing that I pretty much enjoyed it from beginning to end yeah just a few spots in there where I was like maybe this is a little too a baby for me but yeah that's pretty much what this album is like slicked hair back hey honey I dunno what this album's game is I know the strategy it's trying to play but just because I know what it's trying to do doesn't mean I don't enjoy it which I clearly do a lot glad we hit a high note here guys let me know what you think of this album down there in the comments are you loving it are you hating it I know they're gonna be a lot of y'all who maybe this is just too much for just too much for it if it is let me know and let me know why I'm very interested to hear some opposing thoughts anthony Fantana Chromeo business casual forever and ever and ever you 
ZJcfSk9f3YE,Lockman Lisbon hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I stub my toe it hurts before we get into this review I want to mention that on the needle drop comm there is a new b-side to a single coming out later this year from the band Krystal stilts it's a great song these guys came out with a great single last year and in 2008 I believe it was they released an amazing LP for anybody who was into lo-fi fuzzy garage rock a light of night great album check it out link is in the D box along with a link to a new our Stevie Moore tribute album put out by the blog sick of the radio give that a listen to one of the members of MGMT actually covers an hour Stevie Moore song - all right let's get into this The Walkmen are a New York band whose music to me just has an old soul almost as if maybe I could hear their music playing on a scratchy old 78 Lisbon is their sixth studio LP so it's pretty easy to say that these guys are seasoned but they haven't garnered the same attention as their other New York contemporaries like Vampire Weekend or the National and I don't know why they have very passionate songs a very distinct sound based on weary crooning vocals and shimmering guitars this thing also got pitchforked with an eight point six and I believe sputnikmusic gave it an eight stars out of 10 as well but for me this is an upset when these guys put out bows and arrows I thought they'd hit a grand slam you know just for rounding the bases first base second base third base but somebody managed to get a hold of the ball before they got to home plate and throw it to the catcher and if I may for a moment I thought I was going insane I actually had to go back and listen to the Walkmans two previous albums just to make sure there wasn't some kind of mental disease in my brain forcing me to hate this band outside of some string arrangements and one track that really relies on a huge horn section there's not much different here sound wise and I really can't say the production is that awful either more aggressive moments like Angela Surf City still go over really well which is the most Punk I've ever heard this band get and tracks like stranded still just sound huge with all of these horns backing them it's really big track a lot like a Beirut song highly enjoyable too I think most of my gripes with this LP sit with the songwriting the musicianship let's start with the track follow the leader mixed very messily the guitar isn't even on the tempo the entire time I'm sure the direction of this track was intentional positively sure but it still ends up just feeling like a piece of filler there are a couple moments like the track blue is your blood where the song is based on this sort of one guitar phrase that repeats itself for most of the track only making the song feel really really monotonous even in the moments where it is changing into something else there was another point that bugged me a lot on the track victory where it felt like the vocals were straining a little bit maybe could have done with a second take and there was something about the interplay between the musicians on this album that I really can't explain either it felt kind of flat I just found that a lot of tracks had drumming that was just kind of repeating the same thing over and over and over meanwhile people were just kind of just doing their thing over it as opposed to everyone reacting to one another there were songs here that didn't really feel like they had an ending just sort of stopped and overall the album doesn't really feel like it has as much subtlety as previous releases like you and me that album I feel like I could just turn it over and over and over in my head like a Rubik's Cube and constantly just be looking at it from different angles and different sides and different shapes and just seeing it in a different light where is this thing the more I listen to it the more I got to know at the flatter it just felt but don't get me wrong these guys still have a lot to admire they could still be sentimental like on the torch song another favorite of mine and they still clearly have a lot of ambition which shows on the tracks stranded that I mentioned earlier I just like the older stuff better and you don't even have to go as far back as the song rats which I know a lot of people love and is played almost two times as much as any song on this album according to last.fm I can't say I'm upset here over a big change in direction or just an unexpected sound because that's just not the case the Walkman sound like the same band here I think what I'm trying to say is that this time around it just feels less inspiring for me I'm feeling a decent two strong five on this album but what am I gonna do it's not like I'm gonna lie and just tell you I liked it um That's not me I'm sure coucher Chester likes the Walkman though I can't hear ya I'm listening to one of these new iPads I hate coucher Chester Anthony Fantana the Walkman Lisbon forever 
1RuC_S06xwY,grinder man grinder man 2 my arm hurts hmm hello my needle drops Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and we're gonna do an album review grinder Man 2 grinder man is a band fronted by singer-songwriter Nick Cave one of rock's most essential personalities if dark eccentric music with a lot of poetry maybe think Lou Reed but more evil is your thing then Nick caves worked with the Bad Seeds is an absolute must and if you're into music that's very very noisy and experimental I would go as far back as to listen to his work with the birthday party grinder man is Nick caves latest project and what makes this one different from all of his others well in grinder man there are more guitar bass songs but I would say even though that is the case there are a lot of similarities with the Bad Seeds which isn't surprising since every member of grinder man is in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds but on this LP the band goes further to create a fine line and make grinder man really its own separate thing morphing it into this safe haven where Nick Cave can kind of just explore very garage very bluesy rock music and let's say as a result Nick Cave is a lot less romantic in his songwriting working straight from the gut he is dirty he is filthy he is disgusting on this album a parental advisory sticker emblem is simply not enough to do the material on this album justice I mean if this album were a movie it would be rated R for violence nudity sex sex sex sexual language and sex the LP opens up with the track about two brothers who I think are murderers and they're on the run from the cops it's a perfect beginning to this album couldn't have picked a better one guys and I love how badass and simplistic the production is it's really raw really fuzzy distorted it sounds like a lot of classic old guitar fuzz boxes are being used throughout this thing but not every track is produced the same exact way I mean the following track not one of my favorites it's titled worm tamer and yes that title is as suggestive as it sounds worm tamer has all these dissonant strings and horns and guitars playing in the background throughout the track it's really kind of a mindful in terms of sound and songwriting there's something clever here to listen to another highlight for me is the song kitchenette which is about a guy just trying to seduce a woman away from her husband kind of critiquing all of the stuff that he's bought her it's also got a really nice lusty bassline in the background - overall the band is shooting for the same target but for me somehow they've kind of ended up with less bull's eyes than the last album for example heathen child is really not one of the best lyrical moments on this album and displays are a real issue with this LP Nick Cave repeats himself a lot and he really falls back on the word baby too many times the track what I know actually kind of feels a little bit like filler with how uneventful and unfinished you and the song evil feels a little unfinished in comparison to its musical companions on this album also but all of that aside the personality the delivery what exactly is going on with this album it's extremely original it's unlike anything else you're gonna hear that was put out this year this thing is just a bastard of an album it's the equivalent of spending a few hours with a drunk womanizing mean old dude who has a lot of mood swings an anger management problem it's something that you would try for the experience and when you do it you that every moment with this guy isn't going to be the best and the brightest there are going to be those parts where you're in there wow I'm so happy I did this I'm so happy I spent the time to do this but then again there is that element of danger in there there is that element where well maybe this guy isn't always cracked up to be I think I'm feeling a decent decent 7 certainly not as shocking as grinder man's debut LP but if you're kind of in the market for more of the same BAM but let me know what you're thinking about this thing do you like grinder man do you hate grinder man and what do you think of this new album hmm how would you score it Anthony Fantana Nick Cave grinder Man 2 forever 
jNBYi07Q7GQ,Blonde Redhead penny Sparkle hi hi my needle drops this is Anthony Fantana the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review of the new blonde redhead blonde redhead isn't one of the most widely known bands in rock but they're almost twenty years of material sits at a crossroad of indie pop psychedelic rock shoegaze and this new LP is a completely different story this is penny sparkle and if you want to hear noisy guitars and dissonance and Distortion you're about 15 years too late may I suggest Blonde Redhead Staib ULP seven studio albums and a soundtrack after that album Blonde Redhead is going new ways they are going dream pop this 80s revival and a lot of the sounds on this LP are pretty popular right now in independent music music but here Blonde Redhead really does age gracefully improves that they could still change with the times and the change is pretty surprising even when comparing penny sparkle to its predecessor 23 the song structures here are a lot more straightforward the sounds are sweeter there are a lot more drum machines and the tracks all seem a little more sequence to but I wouldn't say that has led to Blonde Redhead losing their taste for adventure because this thing is not their pop album this is not gonna get any radio play not at least commercial radio play what makes this thing so interesting maybe a little adventurous for me is how quiet it is it is so bleak and eerie and also kind of sensual which would usually underwhelm me but the songwriting here is really nothing to turn your nose up at the chord progressions are so sinister throughout every track on this thing you've got contrast between the chorus and the hooks memorable lyrics great melodies just the basics of catchy songwriting considering that and the change in sound that Blonde Redhead has undergone on this LP I really think this is something fans of beachhouse Bjork and little dragon can appreciate which bring me too my most surprising comparison um when listening to this thing over and over I found that more and more it was kinda reminding me of Fever Ray yeah but of course not really as eerie or creepy more sexy instead and that's another thing this album is sexy as hell like the entire thing could soundtrack a slow motion black and white lovemaking scene in a movie even though this is the most quiet I've ever heard Blonde Redhead for an entire album this LP for me just just sucked me in it didn't so much come out to me but it's something that you kind of have to give your will up to submit to it's not gonna rock you it's not gonna blare sounds at you it's gonna hug you and embrace you and pull you in close and whisper sweet nothings into your ear there is not a track on here that I hated but I think the only thing I really don't like about it is the the album art this may not be one of blonde redheads most definitive moments but I think this proves that there's still a force in independent music that transcends all the buzz all the memes and all the BS that gets a lot of attention these days I want to see maybe two songs underwhelmed me and there was a track that I felt ended maybe a little abruptly a little early like oh where was the ending to this track it just kind of stopped but if you get in and just let the sensuality take over then this is an extremely extremely enjoyable listen you know really I was feeling like a strong seven on this but it I'm gonna let it squeeze by with an eight because it really is a great great album didn't amaze me but it is a great great LP and I'm really happy to hear a band that is as aged as Blonde Redhead just still kickin ass but doing it quietly and I kind of wonder what counts you're Chester thinks of Blonde Redhead you know I really do actually prefer brunettes you know what I do to blonde redhead penny sparkle forever 
Jhxy8MV9S70,of montreal balls priests hey guys Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd got to do an album review but before we get into that I wanted to tell you that on the blog there's a new track from the tallest man on earth he has a new EP out via iTunes and it's a fantastic song just down there in the box find a link to download it I wonder what a couch your chest the things about the tallest man on earth Haley if he's so tell he'll come at how come I haven't seen a man I hate him I hate council justice of Montreal is a band who over the years has dabbled in a lot of musical styles whether it be psychedelic pop or funk or maybe on this album a little bit of R&B but it doesn't matter what style they're pursuing whatever type of music they're playing it's guaranteed to be something that completely just lets go of its inhibitions around releases like some lanta twins and hissing fauna frontman Kevin Barnes started embracing really flamboyant rock front men like David Bowie or Boy George or Prince the music became more gaudy as well like so overblown so many kaleidoscopic sounds and colors to listen to just very overloaded and though I do think of Montreal got a lot weirder I have to admit Kevin Barnes songwriting did get more ambitious and his production chops got a lot better Barnes lyrics got more interesting too creating characters and making these really cryptic references that drive fans nuts wondering who or what the hell he's talking about there are a lot more electronics in the music too but false priest believe it or not is somewhat of a step away from that maybe a little closer toward more natural instrumentation not that you can find a drum set in nature but follow me on this one though the instrumentation here may be a little clearer than it has been for the past few LPS for Oh Nouriel Kevin Barnes vocal delivery is more unashamed than ever he just continues to do all of these really wacky falsettos on all of the songs which are weird enough alone but here he started layering them on top of each other like it ain't no thing there's a little more guitar on this LP there's a little more drums on this thing but the music still sounds very one-track very rigid there's a ton of synthesizers on here which I'm sure most of Montreal fans are used to by now and that Beatles esque bass guitar that has pretty much been there since almost the beginning is still stand and strong on this LP too though maybe it's not as loud as it used to be some songs are really quick and poppy and accessible like the song enemy gene where Janelle Monae actually shows up to help in the vocal department while other songs are really memorable just because of how strange they are like Kevin Barnes narrating about this very very dangerous abusive relationship on a riotous defects I mean that she killed his beta fish-- my issue with most of this LP is I wish Kevin Barnes wasn't trying to just pour 10 gallons of sound into my head within a 30 second timespan the bizarre nature of this album just its demeanor distracts away from the music more than it adds to it though I will say lyrical moments like you look like a playground to me that's just Kevin Barnes flirting with being a genius if you would in fact allow me to call him a genius I know Kevin Barnes can write a decent pop song when he just steps back and calms down a little bit he's done it before and he does it on this LP with famine affair however at least more than half the time I find that all of the instrumentation and all the sounds all the synths are so layered on top of each other that is just this orgy of sound that I really have no desire to reach into and kind of pull apart I'm feeling a light 5 almost a strong 4 on this LP and is because all the songs are really boring to me no not all it's actually because I love a lot of these songs but I hate a lot of them too but what does it matter like Kevin Barnes says in the track there's nothing wrong with hating rock critics I don't create I just critique but what I'm wondering is what would you score this album hmm high ten low 1 somewhere in the middle let me know Anthony Fantana oh yeah and why Anthony Fantana false priest of montreal forever 
HtZpjuo2BBo,Ouiser early well well well well well well well well well well well my needle drops its Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd you know what there's an interview down there in the d box that I actually forgot to put in there yesterday because you guys know why but we got to do an album review the new Weezer LP her holy of course this thing doesn't come out until next week but Weezer is streaming it online in full now on their MySpace link down there in the D box Weezer is another band that I'm reviewing that really needs no introduction yeah they don't need one everybody knows that Weezer has this tendency to work people who are in my demographic mostly because of how their sound has changed from the Blue Album up until today and for a lot of people I know R attitude was one of Weezer's greatest offenses I know most of the time when I'm listening to a Weezer track that I don't like him I'm usually like this I am NOT enjoying this Weezer song I think I will change the track wears on some more recent tracks I know it was more like but I'm here to tell you that even though this LP is not perfect I think it's something that old-school fans and new-school fans can take seriously which may be hard to believe so let me rephrase that I think this album is something that old-school fans and new-school fans can take seriously there's a slight but very noticeable change in Weezer sound right from the get-go of this LP with the lead single memories Weezer hasn't been sound in this distorted or this dirty in a while I mean the band's not going low fire or anything but the LP has really devoid that squeaky squeaky clean rock sound that made a couple of their previous LP sound a little too sanitary for me I'd say here rivers songwriting is as strong as ever and it's awesome to hear the band just transform these songs into a few different styles there's some straightforward balladry on unbroken with lots of flute playing in the background and some flute run actually sound a lot like Aqualung from Jethro Tull but for me it's one of the most memorable songs on the LP great melody great hook I think my only issue with this song as it is with a lot of songs here is that there are a couple cliche moments in the lyrics with can't you see it's a line that's been said again and again and again and again by bands both good and bad which is partially why I would like to see that line avoided but still the song is too catchy and too enjoyable to get hung up on three words there are also some unapologetic fist-pumping rockers on here like where's my sex which is actually one of the lowest points on the album for me just because of the really weird vocal delivery and the cheesy bridge but the lowest points on Hurley are nowhere near as low as points on like let's say make-believe I mean this track is no Beverly Hills Weezer gets a really nice overblown acoustic sound on the ending track time flies and the song ruling me actually sounds like maybe a classic Weezer song but kind of sped up with a little added arrangement on it there are moments where it's angsty it's cute it's tense it's mellow it's gregarious it's just looking to have a party it's nostalgic it's innocent there are a lot of different emotions flowing throughout this thing sure there were some tracks that I thought were okay there were some production moments I didn't really care for like putting a drum machine behind the tracks smart girls but nothing struck me here is offensively bad Weezer hasn't sounded this cohesive this consistent in a while now I know a lot of people are still hung up on the fact that Weezer is not really exactly the same band that they used to be and that's fine that's fine that's okay hey listen if I want the blue album I'll take it out of my CD tower and I'll put it in the CD player I'm sure this is going to please new fans and I urge any old school fans who may be a little too cynical to listen to Weezer again to at least give this album a try I think at least one or two songs will impress you I'm actually feeling a light too decent seven on this thing much higher than I would have scored ratah too much higher than I would have red but what do you guys think of this LP there's quite a bit of change on this thing Weezer is coming out with this on an independent label maybe this will be a string of releases on epitaph or maybe Weezer's just going to release independently from now on who knows what do you think Weezer is going to go after this maybe toward something more enjoyable or do you think they'll keep making records that you hate or love Anthony Fantana Weezer early forever [Music] you
