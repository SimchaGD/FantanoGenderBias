dfzAuvtWVYk,earth ladies and gentlemen Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd time for a review earth angels of Darkness and demons of light to earth is an experimental rock band led by guitarist Dylan Carlson they've been putting out LPS since the early early 90s and over the years they have put out some of my all-time favorite records these guys are incredibly influential when it comes to the heavier side of rock music helping to pioneer the droney offshoot of doom metal drone metal their incredibly influential to drone artists like Boris like son and the sounds that they put out in their records are pretty much the precursor to the heaviest and newest sounds out there today in sludge and doom metal you could downplay the role that this band has played in music if you like I do know that the spans music is not for everyone but earth and in groups like The Melvins 2 are an undeniable part of why we hear so many heavy and low end frequencies in rock music today albums like Earth 2 or phase 3 as inaccessible as those albums can be they really kind of opened up new possibilities for how loud or how heavy and bacey a record could sound in a way that kind of sidesteps various styles of Noise music now over the years the band has been evolving its sound they made a big change after a short hiatus in 2005 coming back with a sound that was still slow still brooding pretty droney - but had kind of a country-western Americana style laced into the music the music had a lot of twang to it some banjo some pedal steel trombone and tubular bells mixed into the music to earth was definitely seeking out new ways to explore their love of a very slow and ambient music now that apex of this new sound for me was the 2008 album bees made honey in the lion's skull love that album one of my favorites in this band's discography it's to me the most melodic out of all the album's that was done in this style and features some fantastic musicianship from guest guitarist Bill Frisell that album just shines it sparkles it's just got so much sheen on it and you know it's it's hard for me not to turn this review into a review of this album so I'm just gonna keep going now angels of darkness demons of light one the follow-up to bees made honey in the Lions skull that LP started bringing things in a slightly different direction I'm kinda lukewarm on this LP nowadays and it's mostly because of not just the incorporation of cello on this album with Earth's new sound their new style but really the way the cello was mixed into the music the cello just had a lot of bass on it it just ended up muddying up the bass guitar and then the sixth string guitar - I feel like a lot of great things about this help he did not translate because things just felt so dull felt so opaque I guess this is the second installment of angels of Darkness and of course because I wasn't too hot on the first installment I went into this thing kind of worrying how many similarities is this going to have with its predecessor will it get rid of the things I didn't like and enhance the things that I did like right off the bat I did hear some great improvements on this LP the guitar and the cello they feel like they're mixed differently now in a way where they actually complement each other and they're not battling for the same spot in the mix they're not at odds now they really enhance one another in my opinion the guitars and the bass carry that low-end like they should and the cello kind of sticks to bringing these really pretty textures into these songs another another thing I liked about this LP was the first track it may just be three minutes but the guitar tone on that song is stellar if guitar tone was a precious metal then this is gold this is platinum it sounds so good it's like listening to I don't know just just a pretty beautiful stream or babbling brook or something it just feels so gorgeous very warm really shiny really resonant yeah I feel like that's where this album really stops amazing me Earth has definitely worked out the logistics of incorporating this new instrument and putting together music for this two-part series but stylistically and musically I feel like Earth is just kind of treading water on this LP nearly every song here just sounds like I'm listening to a slightly altered version of a song that I've heard played on previous earth albums these guys are pretty much just jamming on recycled grooves and guitar phrases and in a way I can appreciate that you know there are plenty of older jazz records that if you bought them they had alternate takes of songs on the album mostly because the solos the improvisation the interplay was so good that it made each take worth listening to however the stuff on this LP is being billed as as new material and while it is to an extent at the end of the day just kind of feels like a repurposed compilation of songs from Earth's previous releases the differences I do pick up on this LP I do like I love that weeping cello in the background on the multiplicity of doors and the guitar chords improvised around that track around the 849 minute mark are beautiful dylan carlson just improvises just in Bella's around this chord progression like a master I'm sorry to be pretty blunt about it but there's not much else I could say about this record because I kind of feel like I'm reviewing the same album again Adrian Davis's drumming on this record as usual is very slow patient and OnPoint love listening to her play under this stuff but despite these pluses I just feel like this album has a severe severe lack of new ideas for people who have been following earth up until this point I'm kind of feeling a strong five to a light six on this LP pretty lukewarm on it but what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana earth oh yeah Cal Church esta what do you think of Earth professor couch your chest to hear THC at your surplus here to tell you that after much research that I have done by myself I have found earth is where we live thousands of man hours poured into that research I'm sure forever 
BkehXdTfF38,the pórtico quartet cortical quartet hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the pórtico quartets new self-titled LP the these guys are a london-based band and this is their third full-length studio album and this LP has a nice blend of ideas coming from the worlds of jazz and electronic music and it's not like electronics and jazz haven't met before over the years there have been tons of musicians bringing these two worlds together among tobin as well as this is for tet in some of his solo stuff and in collaborations he's done and one of my favorite electronic music producers of all time Square pusher those guys are just single producers and and and producing music by yourself definitely has a different sound than when you're working with a full band but it's not like that combination of jazz and electronic music hasn't been explored either by groups like the Cinematic Orchestra Norway's jaga jazz and I'm not trying to say the pórtico quartet is late to the party when it comes to combining jazz and electronics I just feel like their music and this album is kind of like the next phase of this combo now while this record does not sound like the cool or the Bebop or the fusion that a lot of jazz nuts go crazy over it does embrace a lot of jazz elements like interplay between the musicians improvisation and exploration musically and sonically previous material from the span especially their own 9 album isla was much smoother and had kind of a an escalating post-rock quality to it with a lot of strong sax solo in a way it kind of reminded me of bands like fridge and producers like new japaese at the same time now this new LP sees the band's style evolving and maybe in a way that will turn off some of the more traditional jazz fans that have latched on to their sound there are some tracks on here that completely function without the aid of sax solos there are some spots on here where the sax does kind of steal the spotlight but for the most part it's either not here or it's playing performing in a way where it is just adding another texture another sound soaring above all of these layers of beats of drums of synthesizers of strings loops and samples to the electronics are kind of taking over with this album and they're now using them to improvise and to experiment much more there was even one track on here that I remember had kind of a drum solo going with an MPC take the track ruins for example which is kind of one of the more direct tracks on this LP it's got a nice straightforward groove a great upright bass line the bass is kind of being strummed and there are all these soft ambient sound scape textures just playing behind all of this and then this very emotive sax solo kind of just makes its way into the track very shyly it's it's kind of coming out of it's shell slowly but surely and when the reverb eventually hits this sax solo it just becomes gargantuan there is some evolution going on toward the end of the track that really kind of makes me feel like who this band is definitely in a different spot now these looped synthesizer arpeggios start coming in and as the sax solo becomes really noisy and kind of chaotic all of these glitchy harsh loud electronics just start barreling down on the track making it really kind of intense I like it because this track really feels like a full band I hear improvisation 'z I hear interplay between the musicians but the way the track is built with this really repetitive these electronic elements it kind of feels like it borrows its structure from an electronic dance song the third track on here kind of follows the same premise as that second one which which acts me a little bit but it's still a decent song the band really kind of starts stretching its legs out in this new direction on the fourth track rubidium which embarks on this eight-minute soundscape of of electronic textures tense strings really faint horns and some synth loops too then these drums just unexpectedly fly in and just start going all Art Blakey drum solo all over the place rolls and fills as far as the ear can hear it's pretty formless and vast and even though it is that it just has so many beautiful sounds in it and leaves me with so much to think about the sixth track lacquer vu is a bit more straightforward the beat is mostly electronic very repetitive very hypnotic I would call it almost a micro house song if it wasn't for the fact that it had these really kind of post-rock violins sort of wailing over it I just wish you had more of a climax to it the song ste plus right after though is fantastic one of my favourite tracks on here brings this album into more of a downtempo sound and has a guest vocalist cornelia a swedish singer and her voice is really light really fragile and emotive has kind of a joanna newsom quality to it this LP does take a bit of a risk introducing a vocal guest so late so close to the end but it really pays off peridot put the vocals are just this percussion played mostly by just the drumsticks hitting each other and these loops that are just kind of skipping along in this in the sort of tense way it feels like somebody hummed and then took the hum and then sampled it and chopped it up really quick so it just kind of had this glitchy quality to it I just wish a two-minute ambient interlude wasn't how this band chose to end this album it just felt extreme the anti-climactic especially since the the interlude didn't really seem to connect to anything but maybe this band isn't one for a big finish still I think it's pretty interesting that the pórtico quartet chose to make its third full-length album self-titled and I definitely feel that that's because these guys are really defining themselves on this album they really jump from one style to the other which normally would make an album feel really disjointed but I feel like Portico quartet gets away with it because every track here is executed with roughly the same instrumentation and sounds and the mood pretty much stays the same throughout this LP every track on this album feels so calculated refined but most importantly I think every single track on the saddle bum is very contemplative it's a very cerebral album it's not an LP that gets my blood pumping but my gears turning up here so some great sounds great production and recording wasn't huge on the ending lukewarm on a few tracks but still I think this is a fantastic album that should be checked out definitely feeling a strong

anthony Fantino portico quartet forever 
PECeceTOCU8,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd with a question comment thing a lot of people comment on my videos send me messages and emails tweet at me have you given a ten would you ever consider giving an album of ten when will you give a ten what albums that you currently know of are worthy of a ten where are the tens it's sort of like some people think that I just have a stack of albums that I think are worthy of ten sitting right next to me and I'm just refusing to review them and I'm not complaining because in a way I asked for it because I have not given a ten yet and I use a numerical rating system but because I'm yet to give a new album a 10 I'm not really sure what a new album me giving it a 10 would sound like you know sure I feel like I could say this or this or this is a 10 but I feel like those albums because I've heard them before I even started doing the needle drop hold a special place in my heart they're all so critically in fan acclaimed albums that you're supposed to like and suppose to think are awesome and albums like this one I feel like our tends not only because I really enjoy the music on them but because I've been listening to them for so long they've kind of become a part of my life not only have I listened to this music for so long that I just kind of get or understand its meaning but I've also sort of put my own meaning onto it as well my own personal meaning if I continue reviewing music I'm sure I will eventually run into an album that I think is worthy of the big double digit number but four things will that mean it's a perfect album will it mean this album will be game-changing alter the face of music go down in the history books as an amazing album will I always think it's a ten even when I'm in my 60s well I think this album that I've scored a 10 is as amazing as the day I reviewed it and will this album be life-changing or mind-blowing the answers are no no maybe not and not for everybody my personal reviewing philosophy and I know that sounds like crap but my scores that are attached to my album reviews are only only only only reflective of my personal enjoyment of the album whether or not I like love or hate something that's it I'm not trying to appeal to some kind of objective idea of perfection and I'm not thinking in my head well a perfect album must have ABC and XYZ in order to be perfect if you want a more technical explanation I pretty much take albums track by track oh I love this track ooh I don't like this track so much ooh I don't like that track at all and of course what I'm listening to an album not only do I take each track into account but how these tracks come together as a whole as an album so I guess to even really consider getting an album at 10 I would need to enjoy each track on it to the max and really just enjoy the whole thing as a combined piece what's going to make me enjoy every track to this maximum threshold of enjoyment um I'm not sure really depends on the album and what reasons I'm I'm enjoying the album so if a 10 is out there for me I just need some understanding that it's just gonna happen when it happens it's not something I really want a plan or force because to me the idea of scoring and the concept of a ten are not as important to me as just turning you guys onto artists that I think are interesting it is just as will it be a ten one day maybe that's all I can say cool cool count your chesta counting to 10 when 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 did 
ew9pSl1vJP0,be still my heart hmm hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here internet's busiest music nerd time for a review lappa Lux l'p Alex when you're gone he's a uk-based electronic music producer this is his latest EP actually his debut release for brain feeder records one of the biggest labels and beat music out there right now and like a lotta releases on this record label when you're gone is is more about sounds and textures than anything I'm not saying this is an EP of soundscapes and and ambient Tunes it is beat music but how these sounds sound how they feel how they resonate and sort of how they play together takes precedent here sort of at the sacrifice of just about everything else and that appeals to a side of me because I love hearing interesting and unique sounds and textures and there's nothing I hate more than hearing a good song executed with just bad sounds just bad sounds I'm gonna try to go through a few tracks on here but keep in mind the sound and the style of the songs on this EP jumps around a little bit the track gutter glitter is the first I heard off of this EP and I like that track a lot it's this slow brooding song with this nice set of just chopped in' and pitch shifted future garage vocal samples and there are all these ethereal synthesizers just pulsating swirling together and calling out in just every direction if you throw this on a pair of headphones just it's so panoramic the beat is loaded with different sounds to from these really heavy bass hits to this really clack kind of snare and these popping sounds this bubble pops it's got a really sexy quality to it but it's way too sludgy and heavy to really be so the track moments is not as heavy not as monstrous it's got a vocal guest on it pi a female vocalist and she's got a really nice sweet R&B style to her vocal on that song the groove has a really kind of choppy future Garage quality to it and among all these glitzed out synthesizers there's just this glockenspiel just sparkling toward the end of that track these really heavy distorted bass synths come flying in and it ends up kind of resembling dubstep music with just these bass or kind of revving up it's a track that mixes just soft gentle pretty beautiful sounds with with heavy distorted and just lots of punch there are tracks on here that kind of pick one end of that spectrum or the other though like the intro track which is just pure bliss it's got these soft shy kind of damaged lead vocals singing very quietly over this soundscape of what sounds like kind of pianos strings maybe since I can't really tell what this soundscape is made out of because it's like lapel extol the sounds and threw them in a sonic fondue pot until you really couldn't tell or one started and one ended it's a fantastic blend he really melted these sounds down and when the track eventually kind of explodes with these piano keys floating in this cloud of Sonics it's just gorgeous and like that track with pie right after it the song has a bit of an R&B quality to it to the song gone on the other hand is really slow really heavy has these synthesizers and sound like they would have made it into a John Carpenter sound track or something and these pitch shifted chopped and sampled vocals that kind of pop up here and there throughout the track just all over the place just add to the creepy factor of that song this EP is only made of a handful of tracks though and I was kind of lukewarm on the rest of what was going on here like the track yellow 90s and construction deconstruction yellow 90s for me was just a real change of mood that I wasn't that into the groove just kind of felt like a high-fructose electro funk beat that Chromeo would have produced or something though the track didn't really feel all that fun or sexy for me and the song construction deconstruction I know this EP is really really about texture but I feel like it throws so much texture at me that I don't really get much out of it I have a hard time kind of pulling a main theme out of that track and I feel like the groove gets lost a little bit in the in the mess of samples and sounds that just gets thrown into that track and that's kind of an issue I have to a slight degree with other tracks on here like that song gone that I talked about earlier it's got this creepiness about it that I like but I feel like there's so many sounds in there that don't complement one another or it's just a lot to hear but none of its really sticking with me I kind of feel in some way that listening to that track it's sort of like wading through a bunch of old newspapers or dirty clothes that someone's just profusing the throw away the EP finishes with this ambient sound scape that I thought was was pretty nice though it didn't really strike me or lure me in or seduce me or anything like that and there were a lot of songs on here that you know I kind of got worked with on a level because they all finished with fade-outs in one way or another though I thought this EP had a lot of great textures a lot of nice blends of different genres and ideas it kind of skimped on other things that I like hearing in music too like a great groove a strong consistent character still there's no denying that the tracks on here that that I did love and even the ones that I didn't required a lot of talent to put together I liked this but I just wasn't really in love with there or even coming close to that kind of feeling a decent two strong six on this EP but what did you think about it did you like it did you hate it and if you did why and what should I review next because that's what's important not what I review next but what you actually thought about it your personal opinion it's important so let me know Anthony Fantan out when you're gone

E9V9AkezyRQ,Sharyn BNN tramp hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Sharon Van Etten tramp Sharon Van Etten is a Brooklyn singer-songwriter who I've been listening to ever since she made her little first handmade demos although I haven't totally been head over heels with everything that she's done in the past from the sort of rough around the edges because I was in love which is an album kind of based on those initial demos to the criminally short album epic every time I listen to one of her releases I always think yeah this is good but there's just this kind of potential that's not being fully realized I guess but there are things that are already inherently great about Sharon that kind of keep me coming back to her releases again and again and then like Sharon's songwriting which always has some pretty great lyrics and her voice which is always just so raw and a motive she's got a really mature and and womanly voice in no sense is it light or girly or flimsy and that helps a lot when Sharon is trying to transmit the emotions behind these post breakup songs or at least they feel like post breakup songs to me this album kind of feels like the act of unpacking emotional baggage leftover after you've broken up with somebody and you're just kind of unpacking box after box after box sifting through things seeing what's worth salvaging what needs to be thrown away ASAP and what you just can't let go of no matter how much you want to you kind of get these really vague memories all throughout this album of turning points in relationships with this person or people like on the song give out where Sharon is saying to a particular person and saying that you're the reason I move to the city you're the reason I'll leave or on the song serpents where Charon is singing about kind of this inevitable change that's coming and it's a change that's gonna bring thinking thinking things closer to the end and I guess she's trying to come to terms with that and the track all I can seems to be singing about just just personal flaws and mistakes and and accepting that as well it's in a way that's sort of assuring for the listener too because I feel like she's just singing directly at me and she's just trying to do everything in her power to get me to understand this there's a lot of emotional strength on this LP but there are spots of weakness to on here like on the track I'm wrong it seems like Sharon's trying to grab validation from this broken relationship by singing to this person asking if if she was worth all the miles he put on his car I guess to keep the relationship going the relationship is over but it was still good right it wasn't just a waste of time right there's just a range of feelings and stories focusing on this dying love and even though that's not a novel concept in music and songwriting Sheeran is just so passionate and so good a singer that I just want to hear her side of the story and that passion again for me comes through the great singing and some really good vocal melodies too on the song Leonard she has this vocal melody that's constantly ascending and descending and in this really catchy way she's also got a load of very close vocal harmonies on this LP too they have kind of a first aid kit quality to them especially on the track serpents which is sung really loudly and intensely and there are moments on here where she's singing and her voice just seems very spotlighted very alone and kind of sweet and understated like on the track joke or Ally if it wasn't already a parent just Sharon's voice her melodies her lyrics and the chords that she uses to build her songs to me are the most interesting thing tramp has going for it so for me the songs feel the best on this album are the tracks that are either the simplest or just kind of have the the least bells and whistles and showcase those strengths like the track give out which is pretty much just acoustic guitar and voice but it's backed up by some really light electric guitar leads that feel pretty atmospheric and dramatic and these heavy but but sparse drums just really spacious leaving tons of room for the emotion of the track the instrumentation does get harder and louder on this LP too though like on the track serpents which has this very driving drumbeat the guitars get heavier too but it's not a busy song the musics volume is just rising to match the intensity of Sharon's songwriting on that track it's on the song Leonard that I think the instrumentation becomes a little too much I guess I do love that track it's one of my favorites on the album and the instrumentation does kind of feel lush and plentiful between what sounds kind of like an accordion or a pump organ a piano but the performance just kind of feels really predictable it feels like the instrumentation is supposed to be there a lot like you're supposed to do your homework and as a result they just kind of play what it sounds like they're supposed to play the song kind of skips along like like it was a Beirut tune or something and and speaking of Beirut Zac Condon of Beirut is actually on the eighth track here we are fine singing but honestly that song does kind of add up to my least-favorite on here I just feel like Zac's erratic vibrato works much better alone I just don't really dig it all that much mixed with with a Sharon Van Etten's song and her voice too but there are actually quite a few other notable indie musicians featured on this LP Julianne Barwick is on here Jen wasner from the van Y oak as well as Matt Barrack from The Walkmen and Aaron Dessner from the National is on here as well he actually owns the studio that this album was recorded in the personality and the songs and the stories are are there you know I just feel like some of these songs have quirks about them they're just kind of turned me off like the opening track which is kind of loud but just so short and does not leave the impact on me the gripping impact that I feel like a first track should and on the track in line the vocal melody kind of wanders in a way that doesn't really deliver a melody to me that that kind of sticks with me you know I prefer the tracks on here where the vocals just feel more precise I just think the last several tracks on this LP are pretty awesome though the track asked follows that simpler and more confessional style of songwriting that other tracks succeed with on this album plus I love how intense and loud that track gets as it kind of progresses starts off very soft but the instrumentation subtly introduces itself as it moves along just getting more and more in the last two tracks Joker Ally and I'm wrong feature Sheeran singing over this kind of jeroni instrumentation it's a trick she's done before but she's brought it up to another level on this LP the track I'm wrong feels really kind of huge kind of epic with some booming drums towards its end some guitar hums kind of rising in the background they have a little bit of bite to them that track for me is kind of like watching an explosion in slow motion this time around I feel like Sharon is doing way more instrumentally and production wise then she did with epic more instruments more musical guests sometimes I feel like they complement her songs sometimes I feel like they don't other times I could just kind of take it or leave it I just kind of end up with a group of tracks on here that kind of pale in comparison to others by a large degree maybe maybe but whatever because like this album acknowledges change it's inevitable it's gonna happen it's got to happen just roll with the punches I did end up liking this album a lot though feeling kind of a decent too strong 7 on this thing what do you guys think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Sharon man Eden forever [Music] 
8Mxjjefgprw,well hi hello and how are you Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd review ep schwa moe vacation schwa Moe is a beat music producer whose last LP bad vibes actually made it onto my favorite albums of 2011 list and the album was full of these really chill understated instrumentals it was a kind of interesting approach to be producing because many of the sounds that that you could hear on on bad vibes were not only quiet but sort of seemed to be easily found and in the bedroom of just about any musician sounds that kind of resembled thumping your hand on a desk or or scratching a pencil or a paper cross something lots of acoustic guitar these kind of distorted and and manipulated melancholic vocals kind of calling out and going and it's not like Shlomo's beats were just these repetitive grooves that just kind of hammered on this one idea over and over and over there was a lot of progression on this LP now vacation is a little EP of some new material following up bad vibes and there is a noticeable sound change on this thing as well as some remixes from label mates at friends of friends records Nicholas jar and Teebs now for the most part on the CP Shlomo is still working with the same somewhat low fie quiet cool and relaxed set of sounds that he has been but he's changing his music style dial dial up a little bit with these three new tracks with the choppy beats and the sampled and pitch shifted vocals the tracks here resemble the sounds of future garage more than anything artists like Sepulchre burial subtract and even though Shalom oh is kind of jumping to a different sound especially on the first track where this kind of footwork where the rattles along with the groove the song this guy's production style still shines through along with the melancholy atmosphere that usually surrounds his songs the intro track here just feels so moody and the solo on this thing I think it's just a distorted and manipulated vocal sample it sounds great really dramatic really epic and the second track on this EP when you is a bit faster and a bit prettier - and the vocal sample on that thing is chopped and and just presented so delicately the darkness of the previous track kind of slips away in favor of something pretty sexy the final track on here feels a little bit more in line with what I would expect from Shlomo those future garage beats and and vocal samples are still there but the tambour of the electronics and the rhythms on this one feel a little more DIY between the guitar and the and the handclaps just the various percussion on this thing it just feels cluttered it feels like a dark cluttered messy bedroom filled with instruments that track to me feels like a nicer and more even mix of slow-mo sound on bad vibes in this and this new style he's incorporating with it I'm not gonna go into the remixes too much on this thing because the tracks themselves are solid enough three really good tracks and a reason to look forward to whatever this guy puts out in the future in a way I am let down because I wish there was more material on this thing and I do prefer when Shlomo plays with with hip-hop grooves as opposed to the ones he's toying with on here but I still thought it was really enjoyable kind of feeling a strong seven to a light eight on this thing but what did you think of it love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana slow-mo vacation forever 
zvvISXU7YaQ,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd it's time for a review a place to bury strangers on words to the wall a place to bury strangers is a New York rock group that for years has been creating this this noise laced reverb post-punk music this EP features track after track of just harsh shots of guitar distortion and these kind of lazy listless disconnected vocals that sound kind of akin to what you would hear on Jesus and Mary Chain album I saw him live at South by Southwest this past year and they Slade I just wished the intensity of this band's live performances and the intensity of their last full length album exploding head translated to this new EP like usual with a release from this band the guitar sounds reign supreme there are loads of different distortions delays and reverbs kind of creating a sound that is that it's almost as voluminous as lightning bolts raining down from the sky or a bullet just piercing through a hundred glass windows the song I lost you has these really ear piercing guitar wails these very just driving drums and toward the end the song just presents this just brittle harsh wall of sound the second track so far away is a bit more danceable has a bassline that kind of reminds me of the Eurythmics track sweet dreams I think the tune is ok the only thing that really sticks out to me are these really bright high-pitched just shiny shiny guitar sounds that come out over the hook I prefer the next track the title track way more it's got these surf rock drums that's really kind of chilled relaxed bass line and these kind of swells of of guitar drums a various sound and texture in the background and over them are these deadpan duet male/female vocals singing about love it's the catchiest song on this EP honestly and speaking of catchy I mean I just don't feel like any of these tracks really measure up to the material on this band's previous album exploding head when it comes to to memorability none of the songs on here are as melodic none of the riffs on this thing are as heavy or as grooving I feel like the last track comes close to that but but only close I would say that maybe a place to bury strangers has subtracted the melody out in order to just be more dissonant being noisier but I don't think this EP is that noisy in comparison with other a place to bury strangers releases there's definitely a little more detail hanging in the background of the tracks on this EP maybe there's a little bit more body to the sound of these tracks and that's mostly because exploding head was was so heavily compressed and a place to bury strangers previous LP had kind of a rough recording when it comes to simulating the effect of hurricane-force winds flying straight at your face just nothing beats exploding ahead in the a place to bury strangers discography in comparison the production on this new EP kind of feels more like a a strong gust and I think it all comes down to the compression you know the lack of compression does give the songs on this EP sort of more subtleties but the overuse of compression exploding head is what makes that album so heavy so impactful so memorable even if it is so loud that it becomes a bit of a trial to sit all the way through it and to be honest I do think I am liking this album a lot more than I was when I originally reviewed it in 2009 so overall in this new EP I feel like there are some interesting guitar sounds but still I'm feeling less volume less intensity weaker hooks despite all my lukewarm comments I don't feel like I hit a terrible song on this EP for sure there were at least one or two tracks on here I thought were really good but I still came away from this thing feeling like it was just kind of a bit of filler in between album releases just to kind of kill some time hopefully when these guys do drop another album they bring that same bold big ambitious sound to shoegaze and noise rock that they usually do kind of feeling like a strong five to a light six on this EP but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next a place to bury strangers 
qjKuzGK04GY,No hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Leonard Leonard Leonard Leonard Cohen all the ideas Leonard Cohen is a singer-songwriter who like Bob Dylan or Tom Waits is a top notch wordsmith know him check out his early albums they're loaded with really wordy stories finger picked guitar and some really faint accompaniment from strings background vocalists and the occasional organ electric guitar bass drum set the instrumentation is good but what makes Leonard Cohen's first four LPS so attractive is his singing and it's not like he's the greatest singer in the world or anything especially on his first LP where there are a lot of points where his voice kind of sounds off pitch what makes Leonard's singing so great is that it feels so believable it feels so real he really puts the idea of songwriting up there with acting he has the potential to come off really soothing and hypnotic sometimes and other times he can deliver his songs with this really riveting conviction that makes me hang on every one of his words now on Leonard's albums he's had his louder his Marc centric his bolder moments but a great deal of the tracks you're gonna run into in his discography are quiet understated kind of laced with this romantic melancholic theater called Rama it's a style he's kept up until his old age especially on this LP old ideas which is kind of a reflection of Leonard's aging style and you know his aging self - at this point in his life Leonard is almost 80 and his his age shows up most in his voice which is really kind of settled into this low-pitched gravelly smoky sound that sometimes reminds me of Tom Waits there's some tracks on here where he's not really singing as much as he is narrating in this really dust caked whisper that's pretty gripping a lot of his lyrics these days are still on point - like with the opener going home where I can't help but giggle a little every time Leonard Cohen refers to himself as a lazy bastard living in a soup it's just this really kind of funny self-aware and clever portrait of the character that he plays when he creates her performs his songs I like the breezy background vocals and the the light hand percussion the watery keyboards it's a song that's very quiet but really soulful to the song anyhow has a story about kind of being mistreated or just desiring someone who does not desire you back and never did - and this comes out in the lyrics like I know you never loved me but could you love me anyway or when Leonard kind of begs this person to just hate him less it's just one funny and desperate appeal after another and there's kind of a sour comedy to it and the vocals themselves feel kind of sinful in this song and the music behind them slowly paced this wandering blues tune but I think the song crazy to love you is where Leonard is at his best just vocals and guitar and lyrically is kind of struggling with the question of whether or not he should chase after this love that he desires I can definitely pick out high points of this album easily but I'm not into a lot of songs here I'm not into this album overall and it's mostly because of the sound the production of these songs it's an issue that I had with Leonard's last studio LP of new tracks dear Heather so many of the instruments and the effects on this LP just sound so plain and kind of corny I don't think they the drama or the sad emotions that these tracks present the song wallow by has this beat in this bassline that sounds like it was programmed in a keyboard that you could buy at Toys R Us and this long different sides has this similar cheap thin synthetic bass sound that I don't like at all I kind of wonder in the back of my head if that's a real bass guitar on that song and if it is how did they get it to sound so fake on the song banjo the background singers just kill me they do not fit in with the atmosphere of the twangy banjo led blues on that track at all and on the song come healing the background singers get pumped up even more for a kind of gospel effect but how much they sing makes it so so apparent that Leonard is not on key a lot of the time because they're trying to harmonize with him and it's just not working I think he just would have been better off singing that song solo or just have the background singers merely coloring the background lightly like they were on other tracks and on the song darkness that track just has this really farty electric guitar that sounds like it was plugged directly into the soundboard to record it for that track and it just sounds so bad and the slide guitar and the piano on that track too it's just so cheesy this album does spare me some of the headaches that I ran into on dear Heather the background singers for the most part stay in the background and there are no saxophone solos but I just cannot get down with the sound of this LP at all there's some moments here where it's bearable and I can really get into the song but for the most part I'm just too much of a stickler for the way things sound to enjoy this LP and yeah I know it's kind of silly and ridiculous to complain about the sound of the instruments on the Leonard Cohen album that's not really why people go to Leonard Cohen albums people come to these albums for the lyrics and the stories the personality and the voice I get that and I think that's the saving grace of this LP if that's why you come to Cohen's albums then there's probably no reason you wouldn't enjoy this on some level that is the good side of this album I just don't think that side is so good that it fixes the things that I don't enjoy because to me most of this album just sounds plain or just horribly horribly under-produced so I am just on the fence with this LP kind of feeling a strong four to a light five on it but what do you guys think do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Leonard Cohen 
h_jZvILNGzo,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of Montreal paralytic stalks of Montreal is a jojoba and this is their 11th full-length LP and they're one of those sage indie acts that have been really interesting to follow over the years through all the highs and through all the lows they started in the 90s sort of as a part of the elephant six collective which churned out some really great acts like elf power apples and stereo olivia tremor control the Neutral Milk Hotel 's and their early stuff not to go on too long about it was pretty much an assembly of acoustic and psychedelic pop tunes that were just proud to wear its Beatles influences but of Montreal later progressed into a sound that incorporated more electronics more beats more synthesizers and also started bringing in sounds from glam rock and funk music to thankfully over the course of this change of Montreal did not just become you know a blend in the electronic act and part of the reason they stayed interesting is because of the singing and the songwriting from frontman Kevin Barnes along with the music his personality kind of changed too in his songs he used to be pretty kind of shy and introverted and throw out a lot of quirky lyrics but alva out on of Montreal's more recent stuff he feels much more frantic and overly emotional it's a persona that he continues on this LP especially on tracks like dour percentage where his vocals are just so wild just lashing out at anybody who will listen the lyrics themselves are pretty raw and personal sort of self-hating sometimes Kevin Barnes is definitely his own worst critic which is always made of Montreal's dynamic kind of interesting because you have these kind of tortured painful lyrics being spewed out over this music that is just too sugary for words now on paralytic stalks the music playing underneath barns vocals is changing again and it's going in a direction that I actually like more honestly it seems to be passing more on the electronics on the beats on the synths it doesn't completely get rid of them this album is not completely devoid of that stuff especially on the intro to year Anu the plaintiff or the end we will commit Wolff murder but the role the electronics play on this album is noticeably smaller and these sounds are being replaced with with arranged instrumentation with strings with horns with woodwinds and piano and to me it gives of Montreal's usual eccentric and kind of schizophrenic personality a sort of refinement you know it doesn't feel as gaudy it doesn't feel too over-the-top the band still able to keep up its energy though most of the time because if there has been one other noticeable change that came with the electronics with the beats of Montreal's music became really groove heavy and that momentum is still here it's just that with the arrangements with the guitar the drums the bass all this live instrumentation this instrumentation that just just feels alive the energy is just different more natural I think like toward the end of the first half of year anew the plaintiff we're of Montreal kind of goes in this psychedelic rock jam that gets pretty sweaty another thing of Montreal keeps up with this LP despite the sound change is the musical density and detail that usually goes into its albums there are so many sounds bouncing back and forth on these tracks if you put a pair of headphones on it will play pong with your brain a lot of tracks here just go through these really quick fun and and almost unpredictable evolutions a lot like the song winter debts with all the changes on tract it just feels like a song straight off of the white album or Abbey Road or something it starts off with this kind of acoustic introduction that is really kind of somber and then it goes into these rushes of pianos eventually there's this pit orchestra swelling really ominously there's a spot in here that sounds kind of country - with this pedal steel playing and a and a sort of honky-tonk piano in a way it kind of reminds me of old of Montreal albums and some stencil where there's a lot of sound play I would call it a rehash of old ideas but this album just feels too big instrumentally to just say of montreal has taken a step backwards there are other tracks on here that go through equally jarring changes that end up stringing these songs out to seven minutes eight minutes the final track is 13 minutes so a lot of these tracks rely on either progressive or just really unconventional song structures which makes listening to these tracks kind of like just driving really fast down a winding road between the instrumentation the longer tracks there's definitely some shade of evolution going on with this LP but of Montreal's changes have always come slowly a lot like the album satanic panic in the Attic is kind of a foreshadowing of what was to happen on hissing fauna are you the destroyer and maybe paralytic stalks will be the launchpad for the next new interesting sound that of montreal plays with for a handful of albums the band is experimenting with avant-garde music like on the eighth track here which is a number nine style sound collage that goes on for eight minutes and features a plethora of sounds including the instrumentation that I just mentioned and some spoken word I think a lot of the new fans especially the people who love this groups poppier albums might think that track is kind of boring but I dug it I thought it was intense but still even though if Montreal is clearly experimenting on a lot of these tracks their sweet side is still intact again that tracked our percentage which has a groove that reminds me a lot of just disco music the vocals and lyrics add that bittersweet touch to the song and the saxophone solo off the back end of that track is just sassy and the song Malevich dowry is this acoustic tune that I can't quite make heads or tails of yet it feels like as soon as that song rolls into town I'm just on an island and I have a little coconut drink or something it just feels really light and sunny and kind of cute now there are some issues I have with this LP and I'm hoping that if of montreal continues with this sound they hammer them out in future albums of montreal is making a lot of their songs longer now and in order to do that they're adding more parts to their songs and on some of these tracks these parts flow together really well on others they don't or the other parts just kind of feel like they're there the song winter debts feels like a complete journey and I really like how he renew the plaintive starts off with these electronic beats and through one transition after another just blows into this full-on rock song that really just is just awe-inspiring to me how that track changes the final track a lot like winter dets has a pop tune at its start a string break and then a piano ballad toward the end but I do think it relies on this string interlude in the middle a little too much and while I'm complaining I wasn't that huge on the first track it was kind of heavy psychedelic and hazy but just not all that memorable for me and overall I guess I wish this album was as conceptual as other of Montreal albums that I love and if there is a concept going on with this thing it has not really revealed itself to me yet as far as the lyrics and the stories on this LP go it's a lot of the same stuff Kevin Barnes has been singing about on his past several albums and he knows that he even brings it up in the second track of the LP where he says lately all I can produce his psychotic vitriol that really should fill me with and you know it's it's kind of interesting to see that extra layer of self-awareness get just placed on top of this album but I think the lyrics are are kind of due for a change just like the the music is and that change is happening here with this record I think you get a lot of solid pop tunes some nice experimentation some progressive song structures classier instrumentation some great Arrangements written for that classy instrumentation and the assurance that of Montreal is not going anywhere this is definitely the most fun I've had listening to a new of Montreal album in a while but what do I know I didn't even really dig hissing fauna as much as most people did I'm feeling a decent strong seven on this LP what did you guys think of it did you love it did you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana of Montreal forever [Music] you 
2nrImj0cqgg,[Music] guys I'm so excited my favorite band of all time yeah that band they just got back together they came back after a really long hiatus they really are the best band they pretty much invented half of the genres that we listen to they made all these records that I love and I somehow feel justified in getting really hyped over it almost to the point where it's irrational because everybody around me is getting really hyped about it because there's absolutely no question whatsoever that the next record that they put together after this breakup hiatus break thing is going to be three times better than anything that they've ever written in the past wait what are the chances of that actually happening you know there are some times when groups come back from a hiatus or a breakup and they make a new record and magic just happens it clicks it's as if there were no break at all or they approach things with a much different sound and it's still freaking awesome poor to set Scott Walker Tom Waits but overall comeback albums are notorious for splitting the opinions of music fans like Devo The Strokes Gang of Four b-52s The Slits the Stooges I don't think I'm the only person on the planet whose favorite bands have released comeback albums that were at least on some level a disappointment there's no reason we shouldn't root for these artists who have come out of retirement we want our favorite artists to do well but I think there's a difference between cheering and expecting for example Christmas comes once a year it's even on the calendar so that they let you know when it's coming in comparison comeback albums are not always a sure thing however this band that just got back together that I love that reunited and stuff they're probably still good live probably going to see him if they come around in my area after all they are one of the best bands ever and if they come out with a bad album it's whatever I still have all their old albums which I'll still love the same so yeah bands reuniting forever [Music] [Music] 
kIsQuDkqXX0,[Music] hey gods anthony Fantana you're the internet's busiest music nerd and i'm sad cuz my favorite band broke up I mean I mean they just broke up they made some of the best records in the genre style that they played in and then they and they and they had tons and tons of fans why would they break up they probably had like 56 good full-length albums left in them and twice as many great EPS maybe there was some inner tension between band members or some kind of extraneous issues that we will never fully understand either way if anybody knows when the band really should break up it's the band you know at least they're not trying to force chemistry that's not actually there and just putting out one album after another kind of getting progressively worse and worse just because they've got no other things going on and speaking of other things going on there will always be side projects this particular band that I was very fond of that just broke up their drummer has a really cool ambient hip-hop project going on the guitarist is involved in in this trio that plays a fusion of power electronics and jazz and the lead singer is in a really awesome acapella power violence quintet if the musicians in the band that's breaking up still love music they will channel their creative endeavors into projects that they like more projects they're more passionate about the best we can do is just grow with them and whether we like the material they end up putting out or not just accept the change because let's face it sometimes side projects and solo efforts are pretty friggin good and you know isn't it awesome when a group or an artist really takes about on a high note like LCD soundsystem or sleater-kinney no matter how passionate you are about a group or a musician it's best to just kind of let go of the past and let these things run their course artists evolve and so should our ears but whether we like it or not artistic evolution is inevitable when we try to stop it you get really weird situations going on like that Velvet Underground record squeeze although sometimes an attempt at stopping evolution does kind of have it's interesting effects like groups such as napalm death or the fall that have a constant rotating cast of new musicians but not every band is going to be that way bands are going to break up and sometimes those bands that are breaking up are going to be your favorite bands but it's okay there will be other bands and other records I love New Horizons new futures sunny days bands break up forever [Music] 
uOqCnL0MEPw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album really related whatever album review Loma Prieta I V these guys are a California band fourth full-length album and the this group has undergone quite a bit of change to be playing with the sound that they currently are no matter which loma album you're talking about the band's heart has always been pretty sentimental towards screamo and hardcore punk and now more than ever this bands take on screamo music is extremely raw and uncompromising coming off as intense and passionate as some of the best albums in this genre created by bands like let's say page 99 who represent really the more extreme side of things now this bands early work was intense as well but definitely more accessible the group's first two lp's definitely had much more clarity to them clearer guitar chords maybe some clean singing - I was even catching some vocal harmonies on the second LP I guess overall with those albums there was a clearer balance between the abrasive sounds and the pleasant sounds but as the band progressed past those two LPs they've just been getting harsher and harsher and now on this album right here I think they're performing tracks with their harshest sound yet it is very very nasty and these guys accomplished this nasty goal by blending screamo and poor Punk with with other styles of music like noise there are some spots on here that kind of hit me as being sort of very powerful ensuite very punked-out riffs and blast beats and some of the riffs on here just feel really sludgy really thick and powering some tastefully performed breakdowns but even with all these extreme sounds all of this discord these guys still managed to find a way to put just some gorgeous musical ideas into these tracks the opening track here starts off with these pounding headache pounding drums and these screams the way that dude the frontman in this group screams by the end of this album er just maybe at the end of a show his voice his vocal cords have got to be feeling like he swallowed a bunch of ghost chilies or like some molten lava or something his vocals just are so heavy with these painful emotions and the vocals together with the bass the guitar and the drums they're all so loud together and packed so tightly into this small sonic space it's kind of claustrophobic the music is right on top of me and there's just no getting away this album can be just as harsh at times as some of the most lo-fi black metal albums out there or even like a converge album toward the middle of this opening track there is kind of this quiet break and then the song busts into these really kind of harmonious guitar chords they're really triumphant they're really beautiful they're still played at an ear-shattering volume but I love how pretty these guitar chords are and how they finish off this track with a kind of positive note and that's kind of where this LP finds its success just violently smashing together ugly and and beauty without even worrying about the consequences and then just kind of counting the casualties after that I think the next two tracks are some of the most unforgiving on this album a bit of a blur for me but they're still thrilling enough to carry me to the next three tracks which are kind of a trilogy some blast beats make their way onto these tracks just shots of feedback and these really kind of paranoia powered guitar leads but my favorite in this trilogy has got to be the final track it has to be the hardest and harshest track on this LP the riffs are as deadly as the Death Star and when this band flows into the breakdown toward the end of this song they really kind of groove it out they let it play out and as they're playing it the production the recording just starts getting louder just more saturated more distorted and it continues in this direction until it basically becomes a wall of almost complete noise it's almost like the music is so extreme it's just disintegrating before my ears it's just a real show of just spiteful bleak nihilistic feelings now funny enough after this track all the songs start showcasing a lot more harmony in the guitars in the guitars at least that's what I'm kind of picking up but the guitar chords just start feeling much more mournful much darker and it really kind of takes the aggression that the band has been building up to this point and starts mixing all this sadness into it all of a sudden clenched fists look teary eyes the eighth track uniform has some really anthemic chords and for lack of a better word catchy vocals the track after that has a really kind of forceful driving rhythm that I love and the track after that aside from this distant chatter there is nothing left one of my favorites on this LP actually is a song in three I love it when a band can play with a really extreme sound but still rock a tune in three timing and the way they break the rhythm up in that time signature with this track is really kind of unexpected kind of progressive on the second-to-last track there are these breaks of clean guitar chords that are kind of dark just shining out and the final song here is is loud but it's much slower and kind of feels like the quiet after this really intense storm just this wasteland is left after all of these extremely tortured and just voluminous screamo songs at this point I have heard 12 tracks and they've just flown by in 24 minutes you know I think aggressive music is is great no matter what genre you're making it in because let's face it aggression is not limited to this kind of music but if you can mix aggression with other feelings and emotions creatively almost in a way where it's kind of seamless you're going to end up with a more interesting album you're going to end up with an album with a more powerful emotional impact you're going to end up with an album that appeals to people on more emotional levels aside from writing fantastic songs that's what I feel like this album does that is the core of this LP for me raw unadulterated sadness but that sadness is is put together with this anger that sometimes makes this album alienating ly harsh it's not like the music here is switching sides between being pretty being lab being pretty being loud it mixes them both together at the same time forming them to just coexist I know I love this but still the volume and the abrasiveness of this album does make me wonder if other people will follow me on this one kind of feeling a strong eight to a light nine on this helpI it was a great listen and can't wait to listen to it more in the very near future but what do you guys think of this LP love it hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana Loma Prieta forever [Music] [Music] 
wktzFuTHqls,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review John Talbot Finn John is an electronic music producer from Spain and this is his debut LP but the first time I ever ran into him was last year when he released an EP by the name of families with a badass gorilla on the cover and an even more badass title track that featured Glasser on vocals really great beats and grooves throughout I didn't review it and I actually forgot to include it in my favorite EPS of 2011 list because sometimes I just okay but that's all in the past and now I have this new album on my plate and I had high expectations going into this thing because I liked the material on that previous EP so much and I gotta say John delivers now if you listen to this thing you're just gonna get one track after another of dance tunes that are just really sexy they are groovin but not too hard not too aggressive a lot of just experimental and micro house tunes lots of really straightforward repetitive beats atmospheric effects slow patient builds just always looking for different ways to evolve you know just elements that a good house album should should have in my opinion but what I like most is the variety of sounds and ideas that John is able to bring to this LP while kind of sticking to those themes lots of repetition lots of smooth atmospheric sounds this album starts with what I think is one of the best opening tracks of this year it really kind of sets up the dark sexy and silky sounds that kind of flow throughout this LP the build on this opening track is especially subtle I think the most subtle on this entire LP once it kind of builds up to its peak the rhythm hits me so hard I just have to thank evolution that I have thumbs to snap along I just want to go there are all these panoramic jungle sounds surrounding the music and as the track progresses more percussion sounds are popping up left and right it's you know kind of becoming a little electronic drum circle and I love it and these heavenly background vocals are in the mix this really kind of warm round synthesized bassline it is bliss the second track hits me with another great groove and a vocal feature from a singer who's actually featured on the last track of this thing too and the singing takes the inherently sexy sound and just magnifies it especially when the vocals just get kind of tightly layered like multi-tracked on top of each other for these really kind of quick shots of chorus those two tracks and and and all the other best songs on here do kind of feature that just repetitive ever-evolving groove formula a lot like caribou or for Tet or Nicholas jar or mmm Panther do prints his grooves on this LP are so great when you get into them you just get lost in them and for me it's just easy to forget that I'm listening to a producer as opposed to a band order especially since all the early atmospheric sounds on on the synthesizers on the samples and the and the percussion some of which sounds like is sampled hand percussion it just feels so live the track last land has these really kind of pitch shifted vocal samples and what sounds like either either a string sample or a synth sample or a guitar being sampled as well it's a nice to the various sounds that the John throws into this LP around these evolving beats the track when the pass becomes the present kind of indulges it a little bit of nostalgia it drops another one of these beats but the music surrounding it just kind of ends up making this track feel like a song that could have been dropped either at the tail end of the 80s or at the beginning of the 90s to be played in the club and the track horse has these really sporadic rhythms in it that really kind of makes it feel like kind of a footwork song but the rhythm isn't as loud as it usually would be in that style of electronic music it's very very quiet very understated and kind of dark and eerie because of it some of the songs on here are kind of short and don't really evolve as much as others but still kind of add an interesting sound to this LP like the third track which the rhythm on that song isn't really straight forward is really repetitive because I feel like John spends a lot of time on that track kind of improving the rhythm throughout the track against these swirling synth arpeggios that are just running in circles and kind of speeding up and slowing down and reversing it gives me a really kind of woozy feeling and the eighth track on here kind of feels like a really lucid poppy synthesizer beat that I could see an artist like Neon Indian or Toro y Moi singing over where this LP really gets kind of dicey for me is toward the middle the fourth track has a really great groove but doesn't really come across with a strong flavor like a lot of the other songs on here do it just kind of has this one muddy synth chord progression and it just doesn't do all that much for me the song missing you has a nice groove too but where it kind of puts me on the fence is with these vocals these vocals that have been run through so many effects they're mutated beyond belief and it ends up making them sound really kind of odd and dissonant and glitchy and yet again in a way it's kind of an interesting sound how did that sound come about I don't know I wondering but then again do I really love listening to it hmm I'm not sure but my least favorite track on here is is definitely the song journeys which sticks out like a sore thumb not only because it sounds different than all the other tracks it's way more upbeat and fruity has kind of a fruity quality to it but the vocal feature on that track not only does a sound like panda bear but it's not even like a good impersonation of panda bear it's really kind of off pitch at a lot of moments in that song it's not even just the way this singer is singing it's also the reverb effects that john chooses to put on these vocals and how he multi-tracks them too that makes them sound kind of just like a leftover piece of Meriweather post pavilion worship from 2009 2010 aside from a few tracks I'm not too hot on I thought this helped he was a great debut for John he does a fantastic job of highlighting the importance of a great groove and a nice slow build in terms of the kinds of emotions and moods that I'm getting from these songs this album jumps around a little bit kind of making for a little of an inconsistent listen but I still feel like most of the songs on here are so well put together I just can't not celebrate them feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this album loved it thought it was great but what do you think of this thing have you heard it if you have do you like it do you hate it why and what should I review next you have any Fantana bean bread ooh that's not good 
13HJ1xnpdpQ,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd here to do the segment on this channel that feels most like public service why you know review hosted by Cal Church esta Thank You Anthony account your chest to hear roommate of the Internet's nerd who is busy and we in Y you know review ask Anthony why he has seemed to not review a certain number of artists who were probably pretty well deserving so to a start this questionnaire forum why you know review the new ish wrasse hostages yeah that a new Azeroth mixtape perhaps to jazz um it seems a lot of people really genuinely excited over this mixtape genuinely excited over Asher Roth kind of evolving himself into something that's a little more underground hip hop friendly and I'm happy that he's relying on his mic skills a little bit more now then he is his kind of white college kid stick and it seems like he's getting a lot of respect from his peers to from the really nice features on this mixtape Chuck Inglish is on here Action Bronson POC div chip the Ripper 2 and blue and kind of speaking of blue how Azeroth is kind of evolved he reminds me of blue a little bit now more than he ever has just kind of laid-back relying a lot more on the rhymes to kind of carry the playful attitude of these songs but in comparison with blue and just all MCS Azeroth doesn't really say much that gets my gears turning in my brain there are lots of really kind of quirky suburban can cull two references throughout this mixtape like stick Stickley for example but this tape overall is just not blowing my mind I think it's okay and a lot of the beats production from from blended babies on this thing is pretty good so yeah you know I'm just pretty much on the fence with the tape okay I'll let you have that decision um hurry why you know review the new Kade at grammar knifes Green grammar knives uh yeah that new kolp gamma knife if you're not familiar with these guys they're a rock band that combines elements of chamber music jazz metal avant-garde and progressive rock and I wasn't that into their last LP and I was hoping this new album would kind of you know give me a new reason to be excited over them but that just didn't happen and I feel like this LP is well intentioned it tries to be experimental it tries to be out there I definitely like the intro track that has these really beautifully layered strings really well put together and that song just really gets my ears watering for what's gonna come next and then the album just goes downhill fast in my opinion most of the remaining tracks on this LP are so messily put together messily mixed messily recorded it's difficult making heads or tails of some of these songs especially the second track which is just unintelligible it's extremely difficult to decipher and I'm sure with repeated listens I could but there's nothing about it sound wise or or writing wise that's really hitting me as saying hey you know what you need to dig deeper into this there are all these really cool nooks and crannies below all this fuzz and noise when this album gets loud all the sounds just kind of drown each other out they don't create this one rush of exciting volume this LP is just kind of lo-fi and not even really low find an interesting or or noisy or kind of challenging way it just kind of comes off as bland kind of dull just kind of kind of kind of kind of no I wasn't into this LP there are some bright spots some shots of horns some really intense drum playing here and there but the mix the recording just makes it feel like a demo most of the time just not fully realized well you know that's weird because I know you're experimental you know you oh it's next fer mental enough but alright I know you like hip-hop and you didn't review this album uh come on believe in the dream sometimes I really think you're joking or I hope you're joking um yeah common the dreamer the believer a lot of people have asked me hey Anthony why haven't you reviewed this album from one of hip-hop's most revered figures the mastermind behind such hip-hop classics as B resurrection and Like Water for Chocolate partially it was because this LP came out at the end of the year in December partially it was because this album kind of came out in the midst of me reviewing a bunch of classic albums during the week when I might have had a chance to review it but it was mostly because I wasn't into it I feel like this LP is better than Commons last album which kind of had these beats that took a turn for a more electronic sound that did not sit well with a lot of people the instrumentals on here in contrast are much more jazzy soulful a lot of hard hard edge beats more what you would expect from a common album but the biggest reason I listen to common is not his instrumentals it's his thought provoking lyricism we know that's why he's such a great hip-hop figure we know that's why he has had so much staying power as an emcee but I don't feel like this album offers that poignant or thought-provoking lyricism up a lot of songs on here we're just kind of obsessed with Commons celebrity status kind of braggadocious which isn't bad in principle but it's just not a suit I see fitting common all that well and there are some songs on here like sweet that are so aggressive and in-your-face it actually became kind of funny hearing common rap about how he's real hip-hop and telling other people yeah motherfucker fuck it was just really over-the-top and kind of ridiculous and the mere fact that comment is kind of beefing with Drake to me kind of shows how far he's fallen status wise because why would Drake even register on Commons radar I know that they're both hip-hop artists but they're not even playing the game the same way seeing common call out Drake is like seeing a basketball player call out a golfer I thought the intro to this LP was pretty amazing with some poetry some spoken word from Maya Angelou talking about fixing the future with dreams with brighter dreams bigger dreams more hope but the second track ghetto Dreams doesn't really dream all that bright at all it's the dream of getting with a really hot woman who's going to take care of the kids cook and want to have sex a lot apparently these bright dreams don't apply to females overall I just kind of felt like this rawr and more aggressive side of common was kind of generic and not believable okay you know your your opinion all right why you know review why you know review enter Zachary flashy colors yeah Enter Shikari a flash-flood of color I got a surprisingly large amount of requests for this album I had no clue there were so many fans of this band sort of watching what I do yeah wasn't into this LP sadly they're an English band that combines elements of metalcore post-hardcore and electronica this is their third LP working with this sound too and in my opinion the whole thing is just really kind the tacky there are some heavy scents on here that kind of remind me of dubstep at times some beats that remind me of drum and bass or brake core but even with these elements these tracks aren't really all that different from your run-of-the-mill metalcore post-hardcore it's just that they're surrounded by these electronic beats and build ups that occasionally make these songs kind of flow like an electret retro song I feel like metal and electronics can and have work together really well in the past but the way these guys do it is akin to how Lincoln Park combines metal and hip-hop they might as well be dipping French fries into strawberry jam or something some of the electronic sounds on this LP are decent but the metalcore and post-hardcore side of things just feels kind of thrown together and unimaginative alright yeah okay let's let's wrap it up here last one why you know review the presses to double crest double um yeah the new crosses EP a lot of people are kind of freaking out a bit as to why I haven't reviewed either of the two EPS to drop from this new kind of electronica and alternative rock project fronted by chino moreno of the Deftones you know the first EP I felt like it had some pretty decent songs on there although the electronics on there felt kind of I guess generic I felt like this new EP had a little bit more variety the first track kind of comes through with an alternative rock sound some pretty heavy guitars and the electronics on the following tracks felt a little richer but overall this EP to me just kind of ends up sounding like Deftones style songwriting with New Wave instrumentation I think it's something that's really only going to appeal to Chino fans I'm sure some people will hear the really kind of paced and slow songs that these guys pull together on here and see them as passion in it but in my opinion they just kind of drag on I don't think it's that moody or that dark or that brooding there's just nothing emotionally about these songs that really appeal to me sorry excuse me there is a link to a blog post on the needle drop com below this video doing a series of short reviews on other albums that I actually was not able to review this past month those are going to kind of come up on the screen right now um listen you really need to get your act together because you're uh you're really terrible at this I've tried my hardest here all right I don't want an excuse which we're trying to be sort of semi sort of maybe possibly professional here and you're the weak link in the chain at them you know maybe if I had a little positive 'ti coming from this direction well everything would be a lot better come together a lot smoother smoother sailing through the ships you know they say a boat whatever floats your boat forever [Music] [Music] 
Hll4l4aAyhY,ha hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review the maccabees given to the wild the Maccabees are an English indie rock outfit this is their third full-length album this is the first time I'm sitting down with a full-length LP of theirs and considering all of the really excited comments that kind of pushed this album onto my plate I was hoping this help he would be a better introduction to the band I really was not big on this album honestly it made me kind of go back to listen to this band's older material and made me wish that 2007's colored-in was my first impression with these guys if you haven't checked out this album please do it is fast it is nimble it is catchy it's just vibrant with energy very kind of easy to get into and nice and memorable indie rock with a sort of post-punk edge to it it hits kind of hard but feels really nice - like the Arctic Monkeys did when they first debuted but since that LP The Maccabees have taken a turn into territory I'm just not big on I wasn't big on it with other albums and I just wasn't big on it here on given to the wild what the Maccabees have done is basically stripped their music of any and all Punk energy and smooth the production out to the point where it is so reverb it is so glossy a lot of these songs just kind of feel really understated they come off is just not being all that memorable in a way it actually kind of reminds me of what foals and and horrors did with their latest LPS how they really got their production much smoother much more glossed out and toned their eccentricities down a lot I know those bands have different songwriting styles than the Maccabees I actually think on this LP the Maccabee have some pretty progressive song structures here and there some of these songs really explode with a lot of color but I think this LP like those two other albums do share a common understated vocals lots of gloss lots of reverb style they're just a lot of songs here that don't feel that bold don't have that much impact to them and I guess I'm not looking for them to to be really hard or really aggressive or anything like that I feel like there are tracks on here that display more personality than others I think the first time the cell P really hit me with one of its songs is the track Pelican which has this really clear rhythm these bright group vocals and those two things together just cut through the effects surrounding these songs and just really delivered a strong personality the song went away had a lot of momentum coming from the drums the song go was really heavy heavy and and FEM ik and the song unknown kind of progresses into these really really tight tight guitars and drums that are fast too in such a way that it kind of reminds me of like Maserati or like the last battles album a little bit and the last track on here just has a huge finish just explodes and is kind of triumphant and when this album hits those highs I could definitely see why it's appealing to a lot of people but in my opinion this thing is definitely kind of back-loaded because the song sometimes gets way more entertaining toward the end of this album I just feel like a good chunk of this LP was was kind of putting me to sleep you know and that the music on here was was terrible or offensive definitely not the case I just think this album was looking for beauty in in some of the wrong places it had some really good arrangements at some points but just slathered itself in so much atmosphere that it just kind of lost its form lost its body and I feel like the really understated vocals on a lot of these songs kind of contributed to that when it comes to something really grabbing whether it's because it's beautiful or because it has a lot of energy I'm gonna look to their previous two LPs for that kind of feeling a strong five to ally six on this thing but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantana The Maccabees 
mzyin0buNks,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review lana del rey born to die Lana Del Rey is an American singer-songwriter formerly known as Lizzie grant or Lana Del Rey with an A in the Rey instead of an e and this is her sophomore LP born to die and this is an LP that came after an image reinvention for Lana her debut LP came out in 2010 and went under the radar big-time but now she's back with a new look and new singles new album new music video and this complete unknown has blown up to a surprisingly huge level of popularity and most of this happened on the back of the buzz of one single song the first single from the LP video games it came out last year premiered as a YouTube video a music video loaded with footage of Lana Del Rey sexily lip-synching into a webcam spliced together with footage of couples and skaters and skylines and you know just a bunch of stuff for dramatic emotional effect it seemed really DIY but when you think about it the production of the music really did overshadow that of the video you know with the harps and the strings and the piano and the really kind of nice glamorous reverb over everything and shortly after video games kind of blew up Lana was making all of these European television appearances and it all kind of seemed like magic until people found out that it was Universal Music Group that was actually going to be releasing her forthcoming LP through itself and its subsidiaries Polydor and Interscope so I guess with major label support some PR a viral video and a sexy image built on Nancy Sinatra inspired nostalgia you can get exposure just about everywhere and of course this put a really nasty taste in a lot of people's mouths saying ooh Lana's contrived Lana's fake Lana's manufactured and you know I think it's a little silly because there are a lot of artists on major labels that get praised in the indie blogosphere and they rely on image too so I don't totally see the issue from that angle honestly but still this is the kind of backlash that happens when a musical product I thought relies on its image more than it does the music you know image is part of promoting music it's not going anywhere and it doesn't have to as long as the images come together with the music in an artful way instead of a deceptive way people are naturally curious about the people who are making the music that they listen to they want to see them they want to get to know them but since day one the Lana Del Rey PR campaign has been 95% image music videos TV appearances photoshoots and magazine covers interviews and controversy most of what has come out of this PR campaign has been stuff like that not like songs and I think it turned around and bit everybody in the but when Lana Del Rey did her biggest TV appearance yet on Saturday Night Live and she pretty much bombed she was off pitch she had like no charisma and her vocals were just kind of goofy and you know I have to ask was bombing really out of character for her I think the SNL performance exposed Lana to a group of people who had no exposure to her or the blog buzz that she wrote in on and because of that they were less forgiving and they expressed that on every social media platform that's out there and the people that had been praising her up until this point couldn't ignore the fact that hey you know what this just was up to par but with these people who didn't like Lana's SNL performance would they have liked her other performances in my opinion she was kind of flat and mumbly and just boring on Jools Holland and her German TV appearance wasn't all that pretty either her singing on record to me is way more OnPoint more emotive and speaking of the record we do have to talk about that you know it's been a really fun buzz ride but we're at our last stop born to die so what does an album living up to this massive hype have to offer some stuff you know honestly I think it tries it tries really hard but it comes up a little short when it comes to substance Born To Die does have an interesting and kind of fresh approach to baroque pop though lots of lavishly produce strings in every direction really pretty and fine delicate sounds it's just like an ocean of instrumentation washing over my ears over and over and over and kind of lulling me into this really kind of sonic seduction and sometimes the string arrangements are really ambitious they really enhance a track like the introduction to born to die or the song Lolita those intros with those strings are pretty beautiful and the strings do a great job of helping out with the climaxes on these songs like how Born To Die explodes toward the end what kind of makes this baroque pop approach kind of kind of fresh is all the beats behind these tracks which are clearly hip-hop influenced especially with the NPC style base hits and chopped and loop vocals pretty much every track on here goes for this mashup of this baroque pop style with a sort of old aesthetic to a certain nostalgia 50s 60s aesthetic with these modern hip-hop rhythms and beats I think it's an angle not a lot of people are doing these days and I do admire this album for that at least still it's kind of a style I get sick of by the end of the LP because the strings while they are nice they do enhance some of these songs they get to be kind of just just too much for me I feel like too often strings in general are used to give us on depth and emotion and importance and just this feeling of epicness but the thing is no matter how much air freshener you spray eventually you're going to smell the crap after a while I just kind of feel like I'm listening to the soundtrack to a Disney movie or a perfume commercial they're just too many instances here where I feel like I'm hearing the strings more than I am Lana's vocals or the song itself I just feel like the arrangements get boring after a while and there's really no escaping them but then again I feel like taking the strings away would strip this album of what little appeal it has this album relied on the vocals to deliver the emotion and the depth and the epicness those feelings just would not be here for one I can't get into the lyrics or the story that this album throws out there I feel like Lana has this little black book of lyrical cliche is that she calls on whenever she needs to write a song and they just kind of assemble into this tapestry that are her verses and choruses heartbreaks born to die loving you till the end of time tears eyes walk on the wild side you're no good for me light of my life holding me tight kiss me hard in the pouring rain get out of this town these kinds of phrases have been said so many times that they've pretty much lost all meaning all real meaning and it's not like Lana is reinventing them to mean something different or mean something new either but the biggest cliche that this album is obsessed with is the bad girl cliche ooh bad girls Lana's portrayal of a bad girl is the most shallow thing on this album this album's definition of being a bad girl is smoking and drinking partying staying up all night and being objectified by and lovesick over the men that Lana is attractive to they're really what a bad girl is is that how this generation is rebelling because if that's the case then Ke$ha is a revolutionary viva la revolucion ah ah when it comes to being a bad girl I wish this album took a little more influence from Nancy Sinatra who obviously influences the image behind born to die but not really the message Nancy Sinatra musically was a serious badass she had her vulnerable moments like the song bang bang but the songs that she put out that were her biggest were the ones where she was the heartbreaker and she got revenge on the people who broke her heart songs like these boots were made for walking I'm not the loving kind sorry about that how does that grab you these are songs where Nancy Sinatra was owning her womanhood and being in control of herself and her feelings and what she was going to do with her life in a time when that was not really a mainstream idea in contrast Lana's biggest song is about trying to please and seduce her video-game-playing boyfriend which is kind of funny when you think about it I'm curious as to how this album makes women feel especially when a song like this is what makes us girls comes up where that idea of partying and staying up lay in skipping school and underage drinking is kind of reinforced as being bad so yeah I think the message here is kind of off it's misguided and if it is well intentioned that's not really communicated that well but if this album was a bunch of tracks that that were like born to die in blue jeans and video games I think this might have been a pretty decent LP because on record Lana Del Rey's voice for the most part is on pitch and those tracks are just pretty catchy but instead of sticking with the the precedent set by those tracks Lana starts venturing out of the comfort zones of the people who have been hearing those tracks and I think her own comfort zone the song off to the races is kind of loaded with the really goofy vocalizations that did not go over well on the Sandell performance and the song Diet Mountain Dew sounds like the soda tastes that track is just so straightforward and heavy with it's rhythms it doesn't really have the finesse or the delicate approach that make all the other tracks so appealing the song national anthem actually has lana del rey like rapping and it's kind of awkward and the song lolita is is almost the trashy radio pop that Lana Del Rey has been promoted as the antithesis to there are some songs on here that I actually admire for kind of almost becoming something I love like the song Carmen I think that track has a beautiful vocal melody and it's about the closest this album comes to really kind of capturing that Nancy Sinatra style in a tasteful way between the cheap lyrics and there's the overproduced music and the and the kind of confusing message this album is just kind of a bunch of songs that could have been really good but they just end up being kind of ruined they add up to something that just does not have a lot of lasting power I think this album is an interesting take on baroque pop it has some pretty melodies and production but it doesn't really go beyond that it's nothing that I'd want to return to kind of feeling a strong three to a light four on this thing but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantino Lana Del Rey forever I love you Vimeo games 
zzcYRFAGfJE,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and making a video to ask you a question so let's say you make music let's say you produce music yourself when is music you made not yours answer when universal music says that it's theirs okay so late last year I blogged about a little EP kind of a mini album from an R&B / kind of hip hop outfit called after the smoke the EP is titled was white girls and red velvet cake and there were a couple really good tracks on the EP didn't love the whole thing but still some standout songs and one of the standout songs on the on the release is a track called one-in-a-million or oh I am produced by the group after the smoke and doesn't sound like there are any samples in the track either Justin really kind of chilled out since and some drum sequencing now in 2010 the duo actually opened up for yellow wolf and they traded some emails talked a little bit and we're planning on featuring him on a track maybe even on that one-in-a-million beat but things kind of fell through once he got signed on to Shady Records so in 2011 after the smoke actually drops the album but recently as recent as this month yellow wolf and a group of emcees that he works with came out with a track with that beat that was originally on that after the smoke album it wasn't a copy it wasn't a reproduction it was the actual beat not that that's a bad thing though because this is kind of a recurring practice in the hip-hop industry during the Internet age if you go on websites like DJ booth or datpiff or any website that houses a lot of hip-hop especially underground hip hop mixtapes you're gonna see everybody is rapping over everybody else's beats it's a system that kind of works as long as the MCS or whoever is lifting the beat for the purpose of a mixtape or a new single gives production credits somewhere on a website or along with the track title just so that people know where the beats are coming from so this yellow wolf track featuring the after the smoke beat I guess leaked or just got released without any production credits whatsoever which is the biggest problem in the world what's kind of a bigger issue is that now when after the smoke tries putting this song up on YouTube they're getting takedown notices saying that Universal actually owns the rights to the song that they created and they've tried appealing to YouTube to saying hey you know we actually own the rights to this song but because the Universal has more say than they do they've basically been told that yeah you know we're we're rejecting your appeal now in the end do I think yellow wolf is wrong you know I'm not completely sure because one of the emcees that appeared on the track Ritz actually came forward explained the track as being a leak wasn't intentional it's possible as far as I know the track is not on a mixtape or being sold in any way and from what I understand yellow Wolf's management also explained this to after the smoke as well still I think it's important that when you use an artist song even if you don't plan on releasing it or something like that it's you know good to do your best to contact that person just to let them know it's happened I think it's best to kind of handle these things on a case-by-case basis what gets things really screwed up is when media companies and labels end up getting involved and then claim that they own the rights to something that they really don't honestly I think Universal and whoever is working on their copyrights is who's messed up here big time and what's even funnier is that these media companies are working to shove copyright and intellectual property law legislation down our throats but they're being pretty lazy and irresponsible when it comes to respecting other people's copyrights the internet is just kind of this free schoolyard of ideas and everybody's trading ideas everybody's sharing and using one another's ideas but media companies are kind of coming up and being bullies about who can and who can't use the ideas that they make and then they want to come up and then kind of use the stuff that that we're making and we're sharing and it's not cool like that that was shown again this week when Disney dropped that Joy Division t-shirt which they ended up pulling production on because they did not check with any of the remaining members of Joy Division as to whether or not they would be able to create such a shirt actually it's been pretty recent where no agent Kings of Leon kind of had a shirt beef going and same thing with Akron family and Mann is the bastard over using their logo in one of Akron family's new t-shirts you know the thing is I don't think the law needs to be brought into every single one of these cases if in fact an artist is borrowing an idea from another artist borrowing happens in a lot of ways like no age didn't borrow tons of musical ideas from Sonic Youth to make their records what I think is important from here on out is just to let people know when you're gonna be borrowing something of theirs to create something new nobody needs to get shamed as long as they tell people where the inspiration for an idea came from going into the future people are just gonna learn to share these ideas more and more the issue I have right now is mostly with media companies who expect their ideas not to be borrowed while they have the ability to freely borrow everyone else's there are some articles and interviews and just internet posts down below this video just sort of linking to information in regards to this Yelawolf Universal after the smoke issue let me know what you think of this situation do you love it do you hate it why and what should I talk about review thane comment question next anthony Fantana 
dHOHrx-p9sc,hi here Anthony everyone Fantana for and album time review nehru teams jackets teams or Himanshu is a new york MC and a part of the rap outfit - racist and dance racist put out a couple solid mixtapes in 2010 that i enjoyed a lot and they spent 2011 releasing their official full-length debut relax if you see my reviews you already know that I love the tapes I mean even Cal loved the tapes I eat it pizza I ate it Taco Bell I ate it pizza a Taco Bell we loved the beats we loved the personalities that heenes and Victor Vasquez showed off in their mic skills their verses are always loaded with very witty rhymes hyper self-aware and hyper referential non sequiturs and they just have this magical ability to be joking but also not joking at the same time but the LP they dropped relax you know I reviewed it and it just didn't do a lot for me even though some of my favorite tracks of last year on that thing now it's 2012 and - racist members and emcees kind of related to the record label that they started greed head are dropping mixtapes Victor Vasquez dropped under the name cool ad which I I wasn't huge on but this second tape the second - racist related tape a man shoes neighbor jackets it's caught my attention and it caught my attention because it scratches all of the very much needing to be scratched pitches that the tapes did lots of jokes lots of material you know nobody is in a rush to get through the 70 minutes of music that is on Nehru jackets and it's not like he was just jerking off on this tape a lot of the jokes that he makes on this thing add up too clever and thought-provoking satire dealing with drugs race gender police technology food movies music war and politics the tape makes me laugh the tape makes me think and throws a lot of great beats out to in the process the beats on this thing come from producer Mike finito who actually raps on one of the tracks and his production on this thing brought this project a lot of consistency just huge fantastically huge and booming bass drums and samples that sound like they're they're lifting music from from Indian music - racist is always really good about throwing race in your face just to make you think about it and they've done it musically in the past - but on this tape it's it's just brought to another level the coca-cola freestyle bangles women parts 1 & 2 sweet all of these tracks and more on here sample at least one or two pieces of music that have a foreign flavor to them actually there are even some verses on this tape that aren't even wrapped in English and I don't understand them and I'm sure he knows that most of his listeners aren't going to understand them either but it's just another way that this tape throws race and foreign cultures into your consciousness as far as other features on this tape go some of the best and brightest of the underground MCS that blew up last year get featured on this thing mr. X Choir Action Bronson Danny Brown despot big baby Gandhi of course cool ad from - racist is on here and even childish gambino is featured on a verse that I actually liked but let's go back to the beats because some of the instrumentals on here are so good they really kind of made this album for me I love the cold and chilly soulful vocals sampled on bad bad bad they just add the perfect piece of atmosphere to that track just making it feel kind of sleek and sexy the track alien Gonzalez I can be wrong but it just kind of like its sampling like this Bollywood music these little symbols and these just falsetto female vocals it's really spicy it grooves like a hip-hop track but all these foreign sounds just make it feel exciting and fresh the tracks weight has easily one of the best grooves on this entire tape and I love the loud booming and aggressive direction the tape goes in with the baby track NYC cops I love the electronics rumbling in the background of you have to ride the wave it actually features Danny Brown and kind of feels like an instrumental one of the more electronic instrumentals from his tape xxx the beyond women has a really kind of cute light-hearted feel to it that matches the the lovestruck lyrics in the song and the track it's the drug has this really kind of sexy quality to it featuring these sensual female vocals and really kind of painting the kind of alluring picture that people usually equate with drugs the versatility is incredible and he kind of proves himself to be just as versatile as the production itself I actually think he knows himself off to be more versatile here than he did on the - racist album and mixtapes with a victor kind of playing this laid-back blunted role he's was usually much more kind of in-your-face and aggressive and lively on neighbor jackets though he pretty much tries to play every position on the field with at least one track going from really kind of hard aggressive and critical on NYC cops - feeling kind of so sleepy and blunted on suede sometimes he's rapping about his junk food addiction sometimes he's rapping about being in love sometimes he's just going all out and getting ridiculous and kind of rapping from the point of view of Jason Bourne from the Bourne Identity my only real issue on this tape is that there are a lot of tracks on here under two minutes that don't really have a topic or a subject matter and they just kind of end up feeling like a bit of filler even if they aren't nice to listen to as you're gliding through the entire tape but outside of that I love the songs on here the hooks are great productions on point the features are really great teams flow is always changing up and his bars are pretty complex sometimes this is you know don't let the really casual and thrown together sound of his voice throw you off I thought neighbor jackets was really fun just loaded with personality I just wish relax was as awesome to listen to but what are you gonna do I'm feeling a light eight on this thing loved it gonna be listening to it again in the near future but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana teams forever 
fUYvPM4dYBo,pop 1280 whore the heart the whore are Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd here's coucher chess to say anything I'm Cal Cheech esta and I'm saying a thing hey Chad yes it's time for an album review pop 1280 the horror pop or population 1280 is a New York band making its full-length debut this year on sacred bones records and if you end up checking this LP out expect some really bleak and abrasive noise rock tracks there have been a lot of different shades and interpretations of noise rock over the years some of it as fast aggressive and simple as the punk rock that inspired it at its roots while other bands really kind of strive for something much RTR much more thought-provoking much deeper you know groups like Sonic Youth and population 1280 plays both sides of the field but they do kind of stick to that RT or more abstract side of things they just work to put together a lot of Irian and unsettling atmospheres around these tracks i would say some moments on here even kind of border on goth rock especially tracks like beg like a human which has some pretty kinky lyrics overall they're aiming for something kind of disturbing and most of the time they hit the nail on its head with all these really tinny and distorted sharp ear piercing guitars really pounding drums with lots of just bounce and reverb on them base that is kind of warm kind of Milky but also kind of Airy spectral its kind of ghost-like it isn't really up front in the mix a lot of the time it's a weird bass mix it's kind of buried in everything but it's always there it's kind of like now you hear me now you don't I'm the base it's just got this kind of distant quality to it there are an array of different noises and effects throughout this LP and some synthesizers pop up here and there too these guys just gather all these sounds and put a huge gigantic spotlight on them making it difficult to concentrate on on much of anything else just focusing on ugliness pop 1280 is definitely making noise rock kind of something to gawk at again they're good round trying to make it the the unnerving freak show it used to be with some really noisy sounds and dark lyrics lots of violence and nooses and dead bodies and fire and a lot of mentions of dogs in the lyrics to dog screwing dogs begging dog boy is the title of another track and the vocals delivering these lyrics are just kind of frantic kind of reminds me actually of nick cave's early stuff from the birthday party except way way way way way more accessible because no matter how noisy these guys get they never really lose sight of being a rock band with verses and choruses and beats it's just kind of orchestrated chaos this is a symbol of that and in that respect they do kind of remind me here and there of swans early work because they're really trying to just do noise in a big dramatic at a dramatic and ugly way and I also like that pop 1280 tries to pack each song with some different noises and sounds to really make some contrast between the tracks here like the robot vocals on cyclotron or the pulsating synthesizers that pop up on crime time the saw and hang them high has easily the the harshest shots of guitar distortion on the entire album and the song Nature Boy just says he's really thick huge distorted bass riffs and the whole album together is just this giant banging clanging steaming screeching noise rock machine that just sounds really kind of tortured grimy rusty I do have some complaints about this thing though the vocals are where I easily get bored with this LP they just don't change things up enough you know I just feel like there are some moments where they could sound more intense they could sound more emotive they could just be doing something different but most of the time they're just kind of doing this one single kind of shout you know they're shouting sure but they're not exactly gripping me even though this is an issue most of the tracks are still pretty great on this album where it really ends up bugging me is toward the middle of this album where the band starts stringing it songs out to five or six minutes and in these tracks pop 1280 will kind of lay on the same exact vocals groove for almost the entire duration of the song and it just makes a lot of the tracks after track for feel kind of stale after a while they just feel really repetitive I love it when bands just lay on grooves like that last battles LP that they dropped but the thing is if the groove isn't evolving if the grew doesn't really moving me it's just going to kind of start to bore me the album does finish off with some really fantastic tracks though so at least it kind of cleans up shop well this LP could use some some more emotive and more unique vocals it could have used more interplay between the instruments it really would have made this album groove much harder and as far as the unique personality goes I feel like these guys are almost there like I thought this album was was pretty good solid debut something I could see myself actually returning to here and there throughout the year if I ever need a shot of of noise rock in my ears it's definitely something fans of a place to bury strangers or ice age can really get into kind of feeling a light 7 on this thing so what do you think about this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next Anthony Fantino pop to a lady 
nYcnhe_y21g,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and album review time Lamb of God resolution these guys are a Virginia metal band that I actually mentioned in my most anticipated albums of 2012 list especially since I haven't gotten the chance to talk about any of this bands music and they do have a pretty large reputation in the metal world resolution is the sixth full-length studio album these guys have pulled together as Lamb of God and it pumps out the kind of grew grew grew grew grooves riffs and breakdowns that you would usually hear on the groove metal record a metalcore record and what exactly do those genres mean well both of them are heavily indebted to thrash metal of the 80s and 90s in thrash metal the riff is king as well but in metalcore and groove metal the rips usually aren't that speedy they're more mid paced and they become especially slow if there's a breakdown involved the riffs in this style of music usually have a lot of punch to them a lot of shudder just these continuous start/stop shots of guitar distortion there's even a spot on track 6 where there's like some post-production editing on the guitar riffs make them feel even more sharp make them feel even more robotic when it comes to modern metal hitting the mainstream it's been a lot of Records like this in this style that have been signed on to major labels or have gotten heavy rotation play on metal radio stations and that's fine I understand why it's popular I understand why it's marketable it's music that's created to just elicit an emotional reaction an aggressive emotional reaction as fast as possible not even leaving you time to think about what you're hearing aggression is lame of God's greatest asset on this record on to their records when it comes to that emotion these guys are about as instant as ramen noodles but I think the popularity of this kind of songwriting in metal music has kind of changed the public face of metal a little bit though there are exceptions like Between the Buried and Me and converge this style of music isn't usually big on detail or variation or songwriting you know not to be really brutal about it but I think it's kind of records like this that reinforce a lot of metal stereotypes that metal is nothing but just screaming and just senseless anger and breakdowns but you know it's it's whatever because if somebody really wants to believe that then they're the ones missing out this LP is an album that kind of fits that mold though if you guys watch my videos especially my metal reviews you already know that I love aggressive music but the thing is Lamb of God doesn't really bring much else into the equation there almost no unique song topics or lyrics on this record it's actually a lot of tunes on here about kind of being alone or being singled out and that's not necessarily a bad song topic if you put it in a unique perspective but these ideas are just painted with a lot of cliche lyrics about digging your own grave or bleeding or hands around someone's throat this album isn't really huge on on speed or technical ability not a lot of catchy melodies either and not a lot of thought-provoking sounds or production and the vocals don't really change all that much either track after track after true I guess I would have less of an issue with that if they didn't feel like you know just kind of generic metal growls when the vocals do kind of change its to do a cleanly some chorus or you know kind of a cheesy narration thing for the most part on resolution Lamb of God just focuses on riffs and aggression with a hint a hint of melody and harmony hanging somewhere in the air but the thing is the stuff they focus on with this LP I don't feel like they do it particularly well or approach it from a unique angle the riffs really aren't that intricate or hard-hitting I mean if I want an amazing riff there are a number of Meshuga records I could be listening to instead for just massive heaviness and just dizzying rhythms that sometimes fall into odd time signatures and as far as aggression goes I just don't think this album is all that aggressive it just has this kind of one level of aggression and it maintains it throughout the LP and after a while hearing it at this same level kinda makes it lose what little flavor adds and you know it's kind of a shame because I thought I might be in for something different with this LP especially with the introductory track which was just so slow just so heavy but after that I just kind of get one song after another that just feels like I'm listening to a thrash metal record that's a bit louder has kind of a modern shine a modern production to it but has less melody less songwriting power less variation between the songs I definitely give Lamb of God credit for putting together an LP where they're definitely using more guitar solos and more guitar leads than I've heard on previous efforts there are some spots where the guitar leads kind of build up into some nice harmonies even the final track has string sections playing against the Lamb of gods distorted guitar chords that feel that epic feel overall I just think resolution doesn't throw that many ideas out there it's just kind of 14 track headbang fest that doesn't leave you with much to think about after it's over and because it doesn't offer a lot of different ideas it just gets really old really fast for me maybe if the sound of the record was better I could see myself getting into it more you know but the guitars just don't have a lot of beef to them you know the kind of sound that I love to hear on an electric wizard record or a high on fire record and you know I do understand that that is not the style of music that these guys are playing but still I hate hearing heavy guitars that really aren't heavy at all it's just all distortion and no Rumble it just feels like Lamb of God wants to leave innovation and experimentation to all the other bands out there and just kind of play things by the book and if that works for them that works for them but it doesn't work for me because I just really didn't get much of anything out of this record I understand why people like it but it doesn't appeal to me not at all there are some spots where I kind of like the riffs and I kind of like the vocals a little bit but there was no one song on here that I liked all the way through kind of feeling a strong three on this LP but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh Lamb of God forever [Music] [Music] 
sVjHl5LdLco,Cheerilee something hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd up high down low dude slow it's time for an album review chairlift something chairlift is that New York band that hit it kind of big a handful of years ago after landing one of their singles in iPod commercial the song bruises and the song got him a lot of attention and it's not hard to see why I enjoyed the song really catchy hook lovesick lyrics really cute boy or girl duet dynamic going on the buzz behind them was getting so big they ended up getting signed to Columbia Records and their first album got reissued through that record label and I did listen to the album but it didn't really stick with me you know just kind of felt like light simple indie pop it's got some nice synths but not a lot of lasting power you know kind of like you eat a meal and then you're hungry like just five minutes later I'm not a big fan of meals like that or music like that now chairlift has this sophomore album out titled something on Columbia Records and it's definitely more mature than the previous LP these guys are definitely not just an indie pop band or a synth pop band anymore chairlift went back did its homework started pulling out some post-punk bass lines and some New Wave drumbeats and some art pop sensibilities this combo comes together and it's kicked off really well on the first track which has this bass line that is just all over the place some really nice rhythms and these synthesizers that just wail with this really bright tone that kind of makes them sound like they should be in a theme song to a sixty sci-fi television show and frontwoman Caroline Poehler checks voice just has this really wide range a lot of personality she is singing and also kind of doing these narrations these spoken word bits it just makes the song feel really eccentric really fun really strange it's just like futuristic synth pop but not like future futuristic sand pop kind of like what I'm sure people in the 80s would imagine all music would sound like in 2012 and I get that feel because the sense the vocals the drums they all come together into this really sleek smooth total package that feels a little icy but some of the songs on here have a quirky quality to them too which kind of humanizes this LP makes it fun makes it feel a lot less robotic and boring like the song frigid spring which has definitely the weirdest vocal melody on the entire LP and I think it's the most memorable for it and the other track that to me has a lot of personality is the first single to come off of this LP came out with a video for it last year and then a man named Misha there are more narrations on that track and synthesizers just gliding along really beautifully in the background there are all these segues between the verses and choruses vocals popping up in every direction lots of different sounds and details it's clear this track got a little extra spice a little extra attention and I don't feel like every song on this album did tracks like met before I belong in your arms and ghosts tonight those tracks to me mhm they've got catchy hooks and and overall they're decent songs but they give up the course is so easily it's like the verses aren't even there these tracks to me just feel much much simpler like they're just kind of playing as straight the vocals don't feel a strange or or as emotive and musically these tracks to me don't throw out as many ideas either those tracks definitely do not hit me like the song cool is fire which to me is easily the most beautiful track on this album the beat on that track is really Asia's feels almost a little tribal and the synths in the background just kind of swell up like like their strings or something and the vocals are really spotlighted on this track they really capture this idea of loneliness and just to range the melody that is being sung with the vocals it's gorgeous I wish more songs on here just felt as as tender as loving as gentle I kind of really feel like I'm a rock to sleep with that song after listening to this thing over and over it's clear that that all the songs are are pretty decent you know all of them have good hooks but not every song overall has a captivating or fun or interesting personality it just makes some of the songs on this LP forgettable you know and I think chairlift is kind of yet to hammer out their own niche in the sound that they're playing with because I think it's a little too easy to kind of tack them on to the ever-growing list of bands that are just drowning in this nostalgia for the 80s there are so many points on this LP where I kind of feel like I'm listening to the second coming of whom or the cockatoo twins usually stuff like that ruins albums for me but not necessarily in this case because the songs are so good I'm feeling that a light too decent seven on this thing but but but what do you think about this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana chairlift current 
MEvzOm8XUgo,going just Soofi muzzle hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd nice to meet you it's time for an album review ganja Sufi muzzle ganja Sufi is an MC singer and producer who's been turning heads ever since he landed as a guest vocalist on the Flying Lotus album Los Angeles which led him to get signed on Warp Records to release his debut album a Sufi and a killer which was one of my favorite albums of 2010 and to this day I have difficulty finding words to accurately describe what this album is it's kind of a weird mix of soul and hip-hop and low fine music and electronica and noise and funk and Middle Eastern music punk and psychedelic rock it's just a mess there are so many songs on here it just kind of uses being a mess as kind of a concept now after a remix album of that LP and a new EP we have muzzle which is 10 new tracks 24 minutes kind of a short mini album and a slightly new direction first off going to sufi is not working with the Gaslamp Killer on this one he's taken it upon himself to pull the recording and the beats together and you have a lot of lyrics on these tracks that kind of deal in social overtones and this stuff to me has kind of led to a release that is a little bit more in control of itself know if a Sufi and a killer was kind of like this auditory binge then this is definitely in comparison much more focused and sober I'm not saying this album isn't loaded with trippy and psychedelic sounds because it is like on the song feeding birds you have these vocals that sound like they're being sung through McDonald's drive-thru speaker boxes with lots of reverb on them watery and reverb guitars just shattering away in the background behind them there all these swirls of just ghostly vocals and electric piano on the opening track white-picket-fence there's some mutated King Crimson samples on here with rubber band and skin and some deep dark bass and an eerie atmosphere surrounding the track venom kind of like his last LP ganja Sufi comes up a little short when it comes to presenting songs but when it comes to putting sounds in his album he's ahead of the curve tons of sounds and colors and textures flowing throughout this thing each song on here is kind of like a starburst nomnomnomnom not a really long lifespan but just a an explosion of flavor which to me is kind of especially true of tracks like the the intro track and the outro track which to me can only seem to exist to throw some weird sounds out there songs like black soot and skin and time out there little meteor but I kind of feel the same way about them too because the beats behind the tracks just the whole track in general just feels a little repetitive kind of runs in circles but those tracks a lot of tracks on this LP you don't really last all that long and while that keeps them from getting really annoying to me they don't exactly stick with me they're not really packing a punch and many songs on here don't really throw out ideas that haven't already been thrown out by a Sufi and the killer there are a few darker beats on here and I do like that do out and feed birds but if it weren't for the fact that ganja Sufi has such a unique voice that he's always changing up with different breathing styles and pitches and inflections and effects I think I'd be pretty bored with much of this album there are some songs on here though that kind of seemed to come to come together with a really strong song hook and sound like the blame which has this very dark beat and these strange little synthesizers just kind of droning away in the background and the lyrics kind of tell this story of violence and murder and maybe even kind of killing for your beliefs and also shame and the song nickels and dimes too which is kind of about leading a wasteful lifestyle and one should do his or her best to avoid that and I really like how that track kind of transitions into the song rubber band and you know if we are going to get less material I I at least wish that more of the tracks on here did that you know just so everything didn't feel so dis dis disconnected on this new LP I think going to Sufi is still pushing an original sound I'm happy he's been able to maintain it while kind of relying on himself more to pull this music together muzzle is definitely a little more cohesive but I think you know the way that a Sufi and the killer jumped around just so so boldly is part of what made that album so fun it kind of like short-circuited my brain in contrast muzzle kind of feels like the same drug that I've been taking but it's just not as strong as it used to be overall I'm still addicted to a Sufi and a killer but if this is your first hit of ganja Sufi you know just try it maybe it'll freak you out and get you to see colors I like this thing but only a little kind of feeling like a strong six just would have liked to have more variation in the beats longer songs more songs newer sounds but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana go into Sufi forever 
gRVagQPDh1w,there's no laughter today hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I was thinking of doing another review I could do another album review another EP review but just wasn't inspired to do it because there's a lot of serious going on recently the internet had this big stop sopa de I'm sure you ran across it here or there certain websites were kind of shutting down or putting up big black pages notifying people of these two pieces of legislation passing through Congress right now protect IP and the Stop Online Piracy Act and I know we made a stink about it we really kind of you know got really loud and angry about it but the fight is not over yet this legislation is still in discussion and that's why we need to continue making noise about it I put links below this video to a petition you can sign and also a website where you can kind of punch in your area code or just where you live and find your Congress man or woman and then call them write them call them leave messages I don't think I need to remind you but just in case I need to a lot is at stake here if this legislation passes the government will have a lot of say over what can and cannot be on the internet and where it can and cannot be and the thing is even now without these two pieces of legislation passing through the government has a ton of power over what can be on the internet just recently in the past 24 hours they shut down the website mega upload for copyright infringement right now they're targeting file sharing sites like megaupload what happens when they start targeting communication tools like Twitter Facebook Tumblr YouTube blogs these sites have copyrighted content on them but their uses are much bigger than that sites like this have been used to to help expose police abuse and criminal activity spread really useful information and mobilize people against injustice these are powerful networking tools that could be taken away from us in a second that's too much power for the government to have and you got to think if the government already has the power to shut down an entire website a website that isn't even in American jurisdiction mega uploads HQ is not in the US if they already have this kind of power why do they need to pass these two pieces of legislation they want as much power as possible that's all governments ever won especially when their interests are being driven by highly paid lobbyists sent by big corporations I'm talking corporations like the six largest record labels out there emi BMG Sony universal Warner polygram and it was actually universal music group that was kind of spearheading the shutdown of mega upload these six large record labels own or distribute for tons and tons of sub labels anti island def jam and all of its sub labels all of us you and me we all own albums physically or digitally from these record labels and I know it sucks but you have to think you have to consider every single time you purchase a record from one of the artists on these labels you basically hand over more money to these labels to pay lobbyists to kind of try to push through legislation like this piracy is only a tiny slice of the pie when it comes to the reasons major labels hate the Internet the big problem is they don't have the power they used to to expose you to things back in the 90s and early 2000s it was easy for these record labels to kind of stuff print TV radio and a great deal of the record labels out there into their back pockets now on the Internet age that kind of thing is not as easy too many opinions to control too many underground artists releasing music that's that's more interesting than the crap that they're trying to shove down your throat I know I wouldn't be exposed to probably three-quarters of the music that I listen to that I know about if it wasn't for the Internet maybe more and I think it's roughly the same for a lot of you which is why it's so important to protect the internet just conserve it we need to protect our ability to share whatever we want to share freely and openly entertainment is at risk yeah but what's more important is enlightenment is at risk with this legislation if we let the government win if we let the corporation's pushing them when then they will control our culture if we keep the Internet as our own then we will make our culture think about this legislation if you haven't already consider what it could mean for the internet if it does pass and do whatever you can do what is in your power to prevent it from doing so thank you for watching Anthony fantino sopa and pipa for never you 
bEj3GUmhci4,first aid kit the Lions oh hi how are you that's good Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our view first aid kit the lion's roar the Lions roar is the second full-length album to come from this Swedish sister singing songwriting duo and this thing has been one of my most anticipated albums of this year after hearing the title track to drop from it last year oh and another thing that made me really anticipate this album is that this this live video of them performing a Patti Smith cover and Patti Smith is in the crowd and it's just a great cover fantastic version of the song and Patti Smith is crying they made Patti Smith cry Patti Smith is is one of the most punk women ever to to walk the planet and they made her cry you've got to have a lot of stage presence and talent to make somebody else's song like move them but if you if you check out this album it's ten funky funky funky tunes 10 funky tunes and they cover a lot of colors of the emotional rainbow some moments on here are really kind of uplifting and beautiful others are very kind of painful and just loaded with this really paralyzing sadness sometimes this album is dark and dreary other times it's just powerful and and bright the instrumentation on this LP is mostly acoustic just a lot of autoharp acoustic guitar drums on here as well it's kind of a step up from the duo's last LP because they definitely try to improve upon the instrumentation just build upon that with piano woodwinds pedal steel strings horns guest musicians Conor Oberst is actually a vocalist on the last track but the thing is no matter how much instrumentation you throw into a first aid kit song no matter how many guest musicians you put on the bill the most standout thing that's gonna be on the track our first aid kits vocals that's always gonna be their unique edge you know first aid kit just pulls off these really fantastically tight and close harmonies it goes on throughout almost each track here and I think it's something that the Fleet Foxes fans especially will dig I just love the way these girls sing I love the way they sing the pitch isn't tu-tu-tu-tu-tu high it's not too low and these girls have a lot of force behind their voices a lot of volume control and just the tone of their voices it just pierces through the mix they just they just hit a range that just really resonates on this record for me that's just there mmm their voices are always just the most ear grabbing thing on every single one of these tracks their spots on here where it's just one vocal just so close just right on top of another like the title track the lion's roar the way the vocals just intertwine it kind of creates this really surreal but very natural sounding chorus effect because the sisters voices just sound so alike and how they croon so slowly on that track it just makes it feel like like a funeral march there are tracks like New Year's Eve though where you will get kind of a lone vocal leading things there are other tracks that feature for the most part a single voice like the last track but on that song things really speed up with busier lyrics that are really trying to tell a story a waitress restaurant airport terminal laughing/crying head and the stars feet in the sky a lot of very Bob Dylan esque oddball imagery first aid kit really knows how to just captivate me with the vocals especially on the song New Year's Eve where the lyrics are just kind of handing out these really personal self-improvement promises throughout the track or on the song Emmylou where I feel like especially on the hook they're kind of singing directly to me they're like singing to me and mmm gives me the chills I get all chilled out chilly there are a few Miggy issues I have with the songs though the track I found a way the hook on that song actually sounds a lot like the hook on any loop and this long dance to another tune kind of drags on for me a little bit I guess where I'm really kind of on the fence with this album is with the instrumentation sometimes I really like it sometimes I think it sounds great it sounds kind of unique really complements the tunes on this album and other times it just leaves me with a bland feeling in my ears the track in the hearts of men is an example of where I think the instruments really work with the track you get these quiet woodwinds starting things off and then they just slowly grow along with the song kind of making a song that sounded really dramatic have this kind of calming quality to it in the background and the guitars and the drums on the song blue groove in a really kind of Velvet Underground sort away but on other tracks it kind of sounds like I don't know some of the guests instruments have been copied and pasted from like a hundred other songs like the song Emmylou for example though I love that track I'm totally not feeling the pedal steel on that track at all it just feels so say me say me say me it doesn't add anything unique to the song for me just sometimes I wish I felt like the strings or the horns had as much personality and as much uniqueness as the vocals you know it's not the worst thing in the world I didn't really come away hating any of these songs I came away loving a great deal of them but I do think the instrumentation kind of kept this album just short of being mind-blowing the ambition of the vocals the ambition of the tunes isn't really matched up with the instrumentation on this record I feel like on the surface it feels that way because you are getting all these extra sounds you're getting all these extra instruments but what they're playing just doesn't really hit me with any urgency there's just no oomph behind a lot of the guest instruments on this album to me still I feel like the personality the songs and the vocals are here those are here and those made me enjoy this album and will probably keep me checking in to whatever first-aid kit does in the future feeling uh decent too strong seven on this LP but what do you guys think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should love you next yeah thony Fantana first aid kit lion's roar forever you 
bhBkb4ayfVY,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for view young fathers tape one young fathers is a uk-based trio and they make some pretty forward-thinking hip-hop music with loads of sounds coming from reggae and African music too and it's all filtered through this noisy low fiber cording style there's not a lot of backstory to be said about this group but little information there is has been posted on the group's tumblr and that's fine because to me the music on this tape has so much personality it doesn't really need a backstory to support it the opening track starts things off with this really fat dirty synthesizer and this tribal rhythm that's that's noisy as hell yeah there's an African influence in there but it sounds like it's sequenced like a hip-hop beat on an MPC or something there are all these group vocals calling out over and these sirens and alarms just blaring in the background it's a really exciting mess and the hook toward the end of the track pulls out some interesting lyrics - don't you turn my home against me even if my house is empty this entire tape is just filled with odd and weird and kind of thought-provoking lyrics it's not like you're really gonna get any uh really hot fiery technical spitting on this thing instead the vocals just have a lot of personality and they just kind of favor poetry over technical ability though you're not getting a lot of words the words that these guys do throughout there just hold a lot of weight for me just a lot of imagery and emotions dealing with war family love youth the last track even kind of talks about the wedding of an uncle of one of the MCS in the group and in that respect you know making sure your words are kind of quality over quantity and using these really kind of experimental beats this tape really reminds me of artists like Shabazz Palaces or even ganja Sufi now the next two tracks on this tape are where you really start getting some straight emceeing the track sister samples this African chant and a marching snare drum and rumbling has to be my favorite track on this tape the B is just so fat and analog and just rumbly the sound is kind of muffled but it still manages to throw a lot of stuff into the mix these really crisp cymbals some quirky synthesizers and something that kind of sounds like a a rattling tambourine it's really fun but also kind of freaky it's like voodoo hip-hop or something the song romance kind of goes on a reggae trip it's kind of like a double reggae trip actually but it's so dubbed out it's just so heavy it's just so wet with effects that it kind of becomes like psychedelic reggae becomes really trippy becomes really kind of lucid it's like listening to a sound system play a reggae tune kind of underneath the ocean but the vocals are kind of coming through loud and clear now the song is on the second half of this thing play with a lot of the same ideas as the first half kind of continuing to chisel young fathers style into form just this really low Phi hip hop and pop with African rhythms and vocals being thrown in in every direction I think my biggest issue with this EP or tape is that some of the tracks on here do end a little abruptly for me there are some tracks that I just wish lasted longer I mean yeah yeah my only major complaint is I just wish there was more I think the track Ramada is a little maybe too stripped-down could have had a little bit more meat in the beat and I guess the lyrics could have you know been a little bit more straightforward with their storytelling but yeah this is a pretty solid tape with this debut in my opinion young fathers are coming out really strong fresh sound experimental beats memorable hooks and some pretty poetic and abstract lyrics that are worth paying attention to feeling is strong seven to a light eight on this tape but what do you think of it what does count your chest to think of it remember fellas practice safe teenis make sure you go to the doctor every few months and get tested for pregnancy it's important yeah do you love this thing do you hate this thing why and what should I review next anthony Fantana yeah father's forever 
ITVA5ALfEiE,mr. schoolboy q habits & contradictions hahaha hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of an album that's received quite a few requests schoolboy q habits & contradictions schoolboy q is a West Coast rapper who actually dropped a full-length LP his full-length debut exactly a year ago January last year setbacks and even though I missed that LP I heard quite a bit of this guy last year because he got featured on a lot of hip-hop albums that that I listened to and I loved like Kendrick Lamar's last album AB Souls last album J ROCs last album as well as the last ASAP rocky mixtape so this is the first time I'm actually sitting through an entire LP of songs from this guy and you know on this album you're going to run into a bunch of sounds a bunch of flavors you're already familiar with if you paid close attention to hip-hop last year lyrically I just feel like this album relies a little bit too much on hip-hop cliches for for song ideas and song concepts you know you can add habits & contradictions as another chapter in the ongoing book about drugs sex egos and lavish lifestyles with it with a hint of social consciousness but just fine you know it's not necessarily a bad thing I'm totally down with following only only an emcee on some really dark dangerous legal Shh as long as it's you know presented in a genuine and interesting and maybe even original way on this album I just don't feel like that happens you know on a majority of the stories in these songs I kind of feel like q is reading from the autobiography of someone else a lot of the stories here just feel kind of forced for me they just feel done and done and done and done again is pretty into the LP once it started though the song sacrilegious is a great owner that that just felt really kind of dark and epic it really got me in the mood for a dark album and the second track raises my expectations of that with the song there he go which has these really kind of smoky saxophones laced into the beat this kind of electronic warring in there too and schoolboy Q's vocal his flow his rhymes are just so weird and eccentric he just starts jumping into the higher pitches in his range as he's spitting it it just sounds crazy it feels kind of ridiculous and cartoony in a weird comparison here and it may be like a mindless self-indulgence kind of way but I can actually enjoy it and take it seriously to me this song just feels like one of the most original spots on the album I'm actually pretty interested when he spits like this but right after that cute kind of jumps on this weed rap shtick with ASAP Rocky on hands on the wheel and I think the vocal sample and the beat is really great very dramatic but the track itself I feel like has a pretty cheap hook and comes off as kind of one-dimensional I like the track right after that one sex drive even less that track once it hits this whole album just kind of takes a turn for the worse for me everything starts feeling just like it's on a one track mind set of just being drunk horny stoned misogynistic materialistic it tries to come off with this very very Kanye West classy ignorant style but it doesn't really you know hit with as much impact as when someone like Kanye does it it's not like the drugs and the alcohol talked about on this album are brought to a dark disturbing or funny excess they're not really presented with with a whole new original sound or style either don't get me wrong I feel like this album is listenable but it's just not blowing me away especially since I just don't feel like it's hammering out a niche for itself after the song by hate and joint I just kind of feel like this LP devolve into a swag rap album the track Raymond 1969 q kind of goes on this Odd Future trip and you know it gets really dark gets really violent and even references odd future in the lyrics the song sexting feels really fast sexy aggressive kind of this schizophrenic flow that really reminds me of Nicki Minaj but the song groove line feels really blunted and soulful and appropriately currency is featured on the track that track in the song how we feelin feel really kind of slowed down and sort of lucid to in an ASAP rocky kind of way but really underwhelming too on the songs gangsta in designer and Nightmare on Figg Street he really kind of goes on this Kanye West watch the throne kind of trip and toward the end this guy kind of does this meaningful deep socially aware Kendrick Lamar kind of thing and it's not that he's all that terrible doing any of these things he definitely proves himself to be versatile I guess but none of it really packs a punch for me because nothing is really repeated or evolved or fine-tuned to the point where it becomes amazing or it becomes standout or it becomes unique this album just kind of tries this tries this tries this tries this tries this as this tries the habits & contradictions to me is just kind of a chameleon that jumps from one sound to another sound in a really kind of unrewarding way I think it loses momentum because of it I mean I would be more into the extreme variety of this album if I felt like every song shared a really high-quality there are a lot of tracks on here like the 17th track which just repeats so much it kind of just feels like filler there are songs on here where I feel like the the hooks are really kind of silly kind of corny and there are other songs that to me feel like well nothing much really happens or stops me in my tracks sometimes queue pulls out some pretty fast flows some clever similes but it's not anything that saves the album for me or you know keeps me interested his lyrics and his stories just don't feel that vivid or descriptive to me and he just doesn't have the personality and the wordplay at this point to maintain my attention for the entire hour that this album lasts I think the one saving grace of the album is the production the beats overall on this thing are pretty good I think it makes this album pretty tolerable I'm kind of feeling a strong five on this thing but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana schoolboy q forever [Music] you 
V3TEU7FBXC4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review Cloud Nothings attack on memory Cloud Nothings is a Cleveland indie rock band and it's been about a year since I was first introduced to this project when it dropped its sophomore LP which was self-titled on carpark records and even though I liked this album a little bit when it first came out my problem with it ultimately is that I felt like it was kind of forgettable which kind of plays out in the fact that I cannot remember not a single song from it the album was chasing after that really lo-fi washed-out reverb II rock sound that's that's been big ever since 2008 2009 and these days you know it's a sound it's a style that I'm really really just fed up with I'm just not interested in it you know I always try to keep my ears open to whatever is new and whatever's going on whatever style of music but it's difficult to stay interested it's difficult to feel excited when you've got so many bands lining up to beat the same exact drum Cloud Nothings did a huge 180 with this new LP attack on memory even though that is the title I think this album is really memorable this album just brings a set of songs that are just very clear and muscular tracks from genres like indie rock and punk rock and post-hardcore maybe with a little bit of emo thrown in there old-school cool ass emo not the emo everybody's like oh that's emo the I would just say the strong points of this LP are catchy hooks strong vocals and lots of variety in the in the 33 minutes that this LP lasts and to speak about the variety of this thing this album does turn out a few different kinds of songs and the first kind of song we'll run into on here especially on tracks 1 & 2 are these these slow burners these really hard emotional rock songs that feel just influenced by the repetition of bands like Slynt but had that fire in that drive like a Fugazi song the track like no future no pastures has this riff and it's being laid on over and over and each time is just getting it's getting louder it's getting rougher it's getting harder as well as the vocals - in the drums and the second track wasted days three minutes into the song it just breaks into the screw that gets jammed out until the song ends at around the 9 minute mark and this Jam is a real ride it's fantastic to hear the change that Cloud Nothings have made on this LP they are just sounding so much more together cohesive instrumentally you know what I mean it sounds like you're really hearing a band rock the hell out while I the guitars are getting noisy the vocals are just losing control but the album is not just one long drawn-out jam after another Cloud Nothings throws out some really fast and catchy songs on here - but doesn't cheapen the music or or make it just feel dumbed down in the process and I think the king of all the songs that fit that bill is definitely the tracks stay useless the introduction of the song sounds like it could have been written for a strokes tune but the song kind of morphs into what could have been like an indie rock song from the 90s but it doesn't really feel old and nostalgic the vocals just had this really kind of strong teenage personality in the hook just hit so hard I just want to go I need to stop now bad sometimes the lyrics are barely intelligible it's clay yeah you're hearing these growls sometimes the vocals do come off a little amateur but they are so emotive in authentic you know that that cannot be questioned at least the emotions behind the vocals they seem really just angry at some points depressed at other points anxious there's another track on this that goes really dark and heavy and it's the track no sentiment and it's on that song you get these just wailing guitars these huge heavy bass riffs and on here on here I can really tell these guys are using that Steve Albini production yes Cloud Nothings actually worked with Steve Albini to put this album together I'm sure it had a lot to do with why the music and the sound is different on this LP and if there is one track on here where that is heavily displayed it's that one and I like the idea of the song too in the lyrics it feels like the lyrics are about being kind of aggressive toward the past aggressive towards the things we remember we don't care what you do we don't care what we'll lose lose in the process of forgetting in the process of attacking the past what you're doing artistically and when you're doing it I think is a theme that gets played out on the next track and that's the song our plan has some really kind of strong driving guitars and bass on there some nice keyboard kind of lost in the mix a little bit and the lyrics go original it'll never get old essential it'll never get old I think it kind of pokes fun of the way we listen to music consume music like perceive music and celebrate it how maybe you know and again this is my interpretation that we have these albums and these sounds and and these artists that we you know throw away their garbage we ignore them oh that's bad but there are others that we just kind of treat like sacred cows oh that's never going to get old the track cut you as a nice little relationship song fall in has a female vocal thrown into the background therefore a nice little extra sound and the song separation is a is a nice little instrumental as well at the end of the day I feel like this album just kind of feels like a batch of tracks just an assembly of random ass songs I didn't feel any kind of one strong theme idea or songwriting style on this thing no real climactic ending either didn't really blow me away but this is extremely catchy well produced well written batch of rock songs rock songs that I feel like I could come back to that I want to come back to that I want to repeat blaring guitars great interplay between the musicians memorable hooks it comes off as really approachable but has this really badass and aggressive edge to it to this LP to me is a huge improvement upon Cloud Nothings previous work I'm feeling light eight on this thing strong seven to a light eight if you love rock if you love indie rock give this a listen hmm and let me know what you think do you love this thing do you hate it why and what should our view next let me know yeah the new Fantan out Cloud Nothings breath [Music] [Music] 
zTGw8MLOCGg,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question query comment thing or basically just just today I think I was first exposed to the trailer for the forthcoming LCD Soundsystem movie shut up and play the hits which kind of details the the ending and then the final concert of the New York Post Punk dance punk dance rock art dance rock punk rock dance rock band and I really want to see it it's going to premiere Sundance I'm not going to go to Sundance probably so as of right now my only hope of seeing is like James Murphy flying down on a pair of wings and handing me a DVD copy of it or something but it really made me think you know why does it movie like this even exist like we live in a world where we love music so much we can't just listen to the album no that's just not enough we need to take the music we love and then immortalize it in film too and we do it with the same passion and drive that we do any other movie some of the greatest movies ever made are music movies we have music movies that are fictional and are created to kind of satirize or or poke fun at music culture like spinal tap or even Detroit Rock City maybe SLC punk a little bit but there are other movies that are fictional or semi fictional but you know really kind of romanticize the story of a certain style of music or an artist like block the line 24 Hour Party People - oh yeah swing kids just want to say swing kids swans say it sometimes we love musicians so much we just let them star in and make movies just for the hell of it like all the movies the Beatles were featured in that terrible terrible Richard hell movie blank generation The Ramones with rock-and-roll high school and who can forget my this is like my favorite music related movie one of my favorite music related movies Weird Al's uhf yo so bad so stop ah we put out movies where we look forward to them because we know the director has really good taste in music and we love just being exposed to the songs that are put into the soundtrack like in the case of a Wes Anderson movie there are movies with soundtracks that get so huge they kind of start little musical trends like Garden State and Juno there are movies that we get excited for just because some huge artists that we love is featured in the soundtrack or as composing music for the film like there will be blood and Tron and girl the Dragon Tattoo and of course there are countless music documentaries out there that give us kind of like a deep look inside the minds of the artists we love or the musical movements that we feel really passionate about like American hardcore the devil and Daniel Johnston anvil the story of anvil and of course there are movies out there that sort of seem to just be existing only for the music like the song remains the same where you're pretty much getting a Led Zeppelin performance or Talking Heads with stop making sense and of course the music movie that just takes it above and beyond next-level the wall there are more music movies that I could mention but I want to know what are your favorite music movies does seeing an album or an artist you love kind of get immortalized in film through a fictional thing or through a documentary or through a semi-fictional thing does that get you excited are you interested in that or is making movies about the artists we love maybe a little much let me know Anthony Fantana music movies forever 
4EzQRbeLeXk,hi everyone Anthony Sano here intranets busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the act of estimating as worthless really long title amongst these splintered Minds leaden thoughts sing softly I don't even know why I said that in an accent the act of estimating is worthless is a New York band this is their debut full-length LP following up an EP and a little demo as well the active estimating presents a really interesting idea take the lazy and listless Fulk Punk attitude and sound that the Moldy Peaches had back in the day but this time we're gonna do it in a way where people can like take it serious but honestly the first thing that I did notice about this LP when I was listening to it was just the similarities it has to the music of the Moldy Peaches and Kimya Dawson and Adam green as well the acoustic instrumentation is right at the forefront of this thing the boy/girl vocals kind of lazily intertwining together are very off beat and off pitch the songs on these tracks are very simple they feature very simple melodies the melodies on this thing are almost like child song like in some respects almost have like a lullaby quality to them and overall the album just has this really young attitude these really straightforward and personal lyrics sometimes they come off really poetic and other times they're just not afraid to get guttural and spit a line out like I up it's a combination of flavors that makes this album equal parts cute endearing weird and also pretty relatable the lyrics are pretty interesting too dealing with a lot of sort of adult situations or just odd situations but kind of filtered through this sort of nostalgic and childlike mindset the more I listen to this album the more I learned that the act of estimating really did put together a solid LP and they have influences that vary outside of the peaches one thing that I think separates them definitely is the recording on this LP is pretty good and it features a mess of different instrumentation horns strings drums and upper a bass glockenspiel some tracks like no one on the road and nighttime just burst beautifully with all of this instrumentation while others just have you know it's just some really nice accompaniment that just continues throughout the song and to be honest sometimes when the horns swell on this album it reminds me of Neutral Milk Hotel a lot and there are other tracks like massive windows and things we remember where the instrumentation will be really loud and just saturated and distorted spots like that really really sound like the microphones to me you know you'll get a bunch of instrumentation surrounding these songs but it'll sound really hectic and sort of low Phi now another kind of striking thing about this band is just its its personality and how consistent it is throughout the album even the cutest and most adorable songs on this LP have a really kind of deadpan vocal and a stone-faced expression and this really strong sense of just earnestness just this raw earnestness it just reminds me of like a Bill Callahan song like a Smaug song or something so you've just got these simple songs these interesting lyrics and strange emotions adult situations with all of this sort of beautifully and meticulously crafted instrumentation surrounding all of it it's just a nice mixture for me overall this album is kind of like being a kid again and having like a secret spot that nobody else knows about like a really cool treehouse or something and you've got like a front deck on there and you can look at the stars at night or go inside read tons of comic books and play video games or whatever even though I felt like this album didn't really present anything brand-new to me sound or style wise it was a nice blend of things that I was already familiar with just kind of put together in a way I'd never heard them before and sometimes you know that's all you really need in order for an album to kind of feel fresh to you as far as negatives on this LP go I feel like some tracks on here just pale in comparison to others and a lot of songs on here just felt really kind of see me see me I felt like I was just getting this really strong notion of deja vu throughout this LP and it's mostly because of the vocals which are a bit of a double-edged sword because even though they lend this project a lot of personality you know it's like oh that's kind of their shtick that's their sound that's their style that vocal style it doesn't really change up and show the variation that the instrumentation does and the emotions do from song to song to song to song so in a way the vocals on this thing kind of end up making a lot of tracks on here feel too similar still I enjoyed the hell out of this LP and would like to know what you think of it if you take a listen to it feeling a decent too strong 7 on this thing what do you think about it do you love it you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana the act of estimating is worthless definitely not worthless forever 
zy-vcDvAJ6U,Hey it's track review track reviews hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music of the independent persuasion and in this episode the indie rock and pop band rather indie rock and pop Giants The Shins have a new track out from their forthcoming album port of morrow it's gonna drop in March and it's been about five years since these guys have put out a full-length LP their last full-length album actually came out around the time I was finishing up college and these guys kind of blew up Fame wise partially thanks to the Garden State soundtrack around the time when I started college so I mean I've been conscious of this band for a long time I think they write some very likeable and catchy songs but they've never really showed off the bold personality I would need in order to I guess kind of get addicted to their music like I can't really say anything terrible about any of the album's the shins have released I guess there are some songs on the releases that in my opinion are kind of generic but if you were to put a shins album on in my vicinity I would probably like it during that era of indie rock and indie pop where the shins kind of blew up I was just listening to and enjoying other bands like Interpol and Arcade Fire and postal service and Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse and The Decemberists and Sufjan Stevens as well as The Strokes of Montreal I enjoy all those bands but never really have been a big fan of The Shins though I'm sure coucher chesta is nope never really lighten being on with it but Cal Church esta hates everything I love I love the shins you know even though I've never really been a huge shins guy I've never really even been into the side projects that they've dealt in over the years either I just figured why not try this song out it might surprise me you never know when a band is gonna just start clicking with you you know and I have to say this track the first one to drop from Port of of Mauro simple song was a nice surprise it felt like a little bit of a change to me the shins on this track feel really loud ambitious almost arena sized these guys have put out their share of louder tracks and and more eccentric tracks in the past like kissing lipless but this particular song is definitely stretching for this Arcade Fire sized indie rock anthem it presents all these reverb vocals and and heavy rhythms lyrics about just the ocean and the Sun and fear there are these escalating background vocals and just this pit orchestra or what sounds like a pit orchestra of rock instrumentation and the verses have this really kind of Beach Boys Brian Wilson kind of feel to them from the way the vocals are performed to the melody that they sing and the rhythm behind all of it it gives me a similar feel to a Beach Boys song too it just kind of feels kind of young and liberating like just riding your bike down the middle of the road no handlebars and the sun is shining on you and there's not a car in sight it just feels really free and the chorus on this track brings a really nice change into the mix to this piano flies in the rhythm changes and the lyrics are really catchy singing about going it alone the chorus just really makes this songs uplifting factor increase tenfold still I have to say overall I don't feel like this song is as bold or as unique as I would like it to be part of me would rather just kind of listen to what influences this track instead even though I think the shins do pull these influences together really well on this track do blend this modern indie rock sound together with this very kind of I might not be remembering this track by the end of the year but I liked it I thought it was pretty good and I'm definitely gonna take a listen to the next album The Shins put out but I'm not really anticipating any huge change in how I feel about the band's music but what do you think about this track do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana The Shins forever 
OB31JSo1MPU,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Charlie Haden and Hank Jones come Sunday Charlie Haden and Hank Jones are two very well traveled jazz musicians Charlie Haden is a bass player and has been a trailblazer in avant-garde experimental and free jazz for years over the course of Hayden's career he's released a lot of albums collaborated with greats like Alice Coltrane Pat Metheny and Ornette Coleman as well and his partner on this album Hank Jones is a jazz piano player and he's collaborated with many greats himself and has a pretty hefty discography too sadly he passed away in 2010 I don't know how much more recorded material there is out there of him that's yet to be a release that would still sound fresh and interest his fanbase so I don't know this this might be the last new recording with his piano playing on it too to come out this album comes Sunday it's Charlie Hayden on upright bass Hank Jones on piano just reinventing all of these spirituals gospel songs and hymns and traditional songs folk songs as well you know I never really bring it up but I've always kind of had a real sweet spot for this kind of music I actually even subscribe to a YouTube channel called strolling down memory lane that throws up that kind of music all the time there's just a really sweet gentle and warm aura around this kind of music this kind of music is the building block for a lot of American music it's the roots it's the blueprint to all the jazz that Charlie Hayden and Hank Jones played throughout their career and this kind of music was a huge inspiration to tons of singer songwriters especially one of my favorites Tom Waits now this is not the first time that Charlie Haden and Hank Jones have collaborated on a project like this actually released an album professor of mine turned me on to in college that was put out in 1995 called steal away where they're pretty much going in the same direction just reinventing reinterpreting tunes from that same style from that same traditional music era if you've ever wanted to listen to music that just felt like it had lots of dignity dignity then this is definitely a must listen even though come Sunday was recorded around 15 years after steal away was the intent of what Hayden and Jones want to do with these songs has remained roughly the same they just performed them together just very softly very quietly but also very intently they don't just let these songs Breeze by you know for the most part they kind of try to leave their fingerprints on these versions and the way that they play these songs out with this very solemn this very kind of clean performance it's really like kind of going to an old country church and just everything is very you know rootsy and rural but also very beautiful and charming know even though I really like steal away I am like income Sunday too but I do feel like I'm a little on the fence with it as well and it's mostly because of similarities it has and doesn't have with steal away on steal away you just got one reinterpretation after another of these old standbys that were quiet but very passionately played and the tone of the instruments was really nice to the bass was soft but very punchy very kind of mmm had some thickness to it and the piano though it was quiet it had these very light lush rushes of sound sometimes - and Hank Jones displayed a lot of very nimble playing when win win win but the one thing this album doesn't do as much as steal away is embellish these songs I don't know if it was because they were recording this project years and years later or if they really wanted to simplify their approach to these songs they really kind of want the songs to stand on their own and kind of not distract from that with the flashy playing or something but there are some tracks on here like down by the riverside or blessed assurance where Hank and Charlie just really are playing it straight sure there are some solos on that track but there are also moments like God rest ye merry gentlemen where it seems like they'll go through the entire track and play it so plainly and so rigidly that I really start getting kind of bored with it I'm not really looking for these tracks to be really jazzed up and upbeat or anything like that I mean I think there are some songs on here that benefit from the quiet volume of this album like the opening track take my hand precious Lord which is just played so slowly and so softly that it just reaches new levels of beauty for me and those are the spots that really hit me on this album the heaviest there are songs on here like give me that old-time religion where it does feel more upbeat it is performed pretty well it is embellished really nicely you've got those spots like I said that are so soft filled with dignity filled with beauty and then again you've got this other side to this album that feels so straightforward so unchanged that I could almost hear any two musicians playing it this way you know which is a bit of a shame because yeah I am here to listen to the tunes because the tunes are beautiful the tunes are gorgeous the tunes are well-traveled the tunes here have wit stood the test of time but I'm also here to listen to Hank and Charlie and I think I would have enjoyed this record a little bit more if I felt like they were more in balance with some of these songs like they weren't sort of letting the songs overshadow them at some points still I think this is a pretty good album at least worth a couple lessons through and try to give the album that came out before this one a chance as well I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this just a lot of songs on here that didn't feel explored enough some songs because they weren't all that explored ended up being pretty short but if any of you have listened to this and if you have let me know what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why how could you hate it Anthony Fantana Charlie Hayden and Hank Jones come Sunday what should I review next 
K-ZiSFmbAA0,it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantino here intranets busiest music murdered burden and it's time for track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music and metal and hip hop and hardcore punk and in this track review ceremony ceremony is a California band that's been making extremely mosh worthy music since 2005 their early albums fooled around with more of a power violence style just this really strong hardcore punk rage infused with these really kind of grindcore drums and tempo changes and just hard-ass lyrics hard-ass vocals it's like in an elbow in your mouth but the first time I ever reviewed anything from these guys it was actually in 2010 when they dropped their LP Rohnert Park which in my review I remember pronouncing incorrectly just like I mispronounced on this and on that I've never mispronounced that to I mispronounce a lot of things by the time these guys dropped Rohnert Park they had settled their music into a pretty straight-up hardcore punk style these guys were pumping out riffs and beats and just and just sounds that were heavily indebted to the best hardcore punk bands to come out of California in the 80s and even though Punk is an extremely established and well traveled genre these guys did a great job of kind of carving out their own niche in it with these very gruff vocals this pummeling modern sound really memorable riffs and very catchy lyrics to like on the tracks back in 84 and sick the band is getting ready to put out its fourth album Zoo on Matador Records of all places cool an Matador recently dropped the first single to come off of this LP hysteria and I gotta say I'm kind of surprised by the change in sound that this single brings to the band well you know I kind of am surprised and I'm not because you know you have to consider that these guys changed on Rohnert Park you know that was definitely a shift in sound for them and considering the change in sound that this single brings I mean they seem like a group of guys that don't like to settle into one predictable idea because this track definitely does not come off with the hardcore punk vibe that I got from the last LP hysteria opens up with these really heavy guitars slow riffs building things up against these really hectic drum fills and what's the beat to the song kind of forms and the guitars really start playing a steady riff the song feels more alt-rock than it does punk and not that that's a bad thing I guess what the bad thing about this riff is in my opinion is that it feels kind of common just kind of feels like I've heard it in a lot of different places there was nothing all that outstanding about it and I don't know whether it was the way it was recorded the way it was just performed the way the the instrumentation kind of melded together but it just didn't feel like there was any momentum behind the riff behind the track there just wasn't any push there just wasn't anything getting me pumped you know and the vocals feel totally different to from from previous ceremony stuff they had this really kind of young and snotty Johnny Rotten kind of vibe to him except not as funny or cynical or snarky or eccentric the hook pretty much revolves around the word hysteria getting repeated again and again and again and that kind of tattoos it a bit in the back of my head but that's only for now I don't think it's really gonna stick with me all that long after a verse chorus verse the track kind of ends things out with a big group chorus vocal and then you know just boughs out after 2 minutes and 30 seconds not that a short song is bad but for that 2 minutes and 30 seconds I was kind of waiting for something that would that would wow me or you know get my adrenaline pumping a little bit I like this ceremony is changing it up again they're not always going to give you the same record twice but this track was just kind of underwhelming for me but you know the thing is this track could kind of be a lone wolf on this album you know because there were certainly moments on Rohnert Park where the band would throw out a track like the doldrums that has sounded nothing like any other song on that album and kind of broke up the other more hard-edged straight into the point punk songs on the album so hopefully that's kind of the way I end up feeling about this song when I have to listen to it in the context of the whole albums ooh that's gonna drop in March but as of this point I'm just not liking this song really not liking it at all what do you guys think of this track do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think is gonna come from this next ceremony album let me know Anthony Fantana ceremony for

kgOFgQLoPgg,hi everyone Anthony Phan Tiano here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review I got a little help from my Twitter people on pronouncing this title and band correctly I hope not really banned kind of solo effort but whatever else ESTs Lavoie aj the lim god i hope i pronounced it correctly so this is the third full-length album to drop from this french black metal project but the music that all cest creates stretches beyond the sound the style and usual fanbase of black metal what's so black metal about this project is the way the guitars are played some of the blast beats that pop up here and there as well as the very romantic melodies that are used on all sets releases and every once in a while the vocals come out in that usual kind of black metal style too but they're unag Norah Belen fluence is coming from the world of shoegaze music as well most all cest songs bring a really vast and dreamy wall of sound that is kind of iced with very sweet cleanly sung vocals it's a sound that a lot of new bands have been chasing after for the past four years mostly because projects like all sets and wolves in the throne room have brought this style of metal so much of visibility but to be completely honest out of all the groups chasing after this atmosphere black metal style this black gaze style some people call it all sussed has never really been one of my favorites I get the frontman for this band needs a lot of credit because he's built a name for himself on this sound and he's also been involved in a lot of other forward-thinking metal projects that I have a lot of respect for like land lows or pests moire but most of the characteristics that I didn't like about previous all cest releases continue on to this album you know out of all the black metal and black metal influenced rock that I've ever heard I think all Seth's music is definitely definitely the most pleasant sounding but I don't think that's because it's uniquely pretty or beautiful or anything like that I think there are artists who are working in the same arena as this album but have pulled together songs that feel prettier to me like wolves in the throne room and even that last Agalloch album was really great I think all sets music comes off as pleasant because it doesn't really ever present anything all that gripping or exciting or challenging it doesn't really push any buttons for the most part on these tracks you get very very sleepy sleepy vocals lost in this wall of sound that doesn't really have all that much character to me a lot of the songs on this album sound very big and vast and airy but I'm not really catching an interesting sound or flavor that keeps me locked in the sound you know not to be brutal about it but I just feel like it's it's kinda kind of bland but the thing is I'm not too in love with the songs on this album either I feel like a lot of tracks on this LP come off as a little repetitive especially the song beings of light the chords and the the very light heavenly background vocals on the track go on for for almost ever the opener really underwhelmed me a lot of tracks on this album really underwhelming I don't feature all that much variety the only two tracks on here that I really really liked were the second track and the track havens toward the end of the album they're longer songs on the album but they really justify their length by featuring more detailed song structures lots of changes lots of builds and both tracks actually featured screaming vocals on them too which you know may turn off some people but it really broke up the man me the biggest surprise on this album though came on the last track it just has this chord progression these riffs that really remind me of like a Foo Fighters palette or something but they just have the the heaviness and in the vocal mix of like a Jesu song yes in case you yeah to us it was pretty entertaining to hear all sets make that change but it's it's nothing I was in love with you know I just feel like this project isn't for me I think it comes from an interesting angle if you're the kind of person who isn't really big into metal but you're kind of curious though it is heavy it is loud it does have an element of lightness to it lots of melody lots of harmony it just doesn't feel all that bold to me I guess I'm kind of feeling a light 5 on this but what do you think of this thing especially if you're a fan of this project did this album excite you did you love it hate it let me know Anthony Fantino all cest you 
0bCcHtQerqE,Hey hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time not for an album review for an EP review zoom Udo idiom wind zoom Udo is a project spearheaded by singer songwriter multi-instrumentalist Nicky Muto one half of the experimental music duo the books who actually came out with one of my favorite albums of 2010 the way out that's it right there and their Nixa Muto has released music under solo capacity before but most of it was before he actually started releasing full-length LPS with the books so this EP is a return back to that solo capacity but Nick is not really playing the same material that he was years ago when he was releasing music under this name there elements of funk and electronica and noise flowing throughout these tracks and the singer-songwriter element that sort of popped its head up a lot more on the way out shows up on this EP in full force the first track to come off of this EP is the title track and it starts with some really kind of wavy Airy chords rising and falling really quickly and then these strings sort of fly in to back it up and they sound very very tender very beautiful then all of a sudden this booming bass guitar comes in and Nixon Muto's really kind of friendly boyish vocal takes my ears on a tour through all these really pretty sounds and in the lyrics I kind of feel like he's giving me a little bit of life advice he's talking about a person's education and how it's not worth a damn how this person is also kind of headstrong surrounded in tragedy it's easily my favorite song off of this and you pee because I'm as enthralled with the song and the lyrics as I am the sounds that surround it this track and the other tracks on here to feature are really kind of odd mix and it gives the song an interesting character like the drums the hi-hat is just so loud and just so in my face whereas the the snare drum sort of seems to be coming in under that and the bass drum sometimes feels like it's just non-existent the music gets even odder on the second track fu c-3po great title on this song samples sort of come into play which makes it kind of feel like the most books esque song on this EP you've got a kind of funny sample starting things off talking about the human race and it may be saying well maybe it's not but I kind of feel like these these very watery swirling vibra phones that pop up in the background here and they're on this track maybe lifted from something else over that Nick the Muto's voice is just kind of manipulated with all these robotic vocoder vocals and those aren't even half the sounds that pop up in this track there are just like harsh shots of noise all sorts of inexplicable textures and Tambor's it's like half of the sounds in this track were created by like a mad sound scientist in his underground lair muhahahaha lightning bolt lightning bolt some of the moments on this track feels so overwhelming it's kind of like getting a bucket of bolts dumped on your head and I kind of sort of mean that as a compliment the last track on the EP has a really nimble beat and it grooves hard and it's got this really idiosyncratic quality to it as all these sounds are kind of pushing along it's really rhythmic manner the vocals are kind of singing in this in this very monotone cultish delivery the more I listen to the track the more I just saw reminded me a little bit of they might be giants and there are a lot of noises on this track too but they all kind of melt into each other in a really interesting way sometimes they swirl they bleed into one another sometimes I kind of feel like the goal of this EP was to throw as many sounds as many noises into some of these tracks as possible but still maintain some kind of semblance of musicality I think the one downside to the third track is that it ends a little abruptly for I kind of feel like it repeats itself a little bit too much towards its finish and then just kind of still it drums up some interesting sounds I do have some other complaints about this EP though I kind of feel like I'm just on the fence with the overall sound and and recording of this thing though I do think zoom Udo is going for something pretty bold pretty noisy something that is evolving past what the books have been doing recently it still ends up sounding kind of demo ish kind of thin because there are some spots on here where I'm just hearing a ton of sounds that I feel like would would come across so much better if there was just more space in between them this recording is just kind of claustrophobic and that doesn't really complement all the subtleties I hear on some of these tracks like I may hear an acoustic guitar or something or some odd vocal samples murmuring away in the background that I wish I could hear a bit more and I do kind of run into the problem with this EP that I do with most EPS and that's leaving this thing feeling kind of hungry for more so overall I did think this EP was really good though would listen again and I'm really looking forward to more music coming out of this project kind of feel like seven on this but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana zum udo Fuhrer you 
nuRLRQl0tZ8,the weakened echoes of silence hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd in it's time for an album review the weekend echoes of silence the weekend is a Canadian experimental R&B project fronted by vocalist and songwriter able to say hey this is not the first time I'm running into this project though I did a review the month this project dropped its debut release house of balloons and to be honest it was one of my most negative reviews of last year not only that but I think it was definitely in the top 5 for biggest negative backlash from viewers and yeah you know I said the weekend was a group possibly during a time when how many people were involved and who was involved wasn't common knowledge but that wasn't a big issue the big issue was just people angry and confused over how I could not like this release wha-ah-ah how could I possibly say there might be auto-tune used as an effect not a crutch somewhere on some of these songs moral of the story people hate differing opinions but I love them so so yeah I didn't like house of balloons I thought it was really nice that this project wanted to experiment with R&B sounds and emotions and subject matters but in a way I just felt like it kind of went horribly horribly wrong I mean the album shop for dark moody and depressing but I think it just ended up sounding kind of whiny a little douchey and it was mostly because of the lyrics a lot of misogyny and drug endorsements and partying and trivial relationship stuff not that those subject matters are bad but I felt like they weren't really handled with all that much poeta sysm I just felt like some of the lyrics were really trashy and shallow what do you want I still came away from this thing thinking you know this guy's experimenting he's got his own style and whether or not I like a weekend album I've got to respect that then the EP Thursday dropped about five months later and you know the production was noticeably better it got up to a little bit but I was still catching a lot of lyrics on these tracks that I didn't care for even Drake who was one of the guys who originally co-signed this project appeared on here spitting a verse and you know honestly I liked hearing the weekend on Drake stuff more than I like hearing the Drake on the weekend stuff I didn't review Thursday but I didn't come away hating it I just kind of felt like I was on the fence with it so just before Christmas the weekend drops this new tape brand new tape echoes of silence and I liked it a lot ah-oh and I think echoes of silence pushes past the previous two releases in every way the production on this thing is a lot better just the sounds are larger the atmosphere is more vast and some of the vocal effects that really annoyed me on previous weekend releases are just not here I feel like echoes is way more upfront with Abel's voice it feels more nude I guess sure there are some edits and some spots of reverb here and there on his voice that are very apparent but his voice just feels really bare and to prove how great the vocals are in the weekend the project faces its biggest challenge yet and that's a Michael Jackson cover of the song Dirty Diana and that's kind of fitting when you consider what the weekend usually sings about but still huge shoes to fill it's the King of Pop off-the-wall thriller and bad or killer albums and not just anybody can step up to bat on these songs in my opinion I think the weekend passes with flying colors on this track it has the explosion of drama and catchiness that the original does but it has this dark sad depression that the weekend is known for brought into the equation Abel's voice some range show some really eerie similarities to Michaels and it's so close sometimes it's almost like listening to a remix and with all these heavy beats and rising cents and really chilly background vocals it's an excellent take on the song it almost feels like industrial at some spots but still after the cover was over I figured you know I'm not going to like the rest of the songs the lyrics are going to be different the vocals are going to be different it's not going to be a song I'm already familiar with it's just going to go downhill but that wasn't the case though I feel like instead of falling back on its usual R&B flavor the weekend sticks with pop on the second track Montreal here the weekend crafts are really lean and memorable pop tune with relatable lyrics it's not just a really uneventful song where you get a repetitive B for five minutes with nothing but just vocalizing about a drug binge over it the song Montreal opens up with lyrics sung in French and then develops into this kind of tasteful story about loneliness love and a relationship on the rocks and even when this thing gets on the subject of sex on the next track it doesn't feel cheap like previous weekend tracks it's not like I'm hearing lyrics like fuck you right instead I'm hearing this story about how one person is sleeping with another despite the fact that there are memories of an ex in that person's head and kind of the sour addition to the stories that both people know the same goes for the party tracks on this album they don't really feel cheap or shallow I actually feel the depression this time the situation actually feels serious the party isn't fun anymore all the drugs alcohol and sex are leading to addiction drained bank accounts and lost time your father doesn't know where you are there's no rent money your mother is crying because she found your bag of weed and the laundry I feel like these moments are painted with the same powerful imagery that Danny Brown pulled out on tracks like party all the time and nosebleed off of the triple XL let me drop last year and of course the synthesizers and the beat behind this track are just huge and mournful it's like they're kind of acknowledging that the person being sung about in the song is already dead but the thing is it's not over the drugs and the sex and the twisted nosov the lyrics on this album gets even deeper on the next song I mean Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas requiem for a dream kind of twisted and it's interesting because as the drugs are getting heavier on the fifth track initiation the vocals are getting all manipulated and pitch shifted in really unpredictable directions almost like the listener is tripping out along with the person being son about it's kind of disturbing and when the song ends this release slips into slightly less unsettling territory with same old song which is kind of a personal story about passing up the chance to be with a girl who didn't want you when you were nothing but now that you're something she's calling and that's not really the most unique story in music but what's kind of funny is that I feel like that gets acknowledged in the hook talking about how this girl and the situation itself is like the same old song and I like the able is just really belting out these lyrics over the hook I mean I am really feeling this hook threw him off I love how he left all of his really huge breaths in while he was singing that hook it just really kind of made a feel even more emotive to just it just felt really just really crushing of course really moody instrumental helps the situation it has this really lumbering beat very kind of subtle icy guitar in the background the song the fall is okay I wish it was more eventful but the beat is decent produced by clams Casino and it does have an interesting story showing that there's always kind of a shade of doubt in the background somewhere no matter how confident the weekend gets the track talks about Fame being kind of like a drug high and it doesn't last forever in fact pretty much every song from track 6 to track 9 talks about how Fame has somehow changed ables love life or personal life and it's not like he comes off cocky or insecure or overcompensating like some artists sign it's more like listen you're only trying to get with me because I'm starting to get popular it's not going to last forever anyway you're crazy echoes of silence brings the personality the lyrics and the level of production I would have liked to have heard from this project in the first place but you know it's been pretty interesting following the weekends exploits up until this point and the fact that I thought this thing was great only kind of makes my mouth water even more when I think about the album the weekend has coming out later this year so as far as R&B goes the weekend is definitely more creative sound rich and more interesting than any other R&B artist out there I feel like that was true since house of balloons but at this point with echoes of silence I feel like that actually means something right now I feel like this is the bar and it's set here I'm feeling a decent two strong 8 on this thing thought it was great but um let me know what you think do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next do you feel like there's actually been a noticeable improvement a change in this project or am I just crazy and liking it all of a sudden I don't know Anthony Fantana The Weeknd echoes of silence burn [Music] you [Music] 
U78NIj16Ou0,guided by voices they're back hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this is the latest LP from guided by voices a legendary Ohio indie rock group I mentioned them in my recent Neutral Milk Hotel review where I said they were experimenting and innovating along with some of the greatest underground and Lofa rock acts of the 90s and part of what made guided by voices so unique is just the amount of influences that their music showcase just psychedelic rock British Invasion blues garage punk and post-punk prog rock art rock power pop noise just avant-garde tracks that didn't really seem to have any kind of form or direction guided by voices albums are notorious for just not sticking to one thing which is what part of what keeps listening through guided by voices album so interesting because you never know where the next song is gonna go the only thing that brought many of these bands releases any consistency was their low fiber cording style Robert Pollard's vocals and just this general oddness now this is the first album guided by voices has released since a hiatus they imposed on themselves in 2004 and now they're back with an older older lineup that used to be around when guided by voices was considered to be putting out some of their best material and this album is kind of being promoted as a return to form or return to some of the Bands best LPS like be thousand and alien lanes and even though the hiatus guided by voices took wasn't really all that long this band getting back together has stirred up a lot of talk again and it doesn't look like these guys are going to jump in and jump out either because we've got this record and another record coming down the pipe spring this year titled class clown spots a UFO but for now we have this record the first installment says these guys have gotten back together let's go eat the factory on this LP we have almost two dozen songs of various lengths styles and audio qualities guided by voices really is up to its old tricks again because they have really turned their back on the cleaner sounds and the more developed songwriting or the more traditional songwriting rather that was on their later releases this LP is pretty much everything you would expect from a classic guided by voices album it really has everything maybe it's not as low Phi as it used to be but I think the only thing it's truly truly missing is the nineties you know like a time period when this stuff would have sounded fresh and groundbreaking not to say this album is terrible not to say it's bad but sometimes going backwards to reclaim past glory can be a little like setting yourself up for failure hardcore fans will be pleased and that's not necessarily a bad thing as far as the meat and potatoes of this album goes I just think it's a load of hits and misses but it's mostly hits right from the opening track the the very distorted and low fyg ATAR chords are back drums are buried in the mix and Robert Pollard's very aged vocalists just kind of lost in the chaos and the track still has that guided by voices calling card of of sounding like something I've heard somewhere before but kind of like a bizarro version of it the next moment on this LP where a song really hits me is definitely don't afore a snow man it's one of the weirdest and prettiest tunes on this album these really lazy flat vocals are delivering this this very strange and surreal imagery that I have no idea how to interpret and you know even though the vocals do feel a little off pitch they're kind of also very calming to me too because they don't seem very eerie forceful just really chill though the guitar chords just had this really kind of friendly character to them and the overall feel the song is just really and inviting the tune is sure but it ties everything up really nicely toward the end the track hang mr. kite is a nice change of pace on the album there is nothing in the way of Pollard's voice and he just has this kind of godly atmospheric reverb on his vocal he is singing about this kite there are these very sobering cellos in the background it just has this heavy heavy feeling of seriousness to it but I don't know what is so serious about it as far as length goes it's another short track but guided by voices really knows how to pack a lot of punch when they want to in a short amount of time another track where I feel like Pollard's voice kind of steals the spotlight is my Europa and that song is nothing more than just his vocal and a guitar with a with a watery sort of affect on it it's kind of noisy but the vocal melody in the hook is just really striking to me the song old bones which actually in a way kind of sounds like a very chilled out sense scape diversion of auld lang syne was so pretty that I almost I wanted to cry a little bit to it those are like my favorites you know but there are a lot of tracks on here that I feel like have nice qualities but they don't stick to me all that much the song waves has this really kind of fun droney quality to it Imperial race horsing has a really nice touch of horns on it and the big hat and Toy Show is like a blues jam going horribly horribly wrong but in a kind of a luring way a lot of tracks on here just don't have hooks that stick with me or they end so abruptly they don't leave an impact I just know some of the tracks here would have been more likable to me if they were more fleshed out and I know that's that's a weird request or expectation for a guided by voices record but that sometimes I just feel like this album is just a scramble of different song sketches I think some people would call it filler I wouldn't call it filler though because some of the song ideas on here pretty good overall I thought this helped he was pretty good not exactly breaking new ground something for the fans but still standing proudly as a righteous pillar of we yes but what does Cal think sky with their voices it's not like I'm a psychic now lalla gist we have fun here feelin a strong six yeah but a strong six on this but what do you think do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantino guided by voices forever 
VhsLsnnCaMU,hey hey hey hey hey hey Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the internet purple naked ladies the Internet is a neo-soul and experimental R&B project from two members of Odd Future Sid the Kid and Matt Martians aka the jet age of tomorrow these guys aren't really the flagship members of Odd Future but that's kind of the reason I was excited to hear this thing because well they're not Hodgy Beats or Tyler the Creator they're going to be different different there have been two jet age of tomorrow releases so far and they've mostly consisted of instrumentals blends of electronic and soul music ambient music hip hop and as far as Sid goes we're really yet to hear from her in a full-length album capacity so I did kind of go into this LP hoping I would hear something that would kind of just salvage my hope in odd future because pretty much everything they've put out this year has just not done anything for me but after numerous listens this debut LP from the Internet does not sound all that much different from a jet age of tomorrow album bubble just a combination of soul hip hop R&B electronics that all feels like it was thrown together quickly in fruity loops and the worst thing about this album is that it kind of sounds like things that I love but it it just stops short of being that when I hear this album I just hear this really Spacey synthetic world of R&B and jazz and electronics that reminds me of artists like Thundercat or the logos or even subtract I might throw in there and maybe that Erykah Badu album that came out last year but purple naked ladies does not impress me on the same levels that that those artists do I mean just kind of take the intro track for example violet nude women it's kind of Spacey an atmosphere but it's also a little and - once the song ends up falling into the groove later in the track I just hear this really tinny guitar that I don't like it all these cooing vocals that kind of get buried underneath this mess of sequence percussion and synthesizers it just like I said feels like a mess there are all these sounds here that feel like they're in the same key but they don't really manage to complement each other in any obvious way most of the beats and instrumentals on this thing just kind of passed me by didn't really stick with me or impress me or anything like that and some of them just felt really really really lazy kind of like fast lane and Lincoln there were only a handful of beats on here that I really thought were great the song visions for one had a fantastic beat that was really clear groove going on and I loved the chopped-up guitar freezes on there those were very nice touch the instrumental just has this really kind of watery quality to it and some great vocals from a guest vocalist on here Koko oh but the sad thing about that track is that it's so kind of short so short that it doesn't really kind of leave an impact on me I guess the song she don't give a fuck had a really nice jazzy feel to the instrumental and the song cont was pretty out there had a lot of nice transitions in it but it just didn't add up into a track that I thought was great the instrumental on lovesong felt really really tender felt really sweet I loved the cute little shy synth chords kind of stashed away in the background the beats are one thing I just kind of feel like I'm on the fence with them where this album doesn't really do it for me at all are with the vocals and with the lyrics since singing voice when you measure it up to other musicians in this style of music is not that strong I mean one of her guests koko out sings her by by a mile Syd's voice just does not carry much of a tune I would say on spots on here like the introduction to the song cocaine her voice almost borders on just tone-deafness and on a handful the tracks here it feels like SIDS voice is kind of fighting to be heard with some of these instrumentals - you know there are some spots here where the vocals do feel decent like on the first verse they say shangri-la but they're just not consistently decent you know and as far as the lyrics go I feel like they kind of show that this LP is kind of shallow like many other odd future releases take the song cocaine for example definitely one of the most mindless drug songs I've ever heard in my life to be completely honest it doesn't even look at the upsides or the downsides of cocaine or talk about cocaine poetically the lyrics just kind of paint this really short and vague story of Syd trying to seduce someone into into doing coke with lyrics like just follow me and do you want to do some kind of okay I just don't like the lyrics at all what's even worse is that left-brain who is really not one of odd futures best rappers comes in and spits this really short verse I'm high on coke she high on coke coast to coast baby flow of my boat a lot of the love and lust songs on here are just as empty you know don't assume that just because you're hearing a love song it's deep there's just a lot of filler lyrics on these tracks like hey baby hey girl I'll never forget you you know I love you you know I care a lot of the lyrics on here just so corny and overused and I have to admit because of that there are some tracks on here that I liked like she knows and web of me because I couldn't really make out a lot of the lyrics overall to me this album just feels thrown together the vocals are pretty off sometimes the lyrics really aren't that great a few of the tracks feature odd futures least interesting MCS but this album is pretty consistent in its direction and its sound in its style I feel like the Internet knows what it wants to do but it hasn't exactly done it yet yet kind of feeling a white for strong three to a light four on this LP but what do you guys think of it do you like it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana the internet forever [Music] 
IB4kTLN15y0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and this video is the last review of classics review week Neutral Milk Hotel in the aeroplane over the sea originally I was not planning to review this album I even kind of made a video about how I wasn't planning to review this album and why I was talking about the virally infectious and sometimes ridiculous cult status that this album has I asked you guys what you thought about it and you let me know and some of you made some really convincing arguments talking about how the people who are making a mockery of this LP are in the minority and if that's all I address I sort of let them win I'm sort of making a mountain out of the molehill of jokes that there are around the internet in regards to this album and not making a video where I kind of focus away from those things hurts this album more than it helps it plus the thing is reviewing this album really isn't that big of a deal an album is really only as important as you make it out to be so Neutral Milk Hotel was an experimental indie and full crock banned from Ruston Louisiana they only came out with a couple albums in their very short discography and the second that they dropped just so happens to be one of the most celebrated releases in underground music released back in 1998 people still go nuts for this album and it just has this staying power that not a lot of releases see but for me it's it's not hard to understand why I think this album has a lot of great qualities going for it this thing has a really bold sound built out of inspiration from noise rock from psychedelic rock and folk music hailing from Scotland Eastern Europe and America plus there is a heavy in luhan's coming from the 90s lo-fi rock scene contemporaries like guided by voices and said oh so this album definitely has a lot of influences going for it but on top of that it's extremely well arranged colorfully arranged with singing saws and horns and accordion keyboards bagpipes as well and plus the usual suspects are here acoustic guitar warm heavy distorted overblown bass and some really hard-hitting drums too with all these different sounds and textures in the aeroplane over the seat perfectly complements heaviness and noise and aggression with tenderness and beauty it's a style the project really built up to with a handful of demos and a debut album on Avery Island Avery is not the preferred album but it shares a lot of elements within the aeroplane a lot of the songs on here have similar chord progressions a very low fie and overblown sound influences from folk music psychedelic rock music and very surreal lyricism to all it was really missing was this just cohesive theme when I listened to in the aeroplane over the sea as opposed to Avery Island I feel like I'm really partaking in a story plus in the aeroplane just had this grand Jubilee of horns and just all this extra instrumentation to really kind of bring it to a next level plus in the airplane really has a a daunting a daunting sadness that just is hard to deny and it's hard to deny because it just does not let up almost every song on this LP looks for a different way to advance that feeling so funny is that sometimes I don't even know why this album gets me so emotional and and I guess I say I don't know why because it's not like I really get a clear clear and totally comprehensible story out of any one of these songs of course people have read interviews that talk about what has inspired these lyrics but what inspired these lyrics and what these lyrics actually are are two different things I just prefer to take the lyrics as they are the less you know the more disturbing they kind of become the imagery is so vivid and yet when I actually try to imagine what Jeff Mangum is singing about on these tracks it's like my brain has this malfunction it's like does not compute we really remember I mean how exactly does one picture a little boy in Spain playing pianos filled with flames it doesn't look like that no the lyrics are really where this album hits hardest for me I think everything else on this LP is great but it wouldn't add up to as much as it does if it wasn't for Jeff Mangum using his lyricism to build from scratch this really surreal world of two-headed boys ghosts tomatoes and radio wire the abstract imagery on this thing is so out there sometimes it rivals the fantasy world created in the book Alice in Wonderland the stories sometimes just feel so nonsensical but for me they have such a huge emotional impact anyway with all these themes of death and God and love and genocide and war and saving somebody's life and intimacy and family and all these stories are delivered in Jeff Mangum's kind of nasally voice it's it's weird it's like there's no stomach in his voice whatsoever it's like it's all up here and on a good chunk of this album he's like kind of straining his voice partially out of trying to reach the higher points of his register and partially because he's just forcing himself to sing so hard and so loud the dude must have a massive lung capacity because if you actually try to sing along with this album you'll see it's it's pretty difficult sometimes it's like the dude will go a whole verse without taking a breath I know there are some people out there who don't like Jeff's voice and are not going to like Jeff's voice but I enjoy it has a unique tone to it and he's on pitch for the most part and he just showcases a lot of personality and a lot of passion another critique this album often gets is it's simple simple chords simple songs simple melodies it's really simple but you know I think that's kind of an odd point an album being bad because it's simple I mean this thing is pretty funky it's not exactly looking to be technical overly progressive or anything like that but I do see the complaint you know if you've been playing guitar consistently for a year you can most likely play every single song on this album if you were handed the chords but I think the simplicity issue is a little overblown I mean take for example the way the king of carrot flowers part two builds up so noisily and so heavily into part three or the way the song ghost escalates towards its finish line not every album and band can do that stuff the greatness of these songs doesn't come out in their blueprint of the the chords and the melody is written out on a piece of sheet music the greatness comes out and their performance take the title track for example the chords over the verses in the title track are the same exact chords to that famous doo-wop song earth angel in fact they're the same exact chords to that little ditty that you hear at the end of every single one of my reviews same chords same chords however Neutral Milk Hotel 'z take on these chords doesn't sound anything like those two other songs it's layered to be really kind of noisy and sweet with these singing saws and and a nice trumpet solo lots of fuzzy acoustic guitar strumming and I love the melody that Jeff is belting out with his voice to all of these elements just make me feel so happy and kind of uplifted despite the fact that some of the lyrics are kind of morbid every track on this album does bring a little bit of a different feeling for me though even though the total package to me is is kind of sad personally the king of carrot flowers parts two and three the way the song just busts into this high-speed distorted bass and drum part it's really thrilling it's like riding a bicycle down a really steep hill at 50 miles an hour and you've got no brakes the song two-headed boy even though it's really acoustic and stripped-down there's not a lot to it it sounds so urging and just fiery the song the fool is a great instrumental it's really lumbering it's just really depressing it's got this Balkan brass kind of feel to its style it's like a funeral march and the song oh come Lee later on that album makes that feeling just even heavier and all of these different emotional and sonic highs and lows just flow together so nicely the king of Kara flowers part one is a fantastic opener it's kind of like opening up a book it's like the the call me Ishmael love of indie music and the transition into parts two and three just starts with this really kind of ominous drone it's almost as if I'm listening to a string section in a pit orchestra just lay on this constant note building up to something really epic the heavily arranged an instrumental fool is a great partner to the strip down at the strip down and simple two-headed boy the loud and furious Holland 19:45 is put up right against the slow and soundscape e communist daughter and the track ghost just kind of breaks into this great untitled instrumental bit that's just like a musical explosion of bagpipes and heavy drumbeats and bass and song two-headed boy part two it's it's just like the perfect closer it's the last page complementing the first page that was king of Kara flowers part one there's just a lot of tension and release on this album a lot of hot and cold highs and lows this thing is always taking a different turn with its next track there's not much else I can think to say about this album it's just fantastic it's cohesive there's a lot of different flavors on here as well somatic and make memorable surreal and ambitious and it brings a range of different feelings out of me it just excites me it depresses me it inspires me and soothes me all in one 40-minute listen I think it's a great album I'm going to continue loving the hell out of it for the foreseeable future and you know keep in mind I'm not saying you have to like it I'm not saying you have to think it's amazing I'm not saying you have to buy into the hype I think this album has its flaws sure if you like your songs to be more straightforward more readable less kind of abstract I could understand that if you like your music to be a little more complicated a little more progressive I can understand that but what's important is that if you haven't heard this album take a listen to it and form your own opinion what does this album mean to you how does it make you feel let me know Anthony Fantana Neutral Milk Hotel in the aeroplane over the sea forever [Music] you 
SqntE3jS43k,vielen classic hey everybody Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd classics Week continues with a review of the Marvin Gaye album what's going on Marvin Gaye is unquestionably one of the greatest and most influential soul singers to have ever lived the dude spent most of his life in the music business singing writing doing session drumming as well and a lot of his early career was spent singing soul pop duo op standards and he turned out some hits that are still widely celebrated today like how sweet it is to be loved by you and what's probably the most famous cover of heard through the grapevine he also put out a handful of very notable duet records with soul singer Tammi Terrell one of which featured the most popular version of ain't no mountain high enough now in the latter half of Marvin's career he kind of strengthened his image as a sex symbol by dealing in the funkier and smoother side of soul which dominated the 70s tracks like let's get it on I want you and one of his last hits sexual healing but these two sections of Marvin's career are separated by this album and this year just so happens to mark the 40th anniversary of this LP too for Marvin this record was a huge change in sound in subject matter and in the amount of control he had over the music he was making he deviated from his usual Motown sound to make what is his most widely known album and it's funny that this record is the one in his discography that is the biggest and considered to be the most untouchable I'm just saying the general public usually prefers its music to be a bit more blissful but you've got to consider that this record came out in the 70s which wasn't exactly the brightest spot in American history yeah the Vietnam War going on Nixon was in office there were all sorts of protests feminists and environmentalists were gaining ground in the mainstream it was a time when people most of which I'm sure were the young music buying public saw the world around them and they didn't like the way it looked and they wanted some kind of way to change it and what's going on just seems like an appropriate soundtrack for that the album opens up with the title track and the first single from this LP and it really kind of sets the lyrical stage for this LP promoting love together 'no sand a really strong anti-war message and it focuses on the way all this turmoil effects individual people brothers mothers sisters fathers Marvin Gaye really tries to make listeners connect with what's going on by kind of bringing this family aspect into the lyrics and in most cases something like this would just hit me as as corny I think maybe it's it's a decent critique to say this album is pretty corny sometimes that's how I felt about it at first but Marvin to me just comes across so positive and sincere in what he's saying and the production just makes the world that Marvin is sending this message from seem so heavenly and beautiful it kind of makes me want to be a part of it I can feel this way about the entire album but I think this song specifically cleanses the soul if somebody really listens to it I think it has the potential to just tear every shred of hate out of a person you can call me a dirty hippie with bad facial hair if you want but I think the world would be a lot better off more people took the message behind this song to heart now the side of this track the sound of this album to me is stellar usually I'm not so much into really arranged and string kissed pop in soul music but the strings just are worked into this album so well and the grooves move along really fluidly most of my issues with tracks that are really heavily arranged is that the groove kind of gets lost in the mess on here the grooves stay intact there's this vast atmospheric reverb on Marvin Gaye's vocals that are very soothing background vocals as well they're warm nimble bass lines all over this album as well as very light hand percussion too lots of finger snaps like I said these very honey-flavored string arrangements they're smooth saxophone flourishes interjecting on one song after another and then there's Marvin's vocal he is the cherry on top he's got such a strong voice just so much strength in every part of his range just so much control passion charisma and all of his vocal improv throughout these tracks really add to the album for me too but it moved the first track just kind of quickly segues into the second track a lot of the tracks on this album just kind of flow into one another without a barrier in between and I like that a lot it makes the second track on here kind of feel like part 2 of the first because it does deal in a lot of the same feelings and lyrical subject matters that the first track does but it's kind of song from the standpoint of a soldier who's just come home from war and it's pretty funny how four years later a lot of the messages on this LP are still pretty relevant Marvin drifts away from this portrait of a soldier to pull out a track on the third song that deals with drug addiction on flyin high and that song just takes an interesting turn of mood as it just kind of segues into Save the Children which is a pretty self-explanatory song title definitely the corniest moment on here but I think the track beautifully packages the argument the idea that we should live today thinking about how the world will look tomorrow because the next generation is going to have to live in it now what's interesting is that two tracks on the album god is love and holy Olli kind of reveal the feelings the sentiments behind this album as being kind of religiously inspired it reproduces standpoint and the song mercy mercy me kind of attacks things from an environmental angle now overall what's going on has a really solid sound and style going for it it doesn't really vary all that much from the idea of soul it doesn't change up its instrumentation a whole lot there is one notable change in sound on here though and it's the seven-minute track right on which has a very Latin flavor to its rhythm section in piano chords I can't really say much else about this record other than I give it a really high high recommendation it's just a really fantastic piece of soul a seminal record for the genre it's uplifting it's positive it's a righteous record it's very feel-good it's well performed well recorded well written I can't really think of anything that I personally take issue with on here I mean yeah I could totally agree with you or understand where you're coming from if this record is too sweet for you maybe it's a little too slick overproduced I personally am not much of a religious person so maybe I don't completely relate to when this album goes down that road but I think the messages behind this LP are something that even a secular person can get behind I'm going to leave it at that what do you guys think of this record do you love it do you hate it have you heard it is it one of your faves does this record speak to you or is it just kind of to Cal Church esta really quick quick Marvin Gaye what's going on forever [Music] 
hp_14jSV8cQ,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm here to do a question statement comment thing as everybody knows I've been sort of reviewing some of my favorite albums ever this week some classics and of course over the course of doing these reviews I've been getting tons and tons and tons of requests and messages and comments asking me to review the seminal Neutral Milk Hotel album in the aeroplane over the sea of course this is the first time somebody's asked me to review this record I've been getting requests to review this record for years and I'm not complaining I'm always flattered that you guys are interested in what I think about a song record a band whatever but I am hesitant to review this album and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the music on it in fact I own this record I love it I think it's one of the best in the genre the reason I'm hesitant to review this album is because there's this really kind of unique cult fanaticism surrounding this LP that not a lot of artists and albums have this is in the case of in the aeroplane over the sea there is fanaticism and some of it sounds like the fanaticism that you would find with any other band but a lot of it is stuff like this it's a potato it's a tambourine semen-stained the mountain tops I love you Jesus cries yeah Frank and Frank and Frank can't gah gah gah gah gah gah gah boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo it's like when people bring this album up there's this subtly intentional comedy to it in their heads like the more they mention this album post-its album cover and mentioned catchphrases from it the funnier it gets so it kind of makes me wonder am i reviewing music or am i reviewing a meme I think this thing is a fantastic record an amazingly abstract and beautiful record but the fact that it's kind of become a series of jokes to be typed and repeated in all caps all over the internet is really depressing to me and I think it destroys the feelings behind this record and the thing is if you think this album is amazing as I do then you probably don't need me to come in here and then say it's good and justify your tastes I just I just I just I just have a sneaking suspicion that a great deal of the people begging me to review this album just want me to fan the flames of this meme wildfire it's to a point where the joke is overshadowing the music itself now if you haven't heard this album screw the hype screw the repeated and recycled catchphrases just listen to it for yourself hear it out open heart open mind if ever seems to be a point in time when this album can be reviewed and then taken seriously then I'll consider it until then anything I put out about this album including this video will most likely continue this series of jokes that kind of makes a mockery of this LP so what do you think is this album still music or has the internet essentially turned it into a meme is the fanaticism behind this LP mostly people joking or is there some love in there to do Anthoni Fantana in the aeroplane over the sea forever [Music] 
oqWkfcdYvvs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another album review classics week continues celebrating 50k 50k wu-tang clan enter the wu-tang 36 chambers wu-tang is a still active New York hip-hop outfit that was formed in the early 90s this is their debut LP dropped in 1993 and it's been followed up with numerous studio albums since but whoo tang is one of those groups whose debut LP kind of overshadows the rest of their albums people usually don't give the rest of their material the time of day even though albums like their sophomore LP wu-tang forever are pretty good but that's not a huge issue since every single one of the group's nine members has released solo material and a lot of that is as essential as 36 chambers like Ghostface Killah solo stuff which is my favorite out of all of the wu-tang clan's solo release material fish-scale ironman supreme clientele also Raekwon with only built 4 Cuban Linx parts 1 & 2 ol Dirty Bastard with the return of the 36 chambers the dirty version and of course we can't forget the jizzes Liquid Swords those are some of my favorites but no matter how much I like those albums this release is the Alpha this is where it all goes back to this is where it starts and you must start now whoo tang and this album were an essential part to the evolving face of hip-hop in the 90s this album is a move past the golden age hip-hop sounds that came out in the 80s the jazz rap and socially conscious rap sounds that were being dropped by groups like De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest in the in the very early 90s and late 80s and the West Coast sounds of gangsta rap that were being dropped at the time too by guys like Ice Cube and waa and dr. dre keep in mind this is just a really quick abridged version of this evolution there are a lot more artist sounds and albums at work here because when people talk about this era of hip-hop especially the west coast side of things groups like freestyle fellowship for example are often forgotten so in the early in mid 90s the New York hip-hop scene was reinventing itself as something much grittier tougher more aggressive and ready to battle of course there are a lot of individual New York emcees that played a role in that like nas and notorious b.i.g but wu-tang definitely stuck out and was unique in their amount of members not to say that none of these guys would have made it if they've stayed solo their entire career but wu-tang power clearly comes from strength in numbers because with nine different people and seeing on these really hard-hitting stripped down beats this album sort of gives the atmosphere the feel of a never-ending cypher a rap battle there are a couple songs here where one MC will take the spotlight Method Man where Method Man is all over that song and of course claim in the front where GZA is pretty much featured on that track but on the majority of the tracks here is just one MC after another taking turns on these beats and because of that it sounds like they're way more hyped than they would be otherwise it's like a competition it makes this record come off with just a lot of energy and energy that is really infectious and with tracks that have gang courses like ain't nothing to fuck with and these really hard hard grooves and rize's beats this album has just a ton of momentum which makes it really hard for me to just not go nuts when listening to this thing and because most of this album sounds like a rap battle there's a very specific kind of lyricism going on amidst these tracks hilarious insults cartoony violence a barrage of brags and non sequiturs and cultural references there's about as much ferocity and testosterone on this as like a hardcore punk record so there's no question that enter the wu-tang is meant to be raw rugged dirty and stoned but it's music you know it's entertainment there's no reason to take a lot of the violence and bragging on this LP that seriously because it's so outlandish and ridiculous the real goal here is just to kind of be extreme and out there which i think is definitely highlighted on a sketch that comes before the song Method Man where they're kind of going back and forth talking about torture and another clear goal here is just to be clever funny witty if you can get into the lyricism on this thing you're going to hear a lot of great wordplay and a lot of fantastic quotables and to add another level of greatness to this record I love that every single emcee on this thing comes into these tracks with a different sound and a different style I hate it when I'm listening to a rap track and it's got two three four MCS on it and they all sound the same none of them have any flavor you can't really pull anybody out is being any kind of specific or bold thing not the case here everyone on this album has their own angle Ghostface Killah is the most hyped MC out of all of them he mostly works in the upper register of his voice throws out a lot of battle raps the GZA is extremely cunning and clever in the rhymes he chooses Raekwon has this nice rasp to his voice and he pulls out a lot of vivid street life imagery Method Man has this really kind of partytime attitude he's really chilled out laid-back looking for a good time at every possible direction and ol Dirty Bastard who I think isn't the most lyrical here but he's the most fun to listen to he combines rapping with this really weird kind of off kazoo like it's he's nuts or he was rather he's got this really low voice he slurs all of his words he's like a rabid dog now let's talk about the beats a little bit I guess the beats on this thing definitely helped bring wu-tang together into this aesthetic of course there was kind of a battle rap cypher thing going on amongst these tracks but there was also a certain sound to the music behind the rapping of course the name of the group is a tribute to old kung fu movies and that definitely gets brought home in a lot of the samples and clips of dialogue from these films too in the lyrics there's a lot of talk of swordplay and martial arts and it really kind of brings this album a huge sense of of camaraderie like you're coming up against a gang of lyrical ninjas in a hip-hop dojo but overall the beats here I think it's just kind of a case of of less is more because it's not like there's a whole lot to them and not to say that they're not intricate not to say that the sounds on these beats aren't interesting I'm just saying it's definitely not like a lot of modern hip-hop which is just saturated with a ton of different sounds poppin melodic catchy hooks R&B singers on this thing like a lot of hip-hop at the time there are ton of piano samples but RZA didn't just pick some kind of sweet or soulful piano break or something like that it seemed almost as if he was choosing the most sour weird most unused melodies notes and chords that he could get his hands on because claimed in the front 7th chamber and Method Man all have really weird piano phrases laid into the beat and there are even moments like cream where all the samples come together to create something that's really kind of chilled out atmospheric and eerie the drums on here have a really punchy analogue sound that's really kind of typical for hip-hop at that time really kind of classic style and there are some songs on here that clearly sample music from the very kung-fu movies that inspire the group's aesthetic - there's just one unique sound after another in every one of these beats and it just adds to the aggressive and unsettling atmosphere of this album they're very textured instrumentals that just leave a lot of room just make space for the lyrics for the emceeing and that's perfect to me like I said these beats are just saturated with a ton of sounds like today's hip-hop and not to dis where hip-hop has gone I mean I don't think today's hip-hop is terrible I just think it's interesting when you consider how much hip-hop has changed in the almost 20 years since this album has been released so yeah on this LP there are a lot of brags battle raps and tough personalities and beats but it's not like that's the entirety of this album there are some spots on here that are worth kind of thinking about the deeper meaning of like the song cream which stands for cash rules everything around me and even though it sounds like a really kind of greedy and stereotypical hip-hop statement that song isn't really a celebration of that it's just kind of a really gritty picture of what it's like to grow up poor and you're in a position where making very fast illegal money seems like the only way out of that and the song tears which comes around the end of this LP is about friends and family members dying after making some bad decisions like deciding to have unprotected sex with a lot of different people or refusing to hand money over to somebody who's trying to mug you at gunpoint 36 Chambers is definitely an aggressive album but it's not an aggression that should make you feel threatened it's an aggression that you get you pumped this thing is just a messy grimy and unbreakable 90s hip-hop album and there's not much more to it than that this thing is a classic it's an important part of hip hop's history but if you're not a hip hop fan I'm not going to promise to you that this thing is going to change your worldview if you haven't heard this album after all 36 chambers is the archetype for a lot of the lyricism we hear in hip hop today if you haven't heard this thing before and you're just not all that school than 90's hip hop in general try this thing out and at least get a sense for where a lot of modern hip hop's ideas come from just to kind of hear them at their best for that time wu-tang 36 chambers counter chesa no one's who you know is matching up the couch asta when i spit this floor it's more electrical than Tesla send your support please free Cal so I could do some shows and tour your locale you could quote me here my rhymes are brand and clever I'm saying it now but you'll be saying it forever you 
MCu9UD2aVlw,frank zappa here hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review continuing reviews of some of my favorite albums ever classics if you want to use the c-word this is not going to be a regular segment I'm only doing it for this week my heart is just not into constantly reviewing older albums I'd much rather focus on new stuff because that's what I cares about the mostest I respect the past but I don't live in it however there's no reason we can't you know do this just right now to celebrate 50k right so to continue this week I would love to talk about the Frank Zappa album hot rats Frank Zappa guitarist composer singer rock icon and musical eccentric any conversation focusing on the weirder side of American music should at least mention Frank Zappa for sure not only has the guy written a plethora a plethora of experimental music over the course of his career but there are some serious musical chops to be found in his discography but I think the most memorable attribute Zappa had to offer in his music was definitely his personality when I think of Frank Zappa's personality and how it fits into his music it's almost as if a musician from the 2000s had got transported back to the 1960s and 70s because of the sheer level of self-awareness that Zappa put into his music he was a guy that just loved to make fun of everything including what he did for a living he laced his humor and his worldview in his music at just about every opportunity that he could zappa's music poked fun at hippies and the 60s on the seminal album were only in it for the money and less than ten years later on Zoop the lures he was making fun of the disco set and his other albums are also loaded with about teen angst and love and sex and rock and roll as well as Fame and societal norms however how rats is where a lot of the joking gets kind of cast aside in order to create a set of mostly instrumental and exceptional jazz rock and jazz fusion songs which maybe the most widely admired and known in the genre Zappa was not the only guy playing with these ideas at the time though he had plenty of contemporaries fusing jazz with rock funk an avant-garde composition like Miles Davis Santana Herbie Hancock let's not forget the soft machine as well as one of my all-time favorites the Mahavishnu Orchestra but Zappa's jazz rock tracks have a much different attitude than the songs of those artists were were putting together I know I said on this record earlier the joking kind of gets put aside but the sound the style the the feelings that get conveyed on this album are so much brighter and more fun and kookier in comparison to those artists which is not usually something Rock and especially jazz fans smile upon since jazz and rocker really deep and really sure your genres of music but Zappa's compositional chops and his is playing on this record are so great it's hard not to admire what's going on here on at least some level if you don't come away from hot rats loving the entire album I think at least the first track is is worth loving or maybe liking this song peaches in regalia starts with a rush of piano chords and what kind of sounds like speedily tremolo picked guitar leads I'm not completely sure how that sound is created to be quite honest I know in the past Zappa has experimented with recording guitar solos to tape and then altering the speed of the tape in order to get an interesting effect I'm not sure if that's what's going on here but whatever it is it's a really interesting sound and gives peaches of flavor that right after this introductory moment brass and woodwinds kind of fly in and it's not like there's any instrument in this spot that hasn't been on another record clarinet saxophone that sort of thing but the way they were kind of pancaked onto one another it creates an interesting sound an interesting tone it's almost as if one instrument is creating this sound and it just ends up being so memorable because of that because of how strange and odd the instruments feel on here and of course Zapp is unique approach to writing melodies only helps that after this some flute and keyboard and guitar kind of alternate for the soloing spotlight on this track and then just before the two-minute mark there's just this Jubilee of bright bright horns that are just so triumphant they come off as being equal parts beautiful and quirky with a really close listen it becomes kind of apparent that this song is really really composed very planned out but it's great because Zappa and the musicians he brought on to this record Jam it out so fluidly it's almost as if it's just stream of consciousness this song is definitely noticeable peak in the Zappa discography in this album it's really zappas compositional side at its sharpest after the opener things get dirtier looser more kind of jammed out if you're expecting you know one kind of meticulously composed jazz rock opus after another you're just not going to get that the rest of the tracks on here have spots that are clearly planned out - just like peaches especially the song son of mr. Greenjeans which is almost the cousin to peaches but most of the remaining songs on here are much longer because they're they're stretched out with solos and improv and that's great for jazz fans and people who love jazz fusion and guitar heroism but maybe not for people who love their songs short sweet simple to the point still I like all the songs following the opener on this thing and the grittiest of all of them comes right after the opener Willie the pimp which features the gravel-voiced Captain Beefheart a predecessor to Tom Waits and he is not shy on this track at all sort of lyrically painting this image of a pimp and shouting and shrieking all over this track like he's really causing a ruckus and just the the groove and the solos just the jam of this track just feels so loaded down and and dirty this track is about as filthy as a whorehouse mattress I would say and there's this really sleazy fiddle playing all over this song which really brings that attitude home things head back in the direction of refinement on the song the son of mr. Greenjeans which like I said is heavily layered and orchestrated just like peaches and regalia but on this song things really get stretched out with a lot of strong soloing and Zappa's playing is just so great on this track I can't help but eat up every note he was just such a great player the guitar was almost an extension of him you can really kind of dive into what he's playing and think about it and see that it's thoughtful but it's so fast and fluid it's almost as if it had no planning or forethought whatsoever following that song is little umbrellas which because of its lack of just blaring guitar solos is almost just a legit jazz song simply jazz not jazz rock almost a jazz song because this track is mostly made of composed moments my one real annoyance with this album is that I feel like little umbrellas could have been so much longer if it had been jammed out this song really isn't as stretched out as it could be and I think it's worth stretching out because the feeling of this track is so much different than the other songs it's more chilled out it kind of lurches forward and it's really kind of sad and mysterious way I'd say it's a lovable monstrous but the lack of strong soloing on that song is made up for on the next track here that song is gumbo variations where Ian Underwood whips out his most fiery performance yet on this album his sax screams for mercy on this song this thing is a 17 minute long combo of jazz funk and rock all the composing and all the planning sort of gets thrown to the curb as saxophone violin and guitar just placed so hard that even I get sweaty the closer it must be a camel kind of sends things off on a really weird note saxophones and drums kind of hit these syncopated angular jagged melodies it's twice the monstrosity of little umbrellas and has a lot more beef to it as well I would just like to say I love the hell out of this album and hot rats is just a standout moment in not just the Zappa discography but in jazz fusion and jazz rock in general I wouldn't say other albums in this style are inferior definitely not but this is one of the only albums that I know that combines jazz and rock with these really colorfully eccentric compositions so if you really value a strong personality unique melody writing jazz this may become a classic for you just as it is for me this thing is definitely one of my favorites and probably will be for the foreseeable future and now Cal Church esta hey everybody Cal Church St here Frank zapper cooking up at DAGs in just 30 seconds flat what delish however I am not much for hot rats or cold rats I don't really care what the temperature is only good rats dead rat all right but in summation whatever Anthony was saying you should listen to over there you should probably listen to it it's a listening full in your ears Fred [Music] you 
-80PEYVeI4E,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I hope all y'all had a good holiday and yes this video is real it's not a trick realness basically this is what I was hinting toward in that video I made about how the channel hit 50k and I had this surprise and we're going to sort of celebrate a little bit by reviewing a couple classic albums this week classic if you want to use the c-word really I'm just picking some of my favorites that I know are kind of well known and people will be excited about if I review them because all too often I get the question will you review some classic albums of you some of our favorite albums reveal some albums hot sure I really love all-time favorite we once 2012 starts we'll get back into the recent stuff and I've already chosen the albums that I'm going to review this week so you know sorry alright the first album I would like to review this week is the seminal LP from Canadian rock band Godspeed you black Emperor lifts your skinny fists like antennas to heaven if this album is not their best it's definitely this group's most praised LP most well-known LP in they're very short and consistent discography this album came out in the year 2000 and is a huge reason why these guys are kingpins in the genre of post rock but that genre label doesn't really say all that much to me since in my opinion these guys don't really sound like any of their contemporaries if post rock is a genre these guys definitely put a different spin on it different than your mug wise and your talk talks and your do makes a thinks you're explosions in the skies your ma knows you're sigur rós --is bras if there was one artist or predecessor that I had to compare this album compare god speed to in general it would have to be the band swans but not like 1980s post-punk noise industrial swans more like the stuff during the latter half of their career the late 90's albums like soundtracks for the blind all the rising instrumentation and sampled vocals and drones and textures on this LP really reminds me of the material on lift your skinny fists even though there were hints of those ideas on god speeds previous efforts this album and the EP that came before it are really where these ideas got refined and tied together into these four meticulously crafted songs for the apocalypse which all kind of come together and add up to just about 90 minutes this album and post-rock both seem to have just something really cinematic about them by Nature this album features tons of rising crescendos and and quiet loads and lots of reverb and atmosphere for added dramatic effect but these are just kind of ideas that fit that post-rock blueprint that go into this album there is so much more going on with this LP than just that there's plenty of ambient music on here noise noise rock spoken-word fueled recordings and found sounds and samples and there's just this really strong Punk fury on this album - in just how urgent and aggressive and just socially and politically conscious this album can be as well as restless and there's a really strong element of classical music on here too but you should not go into this record expecting like a symphonic rock record that's definitely not where this is coming from I see classical because of of course the pianos and the strings and the horns that show up on this album but all all these extra sounds just come together in these highly highly detailed layers and these layers do add up to something that sounds a lot like a pit orchestra but at the end of the day this thing is still a rock album now lift your skinny fists it's a highly highly praised album there's no doubt about that but I would not call it an accessible album or an easy to listen to album by any means even if you are kind of going into it expecting good things unless you already know you love drone you love ambient music and sound scapes you know you love noises and you actually have the time to sit down and listen to this thing all the way through don't expect to be pleased as punch with this album the first go-around I could definitely understand this LP getting criticized as being maybe long-winded kind of pretentious maybe a little depressing too but honestly that doesn't change the fact that I love this thing and it's not like it's the most indulgent thing in the world it's not like listening to Trout mask replica alright so what's actually on here song wise if you take a listen to this thing it's going to kind of be like partaking in an auditory experiment where all the musicians involved try to use sound to paint an accurate picture of the beginning and the end of the world these songs feature really exciting highs and and tear-jerking interludes and really kind of dark angry sad sad sad lows thankfully it starts off on a positive note with the title track or sort of title movement which I have been able to kind of follow along with on this map of the album that comes with the album itself although it is not that accurate of a map being that some songs and movements end before or after they actually say they do over here that's whatever because this first six minutes or so of this LP is some of the most breathtaking beautiful and amazingly layered rock music to ever fall under the genre of post rock just tons of strings shimmering guitars swelling horns these really marching drums and all these instruments just escalate and escalate and escalate layering and building is really where these guys have a fine-tuned strength that is often imitated but not often recreated these guys really value and understand tension as if they're related to it or something the builds on this thing are pretty slow don't expect them to go anywhere fast I mean these songs do go past 20 minutes sometimes but in my opinion God speed really knows how to keep the quieter sides of their builds pretty listenable and engaging with interesting sounds lots of dynamic playing but when it comes to the louder sides of these builds god speed really knows how to prove how cohesive of a group they are and how just detail-oriented these songs are because they're always just getting louder and more intense just as you think these guys have reached the final apex of a build they managed to figure out a way to just get a shade darker or a shade brighter the size of the sounds that God's bee plays with over the course of a build evolve of course but also sometimes the phrases of the strings or just the horn arrangements or the guitar leads will change over the course of a build as well upwards or downwards which is also really nice because it adds to the evolution of the song you're not hearing this one single phrase performed in the one single way you did at the beginning of the song at the end of the song which is awesome because some groups will kinda slouch when it comes to adding extra instruments into their songs because it's an extra instrument it's just kind of there to add another color another texture the strings the pianos and the horns as well there's some glockenspiel on this LP to all those play really pivotal roles on this album from movement to movement to movement kind of a different instrument a different sound takes the spotlight which brings lift your skinny fists some awesome variety as soon as God speed reaches a lot of the tops the tip tip tops of these builds that I've been talking about some times and in its little formulaic they will kind of cut its throat and just let it die really quickly and kind of transition or segue into something different but you know to their credit they always transition into something interesting or just seems like really fluid on this LP like this first movement that I've been talking about as soon as it reaches it and just explodes wildly and these kind of wailing strings are left over in the background it kind of explodes like a firework and the strings left over screaming or kind of like the fading and flickering smithereens left in the air as it falls to the earth those strings kind of develop into a drone and then this guitar very delicately played introduces itself playing the melody to what seems like Amazing Grace it's almost a cover of Amazing Grace actually which eventually builds itself up to be one of the most heavy and riveting versions of the song I've ever heard all of a sudden Godspeed just kind of breaks away with these dissing strings kind of interrupting that song and they just take a turn for something much darker which makes this album feel even more like a movie for me it's like something in the storyline had just changed like a villain had just been introduced a villain something evil something bad because this part of the song sounds like fists clenching and teeth gnashing and bricks going through storefront windows after that track slows down the album goes into a pretty hefty series of ambient interval and soundscapes and and collage music and every moment just feels really kind of vast and eerie and haunting and just just like endless in terms of just its reach its largeness these guys make quiet music that just seems as huge as when they're being loud it's really something that the Tim Hecker fan in me totally gets off on in this series of ambient interludes the most striking moment for me is when this low voice pitch shifted woman's voice start speaking and it seems like she is giving a sermon the woman is talking about God and like I said her voice is kind of slowed down for this weird effect they're weeping strings in there and she's talking about dying and seeing God seeing God in some kind of vision and going insane the woman seems to be really passionate and really kind of sure about what she's saying toward the end of this clip that God speed plays she even goes as far as to say she knows things she can say things she has words that that aren't even in your Bibles yet but the thing is even though this woman seems kind of excited about the stuff she's saying the way God speed has altered her voice and the music they're playing against what she's saying makes it seem very kind of dark and twisted and disturbing to that one part of the album is something that I just cannot get out of my head the way those strings sound the way that woman's voice sounds it's all very unsettling for me following that movement the band pulls out another kind of slow building rock tune that to me is is one of the most twisted moments on the album the guitars on this one really wail the strings kind of circle around what the guitars are playing in a very repetitive way to kind of make this spiraling effect and this little tiny baby glockenspiel is just swallowed in the insanity there's a lot of material that comes after this track including one of the band's most popular songs which starts off with little monologue a little snippet from a conversation with a New Yorker talking about Coney Island how it was the playground of the world how people used to sleep on the beach there and now things have changed even though this is a great track I think pretty much all the material on this album is great it would be impossible for me to go over every single song moment segue transition interlude all of it plus I feel like in a way I'd be spoiling the album a little bit because like I said this is one of the most movie-like experiences I've ever had with an album there are different movements and climaxes on here each one of them brings a different set of ideas and emotions to me this album to me is equal parts uplifting and unsettling there are plenty of beautiful moments here but there are also spots on here that are as forlorn as a funeral march except this album has been created with with such a far-reaching ambition it's almost like Godspeed you black Emperor is trying to play off the entire planet like goodbye earth you had a good run now you're burnt to a crisp because of the military-industrial complex people are dead buildings are rubble streets are cracked the skies are black that's basically the attitude you'll be running into a little bit with this album not really an attitude I'm sure a lot of you subscribe to I don't subscribe to it I don't think the world is that terrible of a place and maybe God speed doesn't either if the world were that bad why make music for it but I personally don't have a problem with staring at the world's flaws and listening to music inspired by them to put it simply lift your skinny fists is an album loaded with qualities that I look for in music lots of ambition great recording and sound memorable textures melodies and songs some experimentation on here as well lots of variety in terms of ideas and in different genres of music great playing and proof Gorman's from these guys which really enhances the more ferocious moments on here and the more fragile ones to interesting use of samples and sounds and and voices to strong themes and concept and an interesting use of samples and and voices and as kind of an added bonus it's all kind of tied together into these really cohesive orchestral movements that that segue into each other really well using drones and ambient soundscapes and interludes there is definitely a formula going on here even if it isn't completely apparent because there is so much material to take in on this album but still there are enough variations on this style that godspeed has with this record that I'm never really bored I never really fed up I'm never really tired of what's going on here this album is just like a roller coaster for me it brings up so many emotions within me I know there are a lot of records out there where people will kind of attach them to certain points in their life like oh I listen to this record and then in the summer of Oh a I mean I know I do that personally but this record despite how long I've been listening to this thing for years and years and years I've never really done that all that happens when I listen to this record is I just kind of see imagery in my head of just Apocalypse and just like righteousness and skylines and war and people and nature and it seems as I listen to this album more over the years that imagery just gets stronger and stronger and stronger in my head not only do I find this album to be incredibly beautiful but a really unique experience to me and enlightening experience personally anyway and that's pretty much my take on this thing Cal Church esta everybody couch your chest to hear to say the great gets for you black in Peru great band you should listen hope you had a good allottee pray

and at number 29 i'm putting the new timber tambour LP creepin creepin on definitely a set of songs that live up to its album's title number 28 definitely my pick for Foulke punk album of the year with new Andrew Jackson jihad release knife man and at number 27 one of the most interesting intriguing and intense jazz releases I've heard in a while from the new Montana Roberts LP coincoin chapter 1 at number 26 my pick for favorite connecticut album this year from the new Giles Corey really dark eerie haunting singer-songwriter album and at number 25 a combination of dubstep and neo soul on the new subtract LP and number 24 an extremely interesting combination of sample-based music and ambient music on the new OneNote Rick's point never LP replica and at 23 it's the new bad bad not good LP at number 22 it's an album that I call a rock-and-roll nightmare earlier this year the new Krystal stilts album in love with oblivion and at 21 an album that I think is even more nightmarish the new Chelsea wolf LP at number 20 the new destroyer album could put a really smooth sleek sexy and slightly nostalgic rock album filled with 80s vibes and saxophones and really witty lyrics dan Behar still continues to be one of my favorite singer songwriters but I felt like this throwback album made destroyer feel a little less innovative than they usually are still a great album but I think the LPS that are higher on this list pushed way more boundaries like on number 19 with some very dark and vivid storytelling and a unique combination of different extreme metal styles on the new cormorant album dwellings and at number 18 I'm putting one of the most exhilarating saxophone bass albums I've heard in a long long long long time this album's recording style makes it so unique not only that but the way this guy performs with his instrument I'm talking about the new Colin Stetson album new history warfare vol 2 judges at number seventeen definitely my pick for favorite ambient music album this year the new Tim Hecker LP rave death 1972 and over 16-8 challenging abrasive and harsh piece of post-punk from ice age on the album new Brigade and at 15 something that is is just as abrasive if not more a really nice heavy deep dark guttural death metal throat towards the megalith and number 14 I'm putting the new st. Vincent LP strange mercy Annie Clark made a fantastic follow-up to actor I feel like pushed her style to the next level and at number 13 I think this is going to surprise a lot of people it surprised me certainly I was just thinking this album was pretty good at first maybe a bit flawed but I saw a vinyl copy of it on sale and I had a gift certificate I figured I just pick it up and saw that the vinyl copy actually had some extra tracks on there that were not on the version of the album that I listened to they added to the album a bit for me and the album just basically grew on me I'm going to put the new James Blake on here at number 12 an artist who I also think has his own style came out this year with a new album and I think is Bill himself to be one of the most raw and original MCS out there right now Danny Brown with xxx at number 11 an electronic project that I think is also pretty bold and original the new Afrika hi-tech LP 93 million miles and at number 10 who were in 10th spot that were the tits I think this album is my favorite hip hop concept album of this year and this dude is definitely a fresh new talent Kendrick Lamar section 80 at number nine in album that comes from my favorite electronic music producer of this year Nicholas jar space is only noise and number eight I'm sure this pick is going to anger some people I'm not sure why every single time I seem to mention them people's eyes go red and they're like but I'm going to put here liturgy with Aesthetica I think this is a great record an original innovative and unique metal record not to say that's hard to come by it's not but if you're only looking at this album from a musical standpoint you're only taking the music into account the crescendos are there the interplay is here great production the drummer is solid the melodies are just so painful and captivating I love this record at number seven it's an album that comes from a genre that I thought would never ever excite me or interest me again a lot of spew with wildlife man the song structures on this thing are experimental they're killer than the stories the lyrics the singer on this thing is intense plus the guitar and the drum mix on this thing is great just one solid song after another the more I listen to this thing the more I just kind of get a feel for its concept and its its essence definitely one of the best albums I've heard this year hands down totally did a 180 I hated these guys at first now I'm totally in love with their output at number 6 I'm putting an album from a rapper who I think really put the artfulness if you will let me make that a word back into southern hip hop that is Big KRIT with his latest LP return of forever and at number 5 a fantastic album one of the best of this year an album about war about country from one of the most consistent songwriters out there not only consistent but consistently creative and an innovative she's always shooting for a new sound in this new LP in my opinion sounds and feels like no other album she has released PJ Harvey with let England shake at number four an album that I think is one of the reasons that hip hop has such a great year this year this album is where I want to be this album is where I'm coming from this album speaks to me not only because it has some great messages in the lyrics a lot of thought-provoking lyricism a lot of depth but some fantastic production a wildly original sound an album that I think should be turning hip hop haters into hip hop lovers the new Shabazz Palaces LP black up at number three and album that I was kind of afraid of at first because I thought I might not like this at all but surprisingly I ended up loving it mostly because the dudes in this band play off of each other musically so so so so well great musicians a Stickley thrilling improvisational element to this band I know that this record wasn't extremely well received but I think if you're coming from more of a jazz rock progressive rock mindset you'll really get a lot out of this album the new battles LP gloss drop at number two a hip-hop album that I think push the envelope even more than the album that I put at number four if you guys watch this channel you guys know I love the hell out of this album you probably already know what album I'm talking about death grips with ex-military some great sounds and and and just aggression on this album end at number one an album that just really kind of struck me with its beauty from first listen from a band that I really didn't think that much of at first to be honest I was totally not into their first EP that they dropped years back and their debut album I just kind of enjoyed casually you know wasn't a huge huge fan of it but this LP to me in its recording in its songwriting and its concept to just all these themes about the world and living your life in this world and just figuring out how to navigate it how to live it and why we're living it why are we here what's the meaning of all of this I just love this album's sentiments I love its curiosity I love its emotions I'm talking about the new Fleet Foxes LP helplessness blues so that's my list 2011 I also want to give a few honorable mentions here some artists who came out with original sounds but I wasn't totally in love with their record civil civic tune-yards as well I also want to thank all of the bands that I reviewed this year all the artists all that everything every record that I reviewed this year as well as every group who I ever put on the loved list but did not make it onto this list and I also want to give a shout out to Elle's I who came out with that great Illmatic mixtape but I just kind of counted it as a cover when push came to shove that's my list of 2011 what do you guys think are you totally happy are you totally mad what do you think love it hate it why and what are your favorite albums of this year let me know in a comment or video response anthony Fantana lists favorite albums [Music] 
7ljw5YxV8vw,[Music] well hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a list of my favorite singles of 2011 now keep in mind these are just my favourite singles songs that have officially been released physically or digitally as singles I decided not to do my favorite tracks just single tracks because I knew that if I did that I would be pulling random ass deep cuts from albums and then putting multiple tracks from a single album onto this list and I wanted to get as many different groups as possible onto this thing you know so I'm doing singles sprinkling a couple a couple tracks from my favorite favorite albums of the year on here okay I'm gonna go through the first half of the list pretty quickly talking about songs a little bit more as the list gets nearer to the top cool at number 50 we have the drums with the song money and at 49 Balkans with a d2v at number 40 it's wild beasts with reach a bit further and at number 47 purity ring with belly speak my belly's speak at 46 I'm putting Tyler the Creator with Yonkers and at 45 m83 with midnight City at number 44 its Beastie Boys with make some noise a song that had a music video that I think I should have given an honourable mention on my favorite videos list of 2011 I was kind of confused about that video felt it was a little unfair to that had such a huge budget behind it in so many you know celebrities not unfair but you know what I mean but anyway that is my 44th favorite single of this year and my 43rd is Gauthier with somebody that I used to know featuring kimbra at number 42 Colin Stetson with the righteous wrath of an honorable man and at 41 little dragon with nightlight at 40 I'm putting fucked up with the song Queen of Hearts and at 39 the pains of Being Pure at heart with belong at 38 I'm putting nas with nasty I'm hoping that this track leads to a full-length album soon and 37 with my favorite track off of their debut album idle labor its craft spells with after the moment at number 36 my favorite track from the new horrors LP skying still-life a great first single to start that album off with at number 35 Veronica Falls with bad feeling and at number 34 one of the more humorous hip-hop tracks of the year - racist with Michael Jackson at number 33 I'm putting the wild flag 7-inch for the song future crimes that the band dropped earlier this year before their full-length debut and a 32 Kate Bush with wild man at 31 a fantastic classic rock throwback from rival Suns on the song pressure in time and then and at number 30 one of my favorite tracks from the new metronomy album the look at number 29 I'm actually going to put Radiohead with the Daily Mail which is a goddamn good song that I wish actually made it onto the freaking King of Limbs but it was nice to hear it in the basement sessions and number 28 I'm putting TV on the radio with will do and at 27 one of my favorite electronic artists of this year rusty with ultra tha's a really bright bombastic dubstep infused heavy synthesized just piece of fun at number 26 I'm putting Saint Vincent with surgeon and at 25 one of my favorite songs from the new subtract album wildfire at number 24 Theophilus London with flying over seas and at 23 one of the best rock songs pop rock songs that I've heard this year it's a shame that the rest of the tracks on the album just weren't is awesome to me Smith westerns with weekend and number 22 the final track and my favourite track from the new Foo Fighters album actually walk number 21 definitely one of the best rock singles of this year Christel stilts with shape the shackles such a fun track I love that freaking thing and number 20 though this did not end up being one of my favourite albums of the year I do love this song off of it freakin cunningly wrists with hard as they come featuring Freddie Gibbs just a really great beat behind that song and Freddie spits out a killer verse on it at number 19 big crate with dreamin a great song that really kind of set the set the mood for that album kind of set the stage for it before it dropped and 18 Rex with 25th hour just one of the hardest and most lyrically cunning pieces of boom-bap that I've heard this year at number seventeen Macklemore and Ryan Lewis with wings at 16 I'm putting John Mouse with my favorite track from his latest LP believer a hell a catchy track that you've got to check out if you're into stuff like Ariel pink at number 15 what is possibly the most intense track off of this album not quite a single but a favorite that I had to put on here a favorite that is going to stick out in my head when it comes to 2011 a lot of spewed with King Park at number 14 the second time Big KRIT shows up on this list with the roots track make my where he is featured a song that really kind of sets the stage for the concept of that new roots LP undone and at 13 one of the catchiest songs that this guy has ever penned timber Tambor with Blackwater at number 12 even though this album was not one of my favorites of the year I friggin love this song active child with playing house featuring how to dress well a really awesome piece of experimental R&B at number 11 one of my favorite tracks from Kendrick Lamar's latest LP section.80 high power a great and just kind of empowering an inspirational hip-hop song J Cole did some awesome production on that track and at number Africa high-tech without in the streets of great Juke tuned at number nine I'm actually gonna put liturgy with returner one of my favorite tracks from that LP and number eight battles with ice cream a song that I was really weirded out by at first but as i Doan to the band's new LP gloss drop I really kind of came to love the song it's it's now one of my favorites on the album and every single time I hear I'm just like I got a dance at number seven this track also comes off with an LP that is not one of my favorites but I freaking love this song it's a real high point of this album and for the year for me Bon Iver with Holocene beautiful track at number six one of the most fun and interesting pieces of dance pop that I've heard this year has some fantastic lyrics about somebody who kind of wants to go to a club but is also kind of a hermit in introvert and also simultaneously hates the club scene Holy Ghost with dude again at number five excuse me I have to read this title Shabazz Palaces with swerve the reaping of all that is worthwhile more not withstanding the final track off of that album I believe has a fantastic beat and it's a great closer to that LP - at number four PJ Harvey with the words that maketh murder just a song that to me really encapsulates the theme and concept behind let England shake just about war about countries sending people to war death the human condition just anger greed violence and my third favorite track of the year is a song that kept me coming back to this album again and again and again and this song though not everybody knew about it at first was actually a cover believe it or not James Blake with the Wilhelm scream yeah you're not believing it but you should be because I'm being serious and number two a track that came off of a hip-hop album that totally ripped my skull open and then stuck a knife in there and then switched my brain around until it was basically like a brain milkshake and then closed my skull back and put it where it was and then left me was my brain all like that just kind of rude tacky on death yawn from the new Death Grips LP ex-military huh triple sec thought fuck job in my numero uno Feifei song of the year is the title track from the new Fleet Foxes LP helplessness blues love that song to death really kind of sets the tone and the theme for that entire album sort of this this feeling of the world is such a great big wide amazing place and I'm just a tiny little baby speck within it and just the overwhelming thought of navigating this giant place known as the world in life and those are my 50 favorite tracks of 2011 what do you guys think what are your favorite tracks of 2011 let me know in a comment or a video response what songs got you excited what songs got you pumped and all fired up what songs made you cry what songs made you depressed what songs made you laugh what songs made you think what songs do you listen to again and again and again and you just listen to them in complete awe I want to know anthony Fantana songs 2011 forever [Music] you 
qLdwuZ8Jr88,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd still in the midst of last week and in this video I'm talking about my top 10 favorite EPS not quite a full length album not quite a single and I'm going to start with number 210 the self-titled King cruel EP reviewed it earlier this year as you guys probably already know this kid was once known as zoo kid sort of underwent a name change on this EP probably a full-length album coming out later next year but the songs that were on this were pretty promising pretty stand out sound at number 9 the EP of three tracks that Robin picked nolde from Fleet Foxes dropped on his Twitter for free just a really great acoustic songwriting and one of the tracks actually features a member of grizzly bear on vocals just some really solid memorable songs that that are not technically Fleet Foxes songs but I would still love to hear fleshed out with more instrumentation at number 8 a band whose future I really look forward to these guys are known for coming together with a nice combination of hip hop and jazz styles into this very cohesive musical idea the EP from bad bad not good that they dropped on their Bandcamp way earlier this year before the release of their full-length album this EP is really where these guys first hit me and I was convinced that I had to check out every single thing that they were gonna do after this because they definitely play with a lot of passion at number seven a band who's constantly evolving past their older sound from their debut album that they dropped in the 90s was originally a death metal band but they're really growing into their own as a progressive rock and progressive metal band I'm talking about the new cynic EP carbon-based Anatomy if you feel the tracks on there but three solid songs that really have me looking forward to the next full length these guys put out another epi really liked it number six dropped from Hudson Mohawke the satin Panthers ep this guy is a hell of a beat producer some really heavy heavy beats on this that just make me want to go stupid crazy it seems kind of trashy and silly and simple but that's part of really what makes it so enjoyable and stand out for me at number five are really solid solid death metal EP from the band oblivion eyes abhorrent evolution this thing is a nice combination of just filthy dirty grimy death metal production with the technical ability that you would find in a lot of modern death metal records though I'm more of an old-school death metal fan this thing was definitely you know kind of dirty enough to keep my attention and just kind of keep me really locked into the really intricate tracks that these guys right at number four one of my favorite pop rap releases of this year the new Theophilus London EP lovers holiday some of the catchiest tunes I've heard all year on that thing at number three an artist who was released on Nicolas jars record label actually who didn't get a lot of press this year that I saw he didn't really get hyped or buzzed or anything like that but hopefully he drops an album in the future that gets more attention Valentin step his EP any time will do is just really characteristic of the dark and bleak atmospheres that I hear in Nicolas jars music but it doesn't exactly seem like he's totally biting his style the sounds in the production are just really imaginative and I'm gonna keep a lookout for this guy and into the future but at number two a producer who I thought was even more impressive but sadly I did not review any of his material this year actually the closest I came to that was the new ASAP rocky album Live Love ASAP and I'm talking about the new clamps casino EP rainforest the students beets are just so shoegazing huge and it's like they're they're so dynamic and vast and yet they also have this kind of lo-fi element to them as well they're just so thick and heavy and saturated and while they are sort of overbearing at times there's just a really strong element of beauty on this EP that I can't deny it's one of the few EPS this year that really didn't leave me hanging didn't really leave me wanting or looking for more I was satisfied with the material that he threw on this thing it just made a really nice and interesting statement and my favorite EP this year is easily easily though there are only two tracks on it they are long tracks though the new Nicholas jari Pete don't break my love two of the most imaginative songs I think Nicholas Jar has put together this year Nicholas char really kind of came out with a bold style earlier this year on spaces only noise but on this EP I think he further develops that into something that's even more interesting more interesting even more accessible and I guess most importantly free for download on soundcloud so those are my 10 favorite EPS of this year what do you guys think of the list what are your favorite EPS of this year top ten 15 20 whatever you feel like you have any fan chant ep's forever 
XVi_Ldg4Hp8,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's less time guys it's less time pulling together a list of my favorite music videos of 2011 I have all of my other lists sort of worked out and I will be dropping one list a day for the rest of this week until I run out favorite videos favourite EPS singles and full-length albums and believe me these lists were not easy to make I racked my brain over these lists and when things got difficult I looked to our Lord and Savior fever array for guidance oh where is your shirt and tight what's wrong with this I thought this is a firma woman no this is this is not a formal event this is just this is a special occasion who should I say hey I'll wear a shirt and tie tomorrow anyway lists favorite videos of 2011 starting with number 20 the liturgy music video for the song returner and man this thing was not only one of my favorite albums of this year but this video is pretty interesting a very nice use of mirrors and Skippy hippy hippy editing effects to make the visuals just kind of as overwhelming as liturgies music in general number 19 the video for the Foo Fighters track white limo yeah this was not one of my favorite albums of this year but the new Foo Fighters LP had some great singles on it and this song was definitely one of them and the video with Lemmy driving all crazy in this limousine is pretty hilarious and number 18 craft spells with your tomb I dug their album idle labor earlier this year in this video with it's it's hard to explain it's kind of like a police take out and the sky is going on a date with this girl and she's going to murder him and it's really psychotic but also cute at the same time very kind of heartwarming as it rips your heart out of your chest at number 17 a video where a woman gets all sweaty and psycho and crazy in a room all by herself the video for wildfire from subtract which features little dragon on vocals at number 16 one of the funnier videos I've seen this year is for the song stamp from the latest rural Alberta advantage album this from the latest rural Alberta advantage album and what makes this video so funny for me it's just you're seeing these inner thoughts and these to show attendees and it's funny how the the female attendant at the show is in love with the drummer and then the male attendant the shows is in love with the female and when I'm on Polaris inter monologues at number 15 another funny one and one of my favorite singles of this year the song wait and see from holy ghost where the two members of the electro pop duo got their fathers to pose as them waking up and eating and and writing songs and going to the club to perform a show so you're basically seeing these these two older dudes perform as the dudes and in Holy Ghost it's a number 14 is a video that is mind-blowing ly cute the video for the song Israeli caves from the Maps analysis album that came out last year but the video did drop this year and it's this video featuring this little kid and he gets something stolen from him by these big badass bears who are bullies and then he like learns karate and becomes a ninja and then he goes and attacks the Bears in the woods and the Bears you know mind you are actually people and just bear masks it's it's nice at number 13 its Radiohead with lotus flower even though the King of Limbs was not one of my favorite albums of this year I think I speak for all Radiohead fans when I say it was pretty freaking awesome seeing thom yorke dance like an insane man you could dance however you like it was just something that you could watch and sort of feel less conscious about yourself because hey this is Thom Yorke this is this really serious musician guy and he's just going crazy the video looked nice it was shot well and I thought on top of all of it it had a really nice sentiment to it too at number 12 it's the video for no room to live off the new times new Viking LP and this video is an interesting project they kind of shot this video where the band is walking from one point to another point and they took the frames or several frames or just a group of frames every few seconds from the film and they had somebody like animate over the frames or just animate a different series of frames for the film so it's it's like this really kind of trippy series of different little quick animations that that are just beautiful funny awesome at number 11 it's the video for missed a motherfuckin ex Squires the last huzzah which is the remix for the first track on his new mixtape and a features - racist and despot and Danny Brown and LP and the videos hilarious the song is hilarious and it's a really nice kind of take a nice spoof on the Craig Mac flavor and you hear remix video at number 10 I'm putting the music video for the tune-yards song business seeing all those little school kids run around the classroom and all these choreographed dance moves and all this colorful scenery it was just overwhelming and inspirational and pretty and nice at number nine number nine number nine I'm putting the music video for m83 s midnight City which had all these psychic children moving heavy objects and slab then across the room into things it was just so beautifully violent and inspirational and kind of reminded me of Ikeda which I liked a lot at number eight just because of how dark and and visually interesting the video was I'm going to put Tyler of the creator's yonkers though yeah y'all know that goblin was nowhere near one of my favorites for this year I still like that song and that video is obviously part of what makes the release of that song so interesting at number seven I'm putting up a video that got released earlier this year by Adult Swim for the song death bound for Mastodon and you know it's music videos like this that don't even really keep my attention because of the music it's mostly the video which features all of these puppets in this very kind of Mister Rogers esque situation you know set up aesthetic but there's all these explosions and just violence going on everywhere and it's it's just freaking funny at number six I'm going to put the video for the will home screen by James Blake which yeah it's not exactly the most eventful video on the block it's pretty much just this static you know shot of James going in at different angles and stuff like that but I just think the video is really aesthetically pleasing I like the filters and the effects that gets thrown on the camera and numerous points of the film I think it really portrays the emotions of that song perfectly in that the visuals and the effects are just getting fuzzier and weirder as the song progresses and gets more kind of encapsulated in this in this reverb in this cavernous cavernous effect set and number 5 I'm going to put the video for blue suicide by coma cinema which was beautifully shot beautifully acted out set against the music perfectly and was a great introduction to the coma cinema project it's essentially about this dude who kind of comes upon his girlfriend who committed suicide and then through this weird ritualistic thing where he cuts off her ear and reads some incantations brings her back to life it's kind of weird but I love it and number four I'm going to put my machines by battles it is the most fun you will have watching somebody fall down an up escalator this year and the only music video or picture or visual or anything ever where I've ever seen a drumset being played on an escalator a moving escalator it was awesome at number three I'm going to put a video that that really is on here because I think the video is is just so overwhelmingly awesome it's got very little to do with the song the song is decent but to be honest I can't even really hear the song that much in the video because over the song are all of these gunshots and bombs going off I'm putting here is tropical with the video for the Greeks which is you know about these kids who are kind of out in the yard playing cops and robbers and they're shooting at each other with nerf guns and fake guns and stuff like that but somebody took all this video footage and animated real bullets and bombs flying out of their guns at each other and all these explosions and all this bloodshed and it's just hilarious and every single time I watch it I pick up a new detail in the video this new insane explosion or expression I didn't hear before like you know bloodshed it's you know pretty disturbing on some level to hear these kids you know screaming and yelling and shooting at each other with guns but it's it's all in good fun mmm at number two I'm going to put the video for cool by saint vincent i think it's one of the most well produced videos this year has a great themed storyline to it and I think Annie Clark is a great actress in the video as well she plays this mother who is really kind of hated by her family and the way she deals with these kids and her husband in this really kind of apathetic way and the way she kind of just takes all of this torture really kind of makes you feel for her character and kind of project yourself onto her character and what for some people I'm sure being a mother might feel like but my number one favorite video for this year which I think it was even more immaculately shot and really kind of struck a chord with me in that it kind of touched down on a point in my adolescence right and really kind of like relate to the story of of this video um McLemore with the video for the track wings I mean if you guys haven't seen this video you've gotta check it out especially if you're in my age group you know this twenties age group or maybe you went to a suburban school or I'm sure even an urban school and what kind of shoes you were wearing was so so so important people were getting shot over their shoes people got me fun of because of their shoes if they weren't cool enough people were admired if they had the right shoes getting the right shoes got you playing sports bettor it was crazy looking back on it in retrospect and McLemore made a fantastic song and was a part of an amazing video which really kind of looked back on this era of consumerism that is kind of forgotten by a lot of people touching back to a very specific time when you had the pumps that air bubbles and the and the style just emotional inspirational the kid who is kind of the main focus of the video is fantastic as well McLemore gives a great performance and it was kind of a hands-down no contest choice for my favorite video this year so what do you guys think are the best music videos of this year which music videos resonated most with you made you laugh made you cry got you excited for a new album guy you into an artist that you'd never heard of before what videos 'best complimented the songs they were paired with if your favorite video didn't make the list tell me what your

GK8BVkjswzg,mmm hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a review and oh wait this isn't a review all right you know what I'm gonna stop being a sourpuss and I'm just gonna like doing this segment from now on I'm just gonna like doing it not gonna be cranky when it comes to it from now on you want a couple people have commented saying that oh I'm using the segment to make fun of bands and herp derp herp derp derp derp derp that's not the case I'm not trying to come on here to why you know review and make fun of people or refuse to review records it's just that I'm one guy I can't review everything and this is my way of kind of touching down on numerous releases that I haven't gotten to and hopefully you guys can base on my descriptions go check them out for yourselves so Cal if you will why didn't I review the thing hey everybody Justin here roommate nerd music moustache guy it's time for our monthly segment called why you know reviewer we tak about the reasons why certain releases albums sangs its have pests by Anthony not review not video didn't do it nope and we're gonna start over here why you'll or review the new work house nerd Sofia to Kish yes what else Nord black metal outfit heavy weights and they've been coming out with albums in sort of this 777 series two albums have dropped from this series so far from what I understand sects and the D sanctification and on these releases so far these guys have really kind of reinvented themselves to not just be a black metal band but incorporate heavy heavy elements of industrial music - and you know not that the change is bad I think it's great that these guys want to move away from their really black metal roots Agalloch did that on Mara with the spirit did more acoustic and folk stuff sounded fantastic as well as over to many of you may know switched up their black metal sounds into their career and had fantastic results however I feel like the the drumbeats on here and the production and and the vocals it just hasn't added up into you know the best industrial that I've ever heard there are still some black metal elements on these two releases especially the first one but you know just I'm just not that into them the sounds really aren't wowing me the songs really are allowing me the vocals aren't really Wow me you know if the idea of a black metal industrial combo excites you then definitely check out the new blood house Nord releases all right y-you know reviewed the new Sepulcher de yeah I've gotten a lot of requests for this one and you know I I've listened to it return to it and return to it and I just kind of thought it was thought it was okay I actually reviewed an album that came from one of the producers of this project earlier that it is here he produced the new Machinedrum album rooms you know Sepulchre definitely even though they are American producers follow the UK style of this music by the book and overall I think these guys make a really kind of catchy er version of this future garage sound something that's really kind of accessible and while it is accessible it's really easy to listen to this record didn't really make an impression on me it didn't really seem to take all that many risks to me I guess even though that Machinedrum album is not one of my favorites of the year I definitely prefer that over this but you know I kind of felt the same way about the EP that got dropped before this album that I've heard so it's not like there's really any love loss here for me you know nezam okay yeah that checks out why you know review the new ruby fresco album loopy fresco yeah tons of people asked me to review this and I'm not sure why the new Lupe Fiasco mixtape I mean maybe people just wanted to see me give another negative review I have no clue but you guys know what's going on here if you don't you know Lupe Fiasco came out with lasers earlier this year he was rapping over a bunch of like club' electro beats it was not well-received by by many people and from what I've read he sort of blamed this sound change on his label a little bit and now he's kind of turned around and he's rapping over the same kind of beats these electro and and house like beats on this new mixtape a lot of the beats off this mixtape actually come from the new justice LP this mixtape is alright to me the rapping is more prominent and this thing does not have the sugary hooks that were really turning me off all over lasers and there's a really nice spot on here where he's flowing very well over a Coltrane sample but overall I just wasn't into it I mean I wasn't into the electronic direction on lasers I'm not into the electronic direction on here and to just add insult to injury it's very apparent that Lupe is doing this on his own his label is not forcing him to rap over these kinds of beats so yeah that's how I feel about friend of the people I would love to make me go back and forth a few guys a little bit on this mixtape in the comments possibly alright but but why you know review the new trashed tic-tac trip trash tak yep the new trash talk EP I don't really have a reason or an excuse for not revealing this it just kind of slipped by me I just didn't get to it but these guys are a band that combines elements of hardcore punk and power violence with very modern thick heavy production I'm not really in love with a lot of their riffs they don't really stick with me all that much but the aggression and the intense vocals are there some pretty catchy hooks on the track or two on this thing as well just some really strong vocals good production muscular drumming if you're into hearing some some modern hardcore punk with a modern flavor try it out all right but what about the new mister old zile stadi - why you know reviewing that yeah the new mr. waz oh um I've never really been a big wazoo fan even when French electro & house artists were getting a lot of play in 2007 and 2008 even when he worked on the soundtrack for one of my favorite movies this year rubber on his last album I thought the beats and everything were were a little generic but there were some pretty good tracks on that thing now on this LP I would say there is more personality definitely there's more weirdness and and quirkiness and the synth sounds that he chooses and the vocal samples - but it hasn't really added up to an interesting album for me it's just kind of added up to a silly like a little bit like trashy album especially with the track do should be I'm sure this album sounds a lot better and feels a lot better when you're in a club setting but it's it's not really something I would listen to by myself to like review you know that's all okay thank you for watching the y-you know review segments hosted by your Cal true chesta over here me host Internet's room a nerd guy appreciate it Anthony closed this good day I love you couch esta hey guys lists are coming next week and you can go down there in the D box to see a few more explanations for other releases that have kind of slipped by me this year it's been an awesome year can't wait to drop these lists next week it's going to be awesome you can expect the first list on Monday it's going to be a list of my favorite music videos favorite ep's favorite singles singles with a few tracks sort of sprinkled for my for my favorite albums of the year and full-length albums ok 
7UbRxK4qMRs,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and album review time the new cast McCombs LP humor risk casts McCombs is a singer-songwriter this is actually the second full-length album he's released this year the one he put out earlier this year also on Domino Records is titled wit's end the thing is I've never really been a big cast McCombs fan and I'm not entirely sure why because he does showcase influences from other singer songwriters who I like like Elliott Smith Bob Dylan as well as Neil Young also Paul Simon I guess sometimes he's just not bold enough for me his songs don't don't stick enough with me maybe what I do know is that the songs from his most recent LPS have been kind of hit or miss for me I guess like on catacombs which came out a few years ago for example there are songs on that album like dreams come true girl that I love to death that are just so cute and and and catchy and just just really lovable and then you know the album will kind of turn around and make a weird production decision or just kind of throw out a song that's that's a little underwhelming a lot like lion killer gets married which just has this really kind of flat totally Undine amick repetitive beat behind it that really kind of makes the song feel longer than it actually is and I kind of felt the same way about wit's end to one song on that album County line one of the most emotionally captivating songs I've heard this year is just kind of followed by these tracks that I don't really care for like lonely dull which to me is just really underwhelming it's just really kind of too soft too sweet to really keep my interest there's just no bite to it but still eautiful Liyana cast mccombs album i find that there are a handful of tracks that are so good it keeps me interested in checking out the next album just in case one song after another is is kind of blowing me away so I did kind of go into humor risk looking for that and even though this isn't one of my favorite LPS this year this album is kind of a surprising change of pace for Cass I think a lot of the songs on here feel like they're they're really simple straightforward repetitive have kind of a harder rock edge to them tracks like the opener and mr. email and the same thing all have these really driving rock grooves that make me think that Cass McCombs has been listening to like the first modern loo lovers record a bunch of times just guitar bass drums just gliding along this single beat really nicely stopping occasionally for a pretty hook like on the same thing and what's cool about these more repetitive songs is that it really kind of gives cast the opportunity to stretch out lyrically like on the track mr. email which has a pretty dark tale behind it once you really start getting into the lyrics that involves just the law in jail and getting stabbed that track drags on a little bit but it's it's still pretty good and the opener love thine enemy has a lyrical punch as well but it kind of does all that with a much shorter song length the softer songs on here I'm kind of on the fence with though the living world and in robin egg blue they're nice songs but they just kind of breeze by for me noting that that's really gonna stick with me or that I feel like I kind of connect with emotionally on the other hand to to every man his Chimaera moves really slowly and just has this really dramatic vocal that casts delivers it's almost like he's acting and the story he's telling is is pretty gripping too though kind of abstract I'm not exactly sure I get 100% of what it is there are these are really watery guitars and cast start singing no not you again I thought you died thought you were killed on your wedding night and he's singing about this this person a hypocrite kind of asking him to kill that person it's strange the track meet me at the mannequin gallery has kind of a sexy sleekness to it and the final song which which really kind of struck me by a surprise has this very kind of odd feel to it that reminds me a lot of Beck's anti Fulke album one foot in the grave it's it's kind of messy there are these very weepy guitar leads and these deadpan vocals that make it sort of ominous just overall I kind of felt like this album was a little middle-of-the-road I guess nothing that was really terrible or offending me on here but nothing I really fell passionate about or in love with I didn't really feel like there were that many bold moments on this album I guess not a whole lot of risk was taken outside of the end of the opener which gets pretty noisy pretty cacophonous which which was a fun listen and the final track to still while I was listening I thought I was okay liked it feeling a strong six on this but what do you guys think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next and why do you think I'm not that much of a cast McCombs fan I mean I am talking directly to the cast McCombs fans here seems like this dude has a pretty passionate fan base just wondering if you're a fan what about his music appeals specifically to you what keeps you coming back to his records and if you do like this album what are your favorite things about it Anthony Fantana Katz McCombs / you 
eATcLAOGxro,hey it's track review hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and this is track reviews where we talk about the latest in rock pop electronic and experimental music also hip-hop metal and instrumental jazz I have not done a track review in a while a lot of people have been asking me if I'll ever do a track review again Here I am doing one but I have to change track reviews up in order to save track reviews ok first off with track reviews from now on no more scores I'm tired of it I either love it like it man hate it don't like it whatever and also this thing this thing that no not doing that anymore either but but the theme songs here and we're still going to review a track hmm just embrace change you know just lick change in the face and everything will be ok alright these guys are bad bad not good why you got to be so negative you're not even in the review yet and you're saying it's bad I hate goucher chest up these guys are Canadian jazz trio they dropped a load of covers and EP a full-length album that I reviewed and loved a live album as well this year and kind of the the the style that they've been building their brand of jazz on is just jazz reinterpretations of awesome hip hop beats some classic some new but a lot of the stuff they have been playing is it original mostly just covers however this new single from BADBADNOTGOOD is in original and according to their YouTube channel they have some more singles on the way as well as a second mixtape and on the a side of this new single from BADBADNOTGOOD there is a very ominous introduction very kind of Black Sabbath esque very heavy very lumbering dark it sounds like something you'd throw in at the end of a horror movie after the vampire mutated monster or serial killer as one this track is just built of acoustic piano it sounds like upright bass drums but the only thing that really kind of keeps this track in in this hip-hop tradition that influences these guys so much is just how the drums sound they just have this very front and center position in the mix just a really fat beefy bass drum with a lot of attack on it to the drums do kind of have that solid boom bap sound to them and even though this track is an original I feel like what influences these guys still Dibble shows up really strongly as these guys kind of develop this eerie introduction into them kind of playing in three this descending piano melody pops up that sounds a lot like the melody on the beat from the song nightmare which came off of Tyler the creator's latest LP goblin the band builds the track up a few times and even though i'm not totally in love with the chords and the melody of the track i like how they play together they know how to make a moment really kind of quiet and dramatic or just loud and intense they speed up together at a few points in this track really nicely too and I really like the final explosion around the 4-minute mark where they just kind of break into a new speed new piano chords it's it's an interesting change as far as negatives on this track go I would say the drums might be a little overpowering especially when they're trying to do something of this style where they're not doing something that has such a heavy hip-hop influence and it may be intentional but sometimes when they're doing these like syncopated hits where they'll they'll all kind of hit down on this one beat or note or chord together it sounds a little out of sync they're playing a little out of sync just feels a little loose I guess overall I liked this track I thought it was okay I wasn't totally in love with it but I thought it was decent and an iced teas toward whatever these guys are moving toward in the future I am glad that they're experimenting and not trying to do the same exact thing that they did on previous releases but what do you guys think of this track do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should wear next Anthony Fantana track reviews forever 
RCbd1JC4Q78,[Music] Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another question comment thing one of the one of the one of the little questions that I get most often on my videos in my channel comments tweets Facebook comments and messages emails is how many times do you listen to an album before you review it before and the answer that I keep giving because this answer is the truth is it depends there is no set number there could never be a set number music doesn't work that way for example let's say the antlers Kanye West Animal Collective Godspeed you black Emperor and Neutral Milk Hotel we're going to come out with a collaborative album next year well whether or not you review this album well and understand everything it has to offer has a lot to do with how familiar you are with the musical styles of these artists how familiar you are with the musical ideas that they're presenting on this project and how many times you've been able to listen to this project and basically dive into it and understand what musically it has to offer somebody who is a black metal aficionado should be able to listen to a black metal album and decide whether or not he or she likes it and give better reasoning for that than somebody who is completely just unfamiliar with black metal and has no clue what it offers or what the point is or what kind of sounds they can expect even if you don't like black metal and you don't like the album that you're listening to at least making the effort to understand why you don't like it beyond just being closed-minded is what is going to come out with a review that's worth reading or watching so if you are really really familiar with black metal maybe it'll take three to five or maybe even six times to listen to an album and side whether or not you like it and figure out exactly why and if you're not familiar with black metal to get these same answers maybe you'll need to listen to the album ten times and not only that album but a bunch of other albums that led up to that album in the band's discography or in the style in general so when someone asks me how many times I listen to an album I don't really have a number answer number one because there is no set number and number two I don't really count III basically decide to review something when I've reached a I guess kind of emotional consensus with this is how I feel about this album and I have all of these reasons why once I have a clear grip on the feeling and I have that list of reasons as to why that feeling is there then I'm ready ready to do the review so so because this question keeps coming up I'm curious do you have a certain number of times you listen to an album before you decide whether or not you like it is there a set standard of times you should listen to an album before you decide whether or not you think it's listenable be people what you guys think I love you Anthony Fantana listening to things a certain amount of times forever [Music] you you 
XmgynYpKSVg,Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review the new roots album undone you guys have been begging for me to do this review almost as if I didn't know who the roots frigging were and like I didn't know they had an album coming out come on in anyway I have been listening to this album I enjoy it a great deal I think I'm going to put it up on the loved list but this video is not the review in fact the real review is a collaborative review I did with the guys over a dead end hip hop you can find a link below this video to watch the review of this album over at their channel it's below this review come on click that link clickity clickity clickity it's below this video it's right down the Mart don't know I don't and that's pretty much that you can hear my thoughts and everyone else's thoughts and Dedan hip hop in that video and I hope you have a good day love you bye [Music] [Music] 
rwAHEPfpiOI,Wow hi everybody Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this band is named cormorant and this album is titled dwellings these guys are a California metal band this is their sophomore LP it's self released and this LP is definitely a nice little surprise gem that landed at the end of this year because these guys have a lot that's worth admiring they're really heavy they're really melodic their songs are very detail-oriented not to mention these guys are really dynamic and how they build their songs - there's so much to say about this record I don't even know where to start because as I listen through this album every time I thought I had cormorant kind of figured out they pull another surprise out of their sleeve another influence another emotion another trick so I figure I'll just kind of start with the the sound of this album which is really great the production on this thing is is killer whether whether the band is just shooting for these mountainous highs or these really kind of dramatic and quiet moons all the sounds are just really pristine and the recording just has this really nice mix of of clarity but also like grit - the guitars come in really heavy the vocals come in really raspy and it all just sounds so live but not that a low five recording is is bad but I think being able to make out the bass lines being able to take in the detail of the guitar solos being able to hear intelligible vocals that have a really strong narrative all those things just make me appreciate this album even more the band covers a lot of different sounds and and textures on this album they're really booming heavy guitar chords that worry now in a really do me way on the second track harmonized guitars Lausanne unearthly dreamings there's an instrumental track as well with these really kind of oddly time progressive riffs and shots of black metal blast beats here and there too these guys really work to blend a lot of genres together and that to me is kind of what their style is black metal do metal progressive metal death metal as well on here and it's all fed through this great production and this really melodic sensibility there's spots on here that made me think of Mastodon and then these guys would push into a different direction and then I think of like angle lock and then they would push into a different direction and I think of like Oh paths this is the sounds that influence cormorant on this record are pretty obvious but how they pull them all together it's just really graceful and that's what kind of makes this record unique to me like the opening chords on a howling lust which are which are really kind of pretty and a little funky in a way build into these really pummeling riffs nicely the purest land has these interjecting black metal moments that that bring the insanity of that track even higher and I love how there are spots on these tracks that kind of transition into these very kind of post rocky and vocal samples where you'll you'll get this big long vocal snippet that will kind of push the narrative of the song forward and that's really kind of the last thing on this record that to me makes it a pretty bold release the narratives the tales that are being spun into these songs some of the lyrics on here you can follow from the beginning to the end of a song and really get a lot out of it if you're listening hard enough it's almost like these guys are composing stories as well as songs and sometimes it's almost like the lead singer is playing a character in this story that he's pulling together and a lot of these stories reflect real life and every song has a different tale behind it the song the purest land sort of seems to be about this this genocide o madman who's just like out of control and just like is is kind of a megalomaniac the vocals on that track just feel noticeably crazy than the other songs the second track on here is actually about highwire artist Philippe Petit and their lyrics on here about the wire and flying and some of the lyrics are actually in French too the song Hunta lyrically is one of the most specific songs on here in atrocities that happened in Guinea not too long ago the song unearthly dreamings is about an astronaut who dies in the line of duty and a howling lust is about a lynch mob that gangs up in and kills a Chinese man for defending himself against someone who was trying to hurt him all the stories on this album deal with with death facing death injustice and the darkness of humanity and the songs and the emotions on this record react to those ideas and situations kind of tumbling back and forth between aggression and and melancholy I know I love what I'm hearing but I don't feel like I want to present understand it yet because there are a lot of layers and there are a lot of details to breathe in with this record whether it be narrative lies or whether it be musically this thing really manages to come across as a piece of like thinking man's metal without being really technical or just like enveloped and it's in its own skill it's a great balance of story and song there's lots of variation on here and it all kind of comes together underneath I guess this consistent vocal and great production I think somebody who's really not even into metal sometimes can get into this record and really appreciate the melody and the songwriting that goes into these tracks I'm feeling a decent eight on this record as far as negatives go I feel like some of the tracks on here do feel a little long-winded some of the vocal samples here and there get a little distracting for me and I felt like on the instrumental track here these guys did lose their flavor a little bit I will say that I do think their vocalists and just their ability to spin these narratives is part of what makes these guys so interesting and original all that aside this thing is a hell of a record sounds like a lot went into it and therefore I am getting a lot out of it have you heard this thing what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino cormorant dwellings 
_Ca1LFIih3k,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd in my eye it's time for an album review new Jimmy's new jobbies spiritual state this guy is a Japanese music producer known for his really beautiful blend smooth blend of hip-hop and jazz music of course he was not the first artist to do this kind of blend people like De La Soul and the roots and Tribe Called Quest came before him and did that too and it's not like he was the only guy doing this stuff into the 2000s either yeah J Dilla yet Madlib but still this guy managed to come along in the early 2000s with metaphorical music and really carve out a niche for himself and that's because his style was noticeably different the beats he produced were just silkier they were more sensual kind of serene and really took a bold musical direction instead of just getting these short choppy loop little samples of grooves that came out of jazz songs on new trapeze tracks you were getting like these really long and winding horn leads and solos there are some points where the the horns and the piano and the drums everything just sounds like it's it's live of course that was helped along by some of the guest musicians he was able to bring on to his tracks like a Yamaha roto saxophone player and when he wasn't pushing out these really serene jazzy and detailed beats he was bringing on guest emcees all of which kind of had their own different flavors but they would all kind of consistently deliver these positive messages and philosophical statements you could definitely pick new japaese style out easily but he passed away last year sadly and I've said this in the past you guys should already know I'm usually kind of iffy when it comes to posthumous albums because the thing is labels love to release music after an artist has died or a band is broken up it almost doesn't matter if the material on the album is is weak because everybody is heartbroken or upset or really really hyped and critics aren't gonna say anything terrible about the album because they might look like a jerk then whether or not the material is good becomes this controversy and everybody gets mad at each other when really everyone should be mad at the record label for basically musically grave-robbing their artists well in defense of this album getting released it is getting put out on the record label new Judy's started himself so maybe I could kind of see my way to okay it's getting released on his own record label hmm the question still remains if nutria beasts were alive would this album have been put out because the thing is before his death it had been about five years since he'd released a full-length LP so is the material on here new is it old is it finished is it rushed is it just kind of a bunch of b-sides personally this LP does kind of feel like a slightly different direction for new trapeze I wouldn't say I'm hearing leftovers from previous albums because what I'm hearing on here feels relatively new for one a lot of the tracks on this LP feel like they've been completely stripped of any and all hip-hop influence like the opening track sure the rhythm in the background kind of feels very repetitive very looped but between the saxophone and the pianos on that track I basically feel like I'm listening to a straight-up jazz song very smooth sunset Seaside Beach jazz it's a style that's shown up in new trapeze music before but I don't think this boldly it felt a little cheesy to me at first but the more I listened the more I kind of realized well you know it's kind of relaxing and it's really pretty in the way that the saxophone and the piano is just kind of layer over one another I just wish the rhythm wasn't so repetitive I just feel like I'm hearing all this jazz instrumentation this this improvisational element but the rhythm in the background is just really stale and repetitive and just kind of monotonous like would the Jazz Messengers album Caravan be as good as it is if Art Blakey got replaced by a drum machine no that's why I'm also kind of iffy with the track gone are the days because there's this really hard driving electronic beat behind all this jazz instrumentation another saxophone part brought by who Yamaha wrote oh I love him in the piano we're doing but I just wish the the rhythm were a little more diverse now if he thought previous tracks really kind of indulged in this smooth jazz sound just wait till you hear the last track because with the effects on the saxophone and this really kind of sexy R&B beat from the 90s the only thing this track is missing is like chimes it's basically the kind of music that when I was a kid it was a joke like listening that was a joke when you heard it it was funny but now I'm listening to it over a decade later on this CD because I have to review it and I'm kind of like enjoying it there are instrumentals on here though they have more of a hip-hop flavor like the track spiral which has this boom bap beat these Ares some disembodied vocal samples and the track far fouls which comes afterwards has pretty much the same instrumentation but a totally different feel to it it has this sample that that really makes me kind of feel like it took a chunk of music from the soundtrack to an old kung fu movie now on the downside with this album and I do feel like there is a pretty noticeable downside there is some filler on here definitely the tracks color of autumn and rainy way back home just don't really develop as much as many other tracks on here do they feel short they feel a little uncouth all over it that doesn't really feel as purposeful as some of the solos on the other tracks just kind of like fill in space the MC tracks to our little hit or miss for me none of the rappers here on this album go hard but that's never the kind of MC that that new trapeze has really brought on to his albums if you're a fan of the Stute you're gonna remember a lot of these MCS from past efforts the best MC track for me is Skye tumbling which is just really captivating has great lyrics and this really fiery sax solo that kind of bellows away underneath them I really like pace Rox lyrics on the song yes - even though I think the beats okay and some of the editing on his vocals over the hook is kind of shoddy the other emcee tracks on here like waiting for the clouds or city lights do feel kind of underwhelming to me though just not as bold sonically or statement was you know if you're a fan of nude rubies if you listen to this album you're gonna pick up basically what what is his usual style with some progressions here and there on a few tracks but you know this album for me is just a mixed bag of different song qualities some moments on here feel kind of bold and detailed and memorable and just really kind of progressive and others just kind of float away in the breeze I'm just kind of you know a little letdown that this is a swan song of this project you know though I'm sure fans want to hear this I wanted to hear this I just don't feel like it's as great as previous material which is why maybe I would have felt a little more comfortable with this being a compilation as opposed to an album and that wouldn't have made me like the tracks on here I didn't like I'm just saying I'm just saying you know me talk talk talk that's all I do I'm feeling was strong six to a light seven on this but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it do you think this was a good ending for this project do you feel any closure from this album will you be returning to this if you are a nutri beasts fan or will you pretty much be spending most of your time listening to the two previous peas let me know Anthony Fantana spiritual state rest in peace forever [Music] 
oyr32v8ibE4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review this LP from the Polish composer hola Mitchell Mitchell Jackie sik great guy yes that's his name hey got your chest I'm going to in this review make the argument to you that this album is the perfect little instrumental tidbit for your winter on glimmer michael is effectively composing classical music with various sounds and styles musical elements flowing throughout it Noise music ambient music electronic music Baroque but it's not just sounds and styles that vary on the cell P it's an album of many moods - this is very emotionally heavy LP very emotionally heavy instrumentals one after another that range from being very kind of eerie and cold to dark and sinister but no matter what kind of feeling a track gives off there's always this real strong sense of beauty in the sounds and the melodies and I feel like glimmer brings about this beauty by going in essentially two different directions with these tracks there are moments on here like the opening track that feel like a slightly more traditional take on classical music the electronic elements the experimental edits and textures that hang in glimmers music aren't as strong bold apparent on the surface the first track on this LP sounds like a beautifully played Celeste being accompanied by strings that kind of get lost in this wall of harpsichord arpeggios it's very chilling and kind of reminds me of something that that could possibly be played to open up the the credits of a Tim Burton movie something like that I'm more into the moments where glimmers classical side meshes a bit more with its experimental side like on the second track dare Gale where the sounds just feel murkier they feel more obscured there they're darker they're weirder there are all these stuttering edits here and there and just the the gritty quality of the atmosphere reminds me of of guys like Tim Hecker or bands like Godspeed you black Emperor I get the same feeling from the fourth track too but there's there's some harsh swells of noise on that track to kind of swallow up the woodwinds they've evidence that our droning away behind it these dark noisy sound escapes with all this classical instrumentation that's what adds up to a real showstopper for me on this album the moments where the classical sounds and in compositions kind of take the forefront on this LP and not that they're bad they just don't feel as distinct to me I just felt like there were too many spots where some of the songs here felt a little uneventful because they merely coast on these harpsichord arpeggios and just kind of let the song progress on on that and it just doesn't feel as it's thrilling thankfully that sound and style makes up just a small part of this LP a majority of this thing is spent experimenting I love the creepy and light drone that hangs in the air behind the woodwinds on what wind walks up above that's a track title there are some very subtle edits and sounds and effects happening throughout the song too and that's what I like so much about this LP it is so soft and quiet and yet so detailed and just very very hidden details you can really just dive into the intricacies of this album and just just take in so much just eat them all up later on that same track there are all these bouncing echoes of acoustic guitar just just ricocheting off every wall in the room and man the whole track just ends in this very thick heavy crescendo involving these woodwinds and this harpsichord and and whatever various noises glimmr can string together it's a pretty powerful moment and the last track on here is a powerful moment as well but not because of its volume or arts or its massive instrumentation but because of just how finely tuned the melodies seem on that track there are some really beautiful lead melodies played by woodwind on that song and some faint trumpet swells toward the end of the song - it's it's really really great I know simple description but seriously that final track describing every detail in that song that's a whole nother video in itself but overall when I listen to this album I just I just see all this imagery of of just snow falling and like you know old decrepit twisted trees and I get kind of like a a weird kind of scary story kind of aesthetic coming for out of this - but not like a you know a modern weird freaky gory scary story kind of like you know a headless horseman kind of old-school scary story now glimmer is a good pretty solid album I didn't hate not one song on here but was I amazed throughout the entire LP totally in love with every track no to be honest I would have liked maybe a few more tricks up this album's sleeve a little more experimentation a little more variation - I felt like this album was a little too close in comparison with its influences here and there a few tracks kind of felt a little short to me like they could have been developed a bit more and a few moments on here kind of redo ideas that I think we're done better on tracks that had come before I know I'm being a little nitpicky but this is still a really good album I recommend it if you're into instrumental music if you're looking for something wintery something cold something with a lot of different sounds and a lot of inherent beauty to it and more of a classic flavor as well feeling a decent too strong seven on this what do you think of this LP do you loves it do you hates it and why and what do you think I should be next Anthony Fantana glimmer breath 
Q5d9O8CPh7w,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd time for an album review the Black Keys El Camino these beasts these guys are a rock duo that I've been following ever since this blues rock and garage rock revival got kind of huge in the in the early to mid 2000s I reviewed their album brothers last year but I got to be completely honest and say I was not all that excited to hear El Camino in all the years I've been listening to the Black Keys especially releases like like thickfreakness and rubber factory and an amazing EP that they have released of nothing but but junior Kimbrough songs the duo has never really thrown me a left hook or a surprise and this is kind of a complaint I had with the band's last album I think it's an even bigger complaint for me with this album I think the Black Keys are long overdue for a direction change you know but there is a silver lining in that cloud and it is that the Black Keys are a picture of consistency every time they drop an album it's got pretty much the sound you would expect and it always gets the same semi glowing or glowing reviews there are some detractors here and there but not so many that they would be a big deal and as long as the Black Keys stick to the style and the ideas and and the sounds and the songwriting that has worked for them up until this point who's really gonna complain not to say there's been no change whatsoever in this band's career earlier releases were much simpler much more skeletal much more raw and that changed after the band worked with Danger Mouse on the album attack and release but to be honest it's it's maybe my least favorite Keys album and ever since then I feel like their songs have just kind of been getting simpler and more straightforward I just think the kind of romantic interplay that you would get between the guitar and drums on an album like magic potion has has kind of faded away a bit in exchange for writing songs that are popular hooky er more instant and because of that I feel like Black Keys new stuff contains less subtleties secrets on El Camino you basically kind of get this same flavor of of modernized but also nostalgic garage and blues rock the hooks in roughly the same way the guitars feature an array of different tones and effects the drums really forced some nice grooves the lyrical subjects revolve around girls and heartbreak and relationships as usual with a few kind of stragglers varying from that formula lots of warm bass lines fuzzy distorted pentatonic guitar solos a little extra piano and organ and background vocals here and there call me death but I feel like the Black Keys are working with roughly the same ideas as they were on brothers with a few spots here and there that kind of stick out like the first single lonely boy which to me feels like a newer take on the raw sound the Black Keys used to play with all the time the track little black submarine starts off as a really nice acoustic ballad and actually kind of sounds like a track maybe the White Stripes could have written on the album white blood cells sister has one of the hardest and catchiest grooves that these guys have have ever produced and Nova baby is is a is a notably sunnier song than a lot of the tracks on here but the rest of the tracks on here for me don't really feel new I get tired of ideas when they feel kind of overused I guess and when those ideas get overused is is really kind of a personal preference you know obviously in my opinion of this record is heavily impacted by just my musical preferences and how much music from these guys I have heard if you're relatively new to the Black Keys maybe brothers for example was was your first introduction to them you're probably going to enjoy this and if this is your first Black Keys album try it out it's really not that bad it's pretty solid there's not really any pop holes or anything but that's because the Black Keys don't really take that many risks outside of what has already worked for them in the past in my opinion it's consistent it's fast it's easy it's kind of catchy but I know personally I'm not gonna remember most of these songs come next month my only major complaint is that I feel like some of the hooks on here lyrically can get a little corny like hey nah nah she's a moneymaker hey nah nah she's gonna take you but outside of that the production on this thing is pretty good the guitars and the drums and the extra instrumentation the bass the warm bass all of it sounds really nice feeling a strong 5 to a lay six on this hmm but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it do you love the Black Keys because of how consistent they are if you are a fan and you have been a fan from from the early days up until this point let me know Anthony Fantan out the Black Keys [Music] 
_SeTi5w1Uhk,[Music] hi everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comment statement discussion begin thing and my question is do you think in the next five to ten years will music basically become free my aunt my aunt my aunt some of my favorite albums this year have been free either free downloads or free mixtapes and I'm sure you guys yourselves have found some fantastic releases that cost you no money whatsoever but you know you downloaded them legally in that case it seems a lot of music is just getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper just for the sake of getting people to listen to it because there's so many artists out there right now and the competition has just kind of shifted into this struggle to be heard because if people aren't listening to you there are thousands of other people they could be listening to and that's just downloading through websites like Spotify and grooveshark and and YouTube and various exclusive streams given to sites and music blogs streaming is incredibly incredibly free it used to be that you would have to pay for music to actually hear it instead owning is what costs money owning the CD owning the mp3 owning the vinyl and as websites like Spotify and Grooveshark become bigger and faster and higher quality and more popular will there be a point to owning a physical release when you can basically stream anything and everything anytime you want at very high quality at the click of a mouse so my question is in the near future do you think music is going to become 100 percent free and if it does how will we support artists into the future will there still be physical releases will there still be record labels will there still be tours will music be free and is it kind of free already how close are we to that future and does the seem realistic is it something that you think the music business can sustain is there an answer to navigate this tangled web we weave let me know Anthony Fantana music free forever [Music] 
J10Fov5VEP8,hi everyone Anthony Fantana Nano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review even though I'm kind of TyTy comic gain howl of the lonely crowd this album is is that out these these guys are an English indie rock band and before you throw them on top of your pile of other English indie rock bands just hold on a second because these guys are kind of veterans they've been making indie rock since the 90s and I think their sound has slowly developed and this album is one of their most mature releases so far I think while comic game doesn't do anything I haven't heard before really they do what they do pretty well and with a lot of heart this band's discography has a range of different sounds some tracks and releases of theirs consists of of mainly upbeat twee pop tunes with pretty instrumentation and others are pretty low fly have a really distorted raunchy sound and are basically garage rock the band's recent releases are sort of showing a very tuneful side of comic gain but they're still sort of maintaining this this kind of messy edgy old-school indie rock sound as they do it all the tunes on here are packed with trebly guitars acoustic guitars really simple straightforward drumming fuzzy bass lines and boy girl vocals that sort of intertwine with one another nicely on some tracks and sort of switch off singing lead vocal with other tracks and there's a lot of nice extra instrumentation arranged around this rock instrumentation which isn't a total surprise because past releases from these guys have sort of played that card on the second track on here there are some very nice horns that sound like they could be on a Neutral Milk Hotel song couple tracks on here features some nice organ the third track has a really nice kind of wailing violin just sort of like you know bouncing on top of the song and the ninth track had a nice touch of piano in it that I loved now the lyrics on this LP which is really where I sort of get the majority of this Bands personality from can range from being really simple straightforward nasty kind of snarky to being very sad and and personal maybe kind of abstract addictive a little dark too the vocals the lyrics the vocal delivery I think that's where these guys really kind of prove themselves to be interesting for me the personality of this record is roughly the same of past records plus you'll find all of this singing that sort of saunters very casually in and out of pitch here and there but there is this really strong eccentric swagger that sort of really comes out on some of the lyrics and some of the vocals on these songs that kind of remind me of like dan Behar from destroyer in a way the feelings that pour out of common gain for me can be really kind of intoxicating tracks like after midnight and she had dreams and some of us don't want to be saved and a memorial for nobody I know which has a bit of spoken word in it I love the feelings and the lyrics on the last track too which is just kind of repeating this this simple vocal line saying I was born when she kissed me I died when she left me I lived a few weeks while she loved me I don't know that last line that last part about living those few weeks that really just kind of hit me and kind of got me all sad and and and really kind of made me nostalgia hard a little bit for a moment there when I used to enjoy old-school indie rock so much more when it felt you know newer and fresher to me and I know that nostalgia wouldn't have have come if I didn't think these guys were doing what they did pretty well the slower tracks on this LP for me just feel so heavy just feel really kind of distinct it's the faster and more aggressive moments on here that I think can be little hit or miss like the track working circle explosive which is so simple and so fuzzy that I think it kind of loses a bit of flavor but the song Yuna Bane's on the other hand has really fat bassline and this really high-pitched organ and this eccentric hook that kind of goes like you know you know you know you know you know as far as negatives on this album go like I said this sound is pretty well traveled and because of that a lot of the ideas that comic game plays with they feel a little deja vu they feel a little borrowed from time to time the guitar riff on herbert huncke has been just about everywhere and the hooks and the chords on the first track the second track of the seventh track just feels so oddly similar I can't get past it still the total package of this album is just a really nice take a nice reinterpretation of old-school indie rock really kind of keeping the torch lit it's not cheapened by slick poppy commercialism and yet it doesn't feel so messy and half-assed and effortless that it kind of sounds like you're getting basically nothing like I said nothing completely new if you're a fan of groups like the pastels or the shop assistants or even newer cat6 revivalists like the pains of Being Pure at heart this will be familiar to you and maybe in a good way I'm feeling that a decent too strong seven on this thought it was really good I do see myself going back to this casually what do you think of this thing have you heard it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino comic game forever you 
UHFFlrSZF-U,what a tricks point never rappelled yeah hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album view OneNote Rick's point never replicas but I'm just going to refer to the project as OPN from now on because that's easier replica is the latest album to come out of this project spearheaded by producer Daniel low patent past records have contained a lot of ambient interludes and sound scapes and and the kind of synthesizer worship that could probably get any tangerine dream fan all excited and this new album definitely marks a change for Daniel he is still sticking to his roots in abstract music in ambient music and sound scapes but the tools that he's using now are different there's piano on here and synths on here a little noise and tons of effects various reverbs and such but the surprise guest on this album is samples sampling sampler San San San San temple dimple dimple dimple chicka chicka chicka chicka Tara replica is an album that is heavily indebted to the art of sampling and it really changes opions compositional style instead of dealing with individual notes or drones or cords or something like that OPN is now building tracks with blocks of sound slivers of looped sounds but still manages to maintain this soothing and mostly ambient and thought-provoking approach and I think because of this this creative an interesting mix of of synthesizer worship and ambient music and sampling this album kind of ends up pushing boundaries in the art of sampling music and maybe inadvertently because when OPN was putting this album together I don't think he was thinking of artists such as as Stein ski or the Dust Brothers or DJ shadow or avalanches or the books or Matt mousse or Girl Talk or any number of other plunder phonics or collage music artists but with all these sound clips that that from what I understand come from television ads replicas ends up being an album that that stands out pretty boldly whether you measure it up against ambient albums or plunder phonics collage music albums genres aside there are 10 tracks on this album that are very beautiful haunting and perplexing and it all starts with a very airy drone just kind of hanging suspended in the atmosphere it's very mind-altering for me and not too unlike what OPN usually does there all sorts of wandering and very gorgeous synthesized tones floating throughout the track and as the song progresses these very quiet quiet loops and just samples start popping up just adding more texture and Drive and tempo to it's like these ghosts noises start haunting the soundscape and it really kind of puts me in another place sonically now the second track is where the samples really kick in and originally it was my least favorite track on the album and now it's one of my favorites the way the the loops have been chopped on this particular track on a lot of tracks on this LP felt really obnoxious and maybe sort of lazy to me at first but once I was able to kind of hear past the fact that I'm listening to loops I was getting into the tempo and I was hearing the detail that is loaded into this song in particular behind the sampling because as the track progresses I'm hearing a lot of sounds that that to me are a little difficult to describe because I don't completely understand or know what they are I'm hearing some flutes I think and various effects bouncing off of one another lots of different synth textures it's a very intriguing track the track child soldier is really choppy as well but it throws even more detail into the mix with this manipulated chopped and looped singing all of these synthesizers some of them kind of airy and light some of them very noisy and just squawking it's like all this chaos set against this very sharp rhythm an eerie singing loops it's kind of like hearing this beautiful thing it built up and then smashed into a thousand pieces there are more tracks on here though like the first track where Opie ends more ambient side intertwines with these samples like tracks such as explain or remember but I think it all comes together best on the song power of persuasion all these really shuffling piano loops repeat over and over and over and it creates a really kind of tense and eerie and pretty atmosphere and it all kind of gives me this mix of different emotions that that feels weird but you know kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat and the sense swelling up underneath these piano loops to me kind of feel like like trumpets and tubas Calicut it just swells like a horn section really beautifully really delicately the song really grows into a sonic Odyssey as the as the since become more prominent and the reverb really gets turned up the title track is a lot like that too but the noisier samples really aren't as prevalent because piano is what's stealing the show here and these very somber chords are just kind of getting cocooned by synthesizers as the track progresses very slowly lots of fluttering synths and buzzing synths plus all these various noises that to me come off as is very imaginative overall this album to me feels like a little bit of a mixed bag you've got tracks that feel like they're they're nothing but samples and then you've got moments that that feel like there are no samples at all is just kind of like a synth drone and while stylistically you do get kind of a range of ideas on this album I feel like emotion all these ideas end up coming from roughly the same place which at the end of the day kind of makes this album feel pretty cohesive to me me me now there are a few negatives a couple a couple negatives for me for one close inspection reveals that working with samples can be really fun exciting and kind of invigorating as far as finding new sounds when you're trying to compose a song based on samples lots of questions can come up like how do I introduce this new sound how do I swap this sound out for another sound while you know not really losing the pace or the feel of the song how do I develop this how do I change this other thing samples sometimes are really not all that malleable because of that there are moments on this LP that kind of lazily rely on fade-ins and fade-outs because introducing a sample or getting rid of a sample it doesn't really seem like there's a better way to do it and there are some spots on here where some ideas and sometimes entire songs just kind of end and just bite the dust because it sort of seems like they've hit the dead end the track remember feels like that to me in the song up which has a really great introduction and a really great end just has kind of like these two different parts at the end it's starting its finish but these two sections just like crossfade really sloppily into one another at the midpoint of the song which really kind of kills the flavor of it tracks like these to me just don't showcase the same amount of detail and grace that a lot of tracks on here do but outside of that I am loving the experience that I had with this LP it did take a while for me to really kind of get into this thing though I had to listen to it I was kind of on the fence with it I revisited it I was on the fence with it I revisited it I was on the fence with it I revisited it and then I was thinking oh hey this is pretty awesome I'm kind of feeling a light too decent eight on this thing but what do you give it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony fan 10010 tricks point never forever [Music] 
XmxL81mXR2I,Red Horse hi everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for in album review the self-titled Red Horse album these guys are a duo Steve pine multi-instrumentalist and Eli Kessler percussionist but those two terms don't quite sum up what these guys do on this album what we essentially have on this debut record from Red Horse is a free improvisational noise album that just is one intense track after another now I've enjoyed music like this in the past for sure but I don't often review it usually because a lot of these records kind of come and go for me just sort of pass by but this one admittedly did stop me in my tracks on first listen at least we really do enjoy the harshness and the tension that noise music can bring but I think with this new age of technology a lot of the performance element of noise has sort of dwindled a bit because performing has essentially become you know flipping switches and twisting knobs and pressing buttons on laptops which isn't a terrible thing but I do love hearing strong musicianship and that's what you definitely get on this record though this record is noisy it is all over the place it's it's sort of boundary-less and a lot of respects how these two perform on this record really kind of had me an off for at least a third of the album the entire LP is about 45 minutes long it's five tracks none of which have you know real intense titles or anything it's just part one through five and the album starts off with just a really attention-grabbing metallic drone that just feels like I'm sitting in the middle of a thousand bull roles going on all around me in a really panoramic way and it's just one of the most ear piercing and shrill sounds I've ever heard on a record if you do listen to this watch your volume there definitely is kind of a masochistic pain element going through this first track and the way the drone shifts which is difficult to kind of take in it's really subtle and and really actually kind of intriguing but things really take off on the second track of this album so to say it doesn't take off in a you know kind of a pumped up you know let's let's just go kind of way it's more like it takes off in that Steve and Eli really start making some noise on here with various pieces of percussion and I think I think I'm hearing some electric piano some guitar some bass everything that creates a tone is just playing very sour notes just popping or swelling up all over the track as the percussion it kind of sounds like I'm listening to Zak he'll play from hella except he's not playing on a drum set he's playing on a snare and then basically anything in everything that he could bang a drum stick on that he found in a junkyard it also kind of sounds like a hundred cuckoo clocks are ticking and talking in the room where these guys are performing this track they're there they're there are these really Basie rumbles underneath everything and the percussion starts whipping out these sounds that that kind of sound like a helicopter is going by it's kind of insane and it's not like the drums and the percussion are abusive just really heavy just really relentless or anything like that it's kind of like just they're there they're busy they're really busy listening to the second track on here is kind of like listening to the inner workings of an old busted machine I feel like I'm in the middle of a machine and I'm seeing gears turning and and pipes are steaming and things are rusted and squeaking everything is shaking I just feel like I'm locked into I'm lost inside of this really metallic dark world and even though none of the sounds on this track really feel synthesized I still kind of sit here and wonder how they made half of the sounds on the song after the second track is where things on this LP kind of start to go downhill for me just a little bit the sounds on the third track don't really seem to bring anything that the second track didn't there's more guitar feedback on this and I feel like there's there's more space between one noise and another a little more breathing room but at the end of the day it just kind of sounds like two dudes making noise whereas the sound escapes on the previous two tracks were really imaginative and different part four on this LP gets busy once again just like the second track but it feels a bit darker almost in a lust more daeun kind of way lust more daeun but there are these huge metallic thuds just pounding as the percussion just wildly swirls it kind of sounds like a killer robot or an alien from another planet trying to break down an iron barrier to get past it and kill you and the second half of this track really kind of dies down and gets quiet and gets subtle with these with these really high-pitched metallic drones it kind of sounds like they're playing sound bowls or something however they're making these sounds they're they're really kind of tickling my brain a bit they're very interesting the last track unfortunately is where I really kind of got disappointed though this album does sort of seem to be a free improvisational noise piece done in five parts I was hoping they wouldn't go down the road that the fifth track did down this really stereotypical kind of noise chance peace road that reminds me of dozens and dozens of pieces that I've heard from from John Cage or John Zorn and you know both artists great fantastic pushed boundaries helped make experimental music what it is today I just feel like Red Horse is kind of toying around with this old hat idea of experimental music that we basically had this this quiet background this blank canvas and then we just start randomly creating unpredictable noises popping up in in every possible direction though when stuff like this is on it kind of you know keeps me sort of interested in that ooh what's the next noise going to be but ultimately it never ends up being that memorable or that shocking Red Horse has some really great musicianship on this album and I think they're onto some really interesting sounds and ideas my biggest issue with this record at the end of the day though I did find it pretty likeable is that it blows most of it's interesting and unique ideas right at the beginning of the album there inevitably will be the question of how do I enjoy music like this what are the standards what are the rules of thumb how exactly do I get something out of music like this you know music like this doesn't have limitations as to what it can be so there are really no limitations as to what you can like about it or what you could hate about it listening to an album like this is kind of like just sifting through a jungle and just looking for I don't know the missing link whatever whatever you want to call it just something something just intriguing something special to you it involves concentration and just really focused listening pop music stuff like that though it isn't bad it hands you its reasons to like it right off the bat whereas this is more mysterious I'm kind of feeling a strong six to a light seven on this but this is online totally streamable and listenable for your pleasure if you'd like to call it that what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next you have any Fantana redhorse forever 
W31Mox0Ez1U,rate hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd and it's time for a review but first I want to talk about some of the comments in my previous video seems quite a few people are very angry and not happy about the font change and let me tell you old font you can forget about old fuck not going to use old don't worry about it I'll use it no you will not stop stop [Music] are you ok I hate just alright it's time for a review yellow wolf radioactive this album is easily one of my most anticipated hip-hop albums for the end of this year I caught on to this dude when he dropped trunk music and trunk music zero to sixty and I thought those releases especially the mixtape were a little inconsistent but I loved this dude's personality his flow his ability to tell a story again the flow the really intricate fiery flow killing it in every direction he just had such gritty imagery that he used to paint just life in the rural South with all these stories about drugs and violence and and just the very moody beats Yelawolf just had a really dark take on southern hip hop he had some party tracks here and there and some corny hooks but at least his ability to rap was just always impressive and he always just came across with high high energy and on zero-to-sixty he had some pretty impressive features too really high profile people like Raekwon and he had gucci mane on there and let's not forget bun B and then once a yellow wolf got signed to Shady Records and was going to release music through them and was working underneath one of his idols Eminem I was hoping that every small my new issue that I had with trunk music zero-to-sixty would get ironed out and yellow wolf would put out a hard-nosed hip-hop album for hip-hop fans but man after listening to this like now I'm running back desperately to trunk music and just thinking damn that is an amazing amazing album on radioactive for me yellow wolf loses a lot of what made him so unique in the first place almost everything on here regresses the beats are more generic the hooks are cheesier the features are less impressive yellow up is still a great rapper and he can still tell a story but I'm cringing at a lot of moments on this LP this album just tries every trick in the book to make itself appealing rather than interesting I'm feeling a lot more aimless bragg's in the lyrics that yellow wolf is spitting out I'm hearing a lot more just generic bland R&B singers singing just generic bland lyrics that probably could have landed on just about any album like on good girl and made in the USA and hardest love song in the world like I said I feel like the storytelling and the themes and the personality of the rapping is still here but the smooth soft and pretty beats behind a lot of his rhymes just kind of wash away his gritty southern sound for me I just don't feel like the themes and the stories really fit the sound of this production I kind of feel like this album is making the same mistake Lupe Fiasco's last album did I feel like rhyme wise I'm hearing one thing but beat wise I'm hearing a completely different thing this album just kind of feels like it was produced for radio play almost from beginning to end for me when the beats aren't poppy and sugary they're really kind of flat and and boring kind of like the tracks Lemaire chitosan with all these like really badly recorded acoustic guitars and just squawky synthesizers there's even a sketch on here where eminem tells Yelawolf that his album needs a song for girls a song for the ladies but it's just really ironic because when eminem was putting out his best stuff a song for the ladies was the furthest thing from his mind the cherry on top of all the lackluster guest singers on this LP is easily Kid Rock on the song let's roll almost all the features on here range from either being terrible to just being delivered by rappers who I didn't even know we're spitting anymore I can't even remember the last time I heard gangsta boo or mystical on a song and Little John really killer mic is on here and that's pretty good and there are some up and comers on here as well like Ritz and shout he fat and even though I wasn't huge on them I I was hearing more guests like that on this album now even though I do think this LP overall is kind of a toned down version of the yellow wolf that I've enjoyed up until this point there are still some shots of old yellow wolf on here like the song grown up in the gutter which i think is one of the most disturbing tracks he's done so far it's got a really heavy banging distorted noisy beat I hesitate to make this comparison but it almost kind of hit me in a Death Grips kind of way but still to go back to my previous point this just kind of feels toned down and I can appreciate when a rapper goes soft to kind of just put some heart into an album be sentimental I feel like yellow wolf does that on the track write your name where he kind of raps about how everyday people are actually what make the world great just feels really motivational and inspirational and the final song is kind of a tribute to his father who abandoned him mmm but most of the moments on here when I feel yellow Wolf's going a little soft it's not in a in a sad or a sentimental kind of way it's kind of in a dumbed down simplified blander kind of way overall this album just feels like a big big big disappointment me definitely not offensively bad not the worst thing I've heard all year but huge huge letdown I mean so I'm kind of feeling like a light five on this LP just my opinion but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it were you really anticipating it did it live up to the hype what do you think Anthony Fantana Yelawolf forever [Music] 
jR4A97iLRxg,hello boy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the internet visual logic nerd and it's time for an album review the spits the spits but before we do this review first order of business this is our old font that we use I'm now going to use this font why because I want to how long will I keep using it until I feel like using another font ma the spits are a modern punk band whose spit in the face of the assumption that all modern punk rock is clean primped and created pretty much just for radio play they've been doing that for well well well over 10 years now and have several EPS and several LPS and and some splits and singles to show for it this self-titled LP is their latest and while I didn't think it was their strongest release it's definitely a fun listen and furthers the grimy style that they've been peddling on pretty much every one of their releases now I started off right with these guys years ago by listening to their self-titled LP first their self-titled debut LP first they have a lot of self-titled releases if I'm correct this is actually the fifth thing that they've released that is titled the Spitz but still for me this first LP is the catchiest thing and the most accessible thing that these guys have released so far with tracks like skate and die die die and black car this album is just a really distorted mid-paced punk rock album that is both mind-numbing ly simple but also kind of hilarious at the same time and this album is no different though if there is one noticeable change on here the spits on this release continue playing with the keyboards and and weird sounds and noises and vocal effects and drum machines that would pop up here and there on previous releases so as the spits kind of continued to play with their old sound but also kind of toy with these new electronics and this continuously fuzzy and distorted and grimy aesthetic this album has kind of ended up being a mixture of older and newer sounds for these guys there are some really straightforward guitar and vocal tracks on here that are kind of in the spins usual style like the opener all I want which is a very fun bouncy love song it's got really silly lyrics but it sticks in my head and I love love the low toned deep distortion on that track and the wailing guitar in the background it's killer it's just got this nice fuzzy grimy feel to it that I can really sink my teeth into the way these guys play the the guitar tones the drumming and just the recording quality just reminds me of like a combination of the Ramones and wire but like a little more low Phi and speaking of the Ramones I know they've always had an influence on the music these guys play but this is the first time I would say I heard a Spitz album where maybe I heard a little bit more Ramones worship than I usually do on tracks like brick by brick and my life sucks the guitar tone the vocal delivery the chords that the spits are using just all of it just bleeds Ramones the only thing that I think sets the spitz apart is that they're a little dirtier they're a little more atonal and their songs are definitely shorter and shorter keeping in line with other Spitz releases every song on here is short as hell in fact this whole release is short as hell it's 12 tracks and they clock in at just over 18 minutes so even if you hate this thing it will not be taking up too much room over your life so anyway the tracks on here the sound like the spits usual stuff some of them are good some of them are okay just nothing amazing nothing new but the songs that really kind of caught my ear on here were the ones like tomorrow's children that track is like an electronic piece of drum machine punk that would have caught a pretty penny on eBay if it had been released in 1979 and was pressed on like a hundred seven inches or something it's got these whaling keyboards in the background and just these these really throbbing driving drum machines and these really highly manipulated vocals that kind of make the the vocalist sound like a robot or an alien or something like that you know from a sci-fi movie it sounds like the spits but yeah it also kind of reminds me of bands like blank dogs you know just this bedroom rock project and the last track on this album at that single I mentioned did exist could have easily been the b-side but outside of those two tracks it's it's hard for me to pick moments on this album that I feel stick out in the spitz style it's hard for me to pick moments on here that really kind of stick out in this album because so much of it just kind of feels say me say me say me say me say me for me if the songs were longer I guess it would be a bigger problem but overall I just kind of admire the feel of this album it's filthy it's weird it's odd it's drooling all over itself in some kind of fierce rebellion against cleanliness and and sanity when it comes to punk music these guys are uniquely lethargic noisy mean nasty and ugly I really like the foundation that this album lies on but I'm not exactly in love with what the spits end up building on it I guess what I feel like the spits have built on this foundation with these songs is kind of like a disgusting roach-infested opium den it may be fun to watch from afar with binoculars but it's no place I'd want to visit without a gun or a drug habit and I get it that's probably intentional this album is more about the sound for me and that's cool the spits do make some interesting sonic choices on here like the blue P keyboards on the track electric brain and it sounds exactly like they're using a chain-link fence as percussion on song wanna be a DD the sounds are cool but I feel like the songs could have been written to be catchy er or more memorable really the spits don't really display themselves as good songwriters here and I felt like that that did come into play on their earlier releases because as I dug underneath the the grime of each song I found that some of the tunes on here we're good and others were just kind of forgettable and overall I'm just not really finding anything on this LP that is all that new for the band in comparison with their last album there's a lot of instrumentation that is shared with this LP though the recording on here is noticeably better I don't think these guys are necessarily breaking any new new ground on this LP but still they're consistent and if this is your first introduction to the Spitz it may not be a bad place to start I thought this thing was a likable listen feeling a light to decent six on this but if you've heard it what do you think do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantino the Spitz forever you 
Ke-HiFnYPSA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest is Hanna's music nerd and it's time for question that I'm curious about statement thing and I have been curious as to whether or not you think or feel that image affects you image image image way earlier this year when the song Yonkers got dropped by Tyler the Creator I remember my first exposure to the song being the music video for the track but I wasn't watching the actual music video I just put the video on and then I was doing other things and I remember I listened to the song like three times I thought it was pretty decent but was just curious as to why everybody was freaking out about it and you know now that we're post that I honestly think that Yonkers would not have been as successful or as hyped as it was if it were not for the awesome music video that got attached to it that showed a lot of darkness and a lot of creativity and just a very great visual eye and it makes me wonder is the music of anyone in odd future as great or as interesting as the respective members personalities and clothes and style and and tweets and music videos would odd future be as popular as they are if they weren't so great at marketing their image and I think what happened with Tyler the Creator at the beginning of this year is kind of being recycled through another artist Lana Del Rey like Tyler the Creator Lana right now is kind of thriving off the buzz of of one single song really videogames it's worth asking whether or not that track and Lana Del Rey would be as popular as they are if it were not for her pouting released sexually into the webcam like this and then throwing all this random imagery into there of kids skyline's and zinzin x' and plus we have to admit if you're familiar with Lana Del Rey that the whole controversy over whether or not she's gotten plastic surgery has kind of fueled her buzz and whether it's helped her or hurt her it is a conversation that is oriented around her image not her music and I think this definitely happens across genres I mean how many banned pictures of of tough metal guys folding their arms have you seen or you know what about black metal too which is known for its theatrical face paint and and like body armor and spikes and stuff like that and to into into of the biggest electronic music artists right now deadmau5 and Skrillex have have both been really good at marketing an image marketing an aesthetic a style just a way that they look and there are other artists this year like Azealia Banks with the track two one two and we life as well as little B and let's not forget ASAP Rocky all of these people have had pretty aggressive music video campaigns that have pushed a style or a visual aesthetic over a sound I think so my question to you is does image affect you does it affect you positively does it affect you negatively do you feel like you're more likely to get into an album or an artist or a song if you perceive the artist to look cool or interesting or tough or like they don't care they don't give a or if they look smart fun sexy eccentric or do you feel like you're wise to all that crap and when you see image being projected at you you're just oh I'm not going to get into that I'm beyond that this sexy girl this really tough guy that they're showing to me I'm not going to give in to such marketing campaigns but when you think things like that are you effectively maybe I don't know kind of turning yourself off to what might be a pretty good album I think most people feel this way and I know I do it's not a good thing to let a sexy or interesting image change your mind about a song and make you think it's great but can't it be just as bad to allow this image the ability to make you think terrible things about the music terrible things about the artists is there such a thing as getting wise to this or are you just being closed-minded is the best thing in all situations to just be neutral on whatever images music videos you know clothing styles band pictures and album covers you're being shown and just kind of like let the music impact you is that possible and finally I guess the the image laser I would like to point at me I'm using image to portray what I'm doing is this a bad thing is this bad is this destroying the art of reviewing so does image affect you let me know Anthony Fantino image you 
Sf0gkn0Wg24,why do I let this happen to me I kind of wanna die every time we do one of these yeah yeah oh yeah I was hoping for something more upbeat for this segment you know marette be more positive think positive fats you know and then the sang will come natural hi everyone this is anthony Fantino the internet busiest nerd nerds least favorite segment on his youtube channel why you know review and this is also uh my time cal church esta to shine my time to shine couch esta you can find other albums he is refusing to review down below in the description box of this video he wrote about them tight type type too busy to tak always tacking but yet can attack loser alright um he has told me five albums and alright the first album why you know review the new Lawrence and the Machine album you know he and this machine I'm sure they worked hard on it Florence and the Machine ceremonials he's not going to pronounce anything right this whole time um yeah Florence and the Machine you know I kind of let this new LP gloss by me because I was not a fan of this band's first album at all you know these guys if you haven't heard of them they're an arc pop a chamber pop outfit and their take on that style to me is just really sugary simplified watered down like commercialized like written almost as if it were meant to sell cars or something that's the vibe I got from there first album but now that I've kind of actually given in and listened to this a little bit this album I'm finding to be a lot more artful and detailed so I'm really happy about that the production sound has changed I am definitely more pleased with what I'm hearing on this album but still am I totally in love with it am i blown away with it no not really but definitely a step in in a nicer direction for this group I thought you know just no real appreciation for the artists voice with with this guy um hurry why you know review the new null gag allure album hi hi Birds no log Aguilar is a member of the the band Oasis and they're the greatest rap group to come from English better than the beats better than the role of stones why not the know gaggle er I'm gonna pretend you didn't say any of that and just respond by saying you know I really kind of shot myself in the foot earlier this year by reviewing that new BDI album you know of course which is fronted by Noel's brother Liam and I should have realised like of course if Liam puts out an album no is gonna want to put out an album and of course because I reviewed Liam's album people are gonna want me to review Noel's album I really shot myself in the foot you know what really bugged me about the BDI album is that it just felt safe really underwhelming really a little bland and something that I don't think would really please anybody who wasn't already in Oasis fan and to an extent I feel the same way about this album is the songwriting better yeah is it catch here yeah is it just more pleasant to listen to overall yeah I'm definitely liking it more than I album for sure but do I think this album is so fantastic that it would impress and amaze outside of the Oasis fan circle I'm not feeling that way you know not that I'm telling you how to feel or what you should think but you know it didn't really strike me is is anything outside of the possibilities of an oasis side project so you know if you're an oasis fan dig it apparently Anthony just does not want to review artists from other countries probably why he is not reviewing this next band as well a Russian Circles Russian Circle circled M proce album I know you're not a fan of fur and bands but why why not this group why you know review their Russian Circles know these these guys are not from there they are from North America um yeah Russian Circles new Russian Circles album to be honest I've never been a big fan of this band and it's mostly because they just write songs that to me I just feel like I see everything that they're doing for a mile they just kind of transmit every move that they're gonna make and I just I just don't dig that you know it's like the the music never really grooves and when it builds up I never really get excited it's just you know really underwhelming for me that's how Russian Circles have have always been and this album is just not really changing that for me unfortunately alright not very good answer there from you on that one I was expecting myrrh but uh alright why you know review the new cold spray cold spray album the title here it's in like Japanese and French just like Korean is this German what is this yeah the new Coldplay um I was getting a lot of requests for this I was actually getting a lot of requests telling me not to review it I let it whiz by me but not really for any other reason that I just had other things I guess I'd rather be listening to you know I don't know like so many people hate Coldplay I think they're a pretty solid band and I really like the album X&Y and Viva la Vida has some great tracks on it too hate me if you want that's how I feel there were some tunes on here that had some surprise synthesizers popping up that that really kind of smothered the the greatness of the song for me plus I was really not into the Rihanna collaboration on this LP too you know it just kind of felt like a Coldplay album with just a lot of pop holes for me and and that's pretty much how how I sum it up all right well your your funeral there buddy on that one I mean finally why you know review the new add the Beach Boys smiles the Beach Boys they're pretty popular group and wouldn't it be nice if you reviewed the Beach Boys yeah smile sessions a lot of people want me to talk about this and yeah this is kind of the thirty second review this album finally released everybody's freaking out first time we're we're hearing a lot of this stuff and you know what it's like it's it just feels like a compilation to me yeah there are some great tracks on here and some really interesting moments too and I am a Beach Boys fan but maybe not so hardcore that I want to listen to a bunch of tiny 30-second to a minute long snippets of random ideas that could have made it onto tracks saying anything negative about this album in a review would be kind of unfair since it is kind of an unfinished product plus people who are head over heels for this thing will just go [Music] well there you have it ladies and gentlemen Anthony Fantana coming out refusing to reveal these releases ah for the dodgy pointless just really heartless reasons that he has given in this program program show internet video thank you for watching this is Cal Church St here and why you'll know review Fred [Music] 
ImsHI_Z6T2I,oh boy hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for you logos it's the name of this project logos there's not a lot of information to tell about this project all the websites I've found downloads on you know artists affiliated websites just kind of leave the cover art and a liner notes and just the download there and just not much else the production on this LP is handled by Ken Barrientos who has worked with other artists who I have respect for like blue and the law there are two kind of main vocalists on here Nico grey and Omar and Mari there's someone on here handling all the horns there's someone else handling all the strings and a good half a dozen or so guest musicians who range from guitar players to other vocalists this thing is just ten tracks and thirty minutes long and even though this thing is a short and free album I listen to this again and again and again I am like continually surprised at the amount of of just detail effort and quality that has gone into this mini album now what you ultimately get on this logo's album is an electronic futuristic and psychedelic brand of neo soul aided with lots of pianos and horns and strings and the style here is just so fresh sounding it just sounds so new it's the point where it's difficult for me to compare this to anything older really I mean there is kind of a chill vibe going on here with some heavy beats and very smooth relaxing beautiful vocals which which kind of reminds me of of downtempo artists like massive attack but I wouldn't be surprised if these guys spend more time listening to their contemporaries than older stuff there are tons of bee here loaded with odd distorted just bent every which way textures flying and whizzing by in every direction imaginable which reminds me a lot of Flying Lotus and there's also just this jazzy soulful smoothness to these songs to that remind me of of artists like Thundercat who put out that Spacey new-age jazz fusion album the Golden Age of Apocalypse earlier this year also that self-titled debut that subtract dropped to that Sol plus dubstep combination that that worked out really well logos does resemble some of those sounds those artists put out but more than them this project just takes me to higher planes of sonic ecstasy with all these layered vocals and space-age synthesizers it sounds so heavenly seductive sensual mmm I'm kind of pissed it's only 30 minutes long but in the 10 tracks that do make it onto this album there is a lot of variety and with some good highlights the second track which comes after a short intro what a great song to start this album off it just Oh hums it freakin pulsates it throbs with so much emotion it's noisy and it's odd but it's also really beautiful in the the harmonious sense that just kind of get layered into this thing the string arrangements that pop up later into the tune the female vocal that's so echoed is just bouncing off of every every other sound and the in the mix it just feels so relaxing and so classy and with the way the vocals stand out on the 3rd and the 7th track they definitely kind of feel like space soul to me just really poetic lyrics and and beautiful vocal melodies and all this instrumentation rising in the background in a really kind of overwhelming way it kind of felt like to me I was I was floating on my back on a really kind of still body of water under an eye sky like I said not a ton of material on here not a lot of background on this thing so not a whole ton to say other than that I think the music is great and it kind of speaks for itself the songs on this thing all progress it's loaded with creative melodies and textures that that were really mind for really mulled over and and fine-tuned these guys have a really definitive and and memorable style for me and this album really is heavily layered and and it's been growing on me with every listen more lessons reveal more details more sounds more everything more magic overall this LP is just really sending my years to another galaxy now as far as the negatives with this thing go I feel like this is kind of short it does have some tracks that I felt like could have been drawn out a bit more but still I didn't feel ripped off or anything like that and at this point I think logos is still just a little rough around the edges as a project as a collective obviously everyone involved in the group is an experienced musician but the end of this album doesn't exactly tie together all that fantastically and and there are a few tracks on here where I kind of questioned the mixing because I'm hearing the vocals get drowned in the cacophony of everything just a little bit especially on the ninth track where you've got these phaser synthesizers and this kind of like buzzing guitar phrase that gets chopped and looped if you're looking for an album that is free that is chill and when I say chill I mean ice relaxing and fantastically gorgeous and lush this is what you've got to listen to I'm feeling a decent eight on this but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana logos 
iRG4w5x2vV8,Bekka hello my needle drops Anthony Fantino here the most tiredest music nerd but not too tired to review some fresh metal vector outer isolation this is the latest album from this Phoenix metal outfit the last time we heard from them is when they drop the album black future in 2009 it was exactly two years ago this month actually and that LP created quite a stir in the metal community just such an intense blend of thrash metal and black metal too with all these spacey themes working themselves into the little lyrics and all of that of course is backed up with loads of technical ability and innovation definitely not an easy album to follow up at a prime example that sometimes artists are more in competition with their own material than they are with other bands so I'm really happy to say that this album comes with some very noticeable changes but for the most part vector has written a series of tunes in their usual style without repeating themselves all that much surprisingly if anything this record just kind of continues to define vector style as a hyper melodic super dynamic intergalactic space thrash band now one of my few few issues of black futures that it could have used more variety and that definitely gets addressed on this album of course they're just intense riffs and and tempos on this record sometimes the the drum fills and the busy leads just kind of come together and hit speeds that would make me wonder if my record player were broken assuming I was playing this on vinyl but you know that's one of vectors calling cards to begin with what makes this LP sort of different to me that it is the increase of slower and more melodic passage on here the softer and slower spots on here definitely have more focus they have more purpose they're just not introducing things and allowing songs to have kind of a clean exit the softer spots are kind of starting to steal the show for me like the really droney atmospheric introduction to the title track that was a nice fresh sound for this band or the sudden loss and speed on the track Tetris structural Minds which man it's it's just so beautiful it's like everything just goes slow-motion after going the speed of light for for almost an eternity and it's like watching the Death Star blow up for the first time kind of beautiful destructive and poetic all at once that moment is just really stunningly beautiful to me along with others I love the the clean glistening arpeggios for me even the faster and more intense moments on this LP air coming off a little more melodic vectors always managed to work leads into their songs really well but I feel like they are layering a bit more this time around making things just really harmonious you know these little mean guitar phrases that pop up here and there the way that vector is now stacking them on top of each other it kind of reminds me of listening to video game musics just halfway into the title track on here I kind of feel like I'm listening to the theme song from Mega Man 2's air man level and some of the sinister and romantic court progressions on Venus Project have kind of a Castlevania vibe to them overall I just don't feel as pummeled or punished by this album I've got breathing room this time around and for some reason I'm not really catching the strong black metal influences and sounds that I heard on black future vectors always had much more going for them than a blend of of different styles they are unbelievably tight but also showcase a lot of finesse as they transition from one speed to another one volume and sonic texture to the next and on some of the tunes here they showcase some extremely impressive syncope which was one of the highlights for me from that new liturgy record Aesthetica now for anybody who is new to this band I will kind of warn you frontman David de Santo does have one of the most unique voices I've heard in metal bar none it's kind of like a black metal wretch but there's a much higher pitch to it in general and there's so much more rasp going on there in the throat the high-pitched banshee calls that we're all over black feature are in full throttle on this LP they really do pop up more and also efforts are made to change up vocal styles too with some narrations some lower growls some clean vocals here and there I was extremely impressed and satisfied with this record I wouldn't call this a disappointment not by a long shot I would say one of the major negatives to this LP though is that there are some moments on here that kind of sound a little too much like black future for their own good that's difficult to do when you're still mining for new songs from your old material our isolation actually uses tracks from the band's self-released CD that came out before black Future 3 to be exact which isn't anything completely new that since black Future did the same and the remakes are great those songs do finally get the production quality they need to really pack the punch they were intended to but I was hoping this band's inherent ambition would cause them to kind of make a greater leap forward with this record stylistically I guess still this record and the previous one are enough for me to to say to you that this band in my opinion is the most standout group in modern thrash metal sure obvious comparisons can be made to past greats like Voivod for example but what I love so much about vector is that they sound new they make thrash metal sound new to me all over again and with all the the science fiction themes the musicianship and clear differences between consistently good songs all of those things add up to for me one of the best metal releases of this year feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this album but what do you think of this record do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana vector our isolator you 
PiuMwOAX72U,Kate Bush 50 words for snow Oh buddy hi my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review Kate Bush 50 words for snow Kate Bush is a UK singer-songwriter who I needed to get acclimated with more than I already was for the purposes of this review full disclosure here I am not exactly a scholar when it comes to Kate Bush's body of work and even though this album was not clicking with me on my first and second listens I was up for the challenge of reviewing the Kate Bush album especially since her name gets thrown around with the art pop greats like Bjork Peter Gabriel Brian Eno and even though my first impressions were kind of lukewarm with this LP it didn't sound generic to me so I figured it was worth kind of sticking around and figuring out why I wasn't totally in love with it but now with hindsight now that I've heard it many more times I can understand why it wasn't clicking with me at first I can understand why it's it's not clicking with a lot of people and why it may not be for every Kate Bush fan and I think a lot of it has to do with just just with pacing this album is very slow Kate's knack for storytelling and her personality are still here but like I said they come on slowly the material on this LP I feel comes on even slower than what was on 2005 s Ariel really getting into this LP can be as time-consuming as just taking an ice cube pulling it out of the freezer throwing it on the counter and then just waiting for it to melt at room temperature ultra still it's it's no surprise that in the world of music there are records that jump out at you and others that you kind of need to dive into actively and this is definitely one of those instances now the instrumentation on this LP has been toned down a little bit I think to a really icy combination of vocals piano and strings of course there's upright bass on here and synthesizers and guitar drums as well and some guest vocalists but sometimes their appearances the roles that they play just are so subtle it's just not going to hit you on first listen no way but still even the first time around there's some very obvious musical posts that that make one track different from the other the opener features Kate Bush's son actually singing and and shockingly his voice is a lot like hers especially when he's reaching into those highs he just sings with this choirboy falsetto and delivers these these lyrics that are kind of penned from the narrative of a snowflake falling to earth and he just gives it so much innocence and like sincerity which proves he's as much a singer as he is an actor kind of like his mother the track misty has some really nice eruptions of strings in its center and it's in its finish line the track Wildman is easily the most accessible on here has a really obvious grooves and quirky synthesizers in there and the chorus just explodes with the youthfulness of Kate's early early work snowed in and wheeler Street is a duet about kind of two lovers who across time name-dropping very specific historical events are always kind of broken up their paths never quite meet up just run parallel to one another for all that long both vocalists on the tracker just so passionate and they're so sincere I really love that track it was one of the tracks that I loved the very first listen but you made it even more surprising that the vocalist guest vocalists on this track is actually Elton John the title track is a bit of spoken word with just this groove this sound an aesthetic that reminds me of a track or two from the new PJ Harvey album and on that song you pretty much get what the title says 50 words and phrases for snow doled out in a very dramatic manner by actor and author Stephen Fry so yeah this is a quiet album but certainly not uneventful overall I found the musical elements of this LP to be pretty nice pretty solid yeah this thing wanders it meanders it repeats phrases and ideas to draw them out in a in a really indulgent display but it's not like these songs are without their progression it's just not obvious progression you've really got to chew this album over to kind of pick up all the subtle flavors that are occurring behind the vocals and the piano now the other side of the coin here and this should be no surprise for Kate pence is the storytelling element of this album just how prevalent that is the track Lake Tahoe is about this ghost woman who's who's calling out to her dogs she left behind when when she died I'm gathering and the song misty oddly enough is about a kind of steamy and romantic one-night stand with a snowman literally a snowman and it's only one night because in the morning he's nowhere to be found the sheets are all soaked and they're twigs and leaves left behind the song wild man is kind of a in ode to the Yeti lyrically the only points on this LP that I kind of found underwhelming where I was really wanting more were on the title track definitely where it's pretty much just kate counting against these different words and phrases for snow and yeah I really like the sound of that track I love the instrumentation I love the feel of that song but the more cynical side of me says you know what this is kind of like a glorified version of 99 bottles of beer on the wall and the final tracks narrative isn't really all that strong either and just does not feel like it ties all the ideas of this album together in a way that I guess I'm happy with but that's just the lyrics musically the only song I wasn't really into on this thing was actually Lake Tahoe the track storyline gets kind of mangled and obscured with all these elongated vocal notes which isn't really an issue with a lot of the other songs on this LP plus the melodies on Lake Tahoe for me just don't feel as as purposeful don't hit as hard I guess nearly every other song here I kind of felt some kind of strong melodic theme going on but yet Lake Tahoe just kind of continues to elude me I'm really enjoying the concept I'm really enjoying the themes on this thing overall it's kind of like being trapped in this winter themed fantasy world created by Kate for about an hour or maybe rather lost because this thing in a way is is kind of like walking into a forest in the midst of a very heavy snow walking in too far and kind of losing your place because the snow is covering your tracks and now that I have more of a lay of the land I figured out where things are it's been a nice experience at every turn there's another metaphor for death or love or loss or age and not that I can't completely relate but I feel like I would appreciate this album so much more with a decade or two under my belt especially since there's a very kind of strong adult contemporary vibe radiating off of this thing I just enjoy personally the quirkier sounds of an album like The Dreaming more if that ever changes I know the album to go to is this thing long-winded is it indulgent yes it is so long-winded and indulgent but that's what kind of makes this thing stand out and even though yeah it's not as bold as a lot of Kate's albums it still ultimately ends up being kind of idiosyncratic just like her previous efforts are if you think this thing is boring I'm not going to tell you you're missing out on anything because this album just does not hold what you look for in music and that's all but if you're in the search for a very chilly atmosphere and songs that that kind of seep into your head very slowly then this is definitely one of the high points of this year kind of feeling a decent too strong seven on this thing but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana okay Bush fifty words for snow [Music] to you 
g01hbKaIfg4,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busy music oh my needle drops I hope you're well it's time for an EP review the new cynic EP carbon-based Anatomy these guys are a Florida band they've been around for years or at least the musicians have because there was a period where they were kind of broken up and now they're back together the band released a second full-length LP in 2008 and ever since they've been kind of making this very slow trajectory away from their older sound but you know can you blame them I would rather they try something new and different than try to reclaim past glory from the 90s now we've got this new EP I've been listening to it at great length and I have to say I'm pretty pleased and impressed because there are elements on here that I think will pleased cynic fans will feel familiar to cynic fans and yet they are moving in a direction that's obviously different now for those of you who don't know cynic yeah they're a progressive rock band there are elements of death metal in their music older music jazz music as well drones soundscapes and with this EP we're seeing the introduction of world music as well and I gotta say the overall sound and aesthetic of this thing is is heavier it's heavier than the previous releases the sound is louder and thicker and just more arena sized especially in the case of the cleaner guitars on this album everybody knows that cynics previous stuff is always kind of featured you know some some pretty clean sparkling guitars but this EP makes them pretty just gargantuan just echoing in every direction just kind of feels like I'm listening to a rock band to play in a great hall with high vaulted ceilings I do really think the production is is is on this album and even though I do say this record is heavier its kind of heavier sound wise production wise these guys are taking another step away from their more metal side I think and they're not really a death metal band at this point not really even a progressive metal band for me at this point more just kind of a modern progressive rock band because this EP for me embraces sounds that reminds me of the Mars Volta with just these really ambitious guitar leads layering over each other in a pretty jazzy and harmonious way and the production style and especially the vocals on here though cynic has always had clean some vocals I'm feeling like a porcupine tree kind of tone on this record too and yeah even though this is not the most unique thing in the world there are albums and artists out there that I can compare to this it's not often that music of this style kind of hooks me in and interests me emotionally the opener to this EP starts things off with a really beautiful female vocal and in these really ethereal textures hanging in the background it just kind of sounds like listening to a waterfall on a starry night and crickets are in the background it's like it's that delicate and the second track the title track on here is really kind of the centerpiece of this thing for me it's got such a busy bassline really intricate drumming a nice groove and these really clean harmonized vocals that to me don't feel hokey like like I feel and a lot of progressive rock and metal music put out today they have kind of a cold soothing calming eerie feel for me they're kind of cultish your chilly it's just kind of strange or odd to hear these very smooth unwavering vocals singing over this really kind of busy chaotic instrumentation and I love the way the song really twists the the bridge is great the guitars just sound really really melodic and the musicianship is extremely strong but then things start to fall apart a little for me after that because tracks don't fade into each other all that well things just don't connect all that well thematically in in my opinion the third track is I think a little bit of filler it's like a two-minute instrumental with a sitar and some hand percussion there's a drone in the background too and while it sounds pretty nice that hasn't really been altered to fit into Synnex style and the fourth track just starts off really sloppy with a messy messy fade in of this guitar phrase kind of popping in and then fading down as other instrumentation fades up and it just feels so awkward and weird and and not really the best way to introduce the next song which is a shame because the hook on that thing is nasty it's just so catchy in the and it bursts so beautifully with though with the drums rolling and the guitars just just climbing and climbing everything is just like so nicely layered and while the the tone and the textures in a way kind of remind me of like of alternative radio rock from the early 2000s I can't deny that what I'm hearing is just really great interplay and great songwriting and the next track elvis beam-out may not be my favorite on here but it's really got some nice noodley guitar leads just interjecting between very quiet understated verses that just feel really calming it's got the same progressive rock style as the previous tracks but with some effects on on the drums I think this really kind of springy echo and just the way the track is produced it just sounds Spacey just feels atmospheric it feels like meteors and rings around Saturn and spaceship launches and satellites and maybe maybe some aliens no way buddy I'm in this country legal I hate Gaucho just that track sort of fades out to a very AM aspheric final track with some spoken word over it it's a bit of an anti climactic ending I guess but still sounds pretty beautiful cynic whether I like the way this EP is structured or not they're always pulling up some really nice textures now overall I really like the direction cynic is moving in with this EP yeah I think their previous material is impressive but I think they've moved away from that they've changed and still managed to stay impressive this thing is not that aggressive it doesn't come on really hard but I think it's got a lot of really great qualities all of which I just brought up in all the songs I just talked about so I suppose my negatives for this EP are that I feel like there's a bit of filler on here and the reason I feel that way possibly is because you know there are some great ideas on this EP but they don't fade into each other all that well they're not organized in such a way that I feel like I get a big punch from this thing things just feel a little scattered I guess and disconnected though I do like some of the shorter tracks more than others I can't help but feel like this EP is essentially three rock songs that I can really kind of sink my teeth into with three transitionary tracks kind of popping up here and there and I have to admit I was kind of left wanting more material wise maybe even though I'm not in love with this EP it's better that way because I'm really kind of left hungry I'm really looking forward to whatever cynic puts out full-length wise in the hopefully near future so I'm feeling like a strong seven to a light eight on this really impressive musicianship recording songs for me but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana cynic forever 
ur3KHH2zQMM,whoo hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a question comments statement thing in this video is about musical evolution a common complaint that I hear from music fans when I'm reviewing records or we're reading reviews just just anywhere is that the band changed something change this change that changed this rapper doesn't rap the same this drummer doesn't drum the same the singer doesn't sing the same this guitar player does not play guitar the same justice changed MGMT changed fiest changed i just don't hear as many questions asking why does this sound the same as everything else why aren't I getting something new and I say this because recently there are a few records that I've been listening to lately that I guess I just wasn't big on not because the artists kind of took a turn for the worse but because I just kind of got what I usually get and that was it I'm talking about people like rapper immortal technique experimental rock band Primus post-punk outfit the fall and yeah these guys are all really pivotal and amazing when it comes to their respective styles I'd recommend any of these guys in a heartbeat but their newest LPS aside from a few tracks I just kind of found them to be same old same old I'm not trying to say these are bad or Lisa's but I guess my point is that I'm not kind of brought to this threshold of excitement because it's it's not like my mind is being bent into a different direction or anything like that I'm not going to have those albums stick out in my mind as boldly as an album that to me sounds like no other and I don't think that says as much about the music as it does about what kind of listener I am I like hearing Neuer sounds I like having you know myself surprised a little bit I guess as much as I love the fall style I feel like for almost 30 albums I've just kind of come to know what to expect from their releases and I did give this a listen and you know felt like a fall album yeah but I understand why change sucks sometimes it leads to albums that are disappointing a lot of people thought for example that new Radiohead album was was kind of lackluster and while I wasn't in love with it either I still admire the band for making the attempt to push their listeners into a different direction but you know what the thing is not every change in my opinion comes out bad comes out mediocre the new chill and electronic direction that little dragon took their new LP and I thought was pretty good Mogwai is more straightforward approach on their latest album I thought was a really great effort you guys already know from my review that I love the new sounds and ideas that battles were pulling together on their latest album despite the lineup change and another person who is notorious for throwing out a new idea a new sound a new concept with every record that comes down the pipe PJ Harvey released a great album this year that in my opinion doesn't really sound like her previous stuff I might not like everything these artists put out in the future I can actually guarantee you that I will not like everything that these artists put out in the future but chances are I will be trying whatever they put out because each of them have built up a reputation for doing something different every single time they release a new album I feel I feel like I personally value musical evolution I think I do and I wonder if you do do you to me when artists make an attempt to change they're taking a risk they're trying to come up with a new sound and that is what pushes music forward it might take us a few extra lessons to get used to a newer sound a different sound but in the end it could be worth it is it hard for you to embrace new musical ideas is it difficult for more established bands with large fan bases to try out new ideas without disappointing people or is it easier for people to embrace new ideas when it's a new artist that is that is releasing them when you hear a new sound or a new style or just something different do you get excited or do you just kind of tune it out and wish you were listening to something else let me know because I'm curious I love you Anthony Fantana musical evolution [Music] you [Music] 
5H69rSUADF0,Mac Miller blue slide park ha ha ha hi everyone my needle drops Anthony fanta know the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review the new Mac Miller LP blue slide park this this this kids a Pittsburgh rapper this is his full-length debut album after a series of some pretty decent mixtapes and I'm not really sure why but this kid seems to have a ton of fans but a lot a lot of haters people hate this kid and while I don't really quite get the fanatic love I don't get the insane hatred either I mean I kind of consider myself middle-of-the-road maybe a casual Mac Miller fan a lot of Mac Miller's older material to me is just kind of from the heart hip hop kind of painting a fun and and silly picture of this suburban dope smoking kid who's very nice and approachable likes to party and has a dream that's kind of a subject in a style that hasn't faired all that well in hip hop the most recent character besides Mac Miller to kind of do a similar thing is is Asher Roth when he put out that album asleep in the bread aisle in 2009 and yeah the rapping and the lyricism on that album is pretty average it's pretty bad sometimes too but there was a bigger issue with what people had beef with in regards to that album and I think it was kind of a problem of trust I kind of felt like that album was a label manufactured trick to kind of get pot smoking Xbox playin keg standing college kids to buy a rap CD Mac Miller on the other hand that question of authenticity is not there Mac Miller is actually that guy and to be blunt about it I'm not big on this album either for me the biggest issue on this thing is that you know this is a full-length debut official album I kind of expected to be wowed a little bit but his lyricism and his flow haven't really progressed matured anything this album is just kind of loaded with fun shallow slightly egotistical party pop rap that is peppered with you know cultural references it's not terrible but I'm not really a fan and it's not so much what Mac Miller says but kind of how he says it because in a way Mac Miller kind of reminds me of the Beastie Boys when they first came out they both definitely cater to a similar demographic and they shared lyrics about parties and getting wasted but at the end of the day I think when you kind of dug below the surface of the Beastie Boys there was kind of this tongue-in-cheek thing about them where they were very well aware that what they were doing was ridiculous I don't really get that vibe with Mac Miller especially on this album because on this LP he seriously tries to create a song where he puts together the soundtrack for the park where he used to hang out at at night and get high and there's even like you know police what kind of going on and off oh no the police are here we're hanging out at a playground getting high it's kind of embarrassing the only thing that I think has really changed about this album lyrically is just the story the narrative just the things that Mac Miller is is rapping about and you know at first this kid kind of came off as as being very hungry and and and and looking for fame but that's gone now and the discussion has turned to dealing with that Fame dealing with haters dealing with fans dealing with the money dealing with the popularity just dealing with it and constantly assuring me and his fans that he hasn't changed he ain't changing nothing's changed he's still the same and that may very well be true but I don't care I would rather Mac Miller change and then make an interesting album then not change and just keep making the same albums over and over and over again the beats on this thing I think are really where things kind of go downhill and I'm really surprised at that because most of the beat choices on his last mixtape we're pretty good I kind of welcomed that mixtape because it moved away from the silly and sugary beats I was hearing on kids that I was hearing on best day ever you know tracks like the spins and then senior skip day that kind of made me cringe blue slide park by comparison is like 50% sugary candy cane nonsense it gets worst on the track up all night where you've got this like pop punk rock drumbeat mixed together with these walking on sunshine piano chords it sounds like a party song for kids who still have a curfew the heavy bass hits on smile' back and and my team kind of feel like like Young Money beats or something and the hooks on tracks like gold and diamonds and and under the weather are so sweet they kind of feel like trying to swallow an entire sleeve of Sour Patch Kids without chewing it just doesn't even feel like hip-hop at this point it just kind of feels like pop instrumentals but with rapping over them the only thing that's really appealing about Mac Miller is his story his fun personality and his kind of underdog image well that's appealing depending on who you are there are some decent clams casino beats on here and the track party on Fifth Ave kind of cuts out the horn phrase from let me clear my throat and then puts it over this more like Club beat it's kind of an interesting reimagined version but a little bit overall I just could not really sit through this thing it was kind of redundant it just felt a little pointless in that Mac Miller wasn't really saying any thing a lot of the time he was just kind of dropping mediocre punchlines left and right and when he wasn't doing that he was kind of telling his personal story about dealing with Fame and that really didn't interest me I see it being interesting to fans to people who have watched him carry on this form so I'm kind of feeling like a strong for to a light five on this but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what should I review next you have any Fantana Mac Miller Bret [Music] 
jtT_ilEovl0,waaait hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the new wale album ambition this dude is a DC rapper this is his second official full-length of course before this he's released a nice handful of mixtapes and this is the first album he's put out since kind of joining up with Maybach Music which is the musical clique of southern rapper Rick Ross a lot of people have been asking me over and over and over to review this album and I just really have no idea why and I guess the reason I'm kind of confused is because this album raises a huge question for me and that question is is this album special is it different is it unique and when I asked that question I don't mean in the sense that whoa this is completely different than anything I've ever heard ever Wow going into every album with that expectation is kind of unreasonable but still are there any qualities here that are different the flow the lyrics the story the beats the themes anything every single time I ask myself that question I always come up with the same answer and oh no to me ambition means you're going hard you're going far you're trying to make it you're taking a risk and this album doesn't take any risks whatsoever it doesn't move anywhere outside of the current trendy sounds and ideas in mainstream hip-hop and while yeah me and mainstream hip hop aren't exactly best buddies I can admire rappers like Rick Ross and Drake in little Wayne and Cole they at least kind of have distinct flavors while he doesn't really try to develop a distinct flavor or character for himself on this album instead he kind of just jumps from one lane to another in hope that maybe one or two tracks on here will become radio hits there's some heavier tracks toward the end of the album I was picking up that sounded a lot like something Lex Luger would produce on the tenth track there's kind of an interesting MPC beat that was really choppy kind of reminded me of the cool kids the track lotus flower has kind of a nice electronic arpeggio floating in the background in the fourth track which is legendary has these stretched out horns that kind of come on really sultry but ultimately every beat on here just kind of sounds like something I've heard somewhere else just not as awesome and as far as the the lyricism goes on here Wally's flow isn't really all that busy or intricate or or mind-blowing it doesn't really kind of come off as as something somebody who's hardcore into technical ability would enjoy and the thing is that's fine that's not necessarily a bad thing but what kind of comes into being a problem is that Wally doesn't really say anything that's all that funny or clever or memorable or different the only track that really stuck out to me is being pretty good is legendary and the reason I dug that track is because wall a kind of comes on pretty hard with his swagger most of the time Wally is doing something really average really middle-of-the-road or he's kind of embracing this new trend of rap singing that has been brought on by guys like Drake and the problem with Wally is that you know he's an even worse singer than Drake was when thank me later came out this album just kind of feels like a bit of a knockoff to me it feels like a chameleon except it's not all that great at blending into any of the ideas it's trying to copy and they understand we all have influences we all take ideas and and kind of repeat them but this album doesn't do anything wale doesn't do anything to make these ideas his put a different spin on them so oh I'm kind of seeing it from a different perspective now what do you think of this album do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Phan tanto male forever you 
oeiWtWcROvo,but you had a key - not gonna say anything nothing other cameras no an EP review oh hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time to review this king cruel EP self-titled King cruel EP thing Poole is a UK singer-songwriter who was gathering a lot of buzz earlier this year and a little bit toward the end of last year producing songs under the name zoo kid and since that buzz has kind of risen we've got a name change and a new EP out now on true Panther sounds I can only expect that a full-length is going to come out in 2012 at least after hearing this thing that's what I'm hoping because there are some serious highlights on here the third track for example portrait and black and blue has these sexy guitar strums in there with just this shimmering reverb on them the song just feels really smoky it makes me want to sway back and forth he just has this aesthetic that is kind of alluring and what's even more alluring than the third track for me is the fifth track the noose of Jah City the final track on this EP every sad and sincere moment in that track just gets emphasized by the heavy effects all over that song it's kind of like this splashy echo that really stands out it's on the vocals for the most part and splashy it's it's springy kind of like a dub reggae echo there's this heavy beat in there this really warm electric piano it feels like something I would hear at a prom in 1950 but it's set in 2011 and it's got this kind of strange sad and an awkward feel to it emotionally this kid sounds like he's on the verge of crying by its effect heavy its reverb heavy but there are so many groups using that kind of sound this year who when they do use it it kind of makes their music sound distant the emotions just feel far away they feel like they're kind of obliterated in the in the overuse of effects or buried this just feels so forward and so bold and so a motive there's this really forlorn beauty about the music on this EP and though the feelings on this thing art exactly happy I don't feel anything shy about the music on here it's just some very watery dreamy and catchy music and agree recording - it's a little chaotic here and there but in a really admirable kind of way now one thing that I also have to mention that stands out about this EP in this project in general is this kid's voice his vocals he's just got this really low you know kind of croon going on and these guys kick thick accent that makes me feel like I'm listening to a post-punk or New Wave vocal from the late 70s or early 80s for the most part just a lot of nice stuff on here that's got me interested in what is going to come out of this project next year but it's not all positives on this EP for me I feel like this thing might have been a little rushed just to kind of get something out this year make people kind of aware of the name change before maybe something gets released in the future because there are some tracks some ideas on here that just feel really short abrupt and an undercooked like the first track which is a nice instrumental kind of makes me feel like I'm on a beach at night or something but it just kind of stops and the third track which is the start of a fantastic song just ends after a minute with no warning whatsoever in the second song even though it's got this this nice feel and is very different from the other tracks on the LP this kind of heavy overbearing electronic be in these relief sugary sweet beautiful touches of string kind of interjecting here and there it felt like it it could have done more still two tracks at least that I loved off this EP and the rest kind of felt like they were teasers but even though I do feel teased I am also pleased so I am kind of feeling like a strong seven on this EP definitely looking forward to whatever kink rule is offering in what I hope will be the very near future but what do you guys think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next yeah Anthony Fantana can't cruel forever you 
G-Rnu8q8fSI,crystal stilts radiant door hi everyone Anthony Fanta no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an EP review the new crystal stilts EP radiant door these guys are a new york psychedelic rock band but not like psychedelic in the in the cliche kind of sixties acid crazy guitar solos kind of psychedelic it's more of an eerie psychedelia kind of like listening to the velvet underground performed from beyond the grave I love the debut album these guys dropped and the last album that they put out came out earlier this year I reviewed it and loved it as well so of course I was pretty excited to get into this and my experience was uh they're most definitely some highlights on here and some changes of sound crystal stilts experiment with throwing some new instruments into their kind of eerie reverb overbearing mixture for example the acoustic guitar that I'm picking up on the on the first two tracks and some of the organ sounds are a little bit more audible everything doesn't feel as dense as it's been on previous records and in a way that's a good thing it's kind of a lighter side of crystal stilts it's a somewhat more accessible side because it doesn't sound as noisy it doesn't sound as ominous it doesn't feel as difficult to decipher while still maintaining a lot of effects a lot of strangeness the acoustic guitar strumming on the opening to dark eyes actually reminds me of the kinks song this time tomorrow and the second track on here just has this very driving beat that I like a lot there are some downsides to this EP though the third track has kind of a cliché spaghetti western ish twangy guitar lead that I don't know I don't like too much I don't feel like it's really the best pairing with this band's style but still I think the chord progression on that track is badass the final track on here kind of for me shows just how far these guys will go into digging into the velvet underground idea box to produce material because there's a guitar freeze on there that sounds just like something off the band's self-titled album and the fourth track on here has such sour vocals and just off guitar strumming it's kind of the messiest song I've ever heard from these guys and not really in a in admirable kind of way at the end of the day even though there are some new sounds on here this EP does kind of feel like I don't know maybe a few afterthoughts I guess some very likable odds and ends a few good ones but mostly all right kind of feeling a decent too strong six on this I recommend it for your crystal stilts fan but I don't really see it wowing anybody else bud fans I guess and I'm a fan so there you go but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hurt why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Fantana crystal stilts you 
CxT49-YpUNc,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd my needle drops hope you're doing well and it's time for an album review the new Drake LP this is his second full-length album the second full-length album from this canadian rapper who cal church esta will be giving you some background information on cal at hurry um dr. drake was graduated from the University of Degrassi rap school where Drake minored in the arse and the B's he studied under professor little Wayne and he graduated tap of his class and the best is mystery thank you thank you thank you thank you that was beautiful all right review time Drake take care but I'm not going to go too far into Drake's past since it's been so efficiently covered already by Cal Church esta this dude's last album take me later oh man I hated that thing to me it just felt so whiny and depressing and I really didn't understand why and it awkwardly straddled hip-hop and an R&B with this kind of underdeveloped persona and I wasn't really surprised that it felt that way Drake was kind of thrust into the limelight after only producing mixtapes and I think that led to this debut album being filled with with with terrible melodramatic and cheap lyricism and even though I was getting all these vibes from this album I didn't really necessarily assume that that Drake's future stuff would sound exactly like that take care doesn't come off like that to me thankfully there are some potholes on this album and we will get into that but overall I feel like on this album Drake feels more confident in his style in his sound not only that but he sort of embraces even tighter all of the aspects of his persona that made him really really kind of criticized when he first came out his his softer more introspective side all these R&B sounds the idea of this this very successful butBut sad and depressed character Drake is is not a hard or a tough rapper and he doesn't try to be even during his most boastful moments on this album he comes across about just as fluffy as a as a 3 Musketeers bar you know he's not a badass but do we really need another badass in hip-hop do we in my opinion Drake's skill level is up on this album and the lyricism though it's not exactly free of melodrama it's a little more adult it's a little more you know thought-provoking I guess I don't feel like I'm just listening to words read straight off of some kids tear-soaked diary page the opener to this LP is one of those personal moments where Drake kind of pens the story of his rise to fame he does it with some really consistent lyrics even though some of those lyrics can kind of be unrealistically boastful like how he killed everybody in the game last year not true I was there moments like that I don't feel like are meant to be - seriously but they do kind of raise a problem when Drake is rapping about how accomplished or how great he is to me it just kind of feels like he's fill in space because if he's not rapping about that he's rapping about how crazy some girl is making him their rhymes on here about other rappers biting Drake's style but clearly that's what he is doing in the case of the experimental R&B act the weekend and I know the weekends Fame and successes is partially owed to Drake because he's openly endorsed them he appeared on the projects previous EP but the favor has clearly been repaid in terms of musical inspiration for this album the R&B sounds the beats in general on take care in comparison with thank me later feel way darker more atmospheric more depressing even though Drake's lyrics may not be amazing he may not be giving me the best reasons in the world for being should the music makes it easier for me to relate and I guess get into the mood that he's trying to put together I feel like that aesthetic comes together really well on the second track shot for me with the vocals and the piano and the keyboards and then the finger snaps on that track the song to me just sounds beautiful the lyrics just don't feel all that childish kind of a story of of two lovers growing apart it's an adult kind of story Drake singing voice on this LP feels much much much less flat and robotic than it did on thank me later so yeah I do feel like Drake has improved his R&B game got more experimental got more creative and I think he's improved his rap game a little bit too and that shows up on the next track headlines now Drake doesn't exactly come out and kill it on this track but he has never really been about that he's always been more about what's kind of pleasing to the ear what's catchy between him and his longtime producer 40 there's just this huge appreciation for what makes music memorable real isset able and and fun and on the next track from this LP the artsy and glossy R&B style gets taken to a new level for drake with a feature from the weekend which surprisingly for me goes off without hitch I like the track a lot subject matters okay but the the beat is fantastic the really ethereal keys in the background and the big fat saturated distorted bass it's a nice and interesting contrast to me the title track from this LP is the first misstep that it makes and it's kind of an issue that a lot of albums that have such a high profile kind of have they're loaded with useless features and tracks that don't add to the idea or the concept of the feel of the album at all they're just put into the album to either get a radio single on it or just sort of get a feature on there that will attract fans of that featured artist and then get them to listen to the album to Rihanna's vocals and kind of the the the world beat electronic crap that's going on with the title track on here just does not fit into the the feel of take care it just feels out of place and as long as I'm talking about things that are out of place I feel like little Wayne is another one of those features he really doesn't rap about the same stuff that Drake does and when he does it just kind of sounds a little funny to me and as weird as it sounds to say this I think he raps with less finesse than Drake I think the only good thing about little Wayne being on this album is that he kind of shows how far along Drake has come since thank me later because little Wayne is making me roll my eyes more than Drake is especially with lines like I Stevie Wonder about her throw up everywhere Birdman is on here but he just kind of rambles and takes up space Rick Ross drops a pretty tolerable verse Stevie Wonder comes on for a harmonica solo that sounds like it would come off some Kenny G smooth jazz record and Nicki Minaj is Nicki Minaj some decent lyrics and this really fruity pebble personality there's there's there some rappers on here that I like like Kendrick Lamar and Andre 3000 but it's not like they're moments on this LP really grab me or leave me thinking oh wow that was those real highlight of this out overall I feel like these extra features and and tracks just add up to a lot of filler a lot of recycled ideas and a lot of do-nothing moments that draw this album out to 80 friggin minutes 80 minutes of Drake this album would have been so much better were it leaner and just sort of more straight in and in to the point but instead we get tracks like make me proud which in its hook and its concept is pretty much like best I ever had version 2.0 you've got hy fr which is pretty much like a boring radio track about Fame and groupies you've got a really lazy hook and a in a boring beat and a throaty little Wayne impersonation on the song cameras and the last track is extremely anticlimactic I mean any number of the slower songs on the album practice for example would have would have made a better closer but still I love the feel and I love the aesthetic of this album it feels like a roaring fireplace in a in a really huge room with wood floors and expensive furniture and a smoking jacket and and cuddling with a fine lady but the harder hitting tracks on here like underground Kingz and and will be fine to me kind of improve upon older ideas of drake's while the song lord knows feels a little new Just Blaze actually produced that track and he came out with what I think is the best beat on this album the huge chorus vocal the sampled soul voices on that too that are all kind of manipulated and watery and this huge thick bass beat it's uh epic I think the slower moments on this album come out really well - I think the only real misstep is the song Marvin's Room which has a really great weekend esque beat hanging in the background but it's loaded with all these cheesy foam recordings and horrendously bad lyrics I know you still think about the times we had that's trashy romance novel stuff come on Drake indulges in that stuff on other tracks like on practice but it just doesn't make me cringes as much and part of me likes that stuff and then another part of me feels like that this music wasn't really written with me in mind it's kind of like Drake's albums are released to attract the ears of of women who wish they had a man in their lives who would say all the corny crap that Drake raps it feels a little inauthentic like Drake as this dude who goes to the club with his collar popped just soaked in Axe body spray who goes around saying all this emotional crap to two girls hoping that they'll they'll go home with him a lot of tracks on your deal with Drake's personal story and he's really good at painting it but pretty much everything about Drake's personality draws from and is inspired by his fame and we all know famous temporary in ten years will Drake be famous will people care that he was famous still the sound the style of this album is is really great and that's why I think what awesomeness this album does have behind it is more ode to Drake's producers I have to take into account that man this just feels so in to me if 30 or at least 20 minutes of crap were cut from this LP I think I would be dealing with an album that was great for me take care as it currently is is just a steak with way too much fat in it that you've got to cut around to get to the good stuff overall I do consider this album to be growth for Drake though especially considering that I liked this much more than his last album I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh Drake [Music] 
kJM08F9aQtw,hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest stuffiest tiredest music nerd going to kind of statement question thing this whole video was kind of brought on by an album I was listening for a review the new pest it moire album these guys are a French black metal band and this is what the album cover looks like I gave this thing several lessons through all the way through it's about an hour long album some pretty long tracks on here one that's about 20 minutes and I gotta say this is one of the most interesting and ambitious black metal albums I've heard this year it's creative it's fun it takes a ton of risks very so of course I had to do research on the LP I pretty much already decided sonically that I liked it everything about this album is in French so head over to translate some of the lyrics do some background on the band on the internet too and on this record and in the band's past releases of course in lyrics I just kind of discover that there are hints of of like racialism in here as well as sexism and nationalism and you know I dealt with stuff like this in the past like on that new Burzum album and what I think this ultimately comes down to is just me not liking the message of this album but I really think this goes beyond racism especially in just black metal music there have been plenty of albums and artists who or the past couple years I think have made some decent or different and unique or somewhat interesting music but I just think their message is kind of boring kind of flat just doesn't resonate with me also something of the new childish gambino album obviously even though I kind of the technical ability that is shown on this album and that some of the beats are pretty good the message is ultimately what really makes me recoil from it but and the thing is there are some artists out there who make music with a message that I don't really vibe with all that much but I managed to enjoy their music I sort of tolerate the message just kind of buries itself into the back of my head because I don't see it as a huge deal I guess even though Kanye West would come off like a jerk and really conceded in a lot of his music I can appreciate his songs and even though I'm not really big on the endorsement of of drugs especially like cough syrup on the new ASAP rocky album I really enjoy the sound of that LP the statements don't even need to be sexist or racist but merely something you don't agree with and once you've made the discovery that you don't agree with what the intention of the music is that you're listening to what do you do I understand out there that somebody may make a comment that is racist or sexist or endorsing a drug consuming lifestyle to the point where it's extremely unhealthy for the sake of joke a satire parody shock value or even to kind of tell a story I feel like there's a difference between that and endorsing a lifestyle endorsing an ideology to say a piece of music is bad because of its message specifically a message you don't agree with does that make you close-minded because in the case of the album that kind of got me thinking about this I've already acknowledged that I like the way this sounds part of me feels like the message to a song is very separable from a song and whether or not we tolerate something that is said in a piece of music or sung is kind of a personal decision we all have to make and it might not be the worst thing in the world ultimately what's offensive is the message and only the message because it's not like the music is what's offensive it's not like you can have a sexist drum beat or a racist bassline but then again I feel like music and message are so tightly knit that you really can't pull them that far apart especially since music is vital to our culture when it comes to communicating our current ideas and feelings a lot of people are looking to express something they find music to be the perfect platform for that and if they didn't have this thing that they want to communicate the music may not have been made as the message and artist is trying to communicate ever ruined an entire album for you there are plenty of Records whose messages have affected me in positive ways to the point where I'm praising the album I'm loving the album is it so wrong for the message to I guess kind of turn me off and put me in the other direction when we find out an artist is putting forth an idea that we really strongly disagree with are we doing the right thing by avoiding their music are we doing the right thing by refusing to endorse it and what about someone who is in my position in every review do I have to throw in a footnote that says Anthony Fantana does not necessarily endorse the ideology of the artist whose music he is reviewing in this review what do you think because I'm torn and confused let me know Anthony Fantana morality forever [Music] you

Z9qBtOaCRzc,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this is a review of a piece of music from the band pianos become the teeth they are a Baltimore band this is their second album and I'm sure kal chesta has lined up something witty deep and thought-provoking in response to this band's name yes a word of advice don't play pianos with your teeth play it safe and just do with your fingers I hate couch esta so yeah screamo it's pretty polarizing term and I don't know why because it's kind of difficult to really even say what an emo or screamo band sounds like people seem to be sure that this style of music originated from punk and hardcore music specifically in the Washington DC area scene where musicians who have loved and played that kind of music we're looking for ways to express themselves differently - two of the earliest examples are rites of spring and embrace the last of which featured Ian makai on vocals and the front man from rites of spring actually joined with Ian MacKaye later to form Fugazi and in comparison with a lot of the DC hardcore that came out before his albums were way more melodic they're sadder they're darker they just sound like they were produced by young people who were kind of frustrated and figuring out a way to navigate life in this emo emo core emotional hardcore term has been getting used for decades and as a result early bands like rights of spring don't sound anything like the the emo bands of the 90s like jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate and cap and jazz and those bands don't really sound like the bands that kept the emo style popular into the 2000s like Jimmy old Dashboard Confessional and brand new stylistically some of these bands aren't too far away from hardcore punk and others would easily hook in a Weezer fan which only goes to show labels and genres only goes so far to actually describe a piece of music to make things even more confusing you have another sub-genre called scream OH which seems to take all of the elements of emo music but bring them to an extreme a harsh and abrasive extreme especially the vocals if you're interested in the style and you've never heard any of it I would look up bands like page 99 great band Envy great band 2 and gospel as well now like a lot of people I had kind of given up on this genre and post hardcore 2 which I've talked about before in previous reviews but this year has been kind of impressive for this style of music I found the new Touche more album to be really enjoyable and that La Dispute LP that I threw on the love list earlier this year I think I love that album more now than I did when I first reviewed it so I figured I would just try this band out try this album out give it a shot since there have been quite a few groups this year in the style that have shown promise now this LP is titled the lack long after it's 8 tracks 37 minutes definitely not drawn out by any means and these guys make some pretty dramatic rock music like any good band in this genre should and a lot like the band Envy they make sure to incorporate some post-rock elements into their music too there are some spots on this record that I could actually see the band explosions in the sky Rocking especially at the end of a track like liquid courage it's not like you're going to find a lot of long quiet slow and shimmering guitar interludes just just sparkling in the sky it's it's not quite that post-rock but these guys definitely display a love for this music especially in their climaxes where they're hitting these heavy power chord with the drums pounding in forjust maximum emotional effect and these guys stick to their guns they hammer up eight songs in this style they're pretty consistent but I just found a lot of negatives as I listened more and more and more a lot like that Touche more record I reviewed earlier this year I thought there wasn't really enough vocal variation on this album the vocals are just screaming and screaming and screaming and screaming and it is a little exhilarating at first yeah but they never really quite let up on much of this album the only real moment of major variation is the last track of the LP for me anyway and you know what it's partially the screaming it's also the fact that he screams so unintelligibly I can't really make out what he's getting so emotional over I do pick up some small hints I'll pick up words like hospital or or summer on this LP but for the most part I just am NOT getting a message that I thought I think I should be and to go back to the vocal variation thing I mean the vocals when they're screaming over these over these really soft and quieter moments with the guitars it just feels so out of place for me I had a similar problem with with the new fucked up album - I actually watched a review of this album my friend jumble junky music had done that bro is my bro and he kind of came out with the with the same complaint that there just isn't enough variation on these tracks - to make this album all that memorable even after I've listened to it multiple times a lot of the moments on this thing kind of bleed together for me but another thing about this album which makes it kind of difficult to remember is that I feel like there may be too few tools in the toolbox you know what I'm saying even though these guys do have some great drumming they're tight band some of these tunes segue into each other pretty nicely I find myself wondering what do these guys do differently than any other band in this style who would come before them I'm having a really hard time answering that question these guys have tons of elements that that I enjoy and I look for in this style of music but I have a difficult time describing them without making these guys sound like every screamo band to to ever live I feel like the most admirable trait of this album is that it's a modern screamo record that totally does not suck but then again is is that that admirable of a trait since I already said I have found records in this style this year that were pretty good so overall yeah I just kind of found this album to to not be terrible or unbearable but just kind of alright a little likeable I'm feeling strong too decent 6 on this record but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana pianos become the teeth you 
vOrHGz2U-zA,Atlas sound hello my needle drops Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review atlas sound parallax atlas sound a singer/songwriter Bradford Cox really doesn't need an introduction better known as a member of the band dear hunter the indie rock neo psychedelic band dear hunter and as deer hunter grew with more and more fame Atlas sound has kind of become Bradford Cox's safe haven for some indulgent musical experiments the previous album he dropped logos is actually one of the first albums I reviewed on this channel and it's a very terrible inaccurate and horrible review and I think since then this this album has definitely grown on me and I've grown to appreciate the music of Deer Hunter even more as well I even saw them live when I was in South by Southwest earlier this year and man they were quite possibly the best band that I saw there maybe even topping Bad Brains so I was looking forward to parallax once I heard it was going to be released and I gotta say if this is your first introduction to Atlas sound maybe one of deer hunters previous three albums would would be a better fit or maybe one of the previous Atlas sound records I'm not saying parallax is bad because to me this album just kind of comes at a strange time dear hunter over the course of their career has grown a lot more accessible especially with their last album halcyon Digest a lot of the songs on that LP were really poppy while still maintaining deer hunters very psychedelic edge and whenever I would hear something new from Atlas sound is coming out and that happened a lot recently since Bradford Cox was putting out kind of a bedroom seer of home recorded compilations of songs it wasn't so much an amazing musical experience as it was kind of an interesting look into the mind of Bradford Cox some knob twiddling weird beats sound escapes as well as catch here in popular moments - Atlas sound has kind of been a project that I've been able to listen to and find a lot of exotic musical thoughts parallax I don't feel has that and it's mostly because Bradford Cox is making a conscious effort to come up with a uniform sound stick to it and the sound Bradford works with on this LP is one that is is very unintrusive its straightforward its oriented around verses and choruses it's actually reminding me a lot of the direction Deerhunter has been going in and though I think a lot of fans will be excited about this to me I kind of feel like Cox in a way has put himself in competition with what Deer Hunter was doing on Halcyon digest because a lot of the songs on this LP to me personally just kind of feel like duller more meandering and just kind of unfinished versions of tunes that I know if they were done in Deer Hunter would be clearer brighter bolder maybe fleshed out with some build ups or segues and extra instrumentation and a wider variety of effects not to say it was terrible and not to say it doesn't have its moments I feel like there are quite a few standout tracks on here parallax is a great song and catchy so is the shakes the opener to this album and I think my favorite track on this whole LP is Monalisa but overall I just kind of find this album really easy to listen to but difficult to remember no matter how many times I listened to it and revisit it because so many of the songs here though they do have a more uniform style they just kind of blur together for me I guess this style isn't without its merits I mean you know this record is pretty popular right now in that real estate record that came out earlier this year was pretty hot too if that's the sound that catches your ears and makes you come back for more than by all means get into parallax but as far as I'm concerned I'm more into logos I'm more into the deer hunter discography I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing liked it a little bit it's alright it's alright with me but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next you have any Fantan out atlas sound you 
EGFCKb5PfDA,well hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's most childish music nerd and it's time for an album review the new childish gambino album camp childish gambino is actor writer rapper and producer donald glover and through shows both online and on television like 30 rock and The Daily Show Derrick comedy and community Donald Glover has been famous way before his music career has been taking off which was really happening last year with this EP he dropped and the mixtape cul-de-sac and every step of the way I have not been a fan and yet people keep asking me to review his stuff so I figure just make a review be straightforward be honest just say how I feel he can rap candy he has a flow doesn't he he has some witty word play doesn't he and yeah he does have all those things he has those things I don't deny Childish Gambino's technical ability his voice is a little whiny but at this point after listening to that EP listening to cul de sac listening to this I'm pretty much past the inflection and sound of his voice what bugs me about his music is is much greater than this to me in hip-hop genre where the lyrics are so pivotal to to driving the music what you say and how you say it are just as important to me as your technical ability and what childish gambino says on this album is is sad it's it's a very personal depressing I kind of like feel bad for him sad because if the lyrics on this album are any reflection of Donald as a person then to me he's revealing himself to be very emotionally damaged and and traumatized individual I don't want to act like I know the guy I don't know the guy but I'm just not into the themes that are being brought up on this album and the first major theme on this album is is blackness and Donald isn't obsessed with how black he is but rather how black he isn't he throws out lyrics left and right and left and right reminding me of how black he is not and of course the black people he doesn't consider himself to be our of course black people from the hood who he paints as as being really ignorant toward his ideas and his personality and his clothing choices but the thing is there's really no reason to believe him unless you're a white person who lives in and grew up in the suburbs with very very limited access to african-americans there are some spare moments of solidarity on here where Donald will rap about how african-americans uniformly will suffer from racial profiling and things like that no matter whether they're nerds or from the hood or whatever but for the most part Donald is just too obsessed with how unhooded he is and it's kind of disturbing in his lyrics he simultaneously says that the hood wants to hear him and and he's just not being given the chance to talk to these kids who grow up in these urban areas and yet the hood has also kind of rejected him and just doesn't understand and what kind of bugs me is that Gambino kind of boldly flaunts his his personality in the aesthetic he's trying to put together and acts like it's something unique I mean this is 2011 there are plenty of rappers out there who are african-american and not from the hood and are way less insecure about it and there are rappers from the hood who are ten times more emotionally complex and sound than childish gambino just because a bunch of people are of the same color and live in the same area does not mean they all think the same thing I've heard a lot of albums recently that have challenged hip hop stereotypes from Fat Sean kid cudi strong arm steady shad bus driver Tyler the Creator cool it's Rex Danny Brown LSI Big KRIT Shabazz Palaces Milo little B and Kendrick Lamar I don't love all these rappers but they take what makes them different and they create something that is really bold and proud a lot of them aren't rapping directly to the hood and they don't need to remind me of that unlike the artists that I just listed what makes childish gambino different or slightly different rather doesn't really add up into something bold and proud it's more like a laundry list of insecurities the thing is musically I don't even think Gambino is all that different from the rappers who he criticizes with some of his lyrics his flow and delivery and inflection are highly influenced by guys like Kanye and little Wayne especially when he's doing his punch line thing his lyrics are insanely misogynistic which is one of the biggest stereotypes in hip-hop he's constantly on about doing as many women of his many different races as possible like their Pokemon or something and he's got to collect them all he's really obsessed with his fame it seems everywhere he goes their struggle struggle struggle sometimes he actually tries to derive struggle from his fame which only comes out kind of pitiful and a bunch of beats that I could totally see making their way on to like a Young Money record if you're listening to him rap and you hear him reference stuff like Ariel pink or rug rats or invader zim and you react like ah well he is just so different isn't he I don't think you're listening to his music very hard I'm sorry but Gambino is not the only rapper wearing short shorts on the surface Gambino is a nerd a hardcore nerd with a pretty conscious and intelligent eye on what separates us culturally and racially that's what he portrays on the surface to me but you'd think if that's what he actually was he would comment on that in a funny or witty way that was thought-provoking a lot like how - racist does instead Gambino kind of takes what little things separate all of us and then he just gets upset about it I feel like I am Gambino's therapist and the pay is just not good enough being the odd man out is the only card Gambino knows how to play and the thing is is that he's not that odd and he's not that out like I said I don't know childish gambino and if this album is truly not him then the character he's playing on this thing comes off to me as being really insecure I mean a character is possible especially since the narrative at the very end of this album is a huge change of voice it kind of goes into this really cute and in funny NPR style essay about a young crush on a summer camp bus driving away from the campgrounds and it was pretty beautiful and I liked it a lot and there are some moments on this LP that get pretty personal when it comes to Gambino's past like getting out of the hood because his parents wanted better for him or he's rapping about problems that other family members of his have either getting sucked into street life or maybe a substance problem too but moments like this I can't help but feel are meant to get gambino accepted by the culture that he's simultaneously insulting with so many lyrics on this album a culture that for some reason he feels like he's been rejected by and yeah we could talk about these very racial and personal and emotional problems all day but it doesn't make for very interesting listening for me some of the best moments with this album have a lot to do with Gambino's wordplay sometimes he can be pretty funny we all know that because of his chops is a writer and he does reference in his lyrics a lot of stuff that is relevant to me probably because I'm white but honestly you're going to have to do a lot more than just reference things to keep me interested to make matters worse a lot of the tracks here are readily equipped with weak fairy-dust hooks that sound like they were sampled right off the Free Willy soundtrack I mean moments like the electro rap track heartbeat are just unbearably corny for me and yeah that's pretty much the entire review so I'm kind of feeling strong to to a light three on this really really didn't like it at all really didn't but just being honest what do you think about this thing do you love it do you hate it why what should i review next anthony Fantana childish gambino [Music] you 
YvcQAEJ6AvU,ladies and gentlemen mr. David Lynch Crazy Clown time.the hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review mr. David Lynch Crazy Clown time the students of course critically acclaimed filmmaker and director and with this LP he is making a foray into music but this is not as first did it even Lynch is responsible for taking part in the soundtracks to his own films of course he's experimented with spoken word and ambien music and drone music before too he's even sung on other artists albums and written lyrics for other artists as well and even though I thought the singles that dropped before this album last year were just okay I was pretty interested in listening to this thing because David Lynch is the kind of director who if you know his movies especially movies like Eraserhead ah he just knows how to use sound to create a tense and weird situation so I came into this thing expecting an interesting sound and an interesting sound is what I actually got a lot of the tracks on this one our album feel pretty empty pretty thin hollow and creepy there's not a lot of punch to these songs and that's how they're meant to be David Lynch uses a ton of reverb a very low fight dirty recording quality low volumes and very subtle whisper vocals a lot of the time to kind of put distance between the listener and the music the atmosphere surrounding the music sort of holds more importance than the music itself some of the tunes on here feel broken and dirty dusty kind of mutated like a Tom Waits song and like I said there is that kind of low Phi weird vocal style combo going on this LP that I think even fans of woods or aerial pink could appreciate the track so glad has this really patient drum be in this cavernous surf guitar and kind of crooning over it is this really weird falsetto vocal that sounds like it's coming from some child's doll that somehow come to life and will kill me once I turn my back on it or fall asleep and the title track to this album crazy clown time which is maybe my favorite on this thing David Lynch brings that weird falsetto vocal character he plays to an even higher level and makes me pretty disturbed and perturbed in process there are tons of reversed guitars and rickety drums all over that track and the story that is being told through the lyrics is a little sick but Lynch doesn't always kind of stick to the styles on those tracks among the 14 songs on this album he jumps around a little the opening has the kind of same reverb II rock quality that a lot of songs on here do but the song is fronted vocally by Karen OVA yeah yes the song good day today is this kind of repetitive electro pop tune with a very dirty quality to it but these weird eerie auto-tune vocals just saying they want to have a good day today but all the interesting sounds and ideas that David serves up on this album do not cover the fact that this dude does not really showcase much song structure or know how about song structure on this album a lot of the songs on here don't have much of a build they just kind of harp on one single idea for four or five minutes until it becomes kind of directionless or boring the four to five minute tracks where the vocals feel kind of repetitive or buried it's those songs that end up feeling the longest for me on this album at first I was pretty excited about this album because I thought David Lynch is going to shake things up because he never comes out with music but in the end all it ended up sounding like to me is an album from a guy who never comes out with music with all the uneventful songs on here in the filler tracks and a low fire recording style I kind of feel like David Lynch has put himself in league with all the other bedroom producers out there all the other self producers out there who are putting their countless tracks and EPS and albums onto the internet every day if you're going to be kind of competing in that league I've heard better lo-fi stuff I've heard better self productions so yeah in the end I kind of ended up just feeling pretty pretty neutral pretty on the fence with this album feeling a life 5 to a decent 5 on this thing but what do you think do you love it do you hate it why what did you think David Lynch was going to bring on this album what did you get and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh David Lynch 
uEINRdIFHK0,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most ghoulish music nerd and it's time for an album review ghoul transmission 0 in ghouls sort of fictional little world they are from a land called creep Sylvania but from what I understand they are actually from from Oakland Oh where's that well it's in California but if you ever go there make sure to protect your neck because if you don't you might get junked why do you think they call it troubling freaky yep that's where they're from these guys are a thrash metal band but they're one of the most personality driven thrash metal acts I've heard in a while Bell Bell Bell the vocals that they have going are done in a really a death metal style they have a very misfits esque horror movie fetish going on and ghoul also has this very theatrical over-the-top dramatic GWAR kind of shtick going for them to musically like I said these guys do play thrash but they've got this really lean straightforward crossover thrash thing gang vocals and fast paces and just and in-your-face aesthetic that I think fans of DRI or suicidal tendencies will be able to get into as well what also influences this bands music a little bit is is surf rock in a couple of tracks these guys actually managed to work in the drum beats bass lines and guitar leads that you would normally hear in a surf song but the thrash elements and the death metal vocals are still there it just doesn't clash in the way that I thought it would initially it becomes a part of Gul's sound and that sound ends up being kind of exciting and conflicting to me at the same time because I don't know whether to just get up and start mashing and elbowing thing or go on YouTube and start looking up old episodes of Tales from the Crypt now to bring the shtick that these guys have going for them even further the lyrics the songs on this album actually tell a story a very comic book-like story filled with cartoony gore that makes it about as fun to follow as like a toxic avenger film the story this record tells features the four members of the band going on this bloody and and horrifying adventure involving killer robots and and cannibalism and mind control and voodoo curses drugs and and cultists as well even though there are elements of punk on here thrash metal and death metal all very aggressive hard-hitting genres ghoul takes everything that is so grim about these styles of music so dark and and so serious and they make it pretty fun to me it's it's kind of light-hearted because you don't need to take it really seriously but ghouls respective members have toured with or played in plenty of metal bands who are taken really seriously like wolves in the throne room dystopia ludicrous under and the band impaled who actually think they share the most characteristics with now sound wise I really love this record I think it's got a lot to offer the drums just have this really nice punch to them the cymbals get a little lost in the background for me a bit but the guitars are really where a lot of this records guts come from they've got this nice heavy crunch to them that sounds fantastic it's sound kind of reminds me a little bit of that new toxic Holocaust record conjure and command so yeah I do think these guys improve their sound beyond their last record splatter thrash but they also refine themselves musically a bit too I think the music on this thing to me just feels less chaotic less messy the riffs have a lot of muscle to them and they're really catchy because these guys are hitting great grooves and even though these riffs are pretty hard-hitting I think a lot of them are evened out because these guys manage to cover them color them in some really nice solos and Lee as far as negatives on this album go there aren't a lot but some of the riffs some of the solos do sound a little generic kind of cliche if you're a thrash metal fan you've heard buildups leads and solos like this before so that makes some of the moments on here kind of a forgettable blur to me if it wasn't for the story the good production just the personality of this band I I wouldn't be riding with these songs as hard as I am right now and I'm sure for some people metalheads and non metal heads this record is gonna I don't know have a little too much Kitsch for you might be too silly for you I don't know and though it is an important part of the storyline I feel like the song morning of the mesma Tron is a little too long a little too drawn-out this eight minute monster among all these like two to three-minute thrash punk tunes with death metal vocals but overall if you're a metalhead I think this is going to be the most fun you're gonna have with a metal record this year and even if you're not huge on metal I still think this is worth trying even though these guys are really excessive they kind of do it in a pretty self-aware way which you know really hits home for me on the last track where one of the lyrics say spill your blood for rock and roll I'm loving the hell out of this thing feeling like a decent eight on this really fun enjoyable solid record with a good variety of different sounds on here that let me separate one tune from another pretty easily but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana cool 
CPVjp0i3WPQ,oh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and y'all know this wasn't this was not going to stay around all that long mustaches do not have a long shelf life in my world at the needle drop you're either a fresh-faced Fantana or your that I want to thank everyone who is on chin to chest at we are the best gotta win number one come on come in come Kim it come on come at ya I hope you're doing well I'm the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review the new my brightest diamond LP all things will unwind my brightest diamond is singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Shara Worden and this I believe is her third full-length album and under the my brightest diamond name share warden works with a team a full band of multi-instrumentalists as well who surround her music and in pretty colorful instrumentation it comes together into a baroque pop style and art pop style and Shara Worden advances that on this album I've known about this project for years I even went to go see my brightest diamond live with a friend of mine and she was great she was a treat to watch an experience she is as much a singer as she is an actress but you know what inside me I've never had this voice screaming saying you must listen to everything she does so I kind of took this album as an opportunity to see why and while I did listen to this thing a bunch of times within a couple listens I kind of already had figured out how I felt I feel like unarguably my brightest diamond especially on this LP brings some really beautiful songs that have a kind of refined aesthetic but still a pop sensibility I'm not surprised that she has toured with Sufjan Stevens in the past because like him she has this really ambitious flare when it comes to instrumentation but all the instrumentation the strings the woodwinds the brass I think it all becomes a bit much and not that it's too busy Shara Worden and her musicians in this project make the arrangements on the songs pretty instant they place them into most of these tracks for a maximum dramatic effect but still on a lot of these tracks i just kind of sit back and don't feel like a lot of these songs are being enhanced by all the extra instrumentation does my brightest diamond need this much instrumentation I guess is my question because to be honest the songs on this LP that really stopped me and my tracks are the ones where the instrumentation was the quietest the most subtle the least intrusive and what I really get out of those tracks the most are just share a wardens gorgeous voice and personality the track brave the war comes to mind where some strumming her vocal and this really soft horn just intertwined really delicately in the last track it sounds like it's nothing but but share wardens voice and a pump organ the song's title is I have never loved someone and oh I want to cry I want to cry to that song it sounds beautiful it's one of the most sincere and earnest and moving love songs I've heard in a while moments like these just feel more sincere are there they're just more impactful to me than when I'm hearing a bunch of woodwinds brass and strings just butting in and interjecting as these songs are kind of moving along in my opinion the more heavily arranged songs on this LP to me are just blended out a little bit by their extra instrumentation orns and strings and woodwinds there's something about them that is just fundamentally beautiful fundamentally sweet they're kind of like honey or look out your window at the first snow of winter but I'm not much of a sweet sky and by january i'm completely sick of snow and gold I think you should check this out even though I'm not huge on it you know feeling the light to decent six on this though I wasn't into the whole thing moments like the last track on here I will not be forgetting for a while and um yeah what do you think of this do you loves it do you hates it why and what do you think about arrangements in your pop or rock music and what should I review next Anthony Fantino my brightest diamond you 
NHnS2gDJEPY,Hey ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha fake laugh hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well it's time for an album review ASAP rocky live love ASAP this guy is in New York rapper who right now is blowing up on a very small body of work like a lot of you guys I'm sure my first exposure to this dude was through the song and music video purple swag and the song at the time when I first heard it I thought I had a really good beat had a good visual aesthetic some style I guess I guess I was looking for more lyricism maybe but now that I had this whole album to listen to I have kind of learned that lyricism spittin fire isn't really the point of this LP now despite the fact that this kid is from New York he doesn't really sound like a New York rapper to me not traditionally anyway I would have never guessed this guy was from the East Coast if he didn't bring it up in his music so often I'm finding that this dude is influenced by a really wide variety of sounds in hip-hop and it's because guys like Rocky is ASAP crew the producers he works with they are musicians in the age of the internet where what you're influenced by is what you're finding on the internet not just your local music scene or something like that if you want to get into southern hip hop you can immerse yourself in it without even living in the south and there are shades of that on this album for me in the terminology he uses with words like trill and lame for firfer uijik and there are some beats on here like brand new guy where the really slow pace and the heavy since and the snappy snare drums remind me of something Lex Luger would have produced Brick Squad and there's another thing about this album that kind of reminds me of West Coast hip-hop just all these really feel good party raps that make me think of Snoop Dogg in the 90s but most importantly I see ASAP Rocky as kind of a part of a trend happening in underground hip hop right now where you have artists chasing after these really subtle shoegaze II kind of loaf I ethereal sounds and they're in their beats in their production combined with a very laid back and kind of chillaxed flow to recent artists pushing this style or actually featured on this tape one of them may make main attractions they have a new LP out called 808 sand dark grapes it's a free album I've listened to it I think it's worth checking out and Space Ghost purp who has a new LP out mixtape that came out earlier this year I wasn't too huge on either just because it felt so low Phi so flimsy kind of inconsistent the dude is even less lyrical than Rocky and I gotta say little B I think has an influence on this guy a little bit if Eddie he definitely has a lot of repetitive catchphrases that he puts out there he references little B in his music and the dude who produces most of the beats for this album kind of came into Fame clams casino by producing beats for little B to me clams Casino and the other producers on this album are the unsung heroes I think that this album had been changed upbeat wise and you were to just throw rocky on a bunch of boom BAPS it would sound a little generic with these beats behind rocky on this album this thing sounds like one long never-ending drug coma brought on by lots of weed and cough syrup there are a lot of weed rappers out there these days Smoke DZA Wiz Khalifa also currency too but this guy is the only dude I've heard who's hip-hop music actually kind of puts me into the high you know what I mean the sounds and the flows just the overall aesthetic of this LP tries to capture the feeling of being high and put it into sound like I said I'm not really in love with the lyrics on this album they're not terrible they just kind of fall to the wayside for me a lot of the time especially since rocky repeats a lot of the same stuff over and over just he kind of throws it in different combinations what he's smoking who he's smoking it with what he's drinking what he's drinking it out of the East Coast how he's a pretty  what he's wearing what his hair is like gold teeth there's some violence on here there's some tough guys  some lyrics about women and sex there are some spots on here like the first track and the last track where rocky gets kind of personal starts rapping and mentioning other people in the rap game but for the most part the sound of Rocky's voice his inflection his cadence is flow I don't really read into it too deeply he just kind of becomes this guide for me this dude that I'm following through all these hazy intoxicating beats he punctuates the thick heavy atmospheres surrounding these beats pretty much all the instrumentals here have Spacey since they're set at slow paces a lot of the lyrics are pitch shifted into much more reduced Roush there will be disembodied vocal samples floating in the background and the bass on some of these songs especially on the song bass is huge nasty just rumbling and to be honest that beat on that song bass it's one of the best rap beats I've heard in awhile and beats on tracks like leaf and what's up they're kind of eerie and beautiful I mean on this album I really think clams Casino is has outdone himself because the production on this thing it sounds so great and yet I really can't compare it to much of anything else maybe I could liken it a little to some of the beats on that Shabazz Palaces album but even that I think is a little bit of a long shot there are some negatives to this album just to be quick about them because I don't think there are that many some of the features on this LP MC wise are just not as good as Rocky they don't fit into the vibe of this album for me coming on too strong in this whoa whoa whoa chill the hell out atmosphere track 10 on here that songs titled kiss and pink and features ASAP ferg who I guess is singing on this song and I could see what they're doing the beat is great and that singing vocal kind of comes in it sounds kind of like they're doing a nate dogg thing but his vocal is off it is so off I love most of the songs on this LP it's mostly because of the beats on this album though you know I don't take anything away from Rocky he has chosen to work with such inventive producers for this release I'm feeling of strong 7 to a light 8 on this enjoyed the hell out of it but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan oh he's a rocky [Music] you 
rgIESOp7WCM,not strain ball ice oh man hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd the future of this I don't know what it is don't worry about it it's not even there just ignore it these guys were a Texas band the first time I heard of them was in 2009 when they dropped a nice little garage rock album that I liked quite a bit and girls club the strange Boys and Girls Club get it I own a copy of this thing the sadly it didn't really make that big of a splash even though I think these guys do have some qualities that set them apart from their contemporaries a really weird vocal style funny lyrics and song titles and a really strong country influence in their music too but you know it's understandable that this LP to me got thrown under the rug a little bit in 2009 lo-fi and garage rock were pretty big and really saturated and most of the big players and the style had already been established like J retard and the black lips and the OCS and ty Segall and King Khan and barbecue show and plenty more bands were coming out at that time to sort of to further that problem these guys put out the second record that wasn't all that well received I mean I didn't even like it that much I judges so I was a little worried if these guys would ever have another record for me that I that I would enjoy and now I've got this LP live music or live music and you know honestly with this thing I've been pleasantly surprised the strange boys have made a full clean and complete transition from their older garage rock selves to a new band now these guys are playing a lot more blues rock and an all country and like I said their music has always had kind of a tinge of this sound in it so it's not that huge of a surprise that they would embrace it so tightly what's unchanged about this band and I think it's their most unique characteristic are the vocal and the vocals on this thing are man they're whiny they're geeky they're awkward they aren't all that intelligible they kind of bleed like a goat or a sheep production-wise I think the strange boys are working with their best and cleanest recording sound yet all the instruments are coming and really loud and clear there's a great balance between the guitars the bass and the drums and when these guys manage to work in a piano or harmonica solo it just sounds great these guys rock pianos and harmonicas just as hard as they do six strings and it gives the music on this LP a lot of soul now musically the blues and country sounds that these guys pull from have been fundamentals in American music for generations it's very familiar stuff that they're doing on this LP it'll be old stomping grounds for a lot of you guys I'm sure partially the the strange boys are revivalists they're bringing back old sounds but they're not purists because they do put their own take on it they do take a lot of liberties with this stuff with the weird vocal style and the messy presentation and some noisy and odd interludes like they do on the song sadist these guys really rock the hooks on some of the louder tracks on here like you take everything for granted when you're stone me and you and Punk's pajamas and a lot of the slower spots on here go over well to better than I think they did on their previous album songs like saddest are really cute they gave me this Oh kind of moment in the in the middle this LP if you're a blues rock fan if you're a country fan and you want to hear something young kind of rowdy kind of sloppy kind of miserable and really memorable then this this now as far as that negatives of this album go this is the strange boy's longest album yet 46 minutes and I think overall I do like this LP a little bit more than their first album yet I don't love it and I think what this comes down to is just a serious serious personal prep in regards to these vocals I can only take so much of them in one sitting I know I know I know it sucks to get hung up on one thing in a band but I wish I could hear a little bit more of the lyrics on this album but I can't because the vocals are just they've just got this whine to them they carry more of a wine than they do a tune I know the vocals are a really pivotal part to the flavor of the strange boys music but I think they could have been altered a little bit without losing this bands really standout personality still despite all that the songs on this are pretty catchy the solos are great and I think this LP sounds like a younger more subtly punked out version of Bob Dylan's highway 61 revisited I'm filming Devin on this yeah but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next Anthony Pantano the strange boys 
RUNnXRjmGoQ,why why hey everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for an album review Lou Reed and Metallica Lulu you see that alright there's been a lot of hype around this release a lot of negative hype around this collaboration very unlikely collaboration and people have pretty much been dismissing this thing from right out of the gate before it was even out really and I'll give it to you you know it was really easy to do that given the first track to come off of this album the view it was put up on YouTube the sound quality was terrible the mishmash of Lou Reed and Metallica did not sound all that good a lot of the abstract lyricism led to some pretty big internet jokes the table but I doubt most of the people really hating on this album have given all 80 of its minutes a hard honest listen but to be honest on some level I can't help but feel like this album is a really really great troll I mean it has to be on some level it's just too perfect of a storm patrolling people tricking people angering people on the Internet is a real art you can't be too obvious or else you're not going to tick off anybody and if Metallica was going to partake in a collaboration that would troll people it would have to be it would have to be a rock figure they couldn't it would have to be a rock figure they couldn't collaborate with like Gucci Mane or like Bjork or something like that people would cry foul and Lou Reed is one of the oddest and oldest living figures in rock we have today and Lou Reed is one of the oddest and oldest figures in rock music we have today who has some kind of mainstream appeal but what been out there has a fanbase big enough offender ball enough for him to kind of just come in and prey on a little bit with some weird-ass poetry Metallica and the beauty is that on the reverse side Metallica is totally a band that would piss off Lou Reed fans because most Lou Reed fans their art rock fans they're above listening to a group like Metallica they turn their nose up at that kind of stuff it's pedestrian plus at this point in their careers I really feel like Lou Reed and Metallica don't have anything to lose really it's been years since a Lou Reed project has gotten this much buzz this much and Metallica at this point I mean everybody's pretty much come to the consensus that every new record of theirs isn't as good as their old stuff for a lot of people the only redeeming thing about their last album was that it was better than Saint anger so people are gonna talk shit about Metallica and Lou Reed whether or not Metallica and Lou Reed actually collaborate plus it's not like new Reed's discography isn't filled with unexpected surprises Berlin with that rock opera feel that came right after transformer the Raven with this Edgar Allan Poe thing going on and Metal Machine music come on so yeah on a level I do feel like this collaboration happened because it would piss people off but I also think we read a Metallica are in a position where they don't need to care if they piss anybody off Metallica's best albums are still going to be really great who reads best albums and his work with the Velvet Underground are still going to be amazing and as I listen to this album more and more not caring is the impression that I get more these guys don't care what the reception of this album is they're just doing what they want to do and that to me is you know more admirable than some group of guys getting together and then copying some indie blogosphere a musical trend to get some kind of minor internet buzz off of it so what's the concept what's the style what a Lou Reed and Metallica do together on this LP not that it matters to many of you who have already decided to hate this thing regardless but I think this album has a really great concept but kind of weak execution all the tracks on here are pretty long winding it improvised they function on a repetitive groove and they feature all of this out there poetry storytelling and lyricism and ice-t-- on top some of the tracks on here go over 10 minutes and the last track hits almost 20 and on some level I mean it would make sense that I would appreciate something like that I love Laurie Anderson I love the spoken word pieces of Tom Waits of Montana Roberts LCD Soundsystem when they do spoken word and their tracks and one of my favorite Velvet Underground songs is sister Rhea a 17 minute long track on their album white light/white heat which is this noisy freewheeling rock song with this great organ in it and the story on that track is about transvestites and cops and an orgy and drugs and its really violent it's pretty sick if that kind of stuff is not your style you'd rather listen to a pop song or something then you aren't gonna like this album no matter who produces it screw the whole Lou Reed and Metallica thing now lewd to me for the most part still has a lot of what makes him such an interesting artist his words are really thought-provoking his voice is really a motive his imagery disturbing I always get something out of what he says even though I don't think age has done any favors to his vocal cords if this album is proof of anything it's that but the lyrics on this album stories about love and sex and the human anatomy and gore and power it's not like Lou hasn't written words about this stuff before I don't see how your average Lou Reed fan can't appreciate on some level at least what he's saying I love the really depressing ideas he throws out there on little dog in regards to too sex and women and just growing old I think and just kind of being washed up sexually as you kind of enter old age and become more frail or something like that and I love love the track dragon on the second half of this LP where he basically tells this story about being subjected being a slave servitude just worshiping the people who who hate you because they're richer than you and greater than you and bigger than you and stronger than you and more famous and popular than you and the lyrics on that track actually are the other side of the coin on the song the view that song actually makes the view makes sense so all of a sudden when I listened to that track I felt like I kind of opened up this door everything all of a sudden just felt a little less ridiculous overall I don't really see any reason for the lyrics and the the poems in these songs to be laughed at to be all that silly I don't see any of the lyrics on these songs to be any more silly than a song like suicides Frankie teardrops and people who are music nerds pull putt over that song all the time let's hear Frankie now as far as the Metallica element of this album goes I feel like Metallica does still have a lot going for them musically stylistically I mean they ruin improvise some pretty good riffs on this album there are stuff on here that is more pummeling and more badass than anything they've written in years and the riff on the song cheat on me feels like something they would have put out in 1991 the guitars and drums on the track mistress dead are absolutely blood pumping and the droning guitars and strings and the keyboards on cheat on me Creed are pretty heavy and dark atmosphere and I really love the strings on the final track junior dad but of course there are negatives to this album for me I don't think it's the greatest thing in the world I don't think it's perfect one of the things that bug me about the cell P as much as I do like what's trying to happen here a lot of it just kind of feels underdeveloped like I'm listening to the first takes of a lot of these tracks and I'm sure that's intentional and I think that kind of makes the end result a little messy and not in a rewarding kind of way it just doesn't feel all that well-thought-out not all that fine tuned and I'm talking about stuff like when Lou Reed should be louder when he should be angry or when Metallica should be getting heavier when they should be playing softer a lot of the details of a lot of these songs don't feel completely worked out it feels like that Lou Reed and Metallica for the most part are just kind of doing their thing have some kind of rough blueprint in here that is agreed upon and they just kind of let the chips fall where they may I like that approach but none of the songs on here end up feeling as overwhelming or insane as a track like sister Rae does I like that song not just for its lyrics and Furze groove and its and its song and its instrumentation but for its chaos and that's what I think could have been achieved with this album a little bit more some chaos even at their most improvised on this album Metallica doesn't really vary too far from their usual ideas and sounds and grooves if Lou Reed was not on this LP this album would just sound like one elongated Metallica instrumental with some strings painting a few tracks here and there because no matter how much respect I have for Lou Reed or Metallica the fact of the matter is is that I am listening to an old man scream over thrashy guitar riffs that are generically distorted and compressed Lou Reed is more aggressive than he usually is Metallica is a little more improvisational than they usually are they definitely pushed each other in different directions for Lulu but I still feel like they could have gone farther to create a more cohesive style I guess I think both Lou Reed and Metallica are somehow under the assumption that their respective styles somehow just click together as is you know Metallica could have altered a little bit they could have gotten dirtier more experimental they could have gotten no easier or something like that or softer this kind of got me thinking of of maybe how awesome it would be to listen to me read just say all this weird stuff over over like electric wizard sounding riffs but instead on here you're just getting this really plain ass guitar tone that you'd hear if you went into like a guitar Center you hear it blaring out of amplifiers in every direction whenever some kick grabs the most expensive guitar he can find and pulls it off the wall and then starts jamming out the Enter Sandman riff on it it's not really that great of a guitar sound to me the quieter moments and the more string heavy moments on this LP are a little more palatable honestly feel like what could have just been on any Lou Reed album but those spots are not what makes this album stand out stylistically I feel like the the combination of Lou Reed and Metallica is just about as vulgar as many of the lyrics that we read puts on this album and that's why I have to congratulate Lou Reed and Metallica they've actually done something that's pretty offensive vulgar to people's musical ideas musical expectations there was a time when earlier this year I watched the chaos unfold on the Internet as a rapper named little bee named his album I'm gay and the hip hop community got all angry and worked up I thought to myself the hip hop community should be ashamed for being so easily offended in 2011 but now I'm here seeing people freak out get angry over this album and rock fans I gotta say rock and metal fans not any better before I to this album I saw this long-winded interview with Lou Reed and Metallica kind of this you know this talk piece where they're explaining how invigorating this album was for them the the creative process and before listening to this album if you asked me about it I think I probably would have called them liars yeah but now that I've heard this thing and really heard it and who knows maybe it'll grow on me in the future I think we read a Metallica have something worth bragging about a little bit because I think what these guys have done here is pretty unique for lack of a better word find a label Lulu stylistically it would probably be spoken word off on our thrash metal core and yeah this album is odd it's kind of funny it's kind of strange it's borderline insane it's taxing it's a little mismatched it's long-winded it's unforgiving I just don't see how all of those characteristics necessarily add up to a really terrible album to me they've added up into an okay album kind of feeling a light too decent six on this like I said I really love the concept of this album I just think it could have used some hammering out sorry for a lot of you who are angry because I took it seriously but a lot like we read a Metallica I don't care if I let popular opinion decide whether and I liked something then there wouldn't be any point in making a review now would there so so so ask kaljaa Chesto he thinks of the album i think wurst cute i asked her on a date and we're gonna shave over here and the review is over what do you think of this thing do you love it do your heart are you neutral on it why and what does you be thinking I should be reviewing next Anthony Fantan Oh Lou Reed Metallica Lulu forever [Music] 
8PqLOyHA7BI,oh gosh yeah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review oblivion eyes abhorrent revolution evolution evolution these guys are a band from the UK 5 piece new debut EP self-produced 17 minutes and from the looks of the cover here I'm sure you can guess you're in for something pretty grim and extreme this thing initially was released in the UK but just recently from what I understand it is now out in North America mm-hmm so I figured that would make it worth a review and also for some reason there's just been you know the slowly growing demonic voice inside of me screaming more meta sometimes that voice gives me indigestion so these guys are a death metal band now you guys know I usually like my death metal really filthy and grimy and blood-soaked I usually tend to stray away from the the really really produced stuff that sounds like plastic to me but oblivion eyes does a great job of not sacrificing any of their ugliness for the sake of getting flashy or musicianship in here it's impressive and offensive kind of like watching Evil Dead 2 for the first time you knows oh I never knew you could have that much fake blood spraying in every direction all at once listening to this thing is a little bit like getting dragged into a pit of mud by a family of alligators and then being torn to shreds as you suffocate on on wet dirt and rocks and little bugs I'm not doing a good job of making this sound appealing am i what do you think delicious all right I just applaud a Bolivian eyes because they just had that really dark grimy lens focused on them and still they use their technical ability to create a golf ball-sized hail storm of relentless drums guitars bass and vocals but the recording is also clear enough to the point where I can make out exactly what every single person in this band is doing sometimes the bass is a little hidden back there but whenever it be solo pops out it's right there in the forefront I hear every grinding chak chak chak know that it's so pumping out but I don't think this EP would be as stand out would be as memorable if it didn't have these accessible points to these four songs as well like the third track on here the opening riff is really slow and doomy and easy to get into and at the halfway point to the song these guitar leads pop in that are really really melodic but as much as I would love to get you guys into what I'm listening to on this thing I can't lie about it there's not much about the port evolution that is easy on the ears but that's what makes it so memorable the riffs are really pummeling the changes are just dizzying neck-breaking hard to digest all at once death growls they are rough they are coarse sandpaper rough and the vocals on this thing sometimes they double up with a higher pitch scream as well it gets kind of suffocating I just think it's great how tight these guys are and how natural they've been able to get that tightness to sound and I think with this EP they made something that leaves me wanting more yeah but once their album comes out and if it is good and I do like it I could still see myself returning to this on the downside this EP does sound like these guys are really sort of in a kind of fetal stage right now because they're yet to hammer out a completely definitive style for themselves but it doesn't take away from its intensity its memorability its potency I'm feeling a light to decent 8 on this thought it was really good maybe a little migraine inducing after all the times I listened to it for this review but but what do you think of it do you love it do you hate it and why and what should I be and maybe are reviewing next Anthony Fantana oblivion eyes 
1_d3YFEGeCQ,yeah friggin snow what October it is getting chilly hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd it's time for a mixtape review thing Milo I wish my brother Rob was here this dude is an up-and-coming MC this is not his first rodeo though he was an MC and a contributing member of the rap group nom de rap before he put out this mixtape which is hilariously titled after del the funky homosapien 'he's first album which I do enjoy quite a bit but also the title is in tribute to a friend of his who passed away so this is hip hop ever since the internet became a great kind of farming ground for hip hop artists to throw their mixtapes in every single direction it's really difficult to choose who I should be reviewing who I should review instead that kind of stuff I can only make so many videos and people tell me stuff like hey so-and-so could use some exposure I'm just trying to talk about some music that that I enjoy I'm not trying to be a musical Robin Hood here in this rapper Milo makes some music I enjoy and what I do like about Milo is that I think he has a lot of interesting qualities he raps over beats that I think a lot of emcees would shy away from because they're too electronic or silly or quiet he lifts from a handful of different producers on this mixtape including mad lib which is cool but what's interesting to me is that he uses beats from shlomo that bad feelings album I reviewed earlier this year another producer I reviewed gold panda and Flying Lotus as well a lot of these beats contains swirling electronics and ambient soundscapes and a lot of acoustic guitar there's very familiar and traditional jazz and soul samples here and there but for the most part the sounds on here are a little out there is out there is my love he's got this really funny and approachable personality that sidesteps the aggression and the unreal bragging that makes hip-hop 'unless for some people and his rhymes are littered with with nerdy stuff relating to the Lord of the Rings and Ghostbusters and sweaters and philosophy and Kurt Vonnegut and internet forums stuff like this has been wrapped about before especially by rappers who a lot of people have labeled as nerd Gore which is basically hip-hop tailored for nerves by nerds and artists and the style have their merits including guys like MC Chris and MC Frontalot but I feel like them and a lot of MCS in nerdcore or just people who get labelled as a nerd rap or whatever they take the nerd persona and they put it out there in a really kind of jokey cartoony way I never get that oh I'm so quirky I'm so nerdy vibe from this record and I like that Milo to me is just himself he's exposing what he's really interested in he's exposing his real personality for all of its strengths and its flaws he's smart and cynical and funny and knowledgeable about nerd culture he'd like to own a farm one day and he raps like he knows a thing or two about the antidepressants but there are plenty of spots on here where he has these moments that remind me a little bit of Kendrick Lamar in that he can't relate to anybody not people his age especially so he starts criticizing because everyone around him is drinking too much and giving him to advertising and giving in to social norms and to hip-hop stereotypes and being too conservative or being too liberal there's not much on this album he takes all that seriously except his own personal experiences which he paints all over this thing the end of the song just us where he uses that shlomo be he tells this kind of kind of eulogy to his to his past friend and it gets me a little it's sad even sadder but but kind of in a funny way that gets me a little you know also the track one lonely owl at the end they're all these lines about growing old but still kind of wanting to be a rapper and be cool there's even a lion where he tells his bed nurse at the nursing home that he swagged out I like mr. doubt writer which is kind of about writing rap songs but then abandoning them because he's a self-defeating introvert now as far as the students flow goes just as his rapping ability he reminds me a lot of MF DOOM guys like that with that very hypnotic repetitive low kind of deadpan delivery if I'm going to get into an emcee who's rapping like that I really need to be into what they're saying thankfully I feel that way about Milo I think even though he doesn't exactly he has a great ability to tell a story and and drop some clever wordplay as far as the negatives on this mixtape go some songs on here just feel just too silly for words especially super happy sunshine funk club there are a handful of tracks on here like that one and like the sixth track as well the final track to where the vocals are just recorded really badly just really muddy they just don't sound good at all the features on this mixtape just don't feel as strong as Milo when it comes to rapping and there are a few cringe-worthy lines here and there but at the end of the day I think this mixtape is really authentic I think it's fun I think it's listenable I think it's realistic so I'm kind of loving this thing I'm going to be looking for the next thing that Milo does definitely feeling a light eight on this but what do you think about it do you love it do you hate it why and why haven't you heard it it's free just download it just look for a link down there Anthony Fantan Oh Milo [Music] you 
X7eK8bLJEMo,having milk grounded milk hmm hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's most birthday music nerd it's my birthday today my birthday so I'm just going to chill out I'm just going to hang out just going to review something I want to review something I've been kind of anticipating since the day it was announced the new collaborative EP from Danny Brown and black milk black and brown Danny Brown's an MC Black Milk is an MC / producer both are Detroit natives and both carry a lot of weight in the underground underground hip hop I have reviewed both of these guys two before on the channel Danny Brown's xxx which came out earlier this year one of my favorite hip hop albums of 2011 and this is a pretty dark and personal album addictive depressing descent into drug addiction plus the lyrics bring a lot of cliche rap stuff to such an excess it becomes kind of hilarious in black milk's latest album album of the year I wasn't really big on it I'm not huge on the guy as an emcee but I like his beats he's got a really nice smooth soulful sound his production that he's worked with a lot of emcees I liked and he produced for that random acts album that came out earlier this year that I didn't feel like reviewing so I was pretty interested to see what Danny and Black Milk would do together what they would pull out of one another in this collaboration and sadly I can't really say there was any kind of AHA change on this EP between Danny or Black Milk it's not like Black Milk changes his style to accommodate Danny and Danny is pretty much the guy I met a few months ago when I listened to xxx but it's not like a change really needed to happen all the tracks on this EP just work without any major adjustments from Danny or Black Milk it's kind of like finding out that raisins taste good on a peanut butter sandwich seriously you should try it beat why's this thing has a lot of boom bappy drums guitar string piano samples vocal samples DJ cuts as well it's a transition from the weird electronic sounds that were on xxx but it's not like these kinds of beats or unfamiliar territory for Danny anyway stuff of this style has appeared on its previous releases the hybrid for example be why is the only standouts and by standouts I mean the only real differences are tracks like Jordan 8 which is pretty electronic and Dada which has a lot of dissonance in the sample set in the background it's kind of odd and it actually fits Danny's personality really well I wish every beat on here felt is weird and bold there are a few beat interludes on here I like too and as far as Danny Brown goes he is still very loud aggressive in-your-face and unique and out there there are some familiar flows here that I've kind of heard on xxx already but the lyrics here write another dark chapter - this dude's hilarious and extreme personality one of the first tracks on here wake up just gives off these feelings of depression and just being fed up with life and not wanting to live anymore just leading this life where you're perpetually high and wasted and angry there are a few loose punchlines here and there are funny one about Mason's and the Illuminati with all the tracks after that one pretty much are funnier more upbeat which I like you know a lot of hilarious lines about about sex that are so gross it actually makes sex sound kind of unappealing but in a blowfly kind of way he says the kind of stuff that I would be embarrassed to repeat kinda like I said nothing terribly new on this EP other than that we've got a release where Danny Brown and Black Milk are billed together which isn't even totally new since these guys have worked together before Danny Brown appeared on black milks last album and the track he appeared on on that album is the last track on this EP and surprisingly to me against the other songs on this EP that track is one of the better ones on here at the end of the day I feel like this EP feels more like networking as opposed to a collaboration that's going to go down in history I think this EP is more for the fans but I'm a fan so I'm liking it I think this thing could have been more but it's pretty solid very fun to listen to and great for what it is I'm feeling strong 7 on this thing what do you think about it are you loving it are you heating it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Danny Brown of Black Milk [Music] [Music] 
YH36huOO0HE,um I want to say thanks for watching so regular it really does mean a lot and I don't feel like I say it enough so hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest friggin music nerd time for a review justice audio/video disco these guys are a French electronic duo I was going to wait another day to do this review but I couldn't wait because I am a fan of these guys proud owner of their first album went to see them live once - in New York they were great when these guys put out their first album in 2007 everybody freaked well a lot of people freaked enough people freaked for these guys to become the thing the banging and buzzing quality of the electro house songs they were putting together in 2007 we're really exciting to me invigorating really energizing sure it was kind of shallow it was kind of simple wasn't exactly you're thinking man's dance music but sometimes I don't feel like thinking Plus that was really nice and obvious disco influence and Michael Jackson influence going on on a lot of tracks on this album I love the horns the strings the arrangements that went into some of those tracks they just made house music feel like larger than life for a moment so yes I forget loved this album and I couldn't wait to listen to this new one even though I was kind of disappointed by the first single to come off at civilization a lot of you guys have already seen my review for that I'm sure but now that I've been able to listen to the entire thing I get a little bit more of a scope as to why that track sounds like that just what justice was going for I guess now justice instead of playing electro music influenced by numerous genres justice would much rather just play with those genres directly to me they're branching out just like Daft Punk did on second LP except when Daft Punk did it I think the results were much more gratifying not to say this is a terrible album though but I will say that hearing justice put together rock songs put together pop songs put together disco songs just doesn't feel as exciting to me the electronics on this album are blended with rock with disco with pop in such a way that it doesn't feel gratifying for an electro fan or a fan of any one of those genres it kind of straddles a fence in between both of these styles and in a somewhat awkward way because the cell P does not really bang does not really buzz all that hard it's not filled with as much mmm and I think that's intentional because justice would much rather concentrate a little bit more on the musical side of things with this LP but on a lot of spots here I don't find the music to be all that impressive after a while because there is still that repetition element kind of going on here plus justices influence for a lot of these songs is really clear really clear to the point where I can almost think of the track they had in mind when writing the tune and because of that I feel like a lot of these songs just feel underwhelming because they pale in comparison to the songs that they're kind of copying the guitar riff on canon sounds like something that I've heard in a number of blues rock tunes parade feels like something Queen would have done with the stomping and the clapping and the anthemic guitar solo the song on and on to me sounds just like Led Zeppelin's Kashmir but with different vocals on it and the guitars and drums on new land sound just like an ac/dc single and in each case justice just creates something that doesn't feel as exciting or as invigorating as the original versions of these songs just doesn't feel as hard-hitting it just ends up feeling like electronics watered down by rock rock watered down by electronics their spots on here we're just as sort of does something in the vein of cross like on Civilization but it doesn't have as much power not as much volume not as much punch I feel the same way about the intro track horsepower which reminds me a lot of the intro track on gross there are some spots on here though where I really think I can give it to justice I love the track Brian vision which reminds me of sort of a combination of disco and classical strings like I'd hear on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack or something the melody is on that track come together really really well I could repeat that thing again and again again so get something good out of it and believe it or not I know a lot of people don't like this track but I like the title track I think it's pretty good the pulsating rhythm is great and even though maybe I feel like there's a bit of a krautrock thing going on there it feels like pretty original tune maybe a little repetitive but it drives very well it's mixed well it's got a nice build as much as I love Justices first album it's kind of a limited style I guess I could say and I could totally sympathize and understand why on their next album they would want to do something different but I think ultimately audio/video disco is just kind of underwhelming because of good handful of tracks here either not measuring up to the old stuff or using their electro sounds to create Frankenstein versions of their favorite genres I want a feeling a strong five to a light six on this I don't hate it I don't think it's bad but I was kind of letdown sadly do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantana Justus audio/video disco for [Music] you 
7VEeJ02y0H4,the field looping looping looping looping hi everyone Anthony Fantana here internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review the new the field LP looping state of mind the field is and always has been the minimal techno project of electronic music producer Wilner he's from sweden I think it's really funny and interesting that on his third LP he quite literally comes out and suggests with the title the kind of listening experience that that you're actually in for with his music but there's definitely some advancement being shown on this thing I think the sounds on this thing are beefier lower frequencies higher frequencies more effects on some of these sounds more texture I love the beats the drums on this thing they've just got this really nice body to them they have a lot of push but they're not like you know bangers the beats on this thing I can really just grab on and just hold tight for the duration of an entire track and I'm just into it I feel like a lot of producers can throw four beats on the floor that's cool but very rarely does it actually feel like it grooves to me and that's how I feel with this album though and I think it's mostly because there's a lot of attention to detail on this thing these little rhythmic flourishes that surround the beats especially on the opening track it actually kind of reminds me of listening to for tetes latest LP there's lovin you yeah there's plenty of repetition on this thing but they're these very subtle subtle subtle embellishments that surround the rhythms that surround the melodic and harmonic elements of this album - the way the synthesizers in the background of is this power kind of swell very slowly as the song reaches the end on this LP a lot of the changes and the shifts just happen so slowly and subtly it really holds my attention because I'm just really locked into observing what's going on here it's kind of like putting life into slow motion while still being able to think in real-time it's kind of weird to me this album is equal parts mesmerizing and engaging so I I think my explanation as to why I like this album is is pretty simple and it can only be simple because this is a pretty simplistic album but not in a bad way I just think it's interesting that what is happening on this album to me seems kind of obvious and yet it works so well it sounds so good and for some reason a lot of producers overlook this kind of style this kind of aesthetic but that's not to say that I think this album is perfect or that I think it's without its lower points one of my least favorite moments is on the third track of this album burned out it's something that also happens on the last track of this album too and for some reason it just really rubs me the wrong way like I said earlier I find this album really mesmerizing and I like that feeling I like kind of feeling hypnotized by the repetition and the textures of this album but this third song there are these really disembodied vocals floating around in the air surrounding this track and I don't know they're just kind of killing my buzz they just don't feel like they fit into the song at any point for me whereas everything is locked into this rhythmic Tetris puzzle where everything has a place and everything has a purpose these vocals are kind of calling out and not really adding anything just kind of distracting like I said that happens on the last track too but I think I may like that track even less because the beat is a little off for me it kind of sounds like listening to a copy-machine make about 2000 copies non-stop it's not a traditional rhythm and that's fine I'm cool with that I think I actually would have liked the track a little bit more if I felt like that song offered as much progression as many of the other tracks on this album do sure I have a few reservations but the tracks on this thing that I loved I loved a lot and for sure I will be digging into the fields previous albums a little bit more now that I have listened to this and I liked it for the most part kind of feeling a decent too strong seven on this but what do you think do you like this thing do you hate it are you in a looping state of mind and if not why and what should I review next you have any Fantan out the field you 
cYpnHONNf1k,really really lately hi everybody Anthony Pham tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd yep and it's time for an album review Tom Waits that is me Tom Waits in my opinion is one of modern music's most eccentric and standout songwriters he's a guy who in a way I have to thank for kind of changing the way I listen to music change the things that I look for in music sometimes to his stuff over the years has helped me appreciate things like grit and abstract lyricism and darkness and odd sounds when I first heard of this guy it was when he dropped his album real gone in 2004 not his greatest LP but at that time my musical world was very very small so being introduced to Tom Waits was kind of like dropping a boulder in a kiddie pool he just didn't sound like anything I had ever heard before in my life so I became obsessed and learned his influences and read interviews and books and managed to get a copy of nearly every album he ever made between the time he put out real gone and then released orphans just two years later now when I first heard bad as me was coming out I was you know kind of afraid to listen to it not as a fan but because I knew I was going to have to review it and I was going to have to battle myself either in one direction or the other and try to either not be a fanboy or try to not be too negative because I'm so enamored with Tom's previous works but to be completely honest in my first few listens to this LP I was pretty disappointed and I still am to an extent I don't think bad as me as a terrible album but what made me kind of disappointed is that in my opinion every Tom Waits album up until this point especially everything that came after rain dogs has a particular feel to it that makes it different from every other Tom Waits album I think bad as me is packing that mule variations to me is very kind of worn and dusty I just kind of get this like this old-school hitchhiker kind of feel from it bone machine is loud and clanging and bending I just kind of feel like I'm like in some underground cave and it's really dark and they're monsters in there it's kind of freaky Alice is incredibly dark and depressing blood-money really barks with intensity it's just smothered in blood and cigar smoke it's a really kind of murderous album and real gone is so low fie and fuzzy really Tom Waits is most noisy album yet in my opinion and I think there are some common threads that run through each album like Tom Waits voice piano ballad screamers and singers bangers and clangers and on bad as me I don't feel like Tom is offering me a new style at least not for an entire album anyway I feel like for the most part bad as me is almost kind of like a retrospective of Tom looking back revisiting past sounds and just kind of looking at how bad he's been over the years the really slow bluesy feel of raised right men would have fit in really well with heart attack and vine if it wasn't for that screaming organ in the background payme is a really nostalgic waltz and New Year's Eve has the kind of storytelling that reminds me a lot of Frank's wild years especially since pay me has lyrics about Fame and the stage lasts leaf and face to the highway are kind of forlorn and and very subtle and quiet I could just hear the wind blowing and the tumbleweeds going by on these tracks and it really makes me feel like I'm listening the mule variations kiss me reminds me of these really long wandering love ballads that he used to write a lot more way back in the day on albums like Blue Valentine I could go on forever none of these revisits really bugged me except for the song satisfied which sounds exactly like the song big black Mariah from Rain Dogs you can pretty much sing the hook from one song over the other without any hitches overall I'm not really feeling a flavor from album or an overall style to me right now this album kind of feels like a mixed bag a lot like orphans was except you're only really getting one albums length of tracks only a few spots only a few here feel kind of new to me I love the song get lost because it's got this rockabilly feel to it and then it kind of struck me why haven't I heard Tom go down this direction more before the song bad is me goes nuts with his voice that Tom Waits kind of saves only for special occasions and the song hell broke loose man that thing is noisy as hell has these guitars in the background just pumping in a way that kind of reminds me of industrial music it bangs it screams and is an interesting reflection about war and paints a story about this military where Tom is singing from the perspective of a soldier talking about getting off meth and bringing up suicide bombs so because I feel like I'm hearing a lot of things on this album I've heard before I think what makes this thing enjoyable what it really comes down to is just the tunes the melodies the hooks the lyrics the song raised right men is is is pretty dark and and I think in a way funny it's just about how a good man is hard to find talking at the same time is kind of about how the problems of the world are being overlooked because everybody is talking at the same time Tom sings and this really creepy falsetto that I love that he doesn't do all too often in the woodwinds that come past the hooks on that track are really beautiful and on that track Tom drops a lyrical nugget that reminds me that he is kind of a lyrical double genius sometimes he says everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain but there are a good chunk of tracks on here that just leave me wanting more the song kiss me I kind of roll my eyes at some of the lyrics on that track I've never really known Tom to throw out that many cliches in one song and the song back in the crowd feels kind of just dry and empty in a way that leaves me underwhelmed it's one of the cleaner and more sanitized Tom Waits songs I've ever heard there's not a speck dirt insight in any direction I think there's kind of a funny metaphor in the hook but outside of that it's not really doing a lot for me and the song last leaf to me is a little kind of long-winded I guess the guitars don't do that much for me and the background vocals intertwine with the lead vocals in a really awkward way that's distracting more than it is complementing I mean if you're the last leaf on the tree who is that singing I think this LP is kind of a sidestep definitely not a step backwards in my opinion tom has not lost his musical flavor at all he's always really had obvious influences like Howlin wolf and Captain Beefheart and blues artists like Muddy Waters and jazz artists like Louie Armstrong of course he's really influenced by gospel music too but overall when Tom Waits makes a song it sounds like a Tom Waits song despite the fact that there's really no cohesive feel between these tracks for me I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this I thought it was really good and worth checking out but it's definitely not one of my favorites in his catalogue but what do you think of this thing do you love it do you hate it why and what do you think I should review next anthony Fantan Oh Tom Waits [Music] 
nHbmzON5kkk,why are we doing another one of these again well it's because this is the best thing your YouTube channel has going oh you know we need theme sang theme sag for this thing why you know review shhh make that make that happen come on good man all right hi everyone Cal church st here the roommate of the Internet's busiest music nerd Anthony Fantana and this is why you know a review which is a segment monthly segment where we tak about some records that Anthony is basically not reviewed or is refusing to review because he takes music too serious he doesn't understand what we like so this is why I'm asking you Anthony why are you not what why are you why you know review the new DG the new DG DG schastye album the less you know the better yeah the new DJ shadow LP I feel like a lot of people with especially in the case of DJ shadow get caught up in his older material introducing is a great album I own a copy of it myself but the thing is I think many people have convinced themselves that he's never ever going to create anything equally as interesting as that album which is kind of silly but still I've had some issues with this LP I can see why other people have too it's pretty inconsistent it's pretty all over the place it's loaded with things that I would never expect from DJ shadow or really look to him to make for me like warning call which is kind of like this little bland understated indie rock tune with Tom Beck on the vocals and sad and lonely which is kind of this lonely eerie piano ballad this thing is so varied I can't really put a jean row on it at all it's got about as many highs and lows as like a compilation of sing goals from a random-ass record label if you're really looking for a mixed bag check this out okay doesn't like the album because it has too much music on it right there uh makes sense to me why you know review the new graph eise graph eise album pink magics yeah giraffes giraffes pink magic these guys are pretty nice instrumental group lots of math rock elements in their style and the first few moments on this thing are pretty intense and got me excited but I wasn't really riding the same exciting wave throughout the entire album I guess alright um what why you know review the new Kimber album quick Kimbra vows yeah I was actually pretty excited about this one when I first heard of Kimbra on that that Gore Tiye album that I did a track review from on the website and I feel like there's some really catchy in kind of original moments on this thing like the track settled down which has these really really kind of bold and colorful vocals that that could remind me of the chirping vocals on Dirty Projectors bit of Orca or even on that new tune-yards LP who kill some really nice alternative pop music is located on this release but then I feel like some other songs take a turn for just something kind of generic with these really jazzy bass lines in the background that really are jazzy they're just being repeated I don't upright bass it just kind of feels like iPod commercial music a little bit some of you guys may like it more than me it's a pop album with female vocals that has a bit of a theme going on about love and relationships where every song kind of explores a different Avenue of relationships from getting married to cheating to starting I feel like it's got some strong moments but not enough to make me want to come back to it I guess do you hear that it's the sound of nothing because he has no heart pumping blood in here none nothing nothing is in there what do you think of the new orbiter album world's turn asunder yeah the war bringer you guys know that I like myself some thrash metal and imagine my excitement when I heard that there was a thrash metal band by the name of war bringer with a new album called world's torn asunder and I feel like these guys have some pretty good and melodic solos that I like a lot but a lot of the riffs weren't really all that memorable for me and they just feel a tad bit over produced and just overproduction is is is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to to metal music so yeah this wasn't really doing it for me throughout the whole thing well if it's a loud rap music it's probably not that that good anyway yeah all right well I you know review of the the new Bush album the sea of memoirs he was our president for eight years just like every kid in 1994 I owned a cassette copy of 16 stone but I have no interest in a new Bush record I'm sorry y-you know review of the new James addiction the the great escape artist pretty much the same thing with Bush except in 1994 I was not a Jane's Addiction fan even when I was a kid my ears did not gravitate toward their sound they never have and I wonder if they ever will listening to it today I feel like nothing's shocking still has some really bold and an experimental moments on it I think it's still a relevant album I mean Death Grips sampled it on the first track to their new album but this new LP really has done nothing whatsoever for me it just kind of feels like safe alternative rock and that's it well then maybe you need to fix your ears you know maybe listen with your heart and sitting your head why you know review the new cymbals eats guitar yeah I'm not 100% sure how this slipped through the cracks but these guys are in New York band they dropped their debut why are their mountains in 2009 got a lot of rave reviews and I liked it too but this one just wasn't hitting me as hard just didn't feel as large and in charge a lot of the songs are shorter a lot of the musical builds of these tracks are simpler and I could appreciate that these guys want to do something more straightforward more to the point but I feel like part of what makes this band interesting was sacrificed in the process but only a little bit I still think it's an interesting record for anybody who wants to hear an older style of indie rock alright why you know review the the real estate states the real estate day the the day yes people have been begging me to review this album and you know I wasn't even really into this band's first album I never really quite got the real estate bubble Jake Jake jingling jangly guitars simple melodies very vocals mellow feel and so much reverb that the music kind of ends up sounding like a smudgy blurry Polaroid picture it's a really light and easy listen but nothing on this really strikes me as being memorable and it's not like I'm not into the style I've enjoyed stuff like this in the past I think stuff that's just as reverb Ian smudgy and buried like that new craft spells LP that came out on captured tracks I just don't find this to be that bold but I don't think you have to sacrifice being bold in the name of being quiet and being subtle for example I think Bradford Cox and his atlas sound project always comes up with some really interesting songs and textures despite the fact that a lot of the time he's much quieter than this real estate record so yeah nothing on this thing really sticks with me it's always just in one ear out the other it's always a blur alright I suppose that's fair enough um here's a singer who is of the religious persuasion I think why you know if you the new solar Jesus Solar Jesus yeah Zola Jesus I'm not doing the new Zola Jesus I've had friends of mine who are really into her stuff I've kind of been hearing her around since 2009 when her recordings were way more lo-fi and I can't say she's really ever done anything for me I give her credit for sticking to her guns sticking to a style and just keeping consistent but the whole dark wave thing that she's doing not that I'm against the genre itself but the synth sounds the drum machines and in her voice I'm really not a fan of her voice it just feels a little flimsy to me altogether on the surface it sounds like something I could be really into but once I dig in a little bit I just lose interest to be honest whoo it's too dark dark dark for me turn on the light you'll you'll enjoy it more re you know you like the ocean don't you a waves waves the life sucks why you know where you yeah the new waves EP I just don't feel like it offers much beyond king of the beach which came out last year yeah you had the best Coast collaboration and the fucked-up collaboration and that's fine but you know I kind of feel like I'm being served Salisbury steak at my school cafeteria in fourth grade with this one all right and why you know review with a new pussy fur pussy fur conditions of my peril yes this is a solo effort from Maynard front man for a perfect circle front man for tool and I do consider a couple tool records to be serious classics I've never really been big enough of a fan to follow or really be interested in Maynard's solo exploits I've been listening to a little bit of this and I have to admit that I'm not getting anything out of it just like past Puscifer material that's hardly fair it's like a little bit of a discrimination there all right why you know review Stevi Wilson's the Stevie Wilson's grace Ford Rani yeah I'm not doing the new Steven Wilson it's been requested and requested and requested and I feel bad I do I do but a review of this record will make no one happy not me not you not Steven Wilson nobody this guy is a modern progressive rock giant most known for his work in porcupine tree I've never been a fan of that band they just sound too overproduced for me to really get into it's just too clean it just doesn't offer me the intensity that I look for in rock music this album is not really turning me into a fan either but it is the most listenable experience I've had with something Steven Wilson related and the reason I think that is is because Steven Wilson is really embracing a lot like opeth did on their new LP an older more vintage style of progressive rock he's always been influenced by this stuff but to me on this record he's really going back in time and getting really obvious nods to people like King Crimson and Jethro Tull and I think that's fine I like a lot of the instrumental interludes on this track some of the riffs are really heavy I like the really crazy saxophone playing on this album but it doesn't really offer me anything that I haven't heard already from from King Crimson from Frank Zappa from Mahavishnu Orchestra from the soft machine from gentle giant Jethro Tull and many more it's just doing nothing for me between the lyrics Steven Wilson's voice nothing really sticks out to me is strong on this thing sorry well ladies and gentlemen you have a theory Anthony Fantan Oh outright rejecting refusing to review these albums because he thinks he has some kind of superiority complex issue where he thinks he is better too good to review this music but you know what I always say three hands in the bird is one when you push you've got to give as much music as you possibly can a chance because there's a lot of art out there that needs to be admired I hate you and you make me hate music - well this has been another episode of why you no review I am your host with the Ghost Cal true chesta thank you for being here with us Anthony Fantana over here we'll end these things like he usually does and hopefully next time you know Chi Chi Chi Chi Y you know review why 
KGLwTJ47stQ,
JknqyWg0Vrs,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review this artist name is Cueto the album is severence Cueto is the pseudonym for electronic music producer jamie Teasdale who I first heard of a couple years ago when I was looking up dubstep songs on the internet and I came across his insistent travels EP owned a vinyl copy of it too highly recommended three great tracks on that thing this dude is also one half of the dubstep duo vexed and they spent their last album yeah playing some dubstep but experimenting with ambient music - so now we have this new solo release from Jamie he's already released some EPS under this name one of which kind of takes the dubstep style and filters it through 8-bit sounds and you know I'm just kind of setting this up because I think it's funny that now the dubstep is kind of like this hot electronic music commodity um he's kind of taking a break from the style on this thing but in a good way but after listening to this thing again and again and again I kind of feel like Severin is is really limited definitely an intentional limitation and that's because Jamie has made a conscious decision to use these kinds of synth sounds and these kinds of drum sounds and execute them in this way instead of huge variations between tracks this album is more about taking a single idea and exploring every single nook and cranny of it but I have to talk about first what sticks out to me the most about this album is definitely the rhythms the drum machines they're really light tinny thin fast they've got this like rattling jittery quality to them that's commonly found in juke music or footwork music and it's like totally not uncommon for the snare drums or the high hats had a lot of points on this thing to just be going like rapid-fire like there are only a handful of songs on here like the intro reality drifts and salt lake cuts and a few kind of interlude tracks that ease up on the rhythms none of those tracks actually to me are the less exciting ones because without these rhythms in the background of these tracks I feel like this album loses a unique quality the drums on this thing are really dry they're clickety they're clackety and they shouldn't sound that way because they kind of sound like they're getting programmed on an old-school drum machine that old-school feel gets strengthened in the synthesizers on this LP because they totally sound like this instrumental soundtrack progressive synth music that would back up an old sci-fi movie you know something from the 70s something from the 80s there are newer artists who have championed this sound again and again and again like zombie or zombie members majore or steve moore and of course there's tons of older stuff like this to reference back to like jean-michel Jarre tangerine dream Vangelis of course that Blade Runner soundtrack you've basically got these really tense Juke and footwork rhythms working against these synthesizer sound scapes now this album synthesizer wise compositionally I just don't find as ripping I feel like a lot of the songs here are built on a really simple phrase or arpeggio and it's just repeated ad nauseam or it changes so subtly that it's hard to pick up and sometimes the sins just bleed over each other and layer over each other for a kind of hazy effect overall they just kind of end up being this side dish to the rhythms for me there are spots on here like truth flood which use this just really kind of tired chord progression that just doesn't really do anything for me and I just see myself ignoring it and just observing the rhythms instead some of these tracks to me just feel like they fall in the background they just feel unintrusive and and I guess that's the nature of the soundtrack style that that Jamie is embracing on this thing I get that maybe that is intentional on some level the reasons I like this thing is because I do like that combination these two ideas there are a handful of tracks on here where I think it's executed really really well and do kind of have a soft spot for these old-school synthesizer Odysseys they just feel so epic they feel so spacey to me they really put my head in a different place as a total package I think this thing is a little rough but artistically Janie really moved in an interesting direction on this one I'm feeling strong six to a light seven on this one definitely not one of my favorites of the year but if I didn't think there was an interesting idea going on here I wouldn't have reviewed it I would love for you guys to check this thing out let me know what you think love it hate it why and what should I review next yeah penny Fantana Cueto 
xZnmheQqgUs,hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest nerd and it's time for an album review that's ooh god bless you AB sue I think you're having some allergies there buddy ABS you is the band name and the album title here is actually at Zoo flesh yet and these guys are a Texas metal band this is actually the first I've ever heard of them but they've been around for 20 years now these guys have had a lot of lineup changes over the years and they went originally from playing this blend of black metal and death metal to this concoction of black metal and thrash metal but these guys are just way way way way more than those two labels they had a lot of eccentric traits previous albums from these guys have included bagpipes and banshee calls and acoustic interludes and synthesizers and classical and romantic melodies they're clearly a metal band that loves a lot more than metal and they like to show that off in their music and with this LP Abzu is coming together with one of its shortest albums yet since its first LP I mean sure the selfie is loud and it's fast and it's it's in my face but there's so much detail to be picked up so many changes around every corner this album isn't all that accessible either it's no slouch it is a feast to be wrestled to the ground because after kind of sitting with this thing and listening to it I feel like I've opened up this treasure chest of eye widening adrenaline pumping awesomeness now like I said for absolute this is a shorter record but also I think these guys have put together a faster record - these guys have had fast moments on previous albums but on here they stay consistently fast this thing is like Bad Brains fast this thing is like Terrorizer fast and it doesn't sound mechanical - these guys are just speeding and the grooves are still there I think these guys have come together with a more atmospheric record - this time around and the recording quality is better - I think in episodes discography an album like Tara is a clear standout but the drum sounds on this album are way better and I also think this album is Epps's most seamless blend of of black metal and thrash metal to date there are moments where this band is put together tracks in the past where it's just kind of been thrash metal song black metal vocals on top this time around it's mmm it's just such a tight Frankenstein Ian monsterous mutation this album has kind of a weird build it's got five three to five minute songs which all kind of come in kick ass and leave as soon as possible blitzkrieg style and then the very last track is this 14 minute monster which pretty much takes up half of the album's length the first track just kicks things off at top speed with a banshee call and some really mmm fast Wow and the speed and the force is just like exhilarating to me there are some bands that will go this fast but it just kind of feels tiring feels a little boring these guys actually get me and no musical ideas here really feel all that flat or boring because there's always kind of a change or a shift the second track circles of the oath where these speedy riffs and blast beats are broken up with these really melodic kind of interludes and to me that's not really these guys making their music easier friendlier to me it's kind of a little more challenging because they're throwing so many things at me all at once it's difficult to pick up on all of it I was actually put off by that at first the last track unfortunately is not one long-winded piece of progressive black metal glory some moments here and there connect on this thing but for the most part it kind of feels like a bunch of two to three minute tracks that all happen to be a part of the same 14 minute long song still some of the best moments on this album are lodged into this last track like the third and fourth movements have some of the best riffs on this entire album and the fifth movement on this thing is a great acoustic interlude and three with this synthesizer in the background that kind of sounds like a Mellotron as far as downsides to this album goes I think this thing could have easily used some more vocal variation I've heard these guys pull out a lot of different vocal styles on previous albums but for the most part they just stick to one on this LP and you know part of me does kind of wish the last track was a little more connected and I'm feeling a light too decent eight that's what I'm feeling what do you think do you like this thing do you hate it why and what should I review next anthony Fantana ab sue forever 
e9lo6CiLlU4,jerk hello everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd with my girlfriend by my side Dominique Boxley I know it took me a while to get this review of the new Bjork album Biophilia to you but now I'm making it happen Ben so I've been listening to the album you've been listening to the album part of the reason my girlfriend is here is because she is a longtime viewer fan she actually turned me on to viewer core I had known about Bjork but she kind of gave me here she gave me the Bjork starter kit right on his CD she just burned me okay look here the good Bjork songs I took like it's kind of like Noah's Ark I took two of every song every album and then from that I was able to pick out some of my favorites I really like post a lot I really like best 14 a lot and um so you know I was I was coming into this album kind of knowing what to expect but I'm sure you knew better than me just because you've been listening to her for much longer time than I did since I was in Middle School it was my first favorite oh yeah that's a nice time to get into pure bright little school great I have to say I was really distanced by all of the very scientific Lyrae you know really yeah yeah at first it was it it didn't I wasn't put off by it but I was definitely just distancing myself from it a little bit when I was listening and I have to say after Volta which is my least favorite Bjork album I was very skeptical of this one so going into it like I said I just I was I had a lot of space in between me and this album I felt I felt and I still feel to an extent pretty distant from it but it has nothing to do with the lyrics the lyrics actually were one of the things from the start that I liked like even on the track like virus where Bjork is singing about kind of like from the standpoint of being a virus like I know it kind of reeks of like bad of on art stage production I kind of like imagine Bjork in a weird cast I think that but on a major level I think that's really creative and I think that's really fun I think it's really imaginative and I love that track I love another track like and then the ninth track where she's singing about tectonic plates shifting in her chest yeah I don't show you that one because you know that song on you know at it's very core it is a relationship sign it's a relationship song yeah and what I liked about that song is the way that the music is arranged it's very kind of explosive like you get to this very yeah you know what I mean you will do great they're talking about when it does start explained she starts thinking about eruption right right and you sort of get that volcanic right woman the music itself is very atmospheric I'm thinking of Hollow right off the top of my head is hollow reminded me the Sun really weird it reminded me of Fantasia mm-hmm and I think I totally got really yes and and not in like this hokey you know Disney way where you imagine you're dancing brooms oh anything nothing like that but the fact that it was so lush you know anything you feel very encapsulated by the music well the reason you're getting that is because you do have that huge organ in the song we're just going but it kind of feels like incidental music right exactly you could see characters figures moving over it exactly I was gonna say that's it's doing saw ya doing something to the song yeah it's more like a score yeah and you know it's devoid of melody really the voice it really it doesn't really punch you with right obvious right thing exactly but I feel like a lot of the songs on on this album have elements of that in various places you know and I think there's something very interesting about doing that my favorite song on the on the album sacrifice and that's because it feels like you know what I was thinking initially when I first heard it it's kind of like what the thirteen-year-old me imagined 2011 Bjork would sound like that's exactly like that oh you know and so it's like you know it's kind of like pagan poetry Meets medulla I enjoyed that one so much because of you have all of this atmosphere but you do have the spotlight on the vocals yeah you know yeah that's that's the thing it's like um you know you were trying to how the lyrics and just sort of the subject matter was distancing you a little bit and honestly what distanced me from this album was I felt like the music because everything I take a track like crystalline for example where they have that like kind of plinking baggage feel kind of sound over and over and over and it just feels really incessant it just feels really directionless for me it doesn't do anything for me right to me it's like it's sort of a pretty sound if it's accompanying something but it's like not amazing as the main course and there are so many tracks that will rely on just one kind of simple sound whether it's a harp whether it's an electronic sound or an organ or something like that and it will just repeat that one phrase over and over I did really love the vocals though the vocals were really what made a lot of these tracks really palatable to me hi because Bjork not only does she have a great voice but she always has this really unique singing style I'm thinking of the fifth track and you know she sing like whoa but still cosmology was actually one of the tracks on the album or I loved the music in the background because you had the vocals you had the horns it just felt really like it felt like floating through space and not only that but it indulged me in those lyrics that I liked right from the get-go because she's kind of like singing this song about how the universe started right you know you know I I liked that one too because that one's got a lot like a lullaby to me like you feel like you're expelling you a story yes story well then I have to feel that way too about virus about right you know oh yeah and I have to say that once I started kind of getting back into and listening to it again revisiting it um I felt that way about most of the tracks that I felt like I was being you know sung to I have to say I did cheat because I I watched some of the the apps video of the apps yeah and I mean granted it was after I'd listened a few times yeah and I was just curious to see what these apps were doing in relation to these songs because you know they are appendage to we're talking about in case you didn't know this album is being marketed as an iPad app like it's an iPad album and just kind of is accompanied by all these visuals but the thing is you can go online and buy this thing as a CD you could buy this as a digital album by itself so I would imagine that even though maybe Bjork and her producers and the label had something kind of really ambitious visually in mind for this album in relation to the iPad it's I think they would somehow assume that it's it's it's got to be standalone in some way because we are selling it by itself or I I think it's more interactive yeah yeah no it's not just like a movie yeah and I think that's it I think that's an interesting element to it but I have to say I liked this concept of kind of having you know a story kind of like a storyteller the thing about the storytelling that makes a lot of these tracks good I don't feel is like consistently good throughout the whole album you know because the thing is their tracks like crystalline where I feel like there are parts where she mentions crystals growing like plants and there are other spots on tracks where she sings like my fingers growing out like courtesan ik you know and things like that and um you know in mentions of space and things like that but there's there I don't really grab a story you know I'm not grabbing the storytelling I'm just kind of getting these abstract connections between nature and music right that she's drawing for me but they don't come together in Jenna don't completely come together as it currently stands I'm really only in love with like a handful of tracks on this yeah and as much as I hate to say it I kind of agree I know we mentioned this about Hollow but for a majority of the album I really to kind of feel like I was just listening to something that would be kind of sound tracking a nature documentary you know and that really doesn't have you know anything just to do with the lyrics but just like you know the the very kind of uninsurance of nature of some of the sounds on this album you know it's very kind of either soft or it's either very repetitive to the point where it kind of becomes background noise you know and you're not really concentrating on on it that much because it's not doing all that much and that really kind of left me hanging I mean you know though a track like Hollow is very bold in that it's just really rebellious against being accessible that doesn't mean it really kind of sticks out to me or makes me want to listen to it again yeah I don't know I can certainly agree with that and I mean I don't know if that's intended and if it's intended I don't really get it if it wasn't like it was intended then it would have to be so because of the visuals you know it's like yeah I mean well yeah I guess and that's where it doesn't work as a standalone room and not sons I mean because and I can't help but feel like you know maybe on some level the the fact that I knew that this was an iPad album it's kind of poisoned me because like I think you're poisoned everyone but because I mean and even you know like in saying I'm a huge fan and I have all of her albums and I was tempted to go and look at the apps to see the apps we're gonna tell me you know and and I think I think it's a really big distraction more than anything you go into a kind of assuming it's gonna be somewhat of a soundtrack right and you listen to a soundtrack differently than you do that's true you know us yeah any old album I don't know I guess I was hoping for this to make a stronger statement mm-hmm you know this was even an album where I was sitting here and just thinking is this like too deep for me it's like I was sitting here thinking that about myself as I was listening to this album whereas usually I'm rolling my eyes that other people were like oh York she just tries to be weird you know ORS like uh you know I don't feel that way and even about this album I can't feel that way entirely but definitely at first I was sort of you know questioning yeah you know I felt similarly like I said I was very I had a lot of distance between myself in this album for a lot of reasons but that's that is one it's like you know is this like fo RT right now you know to me like this I kind of it kind of smelled like that in the beginning yeah in the beginning but now that but now that I'm into it you know it's like uh I I enjoy the themes I enjoy a good handful of the tracks and you know for the most part that there isn't really any song on here I hate it you know just like really do not like except Hollow I really didn't care for Hollow but the rest of the tracks if they weren't blowing me away they were just you know okay we're feeling relatively neutral on the album yeah overall yeah I mean I figure her being a bigger Bjork fan than me would maybe have more love for it than I did but I'm surprised that we came out right right so well I I tampered down my fandom yeah to look at this a bit funny after this review is over will your fandom be maybe bubbling back up maybe you're watching sweet sweet so yeah that's that's pretty much our takes on the album I'm just gonna leave it at that Anthony Fantan oh hey Dominique forever [Music] 
fU1YnAn4lWY,hi everyone 1.1 anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for an album review civil civic rules these guys are an electronic rock duo that I've been dying to hear a full length album from ever since they dropped their first single back in 2009 I believe less unless now why are these guys electronic rock to me well they have a lot of rock elements in their music just really hard driving distorted guitar and bass riffs everywhere plenty of melodic guitar leads and a lot of the time the distortion on some of these tracks just gets so massive just turns into this wall of and all these really shoegazing guitar leads are all swimming through it like little baby fish but there's also an element of electronic music here as well there's a lot of hard-hitting drum machines on these songs a lot of glitchy kind of noisiness is one idea kind of transitions into another not to mention all the synthesizers that civil civic have managed to add to this album and of course every track on this LP is instrumental over all these guys for me are just kind of like part man part machine and civil civics music a lot like the music of Ratatat or automata gucci is very much about momentum it's very much about Drive it's very much about melody melody and melody that's what I've loved about everything the band has put out up until the release of this album but the thing is a lot of the tracks that civil civic put out before this LP came out are on this album I was kind of hoping for an entire LP of completely new material but still I don't blame these guys for wanting to get tracks like less unless on vinyl like life I think putting material on here that is a year to two years old is a bit of a gamble because tracks like less unless have had time with me to grow on me to establish themselves with me to kind of just seep into my brain and become a part of my my musical memory so after seeing these guys put older much older material on this album I was kind of looking to the newer tracks on this LP to kind of show me a different side of civil civic just something newer just new directions just fresher ideas I just want to see where this band is is gonna go next but I didn't kind of come up from this LP finding a lot of new ideas but that's not to say I didn't find any one of my favorite tracks on here great nurse starts off with these really kind of uplifting synthesizer arpeggios and then segues into this guitar we this guitar melody that sounds a lot like it would have come from a halloween-themed spaghetti-western with a little bit of a surf rock twang going on there it's one of the most interesting ten-car pileup so the influences i've heard on a track this year and on the track may feel simple Civic experiments with doing a softer song just being much more subtle and I think it kind of works for them but the bp+ the reverb guitars on that track just like sparkle like stars in the sky and war like thunder now songs like Street trap and it's krill have really just driving drumbeats repetitive riffs melodic leads and they really don't bring anything new to the table for me really they just end up kind of paling in comparison to the more established civil civic tracks on this LP that they share the same qualities even the song sky delay I like this song a lot but the very beginning of the track it kind of sounds like a slowed down version of run over time the only thing that kind of keeps that song and my really good side is that it starts in a very different place than where it finishes because civil civic brings that track and a really heavy sigh delek direction more psychedelic than they've ever been and and and there is an album that I just reviewed that this kind of reminds me of that new rusty album glass swords and the reason I feel like these two albums share some characteristics to me is that both rusty and civil civic have very bold defined and to me kind of unforgettable styles but both of those styles at this point right now are both a little kind of narrow you know they're they're this kind of one set thing and neither artist really ventures too far outside of that thing because of that a lot of tracks on this LP sound kind of similar in a way that makes a handful of songs on here less attention-grabbing still I think this thing is a pretty good debut album I'm feeling a decent too strong seven on this album what do you guys think of it does you love it does you hate it why and what do you think I should review next thanks for watching Anthony Fantana civil cynic you
