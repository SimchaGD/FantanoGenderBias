TcMeRrIJe1M,hi everyone city boy tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a new various artists review of Black Panther the album music from and inspired by this record over here is a Top Dawg entertainment curated and crafted set of songs a soundtrack of sorts for the new Black Panther film which has been getting rave reviews from fans and critics alike quickly being regarded as one of the better Marvel films out there and the soundtrack has been turning heads in the music industry because of the top dawg entertainment connection because artists like Kendrick Lamar are all over this thing dropping a ton of new original verses and songs so of course people are going to be hype for this thing as was I but mostly for the movie itself because some of the teaser tracks to this thing I thought just kind of sounded like a simplified overblown version of the thoughtful cutting-edge pop rap that I've enjoyed thus far from the TDE camp especially on like all the stars which is is not a terrible track but the only moments I really am wowed by on this track are Scissors contributions like her singing on that hook especially when the beat drops in it's just such a it's such a perfect combo it's gorgeous it's beautiful it's epic it's exciting but vocally and lyrically on this track it does kind of feel like Kendrick is phoning it in just a little bit like he's just kind of here on this album for the check or something I mean it does sound better than a lot of low-grade soundcloud rap you can find out there and I get that he's consciously trying to keep it simple because at the end of the day these are just supposed to be big grand catchy straightforward songs for a blockbuster comic book movie it's it's not to pimp a butterfly which is smart on Top Dawg entertainment sparked to essentially Taylor the creativity to the job that it is supposed to accomplish but I feel like that hinders this album's likeability as a standalone piece because for the most part this album is about repetitive phrasing and slick flows and bangin instrumentals that occasionally have a kind of dark progressive edge like on the opening track which features all these sad elegant pianos vocally I feel like this is one of Kendricks better performances on the record and lyrically I think he says a lot about being a king being a hero being a standalone figure while also deeply tying into the movie itself I also love be heavy drums on this track and the Warped thumb pianos that introduce themselves in the second half one of the handful of moments on this album that come off legitimately trippy and experimental and the beat on the track ops with young and black rock and Vince staples is insane these rumbling driving beats some freaky effects and vocal overdubs on this track - it's easily one of the weirdest things on the entire record even if I do find some of the refrains on here you're dead to me - be a little obnoxious there are a few tracks on here that seem to meld elements of contemporary R&B and trapped like I am featuring Georgia Smith whose vocal performance here seems like it's got a lot of emotional weight to it but I find her voice to be kind of nondescript also the track the ways featuring Khaled and sway Lee of Rae sremmurd which is a kind of dreamy bouncy intoxicating ballad very relaxing but also kind of sleep inducing really of all the newer names and faces here in the features list the one that really stood out to me had to be paramedic the SOB RBE track these kids are from the Bay Area they had an album last year that was kind of a mess it was a compilation of singles that had dropped throughout the year it seemed like and they have so much energy and personality on this track they're just wild there's like this weird muddy chime or Casio keyboards have all that place throughout the track and the song brings this groove that only a group from from this area in the West Coast could bring truck knocking beat great chorus from Kendrick but it is one of the tracks on the album that I sit here thinking like what what is what does this really have to do with the movie I mean it's good it's fun it's catchy but but is this connected to the to the Black Panther universe my favorite banger on this thing has to be the song X though with schoolboy q schoolboys verse on there's awesome love the funny humble reference that he makes in his verse I also like be very minimal but groovy bloody waters with absol that one line he drops in there about a warfare and then asks is warfare love that that's so good the only TDE member that kind of underwear me on this thing had to be j-roc I mean his verse to me felt a little vapid a little loaded with filler like I know he can write more lines I know he can write better than this this is ready that is ready this is ready that is ready I gotta go get it I gotta go get it I gotta go get it I gotta go get it and the more I listen to it the more I felt like the future feature on this track like at first it was interesting but now I just feel like it's trash like his awkward singing on the track and that ugly hideous raspy falsetto again when I first heard the track I thought it was kind of unique I thought it was a good change of pace for him but as I kind of repeated it again and again and again it just felt like future challenging the idea of men like how little can I do and still get paid on the song redemptions akari's vocals are as much of a turn-off for me as they were on love from Kendricks last album but it is one of several tracks on here that spotlights in a really big way some great African talent which actually does bring this project quite a bit of personality and a certain uniqueness that no other TDE project has there are musical influences coming from the same place popping up all over the record as well and I would say overall for a project that has so many features and guests artists on it it does not really sound like a mess at all even when I don't like a particular track it is structured pretty well at the very least most of the people that appear on this record bring a great performance and have their own unique I guess sort of spot on the album that that it seems like only they shine I especially love the surprise appearances on here from Anderson PAC and James Blake honestly I was more let down by some of the core voices on this record mainly Kendrick Lamar because on here I feel like once again he is kind of lyrically underperforming and occasionally trailing off into these faux deep conceptual detours like in the last moments of King's dead still though this album is mostly enjoyable it's not that bad it's just kind of a loose collection of tracks that are a little hit or miss they just happen to all be tied together by a big blockbuster film the best things that this project probably has going for it the production and the features many which are very interesting very exciting some of which give very compelling performances introspective ones even like on the song seasons and I'll leave it at that I'm feeling a light too decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling like you're full of thoughts over here next to my head is a nother review you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana forever 
ZrtQrGLNJwU,"[Music] hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the most inconsistent podcasts on the BND podcasts on you remember when the last episode of this came out and this is gonna be a very special episode as we are seeing or rather hearing the return of my lovely wife Dominique on this podcast hey how you doing I'm good I need to move this microphone just a little bit closer okay okay that should be good I think that's good all right I'm gonna be watching the levels all right they're going crazy I'll try not to show so we're coming back with 20 songs 20 love songs themed around Valentine's Day I know it's been a while since you guys have heard from Dominique where our relationship has kind of gone under the radar since the needle drop has blown up yeah well according to you guys we've been broken up for several yes we've been broken up we've been divorced we have all sorts of stuff yeah we broke up and and you turn into a into it into it men's rights activist they're quite a good few reddit theories but we've just been relationship wise just kind of under the radar because our privacy is important but you know my online show is about my opinions on music it's not how my marriage although if you guys can can pony up the YouTube revenue maybe I can convince Dominique into yeah I mean I suppose you guys can guarantee $40,000 of YouTube revenue every month we will vlog every day okay that's that maybe push an entire life plastered all over the Internet and you know what's gonna be funny is we're not even gonna put any effort into it it's literally gonna be just us sitting around the house yeah you guys asked for it it's not gonna be like it's like I'd be like other vlog channels on YouTube okay we're going to the mall today doing thing we're gonna be doing things like hey guys vlog 153 we're trying to catch up on love after lockup it's our favorite show right now it's the worst thing on television did you bring my dryer shoes yeah it's what's what's on the grocery list what do you what do you what do you need what can I cook you what do you want to eat no that's literally response we're obviously still together because nobody else will have us so so there yeah so so we've decided to return because one of our first videos together on the channel was in 2011 it was our 10 Valentine's Day songs so we decided to double it for free totally for free we doubled that number at no cost to you and Dominique has made the suggestion that we do this you know but it's been a while since she's been in a video or on a video or having anything to do with the needle drop you know typically I over the years even though we've made this agreement to kind of hang back and sort of keep things off-camera you know I drop hints here and there like hey this band that you like I'm gonna review it maybe you want to say something you know but it typically ends up just kind of like falling to the wayside or on the backburner or whatever but this time she made the suggestion and and I said okay you know would it be at a video and she said I don't know about that and then I said okay well what about a podcast then so that's kind of been our our our compromise here so now we're doing this podcast we picked out 10 tracks we're gonna go over every single one of them why we picked them and I'm gonna kick it off right now which let's just get straight into it I'm gonna kick it off with Kevin abstract with the song empty to me any mo alright so that was Kevin abstract why I picked that song essentially you know that over the past few months or I guess the past year I've become a big fan of this rap group named Brock Hampton and I've been talking about them and I went to go see a show with them recently yes I'm aware here well the number one Brockhampton see but before Brock Hampton one of the members of the group flagship member Kevin abstract had this solo record titled American boyfriend it's a bit of an autobiographical record where he's talking about being in love with this dude who's on the football team this is the opening track of the whole thing so it's kind of like this big gigantic show of emotion this big theme to kind of state his intentions and his emotions for this person and you know just like him reflecting on their relationship and the reason I picked this track even though I guess that scenario doesn't really apply to us directly is I guess I just like the elements of young love and tension in the track I kind of like the way that Kevin lyrically kind of plays with these themes of having to be home needing to go back home sort of being torn away from his significant other via his home life whether that be because he can't be with this person all the time or he has obligations or whether it be because you know they're elements of kind of dealing with his queerness on the album and coming out of the closet and sort of you know bringing that to the attention of his parents and everything you know having to sort of come out of the closet and you know sort of acceptance of same-sex relationships sort of at the age that he's at and everything so there's like all sorts of life pressures extraneous pressures sort of coming in on this relationship and you know to me and in some ways that kind of reminded me of when we first started dating and just thinking how you know we wanted to be together we wanted to be at this place where we were just like inseparable and just together all the time and sort of dependent on one another but there were all sorts of things preventing us at the time very early in our relationship from like taking those next steps yeah I know that that's really true and actually as you were kind of providing more context to the song I was just kind of thinking about exactly that and kind of you know when we first started dating and you know I dealt with some you know family health problems that you know it was a really big deal and it was a it was a really big deal for me and so starting a relationship with it just kind of everything else falling apart there was yeah health problems and money problems and family problems then after all of that was out of the door there were just the problems of trying to find a place to live which like with a dog yes with a dog like we had some real horror stories like about some of the apartments that we looked at with within our budget like there was one place that we looked at that on honest to god they had no heat because the heat was the oven was yes it was the stove and and keep in mind illegal which is illegal now but that's how like houses used to be set up like back in the day like back before civil rights like I'm pretty sure that's how far back we're talking here bootleggers we talked to our parents about it and they said no that's like how some some apartments used to be like really that the oven was an older oven and it was a great on the side of it yeah you remember yeah you know just open up the stove and then turn it on it's not like that it was a dual functionality yeah there was like there's like at like almost like a heater on the side of the oven that would heat when you turned it on and that was the only source of heat in the apartment in New England so it was like the last place on earth where you would want such a thing to be your heat source you know we saw other apartments that were like just like in horrible disrepair it was like one place that had super high ceilings and I remember like the only cabinets I think in the kitchen like we're just like way above my head they were clearly just installed [Laughter] something out of like timber and it was just like a really bizarre proportion it was like a fun house yeah but yeah like we're laughing about it no but at the time we fought a lot about it it was awful because you know you're trying to find someplace where like you know number one like I just started a job Anthony was you know it's trying to get trying yeah trying to get the needle drop off the ground and so like we needed space but we didn't have the money for the type of space that we needed so then that meant we need it to be looking at older places and the older places were scary and yeah or they wouldn't take dogs or anyone take dogs but mostly it was because they were scary we've got a lot of way a lot of scary scary houses yeah we didn't like that one place that we saw where it was like it was like half built like they were showing it's like one like unit and in the house it was a house and but the rest of the house was just dilapidated pretty much so it was scary yeah we were having you're having a tough time but that that's I guess that's our little detour into into I guess some of the CDs songs already bringing up some raw emotions yeah I know let's get into the next track one that you picked because we're gonna alternate back and forth between each of our picks throughout this throughout this podcast you picked a Lianne La Havas song say a little prayer a live rendition of that track let's play a little bit of it and then you can talk about why you you picked this song for the okay [Music] so there's a little bit of that Lianne La Havas track and can you tell me why you picked that song for this episode what about that song made you think about this podcast and us and um well I guess a little history I love Burt Bacharach I love kind of like a bit I mean the kitchen Asst of of his arrangements um and so I actually have always loved this song especially the Dionne Warwick version most famously but I've heard every probably every cover and you know try to actively listen to covers and interpretations of the song I mean there's a couple of other songs like that that I just I love the song so much that I want to hear everybody's version of it but what I love so much about this the way that she covered the song is how she slowed it down and just you know I think like it gave me an opportunity to kind of hear the song in a different way I think maybe being older and being in a relationship now that's knocking on 10 years now we're pushing 10 years yeah oh god that's for real life that's for real life but yeah but it's just like like to me the song her arrangement of the song it's like like love that kind of like envelops every part of your day even when you're not thinking about it right like when you're not focusing on oh it's Valentine's Day I need to show this person that I love them I wake up loving you and I go to bed loving you kiss but yeah I hear you this is um this is uh you know it's like a quiet assurance you know it's not quite as showy is like probably the original version or anything it's a lot more stripped back to its sort of most bare essentials yeah of everything and it just kind of seems like the tone of the track just seems a lot like just like a conversation as opposed to like I guess an event or something something like meant for the for everybody else to see you know when really you're just like trying to show it to one person exactly yeah it's there's an intimacy in this version that I think is really beautiful and yeah it just made me it made me think about you know kind of like what you were saying earlier about how you know in the beginning like you're trying to like you know everything will be great and awesome as soon as we move in together and we see each other all the time and then that has its challenges too and then it's like oh my god we see each other all the time yeah at the beginning there's definitely a beach boys wouldn't it be nice kind of I yeah exactly exactly and so I neither of us picked that song no we do that we're too old for that song now exactly but but exactly we're too old for that so I mean and definitely I think you know what I like about this song is because it is kind of like for me that next phase of just the you know just being super secure in your relationship and in your love and and just you know just the feeling that even when things are bad things are still pretty good it's funny you just like the first song that I picked to me like reference to very early partner yes and this part that this song that you just picked sort of reference is a very sort of later part kind of a late of later scent and I have songs that I picked that kind of feel that way to me too yeah however I feel like this next song that I picked also kind of brings things back to the start a little bit YAG a point in our relationship when I guess that was just like a lot of excitement a lot of what-ifs and and I'm talking like literally like the day we met yeah the way that this song sort of tangles with that is it's literally about sort of meeting someone who you've talked to online so which like back in the day when we met online there were no songs about that yeah so literally the world is catching up to us I know it's right well it's catching up to us right now so finally today I covered this stuff all the time like every year I least hear a handful of songs that are like whoa this is like such an internet love song because you literally have somebody referencing I met this person online you know we're meeting in person he's he or she is messaging me and like back in the day that was not the thing you know like it was not like as standard no it is popular as it is today and maybe I'm projecting but I always like I've always kind of interpreted Bjork's hidden places in that way you know what I mean and I know I'm probably 100% projecting but that that is kind of a technologic romance if somebody was gonna write such a song I probably would be her yeah from the future like her like Imogen Heap or something yeah probably one of those two like would probably write a love song from the future yeah but but yeah this is this one's also from ours that you're familiar with Karen J Kalinin but this is from his new album which sounds vastly different from the record that you're familiar with which I came home from a tour in Australia with that album and they both like loved it yeah when we heard it we were just like well this guy's great and I was just like I'm set with myself that I didn't review at the year it came yeah yeah but his new record is just so vastly different stylistically and I've heard bits and pieces I did not listen to it and its entirety so to me this is one of the one of my favorite tracks on the record one of the tracks that like I said hit me as being like whoa this is just like you know the feelings and the sort of situations that that I had when we were first meeting and I think he'll sort of catch that the sort of tone and the music and the lyrics of the track definitely speak to probably the tension that one is feeling when they're like okay you know we've made this agreement that we're going to meet in person but there's also kind of that weird feeling of just like you know it's it's odd you know it's weird because in a way you feel like you know this person a little bit because maybe you've been talking about things mutually for a little bit and but but then still there's kind of like that Oh what if I what if I am worse in person than I am like yeah that's funny that you say that because I think for me I think I I kind of had like a completely different perspective on I'm meeting someone person because it for me it was just such a like what's the worst that could happen like you know what do you mean like granted there are awful things like could happen but I wasn't going there but it was just kind of like this could be fun or it might not be fun and like I I guess like I kind of went into things with not having a ton of expectations especially since you stood me up that was a mistake that was a mistake that was not standing you up that was just a miscommunication schedule a lot like being stood up I told you I had work I just forgot to tell you when I would get out of work that's that's that's oh yeah I was it's like eleven o'clock I could I was like yeah like this and then I called her when I got out of work at like maybe 11:30 I'm like okay I'm at work I'm out I'm like good for you so but still though probably given that that's it you probably given that situation there was like a bit of nervous excitement yeah the whole thing yeah which is in this track and is turn up to 11 the point where it's just like in insane it's like this track is called down to hang [Music] his lyrics are hilarious and and that's also a James chance of James chance and the contortions playing sax on that track so it's like a little bit of like an O wave throwback over there I feel like I don't have much to say about the song now because I've already sort of spoiled my already reverse their version it is really funny to kind of like as I was listening to it I was like oh is that how boys feel because I think it definitely is I think it definitely is it was definitely like a weird sort of like about to pop kindness yeah excitement yeah yeah yeah especially when you've kind of like I don't know like already pre gamed in a way by talking to the person so right you know and like it built up like expectations you know yeah yeah like where's like if you just met somebody casually sort of like in outside settings somewhere where you expect people to meet then it's like none of none of this is there right right no no no no that's true it's true yeah that's kind of amazing I have to revisit in its entirety and and I guess I guess you talk about the the the he's talking about the hanging quite a bit and he does get graphic with the noose you know - yeah loosing himself but also it's like you know there's probably like a bit of a serial killer vibe there - a little bit yeah actually a lot but I think but it is funny it is kind of like you know like you said just kind of like a build up of expectations and you know even for my part even though I play it cool you know I was nervous too but I guess more from a standpoint of man like we've been having such a good play good time like chatting about like music and stop and if this sucks like you're really awkward alright we're going to get into the next track that you pick we're gonna play a little bit of it and then you can get into why you picked it this is a short bit of diamond arrow Cena's Valentine that's really good right I turned her on this artist sort of in an inadvertent fashion because I got a promo for one of her older CDs and I thought it was pretty decent I thought that she would like it more than me so I just passed it to her because you know knowing what she enjoys I was just like hey I think you'll probably enjoy this more than I am and she's telling you that this came from a later record no this came after yes good nap yeah yes yeah I didn't meant later I meant like I mean like older oh yeah listen to that yeah we go you do it's actually really really good and I love her voice her voice is really good her voice is literally like melted chocolate it's it is so like deep and earthy and sensual she has an amazing voice so needless to say after that promo and there were some standout tracks on that yeah you know I felt like with that promo there was just like a weird kind of thing going on with the instrumentation and some of the vocal layering where it just felt like there was something kind of missing or something's being lost translation just a little overwrought but this is just is so much more intimate and it's like the instrumentation in the background it's simple but it just works and it showcases her voice so much better and it's so lovely it's just it's a beautiful song and I so I picked this because when I was listening through this album it because as soon as I got Apple music I had like this mental list of like all of these albums I want it to like yeah like revisit or whatever look into and I remember the first time I heard this it reminded me so much of the very first time you and I went on vacation together and we had like a little road trip we went to Hershey Pennsylvania it was just like this really like first of all I had to kinda fight tooth and nail to get yet they need to take a break to go on vacation horrible it taking a break he does not ever take a break you got so it's funny that you're that you're confirming that because there are people who watch from the outside look then they're like do you sleep yeah no he doesn't and yes he has a whole family wife like he's got stuff and yes that all happened simultaneous to his work schedule so anyways so you know so this was like really the first time like you know we had this extended amount of time together where nobody was working it was just really idyllic and you know I like specifically this reminded me of the drive there I think we were listening to Vampire Weekend like we really think the Vampire Weekend out I think I might have been really into that yeah you were really into it I was really into it contra but it was awesome and it was are you saying that that was the horrible thing about the trip nothing he kept playing Vampire Weekend but it was awesome anyway no actually I I did actually really liked that album a night but no what I'm seeing is that it was just such an idyllic like trip it was like super sunny and you know out of farmland yeah we're going to rollercoasters exactly exactly so it was just you know like new you know fairly love and just kind of the carefreeness that you and I rarely get to indulge in because we're both crazy busy so so yeah so that is the vibrance of the song energy cute yeah it's really cute it's just yeah it just made me think of our first really carefree carefree moment no but yeah that's just like you know it's everything that you want and like just kind of a sweet light-hearted kind of love song you know there's nothing like too complicated about the emotions or anything like that it's just I like you I like you I like you I like you I like you I like you I thank you like you know it's just that's just kind of the vibe of it it's just really pretty it's really sweet and you might you made me want to check out that follow your album if so if a lot of it is kind of a bad vibe oh my goodness actually just as a note as I was like cuz when I picked all my songs I wanted to make sure that they were linkable because I'm you know some of the songs like they just came from my memory and I have no idea if there is you know an actual URL linking or linking you to them so anyway so when I was you know just kind of going through my list and just checking again she was she has a cover of Besame Mucho which is just fantastic like that's I don't think it's recorded like I don't think she has a studio recording of that but I highly highly recommend anybody YouTube it you YouTube it you will not be disappointed it's beautiful alright I'm gonna get into the next track over here who is another artist that you've been hearing me sort of play again and again and again throughout the year Alex Cameron this song is titled run out of luck we're laughing because we've we've had many conversations about just how much of like a weird Creepo Alex Cameron is when you just looked simply at his lyrics you know I don't know the man personally but you know I've showed this record to dominique a few times there's been like this is great I love this but these are the man's lyrics you know this sings about but but I promise you this this is not one of his weird or creepier songs okay okay this is this is one not too heavy on the creeper wave although I'm not gonna say it's wholesome no I'm not gonna say it's whole that's right you know me you know I start to be I know you I know you alright well give it a listen listen to the lyrics and hopefully I'm not horrified and I swear you won't be horrify there's there's kind of like a it might it might seem a little weird at first but I swear I have a nice explanation for why I sort of had some feelings about us and [Music] where [Music] all right on one to ten where does that right on the Creepo scale I love it - it's all my favorite stars last year so no I mean the this to me was a track that reminded me of just every everywhere we've been everywhere we've gone to sort of get to this point because you know there's just like if you've been in a relationship that is pushing ten years you know you do have your doubts and you do have your moments where you feel like you're out of love or you feel like you know it's slipping but then when you get back to that moment where you're like back and it you know it's like it feels like really good and it feels really great but still it's like you can't totally ignore the past and you know that there's like you know those doubts in your head and you have those you learn over time like what volatile personalities you are and you know like your triggers and you learn and it's like you know you you are like you know either you know you in some ways you are like a stripper or you are like a hothead who will like totally just punch somebody out and which is like totally a danger to your relationship and but you know still it's like at the end of the day there's just like something that ends up working or functioning about it and it's just like yeah I like the feel of like being kind of renegades together the way you know just like you know I just kind of like that story that vibe with the track but yeah I love that song you know it's it's you you have your moments where it's it's you fighting it's tough emotionally and you have your disagreements and you know you're you're essentially unhappy in a way but then once you get back to that point where you remember like why you're why you're in it you know because really if it's working and you love each other those those tough and those rough moments are going to be temporary and those flaws about you that are probably never going anywhere and never gonna change it's like you just kind of end up like seeing past them anyway and you know he makes reference on the track to even though there are these doubts and he says like you know the odds are stacked against us but simultaneously like she's assuring him like you know we're gonna be together it's okay you know it's so that's that's kind of what house yeah kind of felt to me sometimes when they're when they're rough when they're volatile it's like you know it's kind of like being it's kind of like living on the edge right as two people are you know there's kind of like a I don't know it's it's tough and it's upsetting but simultaneously there's like a weird excitement to sort of being brought to that point where it feels like it's gonna be over but then when you get back to that point where you do sort of love each other you know you're back in when you know you win exactly you got the jackpot we went to Vegas once and we were we were all over this one slot machine that we won $300 out of we're the worst people to go to babe I think we actually won more money than that out of it but then we just won a bunch of money out of it but then we spent like maybe in a half an hour to an hour out of that losing more than half the money that we want out of it I think yeah pretty much but you know we were also spending a great great deal of the time just people watching because that was much more interesting than gambling so you know that we didn't really enjoy all of the because we're much more interested in hanging out in the casino I had a hard time finding anything to eat it was like the worst yeah that was really tough I remember we uh we stepped into a single room that was a high stakes slot machine thing and she put us like you're just like hey let's like we were just like hey let's just try this just to try it let's just like you know because you're on just like penny and dollar slots instead listen let's just let's just go in here and try it like she put it in there and then all of a sudden like the machine literally did nothing and they were just like okay yes that's I guess this is telling you you lost so so yes I did pick that track I love that track I'm glad you loved that track I swear to you the the there's only a handful of moments on the album that are so creepy you know there's actually like a lot of great records on those are the ones I was most excited about you know I was like hey look at how creepy this song is well let's get into your next track pick this yes track we're gonna play a little bit of it it's titled sweetness and once we played a bit of it will come back to dominate we'll talk about her thoughts behind the track [Music] all right so so this song is a bit of relationship nostalgia but I don't even think you remember when so early in our relationship one of the things that we did a lot of was you know we would kind of show each other things that we were like super passionate about like obviously Anthony I'm super passionate about music so he liked when we would go out and just be hanging out like you know he'd be showing me like music we'd have like a night where we're just listening to music or we have a night where I was you know bringing over like movies that I liked and whatever and I'd kind of share like all my weird movie teeth my weird my weirdest movies with him and if he didn't get freaked out then you know I could push it to the next level and kind of the same thing was happening with music and so it was just like this really fun time like in the beginning of our relationship where we were just sharing you know things that you know we liked and the night that we filmed the Valentine's Day video we had watched Buffalo 66 exactly on the soundtrack so you know and for those of you who have not seen it it is uh I guess I'm unlikely love story between two misfits the the odds are stacked against them more than they are in the Alex Cameron song yeah no kidding but yeah so yes this song is really just kind of adding I mean it's a I mean probably most people know yes yeah you know so this song is really just a bit of relationship nostalgia fruit just that time where we were just learning about each other and getting to you know getting to know each other's interests and you know kind of taking off you know whatever mask that you have when you first meet somebody and you're like checking out to be too weird you scare them off you're making you regret not putting that future Sun on your mask off I've been a great relationships Hey there's there's still time there's still time pack it in this next track is it is funny I feel like it just just like that song that you just picked I feel like I'm picking this track because I I know certain things about you and certain tastes and preferences and stuff so I feel like that you would appreciate the sort of the the theme and the concept of this song which I think after it's over because we're not gonna play the entire track I'll definitely have to explain some of it because even to me at first like what the song was wasn't entirely apparent because Neil's lyrics can be a difficult read or listen to sort of take everything and by the way this is a from a band named lemon demon the song has held no ID girl and lemon demon is a band fronted by are sort of masterminded by Neil C serega who does all those amazing mashups that yeah yes that I love that I force upon to you I'm like then honey listen to this meme I love a little bit laughs I'm just like I'm so excited about his mashups and it's funny that's the the lack of enthusiasm that I get recommending them to my audience I also get at home recommending with my wife and and even to Austin as well like he's just like the people don't get why you're into this dude they really they really don't and you know it doesn't matter I love it however this is a you know an entirely different type of music project I swear no like Smash Mouth or bare naked Lee he sings are gonna pop up here I swear it was a slasher out sample shows up on this list we're done I can't even think of a good Smash Mouth song so and I you said I would at least in one of their albums but let's let's get into this track again it's called no ID girl okay so my thoughts behind picking this track from what I've been able to gather listening to the song again and again and reading the lyrics online he falls in love with an interdimensional being and from what I see at the very end you're already under the SyFy you're already into the sci-fi element of it and and toward the end of the track I kind of get the feeling that he is obviously responsible for the transfer of either that being to this dimension or this there himself to that dimension or kind of opening up something that would allow these beings to come into this world and toward the end of the track I kind of get the idea that him doing this as a result of that is that the world is just destroyed and that everything is just like you know mankind is just totally dead but he doesn't regret it because he gets sort of what he wants he gets the relationship or whatever so he'd do it again he'd do it again anyway even though it basically means the end of the world I figure you'd appreciate the sci-fi elements of that I do giving your sci-fi kick but yeah that's that's essentially my reason behind picking that track obviously with our situation the stakes are not as high the situation is not as dire I mean you wouldn't destroy the world for me to invite you in here like like possibly you know I guess it's I would definitely like I definitely had about it it's like we're not talking about like I wouldn't run out with a gun and like start like killing a bunch of people like I think we're an interdimensional being yeah when I pull you into this into this dimension to destroy the whole world I don't know it kind of sounds just as psychotic as running out there with a gun I kind of feel like you have to look at both of them the same way you know it's just you're not exactly pulling a trigger you're just opening a dimension you know so I feel like post should be looked upon with just as much skepticism and like hmm that's kind of so I mean so I'm not gonna answer that right now just so that there's not a whole lot of drama I'll give you my answer yes off that one when when we're off the podcast okay okay I've already said it though so this next track that we've picked sensitivity from Ralph Tresvant we're gonna play a little bit of that and then we'll go into your your logic behind picking this traffic for the list [Music] I regret that we didn't do an entire podcast just based around this genre oh my god R&B and sort of like pop soul and stuff that'd be awesome next next Valentine next time I remember when we were kids I missed that they used every decisions that would play that yeah all day oh my gosh yeah morning till night I still live for them [Laughter] such unique time for music yeah and really weird at the end of that song there's like a rap mmm of course because all songs have to have a rap yeah yeah hey I'm really sensitive it had to be like that yeah definitely like a bit of an MC Hammer type flow yeah I love this song yeah it's cute yeah it's smooth that's fine um I feel like I was probably like one of the youngest and my family and so like all of my cousins everybody was super older than me and like you know if you're talking about radio stations that just play this type of music all the time like when this was new this was all over the radio so this song came out when I was five and I remember like just I was the kid that like knew all of the songs on the radio and like all of the dances so like I was the one that day would be like Oh tell me do this dance tonight what I would just be like alman it up so anyways anyways so it has been ingrained in me that I need a man with sensitivity got it since a very brainwashed but I picked this song for this particular list because as you were saying before you know you are you know starting a new relationship like you're coming into the relationship with like your own you know if like I said everybody has like baggage and and stuff that you're bringing into the relationship separately and your expectations for what your relationship is going to be and I think despite having a man with sensitivity being and grained in me I see I I think like I felt like I don't know I I just wanted to not have those types of expectations for our relationship and just see where things went what I guess what I what I was trying to say is is that um you know you are you are all of those things without being a very smooth smooth talking first that I don't know what the hell is I say thanks for having me is not being sorry smooth I think I'm smooth I talk to smooth all the time on the internet you talk to me but what I'm seeing is like you're not like a flashy person like you know what do you mean like you're not there's no being like the sensitive guy that's like that's also kind of Lee being like the nice guy yeah hey why won't Girl's Day me I'm a nice guy I'm really not buying anybody who comes up to you you've heard me this is all the women out there advice advice for my wife talking about I'm a nice guy like you aren't I really nice nice guys finish last no crazy people finish last because everybody knows that they're fucking crazy I've never told my wife I'm nice no he didn't I've never told her I'm nice so I even to this day I just expect a certain amount of asshole and everybody you know you just like whatever your ratio is you just you're just taking a ratio and if you're saying you're really nice from the get-go chances are that asshole ratio pretty yeah you're overcompensating funny internet post that I that I have to tell you about right now even though it's not appropriate for the podcast but I feel it's really funny internet post that I think this was a girl posted where she said um guys with big feet have big penises and guys with big cars have small penises no wonder people are afraid of clowns I'm trying to tell you that just now but hopefully everybody else got a laugh at the next track this track is from an artist who came out with one my favorite albums of the past few years her name is angel Olson I don't know how much of her music I've played you if any really I don't think I played you anything off of her last record and and really everything she's put up until that point for me was like hey I like this but I'm like really waiting for that moment where you make that killer record and I think a lot of people were too and this album of hers that she came out with a little while back called my woman is easily her biggest album easily her most critically acclaimed album and I'm glad that she kind of got that chance that I think a few artists do these days in the music industry to really just like kind of come out with a record that is is only somewhat successful because it feels like sometimes people just kind of get chewed up and spit out of the industry too often and I'm glad that she was able to stick around and kept at it because I the end result is just a great record with fantastic songs on it like this this track is titled shut up kiss me [Music] thank you oh that's a song I picked to me that track is I don't know it's maybe it's a bit of wishful thinking I mean it totally just like comes out of this feeling that I know I've had numerous times before if we're like in the middle of a fight or middle of an argument when it's just like I don't know I I why are we still arguing I feel like we could just be getting along instead just like Shep and kiss me instead like what why are we here why are we doing this and and I I guess again this is like probably why it's it's more wishful thinking because there's there's elements of the song where she's like you know we could rewind just all the bad things that happened and just sort of like throw it under the rug and toss it away and you know just like get back to loving each other and you know maybe that's like not reality or anything yeah like still that's like what you want to happen yeah it's like you'd rather just like can't we just like hit the red reset button on this or stability okay like I'm sorry like can this just be over now or something yeah you know I think especially in our situation where we actually don't have like a lot of fights like we don't have we don't fight frequently but when we do it's epic because we don't we don't practice that often no you don't practice a lot of reason to but when we do it's but let me do and we've definitely had our moments what I've just been like okay I've said sorry I mean I've acknowledged what's happened like it like can we just like be over and done with this and I remember there have been a few times where just been like mmm no you can't we can't be done no because I still mad or you're still mad and so it's like it has to continue yeah there's always that moment where one person is probably thinking at some point when I just wish we could just like get back to how it was just like 30 minutes before Ganju I started let's get into this next track birdie blue dress tell me a about this track after we play a little bit of it one last thing I wanted to ask you about what did you think of her voice I liked her voice I really like how vocal distortion that's really it works really well with kind of the pace of the song anything yeah I like how she doesn't sing like that all the time but when angel does I love how like weirdly traumatized she sounds when she's singing like I can't quite describe it but all I could say is that it sounds traumatic yeah you know sometimes she's singing in that ocean I like it but yeah I love her singing on that track I loved being brought to the brink let's play this birdy track and then we'll get it to why you picked this one okay [Music] okay so I think I think it's this song is like a really good contrast and I you know I really like this song this is like I mean this is kind of like an album where I didn't really like the album as a whole but this one track is always stuck with me I think it's so I think the imagery that the song and folks is really interesting I think this sense of you know having this thing that you wash and then just suddenly you find it and like things click like oh this is how it should be and so I think this the song is actually a good contrast because like I was kind of the reason why I included this is because I was kind of thinking about you know that feeling after you know things get really bad you've had a really bad fight and you know there's like that period of like cooling off and you know just kind of like you know there there's a wholeness in your relationship that you know feels like really asymmetrical when when you know what I mean when things aren't working and yeah that's that's why that's why I picked this song okay I'm not a not a person who talks about things that she likes often so bear with me I like the sensual kind of mellow vibe of the track and her voice is really sweet throughout the song and it's kind of hypnotic the way that it sort of plays on you know the droning keyboards and yeah I almost have like a and there's kind of like a skeletal as a Velvet Underground II kind of feel to it I share this next track comes it comes from a more visceral place I'll say that much I'll say I'll just kind of like spoil the whole theme an idea that right from the get-go because it's pretty straight into the point it comes from a band named Swain who used to go by the name of fuck what was their older name was that this routine as hell I'm pretty sure it was this routine as hell and they changed their name because they kind of like came together with a different sound I mean I love that album that they put out under their last name but they started doing like a bit of a 90s kind of alternative rock almost like a grungy punky kind of thing which was not the hardcore sound that they originally came up with yeah and this song is pretty much just like I don't know I guess in a way just like a fuck song it's just like just all about just like getting completely lost in another person's physical being but I also say it's it's not very sexy sounding you know is just a very visceral rock song I guess just being lost in some of the other and someone else one could argue that sex is not that sexy we'll play a little bit of it [Music] so there we go that's that it is just pretty much about getting lost another person physically it's just this is the gist of it or the jizz of it however you want to say it I mean I guess you know they put a little bit more romantically I guess then I just did I'm a terrible person how is this awkward we're just saying I've made way worse jokes in front of you I just told a joke about how clowns have big dicks a few minutes ago Simon awkward seven awkward situation just microphones are on now that's all tell them it's the only difference oh so this next track that you picked is a yeah yes track it's titled our time is this from the this EP did it come out before the album Beutel yes like early early this is early early early early when they were really wrong yeah New York soundin yeah really wrong New York sound and all those in the olden days was good New York indie bands in the early 2000s that were good for a very limited amount of time still like the yeah yeah I'm still like a lot of the early stuff too but hey you know I'm not saying the IAEA's are alone in that you know it didn't take long for The Strokes to take a nosedive you know so it's it's you know I'm not saying they're alone in that they're certainly not they're certainly not very very little of the indie set from back in those days is still around now and if it is it it's putting out a disco record so well uh so let's let's let's take a trip back to yeah our younger days with this Yaya's track our time me [Music] that was a nice reminder of why you sound like that yeah yes or why I love them initially yeah you know it's it's such a sweet and cute song so I'm so happy I picked it but it also you know just brought me back to God just like you remember how like I'm just trying to think of the context because like what the hell was it in response to like why this stuff why the hell did this stuff get popular because you're talking about like grunge happened and then the whole like I guess it went mainstream and Kurt died and then you had post grunge and you had like all of these like awful sort of like fake grunge bands that were just like total shit and just like new metal happened and it's like what do you do after that so it's like you had a lot of these bands and they were just like totally taking it back to basics there's blues stuff you only had one drummer and one guitarist and one of them was probably singing and like around this time it's like you had yeah yes and Black Keys and The Kills and the White Stripes and The Raveonettes and it's like being a duo was like like having four members was just too much jazz I couldn't couldn't be more than three some cases like really stripped back if there was a third person they had to be doing something stupid like tambourine they couldn't be adding too much extra sound you know and it's funny because like a lot of those groups they ended up just like totally faltering the moment that they were doing all right let's try to add more stuff now yeah like once they decide there's too much you might sort of lost the narrative but uh but yeah that was a nice reminder after having covered I think the last couple yeah as records and was just like I don't know so much about this yeah it's still really good it's still really good there's probably like some I mean we're technically Millennials too but they're probably some people listening like maybe ten years or so younger than us who are trying this track out and like what I was a big deal yeah it's some squawky lady it's like I'm crazy over a blues guitar and I don't get it but I you know again my Tamia why she was such a fun and interesting vocalist yeah this next track that I picked is a lot more smooth and mellow it comes from the king of normcore the Canadian chain smoker that's one of his nicknames I'm pretty sure Mac DeMarco this is one of my favorite songs of his it's called my kind of woman and let's let's just get into it because I think the sentiment of the song is pretty obvious right from there right from the get-go so yeah there's that Mac DeMarco song that I picked that I liked quite a bit yeah yeah I just love the sentiment of that track but I think the thing I love most about that song is honestly just the way it sounds which is something so woozy and like kind of drunk about it yeah like and I don't know I just love how the guitar sounds on the track just kind of is like a high-pitched kind of sort of quality to it that I don't hear in a lot of other songs like Mac DeMarco even those music is very smooth he strikes me as an artist to really kind of pays close attention to the way certain things sound a lot of the time and and this is definitely one of those tracks or seemed like everything had a very particular kind of Tambor to it purposeful and the result is that you know it just kind of feels like being in love you know it does feel like you know there's kind of like a Drunken quality to kind of being infatuated with somebody that I feel like that song embodies really well so we'll move on to the next track you picked a shoo-shoo song when he did what are your favorite bands I did and you know it was funny when I was going back and I was looking at our I think it was the video that you did I think 2014 where you did a video with the Valentine's Day playlist that you made for me for Valentine's Day and in the comments eggs I think alike I wonder if she was creeped out by the shoo-shoo track and I was just like ah no I know I was not I'm a fan I'm a big fan yeah I mean when I started college I think I listened to post-punk and I listened to like any and all like experimental rock and like a louder the better and shoo-shoo like for me just such a standout band just because of their well I mean Jamie's voice obviously is he's like he's like if Hank Hill being shocked constantly but but come back from the dead he's like a ghost like the ghost of constantly shocked egg ill oh no I love Jamie's voice oh yeah you guys have seen enough positive shoo-shoo or used to know well I think of when I was in college and I had these roommates that were I guess there were Mean Girls it was before the Mean Girls movie but that's what they were and I was really into Shu Shu at that time and I remember coming in from class and they were clearly having a conversation about me and one of the girls saying something to the no of God she plays that crying guy all the time yeah yeah that crying guy crying guy that crying guy hopefully Jamie's listening or somebody's telling him to listen to it and I am loved Shu Shu and telling him hey someone on this podcast they said yourself the crying guy this tract ceremony where yes this is a this is a Joy Division cover yeah so we'll play this oh yeah cover and we'll get into your reasoning for picking picking up a birthday okay [Music] I like the with cheese cents in that yeah yeah I like this version they've done I think another I think one other version of this cover and I like this this version the best at what shoe shoe era did this cover get recorded was this was this around the time that he was like messing around with the Gameboy chiptunes stuffers I think so before that no I think so I think cuz like I said there's an earlier version of this cover but I don't I don't know and there's something about that I didn't do the research there's something about the tone of his voice and just kind of like the the the chaos of the instrumentation that kind of reminds me of like super early like bright eyes stuff like there's almost like I feel like this Joy Division song I've played the right way could just be an emo song like nothing well I think he's playing an emo song but like I feel like I feel like he's almost taking it there like we're a step or two away from it yeah yeah I didn't think of it like that but yeah totally well I knew it want it I want it to put ceremony on this list I mean you know it's a tragic love story right but I guess like I don't I don't take the lyrics super literally and I've always loved the like the feeling derived from that song because it's like to me it's always been kind of like as much as it is about a beginning it's also about an ending which I mean that is the human story right so I I mean I love and so I love that and I love that in the context of like a relationship because you know they'll they'll come a time when we're you know very old people and you know and and all of you know all of this time that we're spending together in real time will will be memories and it'll be you know just the splash electricity you know what I mean and anyways so I like this song because it feels like that it feels like an entire life in a second for me I hear that so that's cool yeah that's an awesome description and thank you for laying it all out there yeah yeah this next one going to take supersuit this next one we're gonna take the lyrics super literally comes from the new perfume genius album it's called die for you and this is this is definitely one of the darker Spacey air tracks on the new record takes a little while to get going but I think there's also like a bit of uh I think like subtle portishead influence too on this track that I think you'll dig because since we saw him live together he's like totally like built out the instrumentation on his records you know one of the artists one of the few artists that their whole shtick their whole gimmick their whole style is hey let's play everything super minimal super short super skeletal super stripped back but as mike has built out his songs instrumentally more and more they've actually only gotten more interest yeah yeah and this track is definitely an example of that for for me [Music] so yeah that's my pick that's my serious dark pick like I'm actually XE actually kind of got dark for my last few picks on this on this list it's funny how the songs have taken a slightly darker turn to slightly dirty geek backup but yeah I don't I don't know how much I have to say about that track other than that I felt like I just wanted to bring into a more grave direction back on my list there there are other love year songs on this record that are much that they have a brighter sort of tone to them but I figured I'd take him in this direction tour the back end of the the list was so what did you do here with this tricky song your name uh we're gonna listen to at first or we listen to a little bit of it first okay [Music] yeah so yeah this song for me is just like it is wedding day like all over it and the changing your name yeah yeah it's cute yeah it's cute it's cute sorry but I love the melody and I love like I looked Ricky's like whispery vocals like in the background and yeah I just I really like the atmosphere of of that song and it's a very different song for him yeah you know yeah well and it's also it's really different on that album too like with the you know kind of with the surrounding tracks it's like just the like breath oh yeah yeah yeah it's like very different from his usual style but it seems like he was doing almost everything he could to maintain while yes sort of making it you know because you could tell with the kind of minimal but dusty dirty kind of beats yeah and the fact that he was kind of maintaining that whispery the kind of quality but he wanted that female voice on top but singing kind of like a cheery yeah and as the track goes on like the whisper you know like the the whisper vocal gets a little bit more like there's it's varying in intensity but it is like you it's definitely like a restraint it's definitely a really unique song for him and just like as far as love songs in general because there's something undeniably cute about it but simultaneously there's just something kind of weird and off-putting and kind of creepy about it you know and maybe not intentionally because the things that feel odd about it hey you married me I know it's true the things that are out about it would probably only come off odd as people who haven't heard Tricky's music before you know I mean but if you've heard his previous stuff you know that that's kind of his thing but sort of like totally out of context like that's like a really be what song but like knowing what I know about his music it's like ok that's really interesting that he would go this route and he sort of made it work you know in a lot of ways in his usual style I mean maybe some people would disagree I don't know how well blowback was received in comparison to a lot of his earlier nice stuff now this next one is an interesting pick this will be fun this is this is pretty much the only track I loved off of this album I think you might have heard this before but I think I do love the song when I first heard it but I feel like in in retrospect and as I've gotten deeper into our relationship I I appreciate it even more you get you guys know this one you guys know this one [Music] so yeah I pick that you know I guess the reason I picked that song is that I feel like I just feel like it's really good love song I and and I think it's good just because the sentiment behind it is so strong of course it's Kanye so it's like it's done and are really like tacky like completely unlikable and you know it's it's like just just like he's almost like a heel in in like a wrestling match you know what I mean yeah but like the the emotion behind it you know like the the sense of the this the sense of devotion yeah they're you know the the fact that he's willing to admit how horrible he is I guess he's yeah admittin is the first step just like just like he says you know it's it's interesting also thing about this song if I can if I can go into it to think of this song about the the being in the earlier stages or at least he's thinking in within the earlier stages of his relationship with Kim and and just sort of like how this sort of you know progresses into a lot of the more intense emotions on the life of Pablo which you which you now know that I love and you looked at me like I was crazy the night that I came back and I and I listened to it okay this is this is really great mostly because it was 3 a.m. and you're like you're crazy you're tired what's wrong with you like nice I swear this is really good now I swear it's really good something happened something happens last time I heard it it's really good now but yeah but maybe mostly because it was 3 a.m. but yeah you know it's like I like a lot of the elements of it where it's like when a real one holds you down you're supposed to drought I find that line very funny manok it's it's uh it's sort of like I don't know almost like if you're a real person if you're somebody who's really gonna be there if you're somebody who's really devoted almost to him it's it's like it's it's like he attributes all of his flaws and everything that's horrible about him like it's it's the reason he's great is because of those things and I feel like that's also the approach he takes to his relationship too it's like hey all these horrible things these are also the reasons why I'm such a great significant other - you know like when he's trying to convince people that he's a great artist it's like hey I'm crazy named a genius that isn't crazy I'm crazy that means I'm a genius uh-huh so you know I I feel like I feel like that sometimes - to a degree where it's like maybe I'm just like way too much like into my own work or maybe I'm just like taking things in our relationship way too seriously and you know sometimes that's stuff that I feel like I have to come to terms with and curb but simultaneously you know sometimes honey you're not famous at our house kaya is not famous at home either I'm sure Kanye gets yelled at but he'll I wonder I wonder if he would ever rap about that though I'm sure kind of gotten yelled at I think you know every once in a while I'm like yeah all these things are why I'm so great though well I'm a great husband because I'm always just like I know I never stopped working that makes me great when it's like now it's it's it's not like that but you know it's like I can definitely get in that mindset sometimes rewear you think your flaws are your are your strengths and and I'm sure to degree for everybody they are yeah you know to me that's him like totally embodying that mindset and almost like taking it too far to the point where it's just hilarious so we're on like the home stretch here we go Wow almost done almost done so thank you to everybody who's been listening so far at us prattling on about these songs and how much we like each other but I know that's why you guys are here you're all really lonely and you're like I want to know what love sounds like I want to know what two people being infatuated with sounds like I'm really I'm really a sad person you know that are you're listening because you hate me and your ammunition I'm sure there's gonna be cake and I can't believe Anthony paid a woman to come on his podcast and pretend to be his wife who divorced him five years ago I'm sure that's gonna be writing a reddit theory I know I can't wait til work okay I can't wait to lurk he got he really hired a voice actress and paid her $15,000 to learn to talk exactly like his wife just to be on that podcast and and fabricate elements of their of their relationship for over an hour you know I've seen more impressive mental gymnastics yeah really impressive like the theories about us breaking up and me becoming an MRA yeah some more like really detailed yeah ah yeah almost like almost like almost like my main channel was like a reason we got divorced like you might have seen my content on the mean decided we have to leave you well no you're reviewing memes series started before the meme channel hmm so they kind of predate the meme channels it's true but yeah just curious how people think up things it's fan fiction it really is it's Anthony Taylor fans everything I enjoyed it keep doing it this next song that you've picked here is from one miss past uzuki how high the moon I'm not familiar with this artist so I'm gonna play the track and then you can inform me inform me after [Music] all right so so yeah so this this song's version of the song how high the moon was originally recorded for the movie I think it was a Lux e blues I think I think that's the name and it was kind of like the the title like title sequence that the song was recorded for and you know there's been lots of versions of how high the moon it's kind of a relatively famous song I really like this version of the song it's very haunting and like wild and I don't remember when this was originally recorded but I feel like there's something about it that seems very ageless it's definitely like I feel like this arrangement is while it's you know I think I sort of get where you're coming from like it sounds like a piece of classy dramatic vocal pop from the 50s or the 60s but there's kind of like a modern eeriness to it yeah I know yeah I didn't always get in that kind of music I'd have to walk I don't remember exactly when this was recorded but this is an older hoarding but it definitely has like just kind of like the stripped down composition of the song I think makes it feel a little bit more modern like you were saying you know you are kind of like expecting a bit more instrument instrumentation and almost everything with with the I'm like really we're burnt out ya know so it is it's definitely like it definitely has like I'm modern feel to it and I I love it because I feel like the song is like the melody is so haunting like I find myself humming this song all of the time like it's a song that like is an earworm for me and you know and it's just you know I think like you know what I added the song to the list I I liked it because it's kind of like a song that you know like when like when you're traveling or something or you know like whenever like one of us is like working or whatever and you're like you're missing your significant other it's just it definitely has those vibes for me mm-hmm okay well this is assuming my last song and then this next song is your last song so this is each of our last tracks which is funny because I feel like I'm toward the end of this and I'm so ready not to explain this song but I feel like the song requires a lot of extreme but it comes from what my favorite rock bands of this decade the who go by the name of Ice Age I pretty much love every record they put out so far this decade and this is the title track the closing track to their latest and my favorite record of their so far called plowing into the field of love so uh so here we go we'll play this track and I'll try to sort of work through what I feel are the themes coming out of this very ugly messy tangled chaotic post pumpkins that [Music] all right it's obviously that song comes on a little strong to me that track says a lot with the way the instrumentation just sort of has this weird kind of like feverish just like very like unkempt like ragged kind of feel to it like the lyrics which I know probably did not fully translate and and I feel like I'm kind of projecting onto the song just a little bit I feel like the words are there but I've like read some of the inspirations for the song that may not necessarily be you know what I'm putting onto the track but given the title of the song and the title of the album and some of the lyrics I don't see how I could kind of read anywhere else but the the way it's kind of framed is this guy is portraying himself as like kind of being in a mansion and being sort of like above like kind of these unwashed refugee types and these sort of like loans lonely studs who are out there in the world just like aimlessly wandering and and he's in that position because he sort of put in the work and sort of plowed into love and so because he sort of put in in that work now he sort of has that status he's at that point where he's sort of like above all of that and he's sort of like you know yeah yeah so I mean I feel like because I'm with you I've been with you for so long and we had we have you know we put the work into our relationship you know there's like so much less chaos in the world the way you know I mean it's still exotic everything is still creating perspective yeah but it's like it's it's honestly I feel like we're probably in a better place now than where we used to be in general like you know our relationship our jobs and everything and just yeah we're very I feel like we're very lucky you know like the stars aligned just right [Laughter] yeah the stars aligned and you know things are as good as one can ask things to be you know definitely definitely so I feel like that very rugged very rough sort of sound which is just ice ages thing I feel like even they can sort of communicate something kind of poetic you know through that which I feel like there are a lot of people that don't quite get even my love for this band too but that's that's probably one of the reasons why I feel like you know some very interesting things sort of come out of the tangle of what they do and in that track and hopefully again I'm not projecting too much onto it you know that's one of the more interesting sort of takes I've heard somebody sort of talk about love and yeah the track you know I think it's okay to project upon the song you know but it's like it's it's funny he almost sort of like you know portrays it as like literally like a heart brac back-breaking work like farming I mean it isn't well honestly if you want my opinion I think people don't put that much emphasis on relationships in terms of the work that you have to put into it because it is work you know I think you know when you start a relationship you're starting the relationship based on you know these really primitive things right like the way that person looks you know like your ability to have surface level conversation with them in connection with them but the real relationship starts once all that stuff gets boring and you are having to deal with the outside world like we talked about earlier having to deal with you know just learning that person the good and the bad of that person and it's really easy to give up it's really easy to give up sure it's the easiest thing you can do it is tough and hard work to continue to fight for something that you you know you know that is right you know so I think that weathered voices is appropriate tone sure I agree and that's what I like about it all right we're gonna getting the last track you're closing up shop over here well with this Feist song which song did you pick is this like off the deluxe version of is this like an extra track yeah this was on the this is a no it's an extra on the deluxe version of the reminder okay all right all right we're gonna play this track Islands Oh islands in the stream oh it's sort of so cute anyone I should cover that that's so cute oh that's a cute ending song let's play a little bit of that and then you can talk about it more though and this and this [Music] how can we [Music] I'm holding their hand guys I made a move on her that was I thought that was I thought it was an opportune time I made my move guys held her hand I might make it to first base later I'm telling you it's so funny when I was a kid I didn't even know ghetto superstar took its melody from anything I was just like I had no idea when I was a kid I didn't even know I didn't even know I just thought that was a totally original song I have no idea Oh Abbi DS track yeah yeah yeah Bee Gees could write a song people don't get it wait pretty sure was a Bee Gees song originally then there was a country cover later yeah that's right yeah your aunt recovery came later a Dolly Parton and then after that you kind of got more country covers yeah and then almost like it kind of got a reputation for being a country song it was not one of the Bee Gees bigger trash yeah I think you're right I don't think that's what people really went to the Bee Gees to hear you know what I mean yeah so you know I I love this cover with the Constantine's and I think like all ten of my songs could have been a Feist song I held a lot of restraint and picking picking my picking my songs because I mean duh it's you gotta pick different artists yeah you know unless you come to me beforehand with that concept you're like I have this idea all feist you're mine you haven't even heard her new album yet I have heard a little bit yeah I've started it I've like not been able to kind of finish it but I have started yeah but yeah it's originally a Bijou song yeah with that beauty's the more you know but yeah I think I think that's a really beautiful cover I think probably anybody who sees us together friends of ours that song who've talked about us or make comment about our relationship we're kind of two two peas in a pod and just two islands and a stream of internet comments theorizing our our eventual divorce yeah exactly well this this has been great this has been fun we should probably the next time we do this maybe started a little bit early earlier it's late for us whatever time it is for you yeah or or actually just keep it to five tracks yeah you know I was really intimidated by the 10/10 track I don't know what I was thinking I don't know where you're thinking either but I feel sad because I feel like I don't think I gave or did my tracks justice because I pooped out at the end I kind of peeked out so but they're all awesome songs I think everybody listening right now is probably pooping out around this way yeah thank you yeah you don't want a family vlogs exactly you don't want a family vlog because five minutes into it we're just gonna be like this I need a nap time in a nap alright guys well thank you very much for listening I hope you enjoyed this I hope you enjoyed the return of my lovely significant other hearing yeah thanks for caring if you want to put it that way caring obsessing it's totally awesome this is the perfect just friend

slBC3h48xgQ,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new relatively new sort of new not as new as usually I review things but hey I'm gonna review it anyway dime a arrow Cena's Q befo Nia this is the latest full-length album from Cuban singer-songwriter instrumental arranger Dinah era Cena who has been pretty prolific in the short amount of time she has been releasing albums under her own name back in 2015 she released her nueva era album a record which I received a CD promo for I was very impressed with her vocal chops but found the instrumentation to be a little hollow a little lacking at points despite the clear attempt to do something a little bit more experimental and edgy than your usual Latin jazz release especially with some of the darker moodier chord progressions on this thing and in very strange vocal layering but I ended up just passing the CD off to my wife because she seemed to enjoy it a little bit more than me and she's been digging on her ever since here and there and lo and behold she's telling me now she's turning me on to stuff she's saying hey did you know this artist has been releasing music release some music last year and I was like no I didn't know that is any better than the album that I gave you because I was really hoping that the instrumental game would kind of be up to little bit on whatever she released into the future because the vocals were really good it seemed like she had kind of a unique thing going but it wasn't totally like you know fully realized turns out in 2016 she dropped a much gmer much more improvisational jazz record which I actually found to be more impressive that record being titled one takes but this follow-up project Cuba fonyód this is nice so nice I actually regret not talking about it and now I am coming on here to rectify that because this is my youtube channel and and I will do whatever the hell I want to do the instrumentation on this thing is a fantastic combination of funk and rumba and Latin jazz of course you're getting those hot latin horns on this thing that hand percussion those Cuban grooves as well of course every once in a while these are elevated with a shot of very elegant strings or some very well arranged background vocals the on this thing stick pretty closely to a verse chorus verse format they're not super long-winded jazz tunes but there still is an incredible amount of strong playing on this record even though it seems that the songs and just the directness of these Tunes do take priority because there is quite a bit of flashy playing and performances on this thing to keep the song sounding at least a little intricate and intense dense you know and enough for the jazz heads but really the main appeal of this record for me comes down to era Cena's voice which is so powerful has so much character I mean with every record she's released so far it's really been her voice that has been the the selling point of the project but now that we had this flood of louder and more vibrant and more versatile instrumentation on this album over here it really gives her an amazing foundation to work off of and just show off everything that her voice has to offer everything from the very quiet and precious Valentine which is an incredibly lovely ballad in the tracklisting here to all the feverish scatting which she does over these mathematical Latin rhythms on the track la rumba me llamo yo of course going into this thing there were some songs that was kind of lukewarm on but even some of those managed to win me over eventually like the track maybe tomorrow a track that does have a very pretty melody maybe tomorrow but it does have kind of a musical theatre aesthetic to it that does turn me off a little bit the band plays the song pretty straight these string sections on the track just really lifts dymas vocals up to Soaring highs all of which is pretty nice but I still would have preferred something with a bit more instrumental muscle still though it is nice to hear how she sort of vocally dominates a song even of this style and I guess my last point on this front is that the song como is probably the album's only moment where for me it's sort of over steps that that line into making overly elegant overly smooth ballroom jazz music though I do like the splash of R&B influence that I think turns up in the vocal melody of that track but when it comes to low key moments on this thing I think I do enjoy the track in hell so much more or angel I'm sorry I'm terrible at pronouncing things but I do love how minimal and how strip back and just how subtle that track is at moments to the point where it's almost just like creepy but more often not on this thing the heat is on high especially on tracks like be very tight and uniquely grooved mambo nama a good part of the intro and a few other passages here are dominated by this octave Boombah Boombah Boombah again one of the many more thrilling musical moments on this thing the album finishes up very well - it's not gonna be forever has some very fun and joyous group vocals fantastic latin rhythms and horns on there - pretty much everything you would typically expect out of a Latin jazz track but just delivered with this contemporary vibrance so while sure it's not one of the more original tracks in the bunch it's still an incredibly fun listen and the closing track Valentine I already mentioned earlier is one of the cutest and most fun tracks on the entire record doesn't really add anything too much thematically to the album as an ending but it's still a beautiful song and overall I just kind of see this album as a collection of just beautiful Latin jazz tunes with good performances great production and very tasteful and creative references to the worlds of pop and funk and a myriad of other things throughout there may be a few tracks on here that I wished had a bit more bite or I wished had a bit more development like the track todo por amor which I feel like I can't be the only person who felt like the song ended a bit abruptly like given its pacing that it felt like it was going somewhere else like it had a little bit more to it but outside of that I just really loved this record I love diamonds voice I love the production performances on this thing I think it's a great balance of of sounding like it would appeal to a pop audience because the instrumentation is very clear it's very full it's very bright the chorus is on this thing really pop but yet you know there's there's enough instrumental flash and spark there to keep it from feeling like just a mere jazz pop record and it just sucks that I didn't hear it and I didn't cover it earlier because it just probably would have been my favorite jazz release of last year but yeah I guess what happens happens I'm feeling a light too decent 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next - like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts I'll see you the next one Anthony Fantino died May or Sina forever I think yeah I think forever 
eQ3Wd60Qddw,hi everyone Pavan II cast Tanana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new MGMT album little Dark Age this is the latest full-length LP from New York pop duo MGMT who hit it pretty big in the 2000s thanks to unforeseen hits such as electric feel and time to pretend and kids all great tracks but Ben and Andrew didn't seem all that interested in maintaining their musical momentum in the mainstream because almost immediately after putting out or ocular spectacular they started to release very strange and long-winded bits of music such as Metanoia and then followed this up with their 2010 album congratulations which was fun but kind of uncompromising and also my favorite record the duo had released at that time the album overall seemed like a deeper embrace of the quirky experimental but very fun characteristics that made them interesting to start there were also epic and multi-phase moments on this thing like siberian breaks some very funny hero worship such as the song brain you know and then the closer the title track of this thing is one of the most epic and and heartwarming ballads the duo have ever penned they followed this LP up in 2013 with a self-titled album that was a bit of a head-scratcher I can't appreciate that with each record MGMT seeks to do something entirely different but this record was really unkempt lo-fi to a fault under written under produced really under under everything I mean it wasn't the worst thing in the world but to me it kind of read like a band having a difficult time adjusting to the musical landscape of the next decade and also it just kind of felt like the the reception of this album was so negative how could they possibly recover but last year they started to drop teaser singles to this new record over here little dark age all of which piqued my interest and for casted the duo going into an entirely different direction just straight synth pop but with kind of a haunted aesthetic to it like there were definitely some petshop boy and Thompson twin vibes coming off these tracks also a splash of aerial pink in the mix - or maybe more than a splash the song James sounds like a dead ringer for track that that could have fit on like that the before today record the Ariel Pink's Haunted graffiti album before today on this track there's even kind of this goofy baritone singing that is like kind of Ariel Pink's calling card this eerie similarity caused me to go look up the writing and production credits on this thing and of course Ariel pink is credited with co-writing at least one song on this thing the song when you dies so I'm not really surprised I picked that up hey MGMT ripoff Ariel Pink's super friggin hard on this record don't be that person that like just listens to this record and you don't listen to Ariel pink please listen - Ariel pink - he's a really great musician he's a really great songwriter lots of good albums in his discography but it's it's almost kind of ridiculous how much MGMT pull from him on this album clearly it was a bit of a mutual thing given the aerial help them with this record in a way but still you know listened to Ariel Pink's music for the love of God the sound of this record is really nostalgic but there's obviously a kind of modern silliness and sense of humor to it it just adds an anachronistic quality to this very vintage style of pop and this very fun aesthetic follows through on pretty much every song here of course there are cuts that feature a little bit more acoustic instrumentation but still the synths do carry at least some presence and even when they're not here in full force there's still an undeniable eeriness that cannot be shaken from a lot of these tracks a lot of the songs on this thing are oddly spooky and kind of frightening and a little morbid it's totally new wave but there's also something a little Goffe about it - kind of tongue-in-cheek as well whatever the mix of moods and influences that are coming together on this album is MGMT pull it off really well and they pull it off very consistently but even though I like the aesthetic and the instrumentation on this album quite a bit my long-term enjoyment of this record really comes down to the sticky unforgettable hooks the songwriting and the very dark absurd and unlikely song topics like the track she works out too much which kicks the entire record off a song that's essentially about a relationship on the rocks because because the guy is not very physically active I guess maybe it's a metaphor or a piece of symbolism for something else I'm not entirely sure but I don't think that's the case in a way the song at its core seems to be about a relationship ending or dying on the vine over just a lack of common interests or different personality types but of course that very common theme is made to sound kind of silly or put into a kind of unique light with all of these funny exercise references a very fun groovy danceable beat and bassline think of the song is like the antithesis to Kanye's new workout plan then there is the track ts lamp which stands for time spent looking at my phone which is a partly schmaltzy partly surreal partly eerily accurate song about phone addiction I love the smooth groove the nocturnal bassline the dreamy swell of instrumentation on the hook the dead on lyrics Jesus Christ then we have the track me and Michael which is a really cute endearing sweet song about friendship I love the gently pulsating since on this thing the twinkling guitars I like be cool assuring lead vocals on this thing - the way it's sung just kind of feels like a bit of a one-on-one conversation which is totally contrasted by the angry and and confrontational when you die which is like a bit of groovy acoustic rock with some very prickly lyrics saying I mean I'm evil I'm not nice go fuck yourself the instrumentation is super catchy and very sweet in a lot of ways but just the nastiness coming off the lyrics it's kind of hilarious the song when you're small is a very haunting ballad with a lot of space around the core instrumentation and vocals the duo definitely does their best to use production to kind of make the music feel like I don't know that it's it's in a gargantuan space or give the listener the feeling of that they're falling into some kind of abyss or shrinking in slow motion like Alice in Wonderland and even though the song on its surface is about physical size there are definitely issues of I guess emotional and mental insecurities being addressed here in the song - or I guess physical size being used as a symbol to address those things I also love the haunting reverb laid on to the Harmonized cultish vocals on the hook here the trippy effects and instrumental overdubs that kind of flash up here and there which this isn't even the only point on the album where that happens there's quite a bit of that over the course of the entire album where you hear you know little instrumental flourishes or people talking and laughing just weird effects just add a little bit more color and context to the instrumentation you're hearing or the lyrics that are being sung and the closing track handed over if I am to read this song correctly to me feels like a meditation on the duo struggle to remain relevant in the music industry it's very cold and intriguing finish to the entire album but for me the crown jewel of the record has to be a song that for me is one of the hardest to interpret and that's the title track little dark age a track that I've been enamored with since the moment I heard it as a single but even though the meaning of the song isn't super apparent on its face I do love the imagery and the cryptic lyrics on this thing as well as the disembodied vocals singing throughout the track be very murky baseline throbbing synthesizers on the hook stellar chord progression and if any track on this album embodies the goth aesthetic that pops up here and there throughout this record it's this one overall really loving this record really enjoying it not too much in the way of a gargantuan theme or concept running throughout the entire album it just kind of seems like a nice loose collection of very memorable songs that are tied together relatively tightly with a very focused aesthetic nothing more nothing less good sense of melody of style of songwriting on this album I'm glad MGMT are kind of back in a lot of ways on this record have have sort of overcome a lot of the faults of their previous album there are a few cuts on here that felt like to me created a bit of a lull in the tracklist mostly the song James which again feels like an aerial pink Xerox as well as the instrumental days that got away which just read to me is alright but still enjoying the album a lot feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album to listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't please don't cry just leave an angry comment the comments if you're feeling angry or whatever just get it out that way just for the best video next to my head that you can check out or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana MGMT forever 
exzlWZlbcU4,our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the worst and the best tracks of the week not too much to say outside of check out our Amazon and turntable lab associate links down there in the description if you feel like treating yourself and before we into the tracks I also wanted to shout out a few cover songs that dropped this week that I liked quite a bit people kind of going crazy for this new Saint Vincent rendition of Rihanna's consideration from her last album but for me personally my favorite cover this week has easily been that should give you a little bit of a hint there probably one of my favorite songs from when I was in adolescence super catchy stuck with me over the years the screaming females doing a cover of Annie Lennox's no more I love you as a part of a new I guess series of tracks from Amazon where it's it's just Valentine's Day themed so be on the lookout for that though those are those are both linked down there in the description both of those tracks give me a shot and let's get into the worst tracks of the week whoo whoo whoo let's do it all right first NBA young boy new track from him love is poison I guess kind of keeping with the Valentine's theme this is like pretty much everything wrong horrible cliche and boring about a lot of mainstream trap right now like the vocals don't even really sound like anything or anybody auto-tune sounds awful beat is dime-a-dozen must have got this beat on the whole sale I'd rather listen to pretty much every Kodak black song ever recorded because at least that has a like a smidge of originality to it whereas this completely does not Noah Cyrus new song total trash sounds like a lord ripoff but like a really bad Lord ripoff like if you've ever listened to Lorde and you've thought which I don't personally feel this way but I know some people throw this criticism at her like oh you know this music is so middlebrow it's it's it's art pop but it's not that artsy it doesn't go that far well wait until you hear this because the that to me hearing this song was kind of like wow this is this maybe this is what Lorde sounds like to Lord haters this is just like a really bad Lord ripoff in my opinion I I just cannot even begin to describe so we're just gonna go to the next track another track from Laurie Anderson and the Kronos Quartet one of my most anticipated albums of the year and pretty much every track I've heard from it so far just sounds like a boring overly indulgent like super artsy Metropolitan attempt at like trying to make a really significant statement on the political climate of right now but failing miserably to communicate anything effectively do not care for it this track is actually titled CNN predicts a monster storm just kind of give you an idea of what we're dealing with and finally this new to chain song with a yg and offset B is super dime-a-dozen 2 Chainz doesn't even really feel like he came through on this one kind of phoned it in this is a part of a new like EP Lee he just dropped and no chemistry whatsoever from like each of these guys typically I I enjoy listening to these guys rap especially yg like I my ears perk up whenever I see a yg feature these days and I'm really looking forward to when his next album is coming out because his last record was amazing but now the not that my opinion has changed on him or anybody on this track but just no chemistry here no excitement just just really kind of nothing to having these three on this one single song in my opinion all right let's go into the let's go into the tracks I felt kind of met on you know weren't worth bad weren't terrible but weren't totally blown me away first toothache zoom topaz Jones topaz Jones is an artist who I guess I just got turned on to by the good people over at DJ booth and this track toothache is an amazingly funky pop rap track I can't quite place we're his influences sit on this song because I feel like they come from so many places like there's a little bit of a West Coast g-funk vibe but in some ways I feel like he's taking it even further back than that like the earliest days of hip-hop and rap music when a lot of the beats and a lot of the instrumentals were just being influenced by funk music and disco music his flow is pretty good a lot of charisma on the track too but still I'm kind of sitting back and waiting like so is this guy going to spin this into something that has a bit more bite to it or excitement or originality or will he merely kind of hang in this purgatory where he's just like kind of being a bit of a nostalgia act you know what I mean which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing as long as you know the music and the songs and the records end up being kind of quality but I'm waiting to hear more you know to sort of see if he'll get to a place where he's not so much drowning in his influences a little bit moving on from their new track from Secret Circle which of course is a hip hop trio featuring lil ugly Mane or you know formerly little ugly Mane Wicky Antoine this track of it titled ounce of it is a decent track instrumentals okay kind of plain really I think it kind of comes down to the lyricism of each person on the track to kind of keep things interesting going forward I would like to hear the production get a little bit riskier but as of right now I love hearing these three on the track I love that these three are a part of a group and I'm hoping for something bigger as far as like a project this year definitely moving on from their new race rumored song teed up sort of sounds catchy trappy woozy intoxicating just like some of the duo's best music so far not anything entirely new from either of them but actually like a pretty smooth listenable catchy track a q-tip abstract radio he has a new song out with Kendrick Lamar titled want you to want it's it's a little messy it's a little all over the place like it's not the best producer the best like assembled track but it's actually cool to hear these two on a song and it does come together relatively well like there are a lot of interesting ideas on this cut but the the the production is just kind of a little clunky it's mixed a little weirdly you can tell they kind of like put the song together on the fly but even with the speed I think they assembled this track at least it sounds like it to me I still think a lot of cool sort of concepts came through so definitely give this song a shot which I know a lot of hip-hop heads are for sure but I didn't see too much talk about this track this past week and I want to make sure everybody sees it also MF DOOM ands our face is our face being the hip hop duo featuring inspected deck that you know I've said on numerous accounts especially my reviews of their projects like there's clearly an NF doom influence going on here they've announced a collaborative album and they have dropped the first single from it and that track is titled nautical depth and is that it's not a bad track you know it's it's not bad I I wouldn't say that there was exactly kind of the fireworks that I was hoping for given the inclusion here of MF DOOM given obviously how huge fans czar phase are because I feel like they take a lot of concepts and a lot of ideas from his music but um he works effectively into what they already have going you know I'll say that and still I am pretty excited to hear what they have to offer here because you know a new album or so of MF DOOM material is always good I do like sour-faced so looking forward to it I'm moving on from there perfect circle has a new track out titled talk talk it is gothy it's heavy it's very sinister alternative metal obviously not on the proggy or side of things which I'm hoping to hear more of that one stool drops a new record but it's not a bad track the the visual that goes along with the music video is a little weird looking and cringy but I still do think the tune is pretty good and I'm pretty excited perfect circle are back and a sound like doing pretty well as far as their musical output you know with the singles and everything and let's get into the track so I thought were the best best best tracks this week my favorite tracks this week all right titus andronicus a productive Koff titus andronicus new project on the way from what I understand this new song and it's kind of like a studio session video of the track that you can check out down there in the description box it's titled above the bodega local business and this is easily one of the best songs I think the band has ever put together very I guess soulful rock music with I don't know it's it's got like a bit of a 70s kind of 80s feel to it definitely a Springsteen thing going on to a degree and Patricks vocals on this thing typically his very raspy like you know cat being strangled vocal Tambor can can kind of be hit or miss for me however on this track I feel like the the type of music that he is performing on top of really kind of benefits his voice I feel like he kind of gives this style of rock music like a bit of grit and you know they're really kind of put some teeth on it it also helps that the song is very nice you know the the Shannon odds are you know a little a little stale a little dated but it actually works pretty well because the performance is good you know it's a lot of conviction a lot of passion there I think the song is actually pretty quality and looking forward to hearing what titus and dronicus you're gonna be offering on this this new album I mean at least to me it can't be worse than the last record cannot be worse than the last record I know that a lot of people love the last record but I did not personally I really did not a new track from PJ Harvey and Harry s Scott for this new series this new drama titled dark river is going to be the theme to the show it's an old English folk tune titled an acre of land and it's a very beautiful rendition Harvey's vocals are amazing on this track it just kind of reminds me just how much I would love to hear just more bear sort of up front folk music like this on whatever her next record is going to be her last album to me just kind of felt a little too washed out a little too distant to kind of hear her in this very upfront naked intimate setting was so much more pleasing for me moving on from there ought have a new track a new single out desire every single song from their forthcoming album in my opinion has been amazing and I'm just loving the kind of low-key very somber tone of the instrumental on this track and the weird weird vocalizations throughout the track the vocals on this thing are strange to put it bluntly but they're still like like a real moodiness and sadness and almost like a kind of a tortured kind of vibe coming out of the the weird kacal contortions being performed throughout this track and the more I look at this album cover the maar I'm just enamored with it like I know it doesn't seem like too much but just like the weird brushstrokes and the way that everything kind of like folds on top of itself like it's it's very um it's very intriguing to me I'm really looking forward to this odd album I think it could end up being their best project yet and if you guys didn't know they are kind of like a art rock post-punk band from Canada just kind of give you a bit more Brack background their last album was one of my favorites of the year when it came out moving on from there from terrible records this project is titled Krauss and the song I'm referencing here is titled reach new album on the way loving the kind of poppy shoegazing aesthetic on this track quite a bit the vocals aren't quite as original or memorable as I would like personally but the production is quite nice and I again really kind of attains that shoegaze sound very well while very clearly sitting kind of in the modern the very digital age I'm kind of loving uh just the production and and the sonic aesthetic of this thing it's very pretty it's very intoxicating it's very envelope England loving the textures on this thing quite a bit and the hooks not bad either you know it's a pretty catchy tune moving on from there idk who last year his his last album I just thought was not as great as some people were hyping it up to me you know it just it just felt like it drowned in his influences just a bit too much however this new track of his over here while the instrumental is a little bare it's a little skeletal it does hit hard his voice to me is a bit more animated and a bit more memorable than it was on a lot of tracks from his last record and the Denzel curry thing on this thing is fucking awesome so definitely give this new single of his a shot looking forward to him kind of trying to do a lot bigger in 2018 because it seemed like while he was kind of not coming through with with as much memorable material enough that really kind of hit me as being distinct on his last project it did seem like he had a lot of ambitions there you know he was trying to make something that meant something he was trying to say something bigger than himself he wasn't just trying to make some dumb dumb down record you know so it seems like he's advancing with this new single over here so moving on from there block boy JB featuring Drake look alive so this is the music video everybody's been talking about for the past week because Drake showed up to the music video shoot he paid for a bunch of people's groceries it was at a high school so on and so forth and so I've been waiting to hear this song because a lot of people been talking about it and the track is fucking awesome like it is such a banger it is so smooth it is so low-key the hook is amazing Drake's contribution is great the music video is actually very well put together block boy JB who I've never listened to prior to this track I don't know he's just got a lot of swagger a lot of charisma on the cut really to me it's it's kind of Drake that ends up selling the song though and in the hook as well but still man great production great hook great energy it's kind of got that low key but very very very like ear wormy sort of trap aesthetic to it you know as much as I harp on this and and I bring up that you know we're potentially at the peak the peak saturation of the genre every once in a while I hear were a super fucking fresh track and this is definitely one of them this is definitely an example of that at least to me at least I mean maybe some of you guys are gonna hear and just think whatever but honestly like this could be one of my favorite rap singles of the year I'll say that I'll say that and we're still in February we're still in February and this is the last one I think that we're gonna be talking about here yes ash Cuccia electronic music producer who I've talked about before on the channel a few times last year I believe he dropped like a visual project that I didn't end up reviewing but if you did not hear about that please do make the effort to go check that out he has a new track out titled earth which is linked down there in the description box this track to me is one of his more interesting piece of music in a while because he's really kind of going back to that strange glitchy very weird otherworldly vibe that I loved hearing in his music in the first place but I feel like he's advanced in you know and it's stranger and a bit more kind of avant-garde direction very cool very intense at points and I I guess a very obtuse in a way but uh but still kind of visceral still very gratifying instantly because the noises just hit you very hard very brightly initially whoa what is going on here what is it going on what is happening to my brain and guys that is going to be it for the weekly track roundup remember once again our amazon and our turntable lab associate links are down there in the description box hopefully you got turned on to some good stuff in this edition of the weekly track roundup and i'll see you in the next one see you in the next review see you in the next video I love you uh forever 
DpXe5kbKVtM,[Music] hey everyone the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tribulation album down below tribulation is a Swedish metal band this is their fourth full-length album last time I was talking about these guys it was 2015 with their record children of the night the children of the night quite quite a spooky album title to me that album was a very solid very above-average metal record even if I thought the band's style across the entire album was a little OneNote tribulation has a very solid sound they blend in a kind of unique fashion some blackened gothic metal with some subtle nods to heavy metal too the vocals are a little run-of-the-mill kind of standard black metal wretches which most of the time come off more theatrical than abrasive their instrumentation always ran a little bland for me as well however it was really about the the beautifully eerie songs that the band would spin tribulation just has this knack for wonderfully harmonious metal songs with a great sense of melody but on this new album over here that instrumentation is elevated a bit with some bells and whistles occasionally on this record the band shifts the guitars vocals and drums into some pretty cinematic instrumentation like at the finish of the 7-minute here be dragons which features the speedy plinky arpeggio melodies could be a glockenspiel not entirely sure either way it sounds like something out of a John Carpenter movie and the song cries from the underworld has some of the most beautiful guitar embellishments on the entire record some pretty refined pianos really brings that gothic feel makes me want to light up my fucking candelabra but I don't own one so I'm going to settle for my st. Anthony Fantana candle yeah this is real what the hell is it - you gotta do a quick I don't like candles that often there we go got that sucker you guys should should pray that I and I don't give your favorite album the six alright there you go so there are some fantastic little extra instrumental bits on this album however in my opinion in some ways they are too few and far between or at least they're not changing up the band's core sound so much that this album feels refreshing enough for me because for me down below feels like a second helping of these somewhat more condensed sound that the band was bringing on their last album sure there are some extra creepy instrumental bits on here like purgatory Oh which is a pretty nice instrumental breather in the middle of the album and I love the soaring horror movie sense that pull off a fantastic solo and fill up some of the instrumental gaps in the second half of the song lacrimosa there's a bit of a gothic piano send-off that brings the track to a close - but for the most part the band still writes and performs in this kind of mild very mid paced very melodic black metal style and this album does feature at least some of the group's weakest material to date between the galloping bee and the sweet and noodley guitar leads that play throughout much of the song the world has to be the most drab song the band is recorded ever and what is the mixing on this track the guitars don't feel that powerful and the vocals are barely audible I feel like the mixing leaves a lot to be desired on the closing track - you know they're just some spots on this thing where I just wish the performances the way they played these songs was a bit more wild and animalistic maybe a little out of control still though I can't complain too much because the bands reserved approach to performance and writing is not the worst thing in the world it's always nice to get a contemporary metal band that emphasizes songwriting and and melody over pure rage and while the the style of the songs on this album do feel very very similar to that of their last record I will say the tunes here are a bit more ambitiously structured thanks to this influx of extra instrumentation with the band building a lot of these songs out with some very beautiful and gothic guitar solos and piano passages the end result being that the songs on this thing feel grand dramatic occasionally epic and truth be told this is most likely going to be one of the better gothic metal records you're gonna hear this year there are certainly more hits than misses on this thing I just can't help but feel that even though I like this band sound generally and I like a lot of their songs generally there's kind of that extra excitement or spark that isn't quite there whether it be coming from I don't know a lack of uniqueness in their sound or just a lack of energy or electricity in the way that they perform these tracks just this nagging feeling that while what I'm hearing here is good that the band is just capable of so much more I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts click on the video next to my head or the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana forever 
rz7KzrrAbzo,hi everyone Joe Biden has issues with personal space here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new tiny moving parts album swell as far as I can tell this is pretty much the sixth full-length album from this Minnesota band that has been one of the more consistent emo bands of the past ten years or so they dropped their debut record I think shortly after the genre kind of crested after a very high point of a mainstream appeal in the 2000s and despite emos relative lack of new and refreshing ideas the genre is still going pretty strong with a healthy dose of releases dropping every year in the genre from the likes of Tigers Jaw and Sorority noise and modern baseball the world is a beautiful place and of course mom jeans some bands that have been hugely influential in the genre had made some somewhat huge comebacks over the past few years American football brand-new and this decade there's been a handful of releases in the genre that I've truly enjoyed especially on the more screamo side of things like La Dispute & touche amore or the incredibly catchy adventures and the scene has also been pretty integral in fostering personal favorites of mine such as crying so yeah I know I get this reputation for just hating emo and hating anything that emo has to offer and and and spoiler alert this review isn't really gonna do much to change but I thought I would talk about this record given that TMP is one of these genres more popular bands right now and the band's previous records while not being entirely original are actually not that bad one album like be very raw and maffei this couch is full of friendship definitely stood out to me and their previous record celebrate while not as fine tuned and produced as this latest album over here stood out to me for its catchy songwriting the tracks on this thing we're a pretty anthemic very pop punky however swell has to be one of the blandest and most creatively bankrupt records the band's come through with yet at least previous records from this same band had but more grit to them by comparison swell feel so much more oversaturated just kind of adding the occasional shot of horns or strings or keyboards in an attempt to I guess make the band's incredibly stale sound come off as refreshing and what is making the sound stale it is the tired formula of dramatically played pop punk rhythm guitars and then of course we have these clean lead guitars pulling off these melodically meaningless math rock licks lots of whiny shouty lead vocals that are just kind of going through the motions of the emo blueprint vocals that I would not be able to pick out of a lineup to save my life literally if it was a life or death situation I I would I would be dead accurately picking out the singer of this band the best thing about these tracks consistently is the drumming which is usually pretty tight pretty expressive but the production on this thing is so needlessly dense that what intricacies the drumming is bringing to the table end up being a little buried buried by the sheer lack of imagination coming out of everything placed on top of them especially the lyrics on this thing which are mostly just a faux poetic display of all of the tropes that we've heard in many an emo record to come with all of these hyper emotional poor trails of breathing and suffocating coming back or leaving or waking up or not waking up love and emotional numbness as well as an acute awareness of particular parts of the human anatomy at given points of particular songs throughout the record my heart this my brain that I mean some of the lyrics on this thing are actually a little difficult to read through you are caffeine in my bloodstream you are the energy hidden in between two muscles sleeping please don't wake me up occasionally the lyrics on this thing are as uninspired and is grating as the music itself on this record I guess I can say generally the performances on this record are pretty tight and the production is pretty clean if not again just a little overloaded and I guess the band structures some of its songs ambitiously but essentially what these structures build up to is just a very trite portrayal of the emo sound which to my ear seems to be getting more homogenized by the year being propagated with the exact kinds of math Rock nods and vocal styles and I guess pedestrian lyrics that you'll find on this very record I guess don't let the overabundance of emotion displayed on this album fool you because truly from an artistic standpoint it's it's pretty uninspired I'm feeling a light too decent for on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit that like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another review you can check out hit that up

3DEtgItwWt0,[Music] hi everyone smell that nice Melton oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new no age album snares like a haircut this is the latest full-length album from West Coast noise rock and noise pop duo no age it's kind of weird to think that I've been listening to and have been aware of this band for like ten years now since they made a giant splash on the indie scene back in 2008 with their debut album on Sub Pop Records nouns which is still one of my favorite contemporary sub pop releases you know know age is often cast off as like this flavor of the month indie band but I honestly think that there are a lot of interesting ideas that turn up on their records I love the foundational elements of indie rock and punk that go into the band's songs and I love the layered glistening noisy and psychedelic sounds they enhance those songs with it's a sound and it's a style that to me really runs back to the roots of shoegaze but there's something very modern and digital about it the issue for me though with no age is that I feel like the duo has had a hard time finding their footing musically ever since they dropped that record their follow-up everything in between in a lot of ways to me felt like a watered down version of everything I enjoyed in the duo's music meanwhile they totally turned left with an object and delivered this record that was so abstract solo Phi so weird in a lot of ways it was too messy for its own good and the whole thing just fell I don't know bogged down in concept to the point where the songs and the sound of this thing suffered snares like a haircut though feels like some of the sounds and aesthetics of that nouns era are returning of course on this thing you're getting all these shouty vocals and punky guitar riffs and drum beats and they're just being smothered in all of these textures textures that are spacious and fuzzy and trippy occasionally otherworldly especially on the more instrumental and abstract moments on this thing like the title track where you get all of these cycling percussive taps and all these droning shimmering guitar tones just ringing out aimlessly it's not high impact or anything but it is very beautiful to listen to and it does make for a nice intermission in the middle of the record and sonically it's certainly more interesting than a lot of the material that's been on the duo's past few records and the song third grade wave if not for the rolling drumbeats playing throughout the track this thing would pretty much be like a messy sax guitar New Age improvisation but these are kind of the weirder spots on the record a majority of the cuts here are actually like pretty sturdy rock tracks with a lot of interesting sound play but no age does a good job of expanding the repertoire a bit beyond the scope of Indian Punk the song squashed is a bit of an art rock tune that to my ears feel sort of indebted to the early days of the Velvet Underground the abstract lyrics the intimate vocals the kind of very low-key and very lovely guitar tones all playing against these pulsating percussion samples and primitive plus is a pretty sweet neo psychedelic track with Dean sponge vocals kind of sitting at the middle of this sonic universe with all these crazy ambient beautiful guitar tones kind of just like orbiting around him it's very experimental send-off for the album and I love the way the track transitions into like a low five version of everything that you've been hearing previously it sounds like you're listening back to the exact song you've been hearing but played on a tape out of like a really dirty speaker however though a majority of tracks on this thing do kind of feel like your typical no age affair I guess maybe though with a bit more sonic boom even if some of the layering on this thing does fall kind of flat I'm talking about tracks like cruise control and soft collar fad as well as the track title to a degree and I will say Dean sponge kind of bratty shouty lead vocals that they do tend to get a little tedious after a while they're kind of limiting although there are a few cuts here where he kind of goes beyond that a bit like on send me which is probably one of the duo's most I guess vulnerable tracks one of their most ballad like tracks the song has a real rush of emotions coming off the vocals as well as the very the crescendo of tones that kind of swell along with the song as it transitions from one section to the next and secrets swap despite it being one of the more aggressive cuts on the album is easily one of the more melodic songs on this thing to popper has a pretty strong hook as well I've got a lot to offer I don't think I should bother still though if anything is holding this album back a bit I do think it is the tunes some of which are just kind of okay or just really to be expected given what I've heard from no age so far however though I do think there are a great deal of moments where the band does push themselves outside of their comfort zone here and the results are mostly positive they do seem to up the ante a bit on the sound play and that's certainly a good thing I guess I'm just happy to hear what sounds like no age being back on the ball a little bit as it is right here I could easily recommend this record to anybody looking for a visceral rock album with some interesting production choices that's kind of trippy tight performances very sound rich I'm feeling a lay seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best or the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is a another

gPdD04_9A9A,hi everyone here theny here tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new rich Bryan album amen la vía jakarta rapper rich Brian this is debut album for the 88 rising Records label which is actually a pretty great label that has been making a lot of waves over the past few years kind of working as a crowbar opening up the hip-hop industry to a lot of artists from the far east brian is easily one of the most popular artists on the label kind of one of their flagship artists and you can kind of put his meteoric rise to fame on the shoulders of one of his earliest singles debts tick a track he dropped two years ago a song that was released before he had even turned 18 and looking back on it it's not hard to see why the track has seen and continues to see such viral success brian's deep husky voice his cold-blooded flow the very heavy and hypnotic production he had some slick lines in there too and also a very unique scent sense of fashion which was observed in the video now ever since Brian saw success with this track it's pretty much just been like a marathon of singles some of which have featured the likes of 21 Savage and Joe G Chris whoo xxx 10 Tasi own and Keith Ape and toward the build-up of this album I was pretty excited for it definitely one of my most anticipated records of the year because I felt Brian was bringing a much-needed breath of fresh air into contemporary rap music which increasingly every month seems to get more homogenized with the sounds of trap and triplet flows but unfortunately this album isn't really changing much up this album does have its high points it does but unfortunately I think it also shows Brian having difficulty coming into his own building on the sound we already know him for and kind of stepping out of the shadow of death stick because the best songs and most memorable and most enjoyable songs on this thing kind of have that same vibe I'm talking enemies and occupied and trespass just to name a few all of which feature that have but also kind of minimal production those cold steady flows Brian's deep kind of monotone delivery the song Kitty also stood out to me to as a highlight because it's kind of the album's lone strong narrative a song that sounds like it's about Brian losing his virginity there's a lot of comedic moments throughout the track but for the most part I just kind of find Brian's pen game on this thing just a little underwhelming because there are a lot of moments on here right I don't think he's writing absolute garbage lines or anything but I think what he's saying doesn't come off quite as as slick as he might have liked it to like on the intro track saying that he's a rapper but his name isn't chance also on the song cold I don't take drugs I just take naps find another girl to eat up like I ate snacks also there's a barn here talking about how he doesn't do triplet flows because he's not amigo or on the song occupied when I'm doing business better stay the fuck away make me blow it like a microwave the lines on this thing that stick out for the wrong reasons they're kind of few and far between however I don't think there are enough lines on this thing that stick out for the right reasons too few moments on this record where I'm kind of hit with a bar I'm just like damn he said that he said that just generally a severe lack of quotables on this thing but I will say throughout this record I do appreciate these small and subtle references he peppers through some tracks where he is talking about his life before music his upbringing his family his personality his quirks all these things that make him a special artist and a special figure in the rap game right now as far as his flow and his style go on this thing I don't necessarily mind a rapper who plays this super low-key I've enjoyed records from rock marciano and evidence who has a new album out that you should hear also quali Chris or kah but if that's the direction you're gonna take things in like the lyrics really have to hit or you have to have some kind of eccentric quality to yourself or the instrumentation that really kind of sells the track and makes the very subtle approach that you're pulling people in with worth it because Brian's very deep monotone flow do get kind of tedious after a while because he doesn't change it up that often if at all I mean there are a handful of cuts on here that are smoother more melodic more mellow like be song introvert featuring Joji who provides a nice feature on that track we also have the song Arizona with August Oh 8 which has a kind of awkward beef switch and ending and then there's little prince with Nicki but while all these tracks are pleasant to listen to they're fine are they highlights are they some of the best tracks on the album I don't think so I don't really think these songs do much outside of just provide a little bit of variation along the track listing just to break up some of the harder and darker and more aggressive spots on this thing so that it's not so uniform for the most part this album is listenable but it's very middle-of-the-road it has very little in the way of surprises and if Brian is going to successfully transition from being a singles artist to being an album or a mixtape artist he's gonna have to provide more in the way of ideas and versatility because even though this thing was 44 minutes long which is not really that long of an album I already felt halfway through that I had pretty much heard everything he was going to offer on this thing I will say though the production on this thing is a little bit more dope than average like it's it's just a bit more colourful and quirky than your average low-key track banger and Brian is still showing more character and personality than a lot of his contemporaries in his age range in the rap game right now I definitely know a rich Brian song when I hear one but currently as his sound stands he's dropping a lot of tracks that to me feel kind of under written and kind of one-dimensional I'm feeling a light decent six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a

tKHC0X2EwAs,hi everyone read the name flan ello here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Justin Timberlake album man of the woods singer entertainer boy band veteran pop superstar mr. Justin Timberlake he has now released his long-awaited follow-up to the critically acclaimed 20/20 experience back in 2013 and in the five years since the release of that album justin has drawn up pretty much a top-to-bottom but somewhat conflicted reinvention for this new record something that's pretty much signaled on the front cover of this thing depicting Justin being torn between like two different worlds two different selves and on this thing Justin so to speak is going back to his roots his southern heritage as the sounds of folk and country music kind of run throughout this thing while also trying to keep afoot in the world of contemporary pop which kind of sounds like a bold idea considering the current states of pop music and country music but there are only actually a handful of moments on this thing where I think bringing these two worlds together actually works while Justin still has some very sturdy vocal chops and everybody probably went into this thing expecting good things given that The Neptunes handle a bulk of the production here this album aesthetically is pretty much a mess right from the start the start being the song filthy which is the worst attempt at making a seductive pop song that I've heard in a while like what about this song is sexy is it Justin's corny lyrics is it the weak vocal mixing where Justin doesn't even really sound like the focal point in his own song is it the corny wobbling dubstep bass that plays throughout most of the track which there's also an actual bassline to which is kind of redundant of course all this instrumentation clashes with the grand instrumental swell that sort of kicks the song off and occurs around the bridge of the track the song sauce on this thing a little while later sounds like a really awful character of funk music like hey just get like a peppy beat and some cartoony silly kooky guitar licks and a fuzzy bassline and that's just that's just funk isn't it that's just funk it kind of sounds like I'm listening to Pharrell like the worst print song ever and it gets worse on the title track to this thing that's where the country influences on this record really start to surface and even though I like the rootsy vocal harmonies in the quaint lyrics on this track of course the song is backed with this very round rubbery bouncy sub bass which turns up everywhere on this album even when it is not entirely appropriate like I get that this is pretty much Pharrell sound and it typically works really well in his own music and in in any Rd track it sounds terrible set to country music the song wave literally sounds like a trap folk combination not only does the instrumentation sound ridiculous but on top of that at this point on the record everything has been jumping around stylistically so much it feels like I'm listening to a ween album but without like I don't know the good songwriting or the the sense of humor the song supplies has a much more contemporary sound no weird fusions of anything but where the track really gets me is in its themes and in its lyrics it seems like the whole purpose of the song is to test the hypothesis of I wouldn't date you if you were the last man on earth because literally Justin uses the end of the world is like a seduction scenario on this thing I'll be the generator turn me on when you need electricity I'll be the wood when you need heat when goes down I'll be the one with the level head I've got supplies yo girl I'm a doomsday prepper I'm a doomsday prepper does that turn you on I want to show you the inside of my bunker girl I got 10 months worth of water down there I get the desire to want to be a provider in a loving relationship but Justin takes it to a level on this track where it's really creepy and it's really controlling now I want to know everything don't leave a single detail out I'll get my lighter just fell out it makes me a generous lover doing something for someone just to get something out of them that's not that's not generosity generosity is not hey you're either with me or you freeze to death the hers interlude is a little weird cloying piano D tour featuring spoken-word vocals from Jessica Biel where she's kind of room to sizing the idea of a woman wearing her man's shirt which hey you know that's fine it's cute I get that it's comfortable it's it's bigger it's baggy err but she's saying stuff like it feels like it's Armour it feels like I'm wearing his skin it's like a buffalo bill type situation it puts the lotion on it puts the lotion on no no one actually thinks this no one actually thinks any of this and of course all of this builds up to the song flannel on the album here's my flannel which is actually a pretty sweet and folky tune I like the songwriting in the song a lot the very nice Simon and Garfunkel s vocal harmonies are sweet on the ears but why is there like trap style production quietly twittering away in the background underneath Justin's vocals and the acoustic guitars it literally doesn't fit aesthetically it sounds like crap what's even weirder is the song's ending because the track just kind of suddenly shifts into this abstract spacious experimental sound piece that feels like one at Rick's point never collaborating with Laurie Anderson yeah it's it's that far out it's that out of place and it is that far removed from the song that preceded it again it just sort of goes to show that this album is like a buffet of the way all the genres on this record come together it's like the equivalency of I don't know some barbecued wings green jello spaghetti and meatballs guacamole and then fried wontons all in the same friggin plate but seriously why do we need 808 drums and bouncy sub bass on every single track almost God just record a country song just record a full ballad and leave it at that thankfully toward the back end of the record there are songs that don't feature quite as much of that the album gets relatively more solid the song Montana is likely my favorite track of the entire album it's pretty much a nocturnal sexy groovin synth funk track and it's one of the few moments on the album where the electronic instrumentation and the acoustic instrumentation comes together pretty nicely that the song hard stuff which is a moment on the record where it feels like all the instrumentation it's coming together synthetically but the textures are there and they feel a bit root seer and the balladry isn't overshadowed by just how garish the beets are and the lyrics of this track are pretty endearing about just wanting to be in a love in a relationship where you're there for the hard stuff you're going through the tougher moments certainly less generic and overly sentimental than the track you did with Alicia Keys on this thing which I mean the lyrics are so general on here I mean how could anybody really walk away from this track being impressed with it as a love song that's not to say that it's not one of the better tracks on the record though like it's much more listenable than some of the other cuts on here and Alicia Keys and Chris staple then actually do provide some great vocal moments on the album that are kind of refreshing after enduring the the very rough first leg of this thing we also have the song breeze off the pond which is pleasant it's listenable it kind of feels like an old-school Michael Jackson song but the lyrics are not substantive at all like Justin spent the afternoon outside and was like well I got to write a song about the grass and the trees and the pond and the wind it's like I guess what would happen if Michael Jackson had to force a collaboration with Phil elrom or something there's literally appointing the lyrics for Justin references going canoeing while high so I guess being stoned in a canoe all day in the wilderness this is pretty much the inspiration you're gonna walk away with sparkly waves dude the waves then you have some like really ridiculous displays of macho naturalism on the track living off the land justin singing on this track like he's some kind of like farmer like frontiersman or a mountain man of course that there are moments on the on the track that feature the 808 bass and and and percussion again all those 49ers back in the day all those guys panning for gold they were the real trappers they were the real oh geez guides I'm not gonna keep beating a dead horse here like the album is a mess it's really weird to think that professionals assembled this and at no point did they think that like wow these sounds they they really don't complement each other that well that they really don't go together I mean I'm sure Justin and Pharrell to a degree were aware that what they were doing here was a little unorthodox and maybe they were just like throwing crap at the wall and just seeing hey you know maybe it'll stick because you never know what's gonna be a hit you never know what the audience is gonna take - and occasionally on this album it does kind of work I feel like there are at least a few high points on here Montana again love that track hard stuff I think is really good also I like midnight summer jam which is one of the only moments on the album where I can hear Justin I can hear the Michael Jackson influence I can hear the Pharrell production I can hear the country vibes coming off of the acoustic instrumentation and the fiddles it feels very pop it feels very contemporary a lot of different things and influences going on at once and yet it's all coming together pretty harmoniously it's not really canceling itself out it almost feels like a song that in a lot of ways could have been on the 20/20 experience but it's got that country flare to it so it's a little different and in a way I feel like Justin and Pharrell are a more natural combination of artists than Justin and Timbaland because Pharrell's production to me is a little bit sexier a little bit groovier however if Justin was ever gonna work with Pharrell on an album this was the wrong album to do it on like the album where you go folk the album where you go country that's the record where you want to team up with Pharrell really seriously there are a few other tracks on here that I would say are pretty listable or Pleasant the song higher higher for sure but songs on here that are tolerable songs on here that are good are in the vast minority most of this album sounds incredibly off incredibly corny bordering on ridiculous or just straight ridiculous I'm feeling a strong three on this thing transition

gmlOJPAQHAE,okay okay okay everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and would be the worst tracks of the week oh all right let's get into it of course after shouting out down in the description box we have our Amazon and turntable lab associate links treat yourself down there if you feel like it and let's get right down to the worst tracks of the week what were the tracks that that felt worse to me the tracks that entertained me the least let's kick it off with this brand-new cut off of the Black Panther soundtrack featuring the weakened and Kendrick Lamar the song is prey for me I'm actually pretty excited to see this movie I do want to see this movie very soon does look like one of the better action movies and comic book films to come out in a while seems like there's a lot of hype around it and I kind of am interested in reviewing the soundtrack considering that it's curated by TDE and there's you know obviously a lot of TDE artists on there a lot of original material so could make an interesting topic of discussion or a video but not not really caring for this new track over here featuring the weekend in Kendrick Lamar it just seems super promotional it just seems super commissioned for a film you know not not quite as bad as a lot of the total junk that was on that last Fast and the Furious soundtrack with the yachty tracks and the migos tracks that that was just hot garbage this track is at least listenable but it's certainly over produced you can tell with the way that the lyrics are written like they have the movie in mind and we have to write something that's gonna fit with the movie and it just seems again super super professional super promotional suits super focus group I don't I don't care for it that much it's it's not nearly as interesting or as riveting as the music Kendrick and The Weeknd make when when they're not writing for a film soundtrack I'll say that much and also eggy Azalea has a new track out featuring quavo it's it's rough it's it's really rough it's maybe one of the roughest listens that she has put fans through in a while and and I guess the more I look at this the more I'm just the TV the static the neon circle behind her I just don't I don't get it it's it's just really strange single art but it's it's a horrendous song like really weak vocals the quavo feature isn't even really that good the me goes really will turn up anywhere for a check it seems even on an Iggy Azalea track alright let's get into the tracks I thought were men this week not amazing but certainly worth shouting out certainly worth pointing out your attention to pointing out to your attention pointing your attention to making your attention on it can't can't even talk to him totally fried stayed up last night going to brock hampton concert so i'm totally fried today alright new track from the streets Mike Skinner the track is titled if you ever need to talk I'm here and it brings back a lot of the very poetic very thoughtful lyricism that Mike was known for in the salad days of the streets however the beat and the pacing of this track is really awkward in my opinion not really the passionate head-bobbing impassioned and and I guess fiery sound that I typically enjoy from the project it's sort of borders more on just like I don't know like a spoken word a bit I guess but there's just like kind of a beat pulsating away in the background I am excited that mike is is back at it but I feel like I'm going to need something just a bit more captivating musically if we're if we're gonna move up from here but it's it's okay it's it's alright and a lot of lyrics on the track are really good a lot of his wordplay is really good so I mean I guess if you're looking for some hip-hop that isn't quite that visceral is more of a an introspective and somewhat stripped-back poetic experience give the track a shot new street sex 7-inch coming out very soon street sex in my opinion is one of the best things to happen to modern industrial music this new track overhears is okay I feel like they're still kind of trying to find their footing at the moment working in some of these darker more post-punk II more gothy more melodic elements into the very abrasive and noisy sound that they are known for and I'm just looking forward to seeing where they are gonna be taking things on their next album considering what they've been doing on this new 7-inch what they've been doing on their last EP I definitely try this track out if you've been listening to anything they have done so far and do not miss out on the band's album end position really excellent record one of my favorite albums of the year Newmark kozilek marked kazlik has two albums count'em two already scheduled for release in 2018 the first of which is going to be a Sun Kil moon album and it's going to be titled after Mark kozilek so Sun Kil moon mark cosmic and and the album so far with these two new tracks it's really kind of living up to the the title the title of the album being and not the title of the album but the title of the songs here being this is my town and my love for you is undying Austin did a great write-up for these two tracks which is linked down below in the description box check that out look at that because you know Austin is patrician you know he's Chad you know Austin is Chad but anyway the tracks are pretty cool mark cause like taking things in a very stripped-back direction but while playing electric guitar and of course you had those very strong very long drawn-out ongoing narrative elements playing throughout the songs on this thing it's again he gives you a very mark kozilek album it's or at least a couple of tracks the the more I listened to his newer material and the more that I feel like mark goes down this road the more I feel like Mark kozilek isn't so much a person but it's really kind of like becoming a music style and it's becoming like a state of being I'll say that much I'll say that much that's that's what that's what these songs make me think of when end up thinking of mark playing these tracks putting these stories together on these songs and basically like doing his best as he continues to embody mark kozilek the the in the abstract the idea of mark Koz like because I feel like he's mighty he might even not even be there yet entirely he still might have some ways to go moving on from their new edge Schrader's music beat track with Dan Deacon on production apparently the entire record is produced by Dan Deacon and it has added this very experimental interesting and full sound to the once very stripped back aesthetic of Edge Schrader's music beats music and the the track over here that I wanted to tell you guys about is titled riddles the vocals are a little too obscured in my opinion not quite as upfront as the last track that dropped that I thought was really amazing but uh but still you know good song all around had a lot of good qualities to it and of course with Dan deacons production on there there's some really cool almost like classical ish arpeggios kind of a twittering away in the background that I thought were really great new church's song get out it's okay just kind of sounds like your average church's track but somehow even more like watered down than usual I mean it's certainly listenable but I don't know I've never really felt like church's music was that interesting was that unique or I guess I guess memorable and I feel like that's even less so the case on this new track over here get out a chromeo it's a decent new single bedroom calling featuring the dream although I feel like saying featuring the dream is almost like a little too not generous because the dream really dominates much of the track it really does kind of feel like a song the dream did but Chromeo just like did production or like backing instrumentation and I mean I guess it's not a bad move because it is superior to the previous single so I don't know I like it but honestly at this point I'm still not expecting that much of this new chromeo record you know they're still doing the synth funk thing they're still carrying that torch and with this new track over here you know they're doing a good job of it but I feel like that's only partially because the dream really kind of makes the song really really kind of makes the track but I'll reserve full judgement from when I hear the the entire album I guess Andrew W K he's back again with another single the track is titled ever again and it's it's alright it's it's a little corny at points it's a little too much is a little too over-the-top at points but that's totally Andrews bag that's totally a style that's totally a thing the Millenial was on here with we're kind of obnoxious but then again like a lot of these elements that he's playing with in his music like he's been doing this stuff for years it makes me think like wow like maybe Andrew W K was like ahead of the curve on all of this super glitzy overproduced just super cheery super anthemic rock music because i feel like you know you can't be a rock band right now with at least like trying to you know pay pay pay homage to you know like and imagine dragons or something like you have to try to write the most like overproduced glitzy glamorous just like super epic super like this is so important this is so significant song and it's like Jesus Christ give me give me a break give me a break right now I need a break break me off a piece of the KitKat bar thank you thank you that was a very avant-garde word piece that I just came up with right now thank you but it's it's a decent track you know I I think if this song ends up growing on me it's gonna be in the context of the record when I'm just kind of like sunk into the the cheesiness of Andrews music when I'm really kind of filling the full experience of that the song may in fact grow on me alright let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best this week really kind of impressed me right from the get-go new unknown Mortal Orchestra track American guilts new project on the way pretty excited for it loved the last album a lot of the recording sort of quirks and production quirks on that record were really interesting and creative and I feel like that is kind of shaping up to be the case with this new single over here as well very low five very grimy but the riffs are great vocals super compelling songwriting is they're very catchy very textured very gutsy and I just feel like a unknown Mortal Orchestra they're just maturing very nicely they kind of went from this like very ho-hum sort of lo-fi indie psyche bubblegum project with funky drumbeats to something that's like really actually legitimately I would say envelope-pushing you know as interesting a psych group as like let's say king gizzard you know maybe not as prolific but certainly uh certainly putting out some interesting stuff moving on from there oh this new track from let's eat grandma hot pink production from Sophie on this one this kind of pushes it into that bubblegum based that super ultra experimental futuristic pop sound that we know from the PC music camp loving the track Sophie's production is amazing and the vocals on this thing are very playful and snotty and silly and absurd just really liking the song overall and just kind of excited to hear more music like this in the future I feel like pops music pops future it's it's it's very it's very bright right now with with totally eccentric artists out there totally killing it right now like this moving on from there new julia halter song new Adult Swim single love this track quite a bit easily one of her warmest and dreamiest and most enveloping songs that I've heard her put out in a while actually kind of hoping like that there's a Julia halter album very soon her last record was amazing and one of my favorite records of the year amazing dream pop record I would say even like progressive pop to an extent chamber pop to an extent excellent excellent album still to this day I have beautiful dreams of how luscious and airy and and gorgeous that record sounds and Joey badass has put out an official studio version of his wonderful Prince Flip thugs cry which he did thanks to the good people over at Triple J make sure to give that a listen if you haven't it's a very excellent sort of revision rendition whatever you want to call it and Jameson has a new track out the song is titled so badly and goddamn this is this is like one of the best songs he's put out in a while and the production on this track is huge and the extra layered instrumentation is quite nice I feel like he's completely transitioned out of the early phases of his career where he was mostly just kind of doing a very generic very atmospheric and moody and Spacey alternative R&B thing and with the last record the instrumentation got so much more tangible and and just dry and funky and just uh I guess groovy and it felt so much more in touch you know and so much less trendy like it felt like it was doing its own thing it was on its own path but the record ultimately just felt a little one-dimensional like a little say me in parts but uh this new track over here is like one of the biggest songs has ever written one of the most beautiful like love ish kind of anthems he's ever written and loved the vocal performances loving just kind of the way that they're sunk into this grand presentation of sound nice production on the track overall and I don't know just kind of hoping for a great Jameson album that's going to turn some heads very soon and kind of really introduce and get people excited too and buy this this next phase of his career his um I guess discography blueprint alles bag new track out from a West Coast punk scene vet who's worked previously I wasn't really that aware of I caught this track over on Stereogum and it is an ass like punky power pop track great chorus awesome guitar leads fantastic lead vocals I am actually kind of a disappointed I didn't know much of Alice's work in the past because her singing and her performance on this track is really great and I feel like with with age she has sort of really come into this deep authoritative powerful and womanly voice that has a lot of personality to it and you know it's it's you know it only adds to the beauty and the entertainment value of this song that the the tune of the track is so friggin good and the track being titled them turn it up and it's this nice fun rockin totally sing along punky track that I really can't say enough good things about make sure to try this track out very fun very gutsy and looking forward to the release of this thing on a Don Giovanni Don Giovanni they're kindled they're killing it lately they're killin alele and finally the song that I want to mention last track in the best tracks of the week section is this new Albert Hammond Jr song is a new project on the way titled Frances trouble and the song is titled muted beatings the structure of this track is really friggin weird it's really friggin experimental like there's fast punky ER moments they're slower spots that are kind of emotionally captivating that I thought were pretty nice I didn't know Albert hadn't in them you know I'd heard material from him in the past I thought was kind of rough around the edges truth be told not every solo sort of side project from a lot of these dudes from The Strokes has been that great over the years you know there's only like a couple of handful of money there's only like a handful of moments that I could think of where I've been like genuinely impressed by like some strokes side project or solo material you know like that little joy album I thought was really good last voids album I thought was very good and really that's kind of about it but Albert Hammond I think is doing pretty well on this track over here and looking forward to this new album even if a lot of people don't really seem to take to this track at least I'm intrigued and I'm going to leave it at that everybody that is gonna be that that is the weekly track roundup hopefully I turn you guys on to some good music some good cuts remember our associate links are down there in the description and all of the songs I mentioned in this video are down there in the description too hopefully you got some good recommendations hopefully you guys turned onto some good stuff in this one I'll see you guys in the next video Anthony Fantana best boy Benson's one direction forever 
tMgNfu4-wgw,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd going to do a kind of raw quick review here of the Gucci Mane project that ended out 2017 Elgato the human glacier gucci mane southern rapper like southern rap legend at this point kind of like a hip-hop folk hero I loved how at one point shortly before and after he sort of did a bit of time in prison his most recent bid in prison it seemed like his career as far as relevancy in popularity was kind of at a low point and as soon as he came back out it was like whoa reset button revitalization he like came out totally anew and it feels like everybody is really loving and appreciating and just really excited for the new Gucci Mane because it seems like artistically and personally he's really turned a new leaf and while I haven't found a lot of his new material super riveting except for maybe the drop-top wop project that he did not too long ago he does sound like he's got a lot more I guess clarity to his thoughts to his lyrics to his motivations on a track his songs just seem a little bit more direct and punchy not quite as I guess sort of drugged out and kind of a I don't know a little wobbly in a way especially when it comes to his vocal performances and sure while he does sound like he's got a bit more composure on the mic it hasn't necessarily led to a whole lot of projects that have been exciting from front to back especially with that recent mr. Davis album he dropped which was probably the most overloaded thing that he's released since he got out however this is one of those rare moments in Gucci Mane's ever-growing discography that he's always always always adding to every several months or so where the tracklist is super tight these songs are pretty direct and straightforward he goes back he rewinds a little bit because while he's sort of very much out of the lifestyle it seems that sort of put him in his music on the map he sort of brings it back to a much more like druggie aggressive and cold-blooded vibe definitely matching that human glacier sort of title of the album the tracks on this thing are super gritty they're super dark they're mean they're nasty they're unapologetic in their lyrical brutality I guess Gucci Mane brings a lot of personality on the mic as well some decent hooks too I would say that what sort of holds some of these songs back is they're a little brief they're a little short Gucci Mane sort of drops like a chorus and a verse or two and then kind of dips out after two minutes and change so some of those moments do kind of you know feel a little underwhelming but still there are a lot of nasty and like I said very sad and grimy moments on this record in a way rich ass junkie is certainly that in a way uh peeping out the blinds is certainly that because it's sort of creepy it's sort of eerie there's an element of paranoia there on that track most certainly and another track that I wanted to mention is probably sticking out to me as being one of the catchy or one's side effects and oh man I love smiling in the drought just sort of gucci mane portraying himself as you know just kind of winning despite the I guess metaphorically the drug market or literally you know I guess you can take it either way so Elgato to me sounds like one of Gooch's more focused projects in a while definitely more focused definitely more hard-hitting not nearly as bloated as a lot of the stuff he's been dropping lately not nearly as redundant as a lot of the stuff that he's been dropping lately and for people who've been listening to him for a long time and are maybe looking for him to go back to you know a slightly meaner sound this project might be kind of refreshing for you too because not to say Gucci Mane sort of gone totally happy-go-lucky since since his release from prison and since he's turned that new leaf but you know there's there's definitely a positivity there and there's definitely a lack of I guess kind of that junkyard dog attitude that people who listen to him - in the in the 2000s used to know him for so that's a it's gonna be it for this project it's pretty solid it's pretty solid and I like the tone I like the attitude I like the aesthetic of the album and I don't know I guess I'll just try to keep my ear to the ground and try to pick up that next time a Gucci Mane album does or mixtape rather either or stops me in my tracks and grabs my attention I just kind of missed this one or wasn't really thinking about it because it came out around Christmas and just wanted to talk about it here just wanted to talk about it now over here next to my head is a another review that you can check out hit that up or the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana forever 
W3SopqFy2eg,yo yo yo hey everyone yeah 'then yacht you know here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new portal album ion nuan profound lore records the fifth album from australian death metal wizards portal whose previous material has always kind of been a difficult digest for me in one breath I've always been kind of intrigued not only by the way the band dresses on stage when they perform but also by their completely unorthodox and sort of avant-garde approach to technical death metal the compositions they work into their tracks are absolutely dizzying and intense and typically add up into this incredibly noisy hellish uncompromising sound they're a metal band that really appreciates texture and Tambor as much as they do the melodies and chord progressions they weave into their tracks my issue though in the past has been they're decidedly murky production it's always made it hard to get a full picture of the band's music for me and has created a bit of a disconnect not only that but a lot of the technical flashes and details and intricacies of their music that are obviously there don't necessarily read all the time it's kind of like they're just throwing a lot of these amazing ideas just into the void but that completely changes it totally does a 180 on ion over here whose sound and performances are just as raw and as organic as any portal album thus far but the bass and drums and guitars are so much more pummeling and bright and vivid and the result of that is it just gives portals music so much more dynamics and punch of course the hectic performance is on this thing and the cultish aesthetic haven't really changed in this transition the band's music is really sounding more frightening and hideous and harrowing than ever and the band is using this wider frequency range on this album to just pile in more details layer on more dissonant horrifying guitars they also work in a lot of weird sound play too like the psychedelic and very surreal noises and sound effects especially on the song freaks where you do get some incredibly dissonant guitar overdubs or the song crone which features these very electric tingling swishes kind of washing in and out like waves underneath this rushing river of insane guitars it feels like I'm being whispered to in tongues by some kind of lightning demon while I'm being hypnotized by these incredibly just difficult to decipher tech death riffs the band also scratches new noise itches on these songs spores which is easily their most abrasive yet and they also bookend the album with these chilling Spacey dark ambient pieces that do a lot to I guess kind of send out and set the tone of the album which is incredibly dystopian and futurist and another insanely important thing about this record is just the flow of the entire album from track to track to track which is incredibly good just kind of keeps me on the edge of my seat for me flow in a death metal album is more important than it is in maybe any other genre because it's a niche genre it's a very loud abrasive sound the worst thing is when a death metal album gets stale or gets redundant which is why portal goes with the kind of half-hour standby that a lot of the old-school bands and the genre did and they don't really need to go longer because each one of these tracks is so dense it's so thick it's so detailed tracks can be listened to over and over and over and you just kind of gain new info and experiences from each track because it's it's just so mathematical and as naughty and as tangled each song on this thing is the more I listen to it the more each track kind of revealed its own individual flavor to me as well as quirks and characteristics like on the songs Adam in the second half the track features these gargantuan metallic bangs and clangs that are kind of in sync with the guitar riffs or the song s ion age which is one of the most densely packed songs on the entire record each chunk of like 30 seconds of guitar work on this thing is like so vastly different from the previous one different intensities different grooves and this track is is loaded with these really ghostly vocal performances to the vocal refrain on revolt of volts is probably the closest this thing comes to like delivering a hook revolt of all revolt oh now only that but the frantic guitar work on this thing toward the end is topped with these loud bright distorted searing chords that sound like I don't know a transformer having some kind of electric malfunction like there's like 10 million volts of electricity running through and it's about to explode for me the song husk is maybe the runt of the litter it's not quite as sonically adventurous or as densely packed as a lot of the other songs here but I do like the constant shifts in speed and tempo on this thing it does make it a unique moment on the album and an interesting listen to to a degree it's not a terrible track and one more time I want to specifically mention the outro on this album it does have a very dark very ambient tone to it there are kind of these ghostly disembodied like calling from beyond the grave human moan sort of calling out against like these very dark jeroni tones and what sounds like an old crackly record skipping and that's just one of the many moments on this thing that leave me feeling like I'm not just listening to an album I'm not just listening to a band I'm not just listening to a studio session I feel like this record really has a sense of place I feel like as I'm listening to some of these dizzying downward spirals of tech debt that I'm being dragged down into hell or something and I love that feel I love that vibe I love that darkness I love the band's aesthetic I just love how intense and surreal and detailed this album is incredibly impressed with it not just from the standpoint of a metal record but just on the whole of music I feel like this album just delivers and serves up so much because really the writing the production the performances the creativity the pushing of the envelope it's all there in spades really I can't complain about much of what this album has to offer I'm feeling a light too decent 9 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling kind of thoughtful Anthony Fantan Oh portal ion over here next to my head is another review that you can check out here that up or the link to subscribe to the channel forever 
J8qVaBy42Xg,oh yeah oh yeah totally sick bit bro you're you're look you're looking fleek hey thanks thanks I like the way it looks too yeah you totally got like this cool dad look going on like cool not cool dad trying to look cool I like it okay hey everyone changed city clothes tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new title album freedom's goblin this is the latest record from prolific singer songwriter producer multi-instrumentalist indie psych Punk garage workhorse this is his latest for the Drag City label and his output has just been unstoppable since he had that self-titled record back in 2008 I mean he's dropped upwards of of like 30 albums collaborative projects ep's live records and now a decade later freedom's goblin is probably like his his longest and most ambitious project yet maybe his most versatile project yet - because this album doesn't just dabble in the sounds that Thai fans are familiar with punk and psychedelic music and garage but on this record time Anna jizz to dip his toes into the glam rock pool as well and dishes out a few tracks here and there that are legitimately funky and funky and freaky and experimental and I think on this album ty is doing a better job of taking the reins of singer-songwriter - because vocally I feel like his singing is so much more out front than usual not quite buried behind the nostalgia of whatever shade of rock music that he's leaning on on a given track in the past for ty that has led to some pretty derivative vocal performances I mean occasionally that even happens on this record like on the song when mommy kills which is filled with these like pretty stale Beatles s harmonies there are even some points on the song that just kind of feel like I'm listening to of Montreal attempt like a punk indie lo-fi garage mix still though some of Ty's most compelling vocal performances to date turn up on this record especially on some of the dreary ER and more moe jenolan were heartbroken tracks cry cry cry rain alte my ladies on fire which in my opinion are all kind of Ty's best ballads to date I mean even on the more upbeat moments of this record like fanny dog which kicks the entire record off tie singing on the song is just full of conviction the singing is just so much more clear and convincing than it typically is I mean even on songs that feel more typical for time more in his usual wheelhouse like the song shoot you up the singing on there is so unsettling and kind of eerie and odd nagging as you [Music] yeah just feel so I don't know strung out kind of dejected a few of the more low-key ballads on here went kind of sour for me sort of like you say all the nice things whose twangy guitar arpeggios get really tedious really old really fast as well as The Last Waltz which to me I enjoyed the tune of the song but it just kind of felt like they were taking this usual very bland garage rock aesthetic and just lazily reapplying it to this sad saloon style tune the instrumentation comes together in a way that's not exactly messy in an enjoyable way but typically on the record the instrumentation is put together very well sure of course given its a tie record it's a little noisy it's a little rough around the edges but for the most part ty kind of puts that grime in all the right places and he does manage to even though there are some chaotic performances on here a little bit of extra noise a little bit of extra fuzz he balances a lot of this extra instrumentation out very nicely like again on the opening track to this thing which hits listener right away with this deluge of guitar and bass and drums and a few horns electric piano I also think freedom's goblin is one of Ty's most unpredictable records - it's so all over the place typically ty goes into an album with a certain direction or aesthetic in mind like one of my favorites of his the very scuzzy noisy and out their emotional mugger or the crushingly loud slaughterhouse the very psychedelic and funky sleeper the very low fie and aggressive melted or one of his cleanest and most riffey records manipulator but with Goblin there's no real clear direction or narrative the entire tracklist into any one direction and as a result of this lack of boundaries on this record tie really gets into the weeds with some of these songs and deliver some very strange and very unexpected moments like the weirdly funky Despoiler of cadaver which to me sounds like a cross-section of disco music Tonetta and Marilyn Manson with its funky rhythm guitars and milky bass lines it's kind of lo-fi aesthetic and and very like totally strung out lead vocals meanwhile the very freaky and funky psych rock track everyone's a winner which is loaded with these kind of silly tongue-in-cheek falsetto vocals I get like a real old-school BEC vibe off of this track which kind of got me thinking it's like Tai is the BEC for the lo-fi indie garage rock set the song meaning has this very primal very groovy drum intro that makes a sudden transition into the heaviest scuzziest most cro-magnon punk music you're probably going to hear all year very unexpected transition not one of my favorite moments on the album but definitely stands out as a unique song talking three delivers this animalistic sax rock that kind of takes it back to the days of James chance and the contortions and the main Pretender the next track keeps the sax on deck but for a much more funky and psychedelic experience the song she is as harrowing as it is heavy it's one of the jammy er tracks on the record and loads the song with all these improvisational moments but they're often layered on top of one another in this very noisy very chaotic very overwhelming way and I absolutely love it on this track when ty is just screaming there's a lot of great material on this thing in short but there's just not a whole lot in terms of themes and sounds and ideas that ties it all together I guess just go into this album expecting a bit of randomness a bit of a shuffle kind of vibe it is enjoyable to me even as more of a casual tie fan but still it is a very long and sprawling album but if you're looking for an underground rock record with a lot of viscera and a kind of experimental edge with a lot of personality and character in scope then I think you might want to give this a shot occasionally it's a little too messy and chaotic for its own good kind of hinders the enjoy ability of a track here and there occasionally the album feels pretty derivative I mean don't go into this thing expecting to hear the most original and the most refreshing ideas and rock on the Block I mean tie is no stranger to kind of wearing his influences on a sleeve and occasionally this album is kind of long-winded - especially on moments like the final track where I feel like the limitations of the solo abilities of ty and his band are kind of exposed as they really try to go long like 12 minutes long still though very good record one of the most enjoyable rock records I've heard in the first leg of this year I am feeling a strong Simon to a light eight on this thing and I am going to leave it at that transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best or the best what should i review next it the like you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling like you're full of thoughts over here next to my head is a another review that you can check out hit that up or hit up the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana forever 
sxL5lPZLbQU,this is the this is the Grammys right now oops I did it again I played with your heart got lost in the game oh baby baby oops I think I'm in the scent from above I'm not that innocent hey everyone it's Grammy Grammy Grammy Grammy here the Internet's busy and I'm gonna be forever disappointed I'm going to go over the winners and losers through a lot of the major categories of this latest Grammy Awards ceremony the 60th Grammy Awards for 2018 let's do it okay first off in the general field here we obviously have the album of the year which Bruno Mars won everybody's been talking about that Bruno Mars actually kind of swept that category record of the year - and song of the year and in goddamn I told you guys this in my Grammys predictions video of course I had my favorites and I had the artists who I wouldn't mind seeing the award go to and and honestly I didn't really hate many of the artists in these categories this year but as I said before and I'll say it again the Grammys always managed to fall on whatever the blandest most agreeable most lowest common denominator record war song is and that just kind of happens to be Bruno Mars it's not going to be childish gambino that record is just way too funky it's way too weird jay-z's record it's not a banger it's way too personal and it's for old people and Kendricks music apparently is is still too radical for the Grammys I don't get it what what is the dude's album have to do for him to get a Grammy like seriously and not to forget to mention Lord in this category too because in my opinion her record is more superior than Bruno Mars's 24-karat magic as well and and I guess as a result of the way Lord has been treated through the award ceremony and then the fact that she was kind of a some people feel robbed of the award in this category the people are crying sexism and it seems like those accusations are kind of sticking given the grammys president's recent remarks which i've talked about in a new video that it's it's not the best PR move I'll say that much Best New Artist category Alesia Cara I mean that's cool she's not my favorite in the mix over here I would have rather it seen go to Sousa but still I've been seeing people harass her over the win of this award and it's like Jesus Christ come on sit down like the you'd have to bully somebody because they want an award in the pop field for Best Pop solo performance it went to Ed Sheeran of course it went to ed Sheeran and what's even grosser is that this is the least original song in the bunch in in the entire field here like the track is basically a ripoff of TLC's no scrubs dude had to pay TLC because they're parts of the track that sound exactly like no scrubs why it didn't go to million reasons from Lady Gaga or praying by Kesha is beyond me those two tracks are so much more compelling and beautiful and passionate Best Pop duo/group Performance Portugal the man I guess I'm actually happy that this happened like I would have seen it going to imagine dragons or friggin chainsmokers and Coldplay but I guess thank God it didn't hell yeah Portugal the man I wasn't a big fan of their last record but still man Best Pop Vocal album ed Sheeran thank God Joanne by Lady gaga it's better rainbow by Ke$ha it's better fuck you could even give it to Lana Del Ray and I would be happy Best Dance Recording with LCD Soundsystem I mean I guess that's cool I'm not crazy about the track but it's really nice to see LCD get get a Grammy I mean they have been one of my favorite indie tronic acts out there and they're easily one of the best bands out of New York one of the best bands of the 2000 so it is nice to see them be acknowledged by the industry I guess it's a bit of a consolation prize Best dance/electronica album Kraftwerk one hell yeah that's actually got me a little tingly a little tingly over that hell yeah Oh best rock performance Leonard Cohen I mean it's that's that's quite nice that's quite nice you know I could have seen it going to Foo Fighters but that's quite nice hell yeah Leonard Cohen rest in peace rest in peace best metal performance of course that was gonna go to Mastodon as I said but I would have preferred to see code orange I would have even loved to see body count win it but of course it was gonna go to Mastodon best rock song Foo Fighters run okay and uh all right I guess Best Rock Album the new war on drugs record what what are you kidding me it's so planned although I guess looking at the rest of the field it's it's not really that much better I mean I guess I would have kind of preferred Queens of the Stone Age but yeah best alternative music album the National ticket I mean I was pulling for father John misty love that album so much as you guys know it's my album of the year for 2017 however my second-best record in that field was in fact the new national album so that's that's pretty nice you know I it should not have gone to gorillas and Jesus Christ it should have not gone Arcade Fire uh scissor rod again in the friggin R&B performance field Bruno Mars why I don't get it I don't get it I don't get it although I guess it's nice to see childish gambino take your redbone best traditional R&B performance that's pretty cool best R&B song Bruno Mars again Bruno Bruno best urban contemporary album star boy the weekend why I mean the this is an album so much better the childish gambino album is so much better best R&B album Bruno Mars why why like what were the people voting that day doing do they listen to any music did they just pick the artist who's like yeah I guess I I guess I'm I remember Bruno Mars let me just let me just pick that had they heard all the album's they couldn't have possibly heard all the album's there's no way all these people heard all these albums all the way through from beginning to end and we're like you know what this Bruno Mars album it's some better than challenge can me you know it's so much better than that says album at this point I just doubt the people or vote did they hear all the albums I don't think so I don't think they do that's rap performance humble so okay we got one and best rap song to Kendrick you go boy you go boy and best rap album okay all right okay all right all right kinda like a flower boy better I I really do like the jay-z album better as well but uh you know hey I feel like there's been a bit of a build-up here for Kendrick in in regards to his deservin 'us of Grammys so I'll take it best country solo performance Chris Stapleton takes it either way that's quite nice because Chris Stapleton is one of the few artists in the country field right now that has any integrity and he does it again with best country song on broken halos very nice he hit a three-peat with Volume one Chris Stapleton from a room quite nice Chris quite nice best improvised jazz solo John McLaughlin miles beyond that's quite nice John McLaughlin is a highly underrated and a highly talented guitarist if you have not heard frigging Mahavishnu Orchestra intermountain flame please Jesus Christ do yourself a goddamn favor thank you I'm seeing all of the jazz categories and it's reminding me that I did not listen to enough jazz last year and I need to stop fucking up in 2018 I seriously do best recording package the the Claudio Ron Kohli and cactus taller art directors get tied with father John misty 's pure comedy what I mean I can't really say whether or not it's better because I haven't seen the packaging for that other record but even though you could tie for a Grammy what do you do they print two Grammys and then you just boast each each get a Grammy is that how it works I'm so confused do what do you know do you get like the Grammy every other weekend is it like a custody thing production non-classical feel best engineered album non-classical the fucking Bruno Mars record not the perfume genius album seriously it's everywhere it's like a cancer that spread I I can I can only take so much of this before you know it I'm gonna see that Bruno Mars had won best New Age album of the year so I'm gonna leave it at that I'm gonna stop the pain I'm gonna stop the headache and thank you for watching you're the best over here next to my head is another video that you guys can check out my Grammy predictions video for this year's Grammys you can hit that up or

cTYg1mAd8tA,hey everyone barks Annie bark tano here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new migos project culture to the amigos that's my favorite group you know all my favorite raps oh you like the migos so much name name their names well you got off step and you got takeout and you got Creepo that's all of them that's what I thought the Atlanta hip hop trio is back and they are quickly following up last year's culture culture one the first culture which easily is one of my favorite trap records period one of the better migos albums out there because while in the past they have displayed a very idiosyncratic style they have written some good hits they've always emphasized quantity over quality and culture was a total change from that migos condense their best characteristics down into a series of very catchy and well-written songs on a pretty trim tracklist that was relatively free of filler I do it for the culture so it's that brevity it's that focus it is that honing of MeeGo songwriting craft that made culture one so good so when I heard them announce culture two I was like awesome hi so excited I hope they like just refine what they were doing on that record and just make it a little bit better and it's just gonna be like amazing one of the best rap albums ever but know that the chances of that dropped exponentially after the album was announced and it was made clear that culture 2 was going to be like an hour and 45 minutes in length like me ghosts are not capable of making an album that long that sounds good it's it's just the truth vocally lyrically instrumentally their music is not versatile enough is not dynamic enough to make a tracklist that long entertaining of course culture too is just going to end up being a glorified mixtape which it in fact is like so many of the songs on this record are wash rinse and repeat you do not write and record this much material in this short of an amount of time since your last album without following a very clear and very repetitive formula even the instrumentals on this thing are painfully formulaic like some of the only tracks that really stood out to me instrumentally notice me was definitely one that instrumental was super mellow super beautiful the made men instrumental was pretty luxurious like I love the glorious and very rich pianos all over that track the laid-back groove it almost kind of felt like maybe a little bit of a throwback to the 90s the Pharrell instrumental on here was insane maybe the most unique in the bunch and had a groove on how a surprise that the migos would even touch flooded is maybe the most skeletal and minimal track on the entire record of course motorsport is a total banger featuring Nicki Minaj and cardi B walk it talked it stuck out quite a bit but maybe only because of its really annoying refrains and walk it and talk it yeah which is really kind of a lot of tracks on here they're actually quite a few songs on here where the hooks the choruses are so obnoxious that I can't help but just they're just really annoying ear worms that stick in my head for all the wrong reasons the bad bitches only course featuring 21 Savage was a relatively big high point for me on the album but honestly the features on here are one of the few things that actually break up the monotony of this record because again there are numerous tracks on here supastarz emoji a chain too much jewelry I would say crown the Kings to many many tracks on this thing basically me goes totally phoning it in with some of their most lackluster and uninteresting lyrics yet along with a bunch of auto-tune singing and ad-libs that you've already heard a million times before like it seems like they're doing as little as they can to advance their sound forward in any significant way but also on top of it water it down to the point where it's so easy to just bust out 24 tracks without really kind of thinking about it because you cannot tell me that these guys spent hours writing the hooks to Gang Gang or to playa or that one line on flooded about pulling up like a pair of Huggies like like a pair of Huggies if you compare culture to with the previous and very lengthy mixtapes that migos have released in the past it's pretty much on par with that it's a slog to listen to it is sooo / tedious your best hopes of enjoying anything on this is to just instantaneously delete anything that you find to be even vaguely boring and just listen to the tracks that you actually like because I actually think there's maybe like a decent album somewhere in the 24 tracks of this thing but me ghosts didn't really take the time to like you know cut it out of the tracklist they just kind of actually left the cutting room floor on the album itself culture 2 is just a mixtape and they're treating it like an album it's it's just really the trio stream trolling just throwing extra tracks onto an album because they know at the end of the day it'll probably get them more streams which honestly I'm not really looking forward to everybody in anybody following this business model in 2018 and 2019 and 2020 and maybe even beyond because it's gonna make listening to albums it's gonna make listening to projects really annoying because even when you do have a high point on this project its significance is really just kind of overshadowed by the mediocrity and the pretty much samey vibe that you're getting from nearly every track that surrounds it yeah I'm pretty much feeling a decent strong four on this thing there's not really a whole lot to say about it it's migos as you've already heard them xeroxed copied and pasted again and again and again until they basically make over 90 minutes of material culture to actually says a lot less about the culture that me goes and the music they're making exists within and really more about a business model that they're trying to take advantage of transition have you given culture to of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe

LxVfshdEKt4,hi everyone excellent eyesight tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd I hope you guys are doing well and this is a video that I'm going to title the life of Pablo redux me essentially returning to Kanye's 2016 album the life of Pablo Kanye West you most likely are you know him rap superstar singer rapper producer visionary man visionary I've done well over a few thousand music reviews on this YouTube channel and some of my most legendary most notorious and most infamous reviews have been Kanye West reviews and for good reason the guy is an envelope pusher he is very controversial he's a game changer he's made some of the best music in hip-hop ever period and his albums tend to be very polarizing or at least elicit very strong opinions out of fans and haters alike and truth be told a lot of my opinions on Kanye's music have rubbed many fans the wrong way and maybe that's because I'm harsh maybe that's because I tell it like it is maybe that's because I'm just not sipping the Kanye kool-aid as much as some people are and as a result I've gotten a lot of requests a lot of requests a lot of people pestering me over the years you have to review this record you have to relist into this record you have to review this talk about this again you didn't listen to the right way know the life of Pablo though that record still kind of haunts me a little bit to this day and and maybe the reason that that is for me personally has been just the loss potential on the record at least in the initial rollout because if anybody remembers which maybe some people don't and maybe some people never will fully realize because the the version that was originally up of the album online I don't know where you're gonna find it unless you illegally download it or something like that because you can't purchase the album in all streamable versions of the record right now are the newest most well mix most up-to-date version of the record with the longer tracklist but the initial mixes of this record were pretty rough a lot of the songs very messy even kanye west acknowledged himself like wolves could have come out so much better which also applies to many of the other tracks on the record as well but even initial release the life of Pablo stood as Kanye's grand experimental Opus one of his oddest and most challenging records in album whose very wild rollout in PR campaign I think made the record interesting but simultaneously I think it held back its sound from being as well assembled and as fully formed as it could have been now as it has been documented there had been multiple versions multiple updates to this record on streaming services since its initial release in February of 2016 it was actually updated about all the way until June and I also did a video reacting to at least some of the updates thus far on the album but that was only in April so I was really only reacting to the April updates of the record the spring updates I will leave a link to those videos down there in the description box I will also link them at the end slate in this video I recall at the point of me hearing the spring updates to the album the record sounded cleaner and I was more pleased with the product of the album but it was still a very flawed project I could have even seen myself scoring the album differently based on that new mix still though at that point I felt like I had had every experience with the record that I was going to have and then it wasn't necessarily pulling me in as hard as it initially was but just the other week I kind of got this desire I got this itch to listen back to tracks like famous and ultra light beam which even at the initial release of the album I loved those tracks I thought they were really catchy and fun and hilarious but once I put the album on it was like I was hearing the songs completely new completely over again completely for the the first time and it was just like it was like a little bit of a mindfuck moment because I didn't know that there were new versions between April and June because it's just a mosh pit sort of following as many records and releases and doing as many reviews as I do and I wasn't keeping track of every little update that was happening to the life of Pablo I figured the mixes from February to April weren't going to get that much better and I had heard an earlier version of Saint Pablo too so I didn't really think that adding that to the record was really going to change the album up that much however I am much more impressed with the final version and I think the track is an excellent closer for the record - and says a lot about the themes of love and that Kanye runs throughout the album it is a better finisher than fade which honestly with this new mix has also grown on me the grooves and the synth bass lines on that track are so much better and bouncier and more rubbery and delicious the point I'm trying to make here with this video is this I guess essentially final version of the album is the version of the life of Pablo that I wanted all along like this is pretty much the fullest potential that I could see coming out of this album and in my opinion it's great it's really one of Kanye's riskiest and bravest albums yet if not one of the bravest albums in mainstream rap it's totally freaky and out there and strange and exposes Kanye's weird side in this incredibly raw way that we've never seen before but on top of it we're seeing Kanye at this incredible point of vulnerability that I don't really think we've seen him deliver to us either on tracks like real friends on tracks where he's singing about his love for his kids his love for his wife the song wolves thinking about sort of that robbery incident that happened with Kim Kardashian almost seems like a premonition of sorts kind of eerie and haunting to think of that in in in the light of that song and there's still some tracks on here that strike me as maybe being a little thrown together a little lazy like Father stretch my hands part - it's basically it's just a designer Panda remix with Kanye's vocals just auto-tune riffing over it please but the vast majority of these songs are really sounding better than ever in my opinion of course ultra-light and famous still sound hard and heavy and fantastic love the gospel vocals on that intro feedback is just so manic and wild as his freestyle for fuck my life featuring The Weeknd I loved that song prior but now it just seems so much more chilling and I feel like Kanye's fear in his anxiety with his behavior sort of taking his family away from him the reality of that seems so much more real the ideas translated so much better and that's another thing that I'll say has helped out this album on the whole with these tweaks with these new mixes I feel like all the weird ideas all the experimental ideas and all the lyrical the emotional the thematic ideas that run through this album translate so much better and actually kind of makes the record feel so much less like a mess even though texturally and stylistically it may seem like it's cobbled together and sort of random and kind of like a rap album deconstructed if you look at a lot of what Kanye's rapping about on this album it's pretty watertight because on a lot of this album it's like there's this constant push and pull between wanting to be a responsible and in loving husband and father wanting to do better by his friends and by his family there's this pull to be a good person a spiritual person but then on the flip side there is that egoism there is that element of destructive behavior that Kanye just can't seem to let go of previously tracks on this thing that we're on the latter side came off to me as being a little cluttered and messy and awkward meanwhile the more skeletal moments on the album like wolves for example just kind of fell flat on their face but now both of these sides of the record in my opinion have really reached a happy medium of course this album still does have a rough aesthetic to it but now it doesn't feel like it's kind of impeding the success of these songs to actually get their musical their rhythmic and their lyrical ideas across effectively if I could take all the experience I have now take this record bring it back to 2016 rescore and place it somewhere on my year-end list I'd have to say I'd feel maybe like a decent a strong 8 on this and probably throw it somewhere in my top 15 of 2016 and say easily this is really my favorite thing Kanye has done this decade and this album is definitely him overcoming that awkward phase where he was kind of experimenting with weirder styles or weirder takes on rap music with his previous album yeezus I'm glad I ended up revisiting this thing I'm glad the ideas on here though they were very messy and and cobbled together it seemed at first we're interesting and intriguing and experimental and out there and wild and unique enough to actually stick with me in my head and make me think if only if only just wanted to say that just wanted to get that out there because I think it's interesting the album has been changed as many times as it has and and how as a result my opinion on the record has changed name one genius that ain't crazy I guess is how I'll end this this revisit to Kanye's the life of Pablo thank you guys very much for watch transition have you given this album we'll listen you probably have us from 2016 over here next to my head are a few other videos that you can check out if you would like and that's gonna be it for this one guys I'll see you in another video at some point in the future I'm sure okay Anthony Fantana life of Pablo forever

project which Austin did a little write-up for on the site you can strain that via the link below this and all the other music we're to be talking about in this episode is linked in the description box as usual along with a new reimagined track from will Toledo of car seat headrest apparently via matador records this year he's be he's going to be coming out with a a sort of newly recorded newly sort of revised version of his legendary band camp record twin fantasy which if you if you're familiar with wills work or if you're not rather there's a very low five records very rough record to the point where it didn't even really truly appeal to me I like his I guess sort of better recorded material his latest stuff but I have loved what I've been hearing so far of this reimagined version twin fantasy so I'm pretty pretty excited pretty hyped to hear this new record so again those will link down below alright let's get into the worst tracks this week let's go into the worst tracks let's get into them oh do you feel it do you feel it do you feel every do you feel the the world darkening it's happening it's happening guys oh I don't know I don't know I don't know how this is happening but yes shaggy and stinger coming out with a collaborative album this year it's like coming out on 4/20 of all dates and don't make me phoning it in so hard it's like the worst pop reggae I've heard in a long time it's it's pretty bad it's it's pretty horrendous do not know why this is happening I'm just noticing now that's that's a nice SG though good on sting good on sting for that nice ass SG is that a jeep but what are they doing what are they doing it's not a good song it's a very cheap pop reggae tune I throw it out the window I really do toss it out the window Beck came out with a super boring and bland cover of The Velvet Underground's I'm waiting for the man yeah it's it's it's pretty lifeless and not interesting at all and is is very much in line with the Beck has been with the music Beck has been making out his past couple of Records he's just sawed off the mark I don't know what to say moving on from there ASAP rocky came out a few horrible tracks this week two above and five stars I'm hoping that this is not the ASAP Rocky that we're gonna be hearing on this new record I hope these are just taster tracks they came up with a freestyle this week too that given how horrible these tracks were I didn't even try it honestly I didn't even try it because these songs repair not like the flows are awful DRAM was on one of the tracks too though he did not save it at all and the hooks weren't really there I have no idea where ASAP Rocky's head is at seems like since he dropped his big breakthrough mixtape and he dropped his big break through commercial record which had some amazing radio hits on in a little bit had some amazing radio hits on it dude cannot write a hit dude cannot write a hit and I'm just why why I don't even care at this point hire a ghostwriter just as long as a good song ends up coming out of it hire anybody you know have somebody else wrapped for you just as long as the song is good do anything at this point instead of this like bland forgettable trait but whatever and finally uh another cover that disappointed me from the upcoming I only listen to the mountain goats compilation record where it's it's basically a series of artists just covering mountain goat songs this one this would Amanda Palmer she really overdoes it she really does overdo it I really don't know what to say about this track other than that she just over does it she over acts it to the point where it's annoying and that's that's basically it that it really doesn't need any more explanation beyond that it sounds like a a version of the mountain goats song freaking the mess inside as performed by the most annoying girl in drama class is what it sounds like it's it's that's that's what it sounds like let's move on to the tracks they thought were okay well it wasn't it wasn't crazy about him didn't didn't love him wasn't head-over-heels for him but so wanted to give him a mention they're linked down they were low a new young thug track featuring shad the god and trouble this one came out on a Martin Luther King Day although I did miss it it's a bit of a banger nice ritzy sweet little piano melodies coming out of this track thug errs vocal melody on the track is quite sweet too not one of those more memorable memorable tracks in my opinion but definitely one of his sweeter cuts in a while culture to me ghosts new record and going to be talking about it very soon supastarz is kind of the big big big big big lead single from this thing is aside from Motorsports you know that's been out a while now but one of the bigger more recent promotional singles the song superstars this sort of sounds like me goes kind of phoning it in in my opinion don't get really what makes the song special in terms of the instrumental the flows the lyrics really nothing about the song stands out to my ears I'm kind of disappointed because it seems like so far migos are not really crafting hits this time around it seems like they're kind of delivering us a glorified mixtape of sorts but I guess you'll hear more on that when I actually do the culture to review moving out from their new track from the band Hopalong whose last record I loved I thought there was like some really really strong guitar work on that record some amazing vocal work as well quite a bit of virtuosity packed into the bands very anxious brand of indie rock however this new track of their is how simple it's it's okay seemed like kind of a milder version of what I've enjoyed before from the band not quite seeing the excitement and hype but I guess I still am looking forward to their their next album just hoping that there's a bit more excitement coming down the pipe I guess new Franz Ferdinand track this one titled lazy boy it's it's alright you know it's it's funky and a sort of awkward a lot like the last single the band dropped recently but um you know it's it's some decent dancey indie rock music I guess I just wish it was a little less awkward but that's all it's got an it's got a decent groove and finally Alice glass musically responding to the controversy coming out of Crystal Castles right now with her accusations against even Kath who has said that he has taken steps toward a legal action against her Alice has publicly said that she's ready to take the stand if me be with her sexual-assault allegations against him and a court setting and now I guess as this is all unfolding she has dropped this cease and desist track it's a pretty intense I found the the mixing and the hook to be a little off but still it's it's really like a strong show of aggression and passion and it's interesting to sort of see Alice I guess kind of playing out a lot of these emotions that I'm sure she's going through during this time in this track right now at this very moment again I'm sure they're elements about the track that while they are very rough around the edges and kind of off to me it's I'm sure that's as a result of just I got to get this track together now because this is just a raw display of my feelings at this moment so I guess walk into this thing expecting it to be a little rough around the edges given the speed with which he probably got it together but uh but still it's a very intense listen and let's move on to the tracks I thought were the best ones this week starting off with Julian Casablancas and the voids that are now being referred to just simply as the voids they dropped a couple tracks very recently the song leave it in my dreams and a cure curious both of which into my ears sounded like I don't know like slightly more experimental versions of The Strokes to a degree maybe not so much curious the the electronics on that song and the the noise element on that song was like kind of crazy and off-the-wall but still very much leave it in my dream it's just kind of sounded like an otter slightly weirder strokes but actually kind of cool and interesting and catchy I'm liking what the band is doing I'm excited for it I'm excited for their next record if you guys remembered I really enjoyed the last voids album quite a bit I thought there were a lot of great moments on it I loved how abrasive and off-the-wall and and bold it was I liked a lot of the songwriting on the record too I I think the voids have a future you know I think the voids have a lot going for them right now musically sonically just creatively in terms of talent as well so I'm just kind of hoping that the voids continue to go up from here and that you know all the things that I've been enjoying in the past about The Strokes best records just kind of manifests themselves on this new album but with some new experimental adventurous bold and maybe slightly challenging bits moving on from there little Wayne dedication six reloaded dude is coming out with a new mixtape very soon whose lead singles have been getting me pretty hype like this literally sounds like we are it's like we're going back to little Wayne mixtape era in his prime point in time it's like we're going back to oh three oh four oh five little Wayne you know we're going back to oh six oh seven little Wayne like it's pretty surprising the the songs of course I'm talking about are the tracks Bloody Mary with Juelz Santana who says a little awkward on the track but still like Wayne's flow on this song is awesome as well as on the track big bad wolf like instrumentally they're both bangers but it's really Wayne's smart witty tongue-in-cheek one-liners and wordplay and double entendre z' and just as energy on these tracks I don't know what it is you know I mean I've been hearing uh mixed signals from the media on where he is mentally where his health is at but as far as the music goes that I'm hearing right now I mean he sounds on the fucking ball you know he sounds on the ball he sounds like he's really focused it sounds like he's putting together some amazing performances on these tracks and it sounds like he's about to drop one of his most fire tapes in a long time and one of the most fire projects in a long time because as many of you guys know the the albums have been pretty lackluster for a while now so I don't know man like I'm kind of crossing my fingers here and hoping that this tape the deep cuts are just as good if not better than these teaser tracks moving on from there really enjoyed this new single from one of the most highly anticipated for me personally collaborative albums this year Jean Grey and Kweli Chris apparently the two of them like they got their there together and they got a they got like engaged last year or something I don't even know that I don't even know that if you didn't know quality crits dropping on my favorite records last year Jean Grae I've been waiting for her to drop something more sizeable since like her last couple of mixtapes and 2011 and 2012 and you know I feel like she's an incredibly talented vocalist and lyricist she's got a great flow great pen game if there's one rapper out there who I'm disappointed I don't hear more from it's Jean Grey and it's it's just amazing that all of a sudden out of the blue here she is collaborative album with one of my favorite rappers in the underground right now one of the best records of 2017 one of the best rap records of 2017 and I don't know I'm just psyched to hear what they have to offer especially given this debut single hosh is really good and features a verse from Hannibal Buress which goes over really well and like the features on this thing even Nick Offerman of Parks and Rec fame is on this thing like I I don't know I'm just really excited the feature list is fantastic the album cover is a mace these two are incredibly talented and have totally idiosyncratic styles that I cannot wait to hear all the ways in which they're able to kind of work that together on this forthcoming album so when it's gonna be coming out via mellow music group of course so be on the lookout for that this year I'll keep you guys updated and of course you will see a review moving on from there another track I like this week surprisingly is the new Jack White song the song being titled corporation and this track adds to my theory adds to my assumptions that this next record for Jack it's essentially going to be his electronic album it's gonna be it's gonna be Jack's electronic album prepare for that mentally it's gonna be Jack's electronic album okay it's going to be his electronic record however this is the first track sort of in that style that I really enjoy and what I say Jack white is doing an electronic record it's it's not like he's going IDM or anything like that obviously the guitar is still playing a huge role but it sounds like the way the rhythm section you know the guitar is the bass especially the percussion the way it's being edited in sequence it seems like we're hearing a lot of loops or something or a lot of sequences a lot of electronically sequence pieces of percussion or something there's something like very tight and precise about it and danceable and somewhat funky like a lot funkier then a lot of jacks usual repertoire but actually this one is pretty incredible like the grooves are fantastic I feel like there are a lot of creative production choices on this track and the song for the most part is very instrumental in some of the grooves on here kind of reminds me of like an old meter song like an old Southern funk tune and I don't know what to say about the track beyond that again if you're not familiar with the meters definitely look them up because I feel like they're they're kind of a prime influence on this track some of the grooves on this thing specifically felt like very much indebted to them moving on from their last track I'm going to mention is the new da burry song he's gonna be coming out with a new project very soon very underrated underground producer and of all people he landed MF DOOM on this new single of his the song being titled little mutha fuckas and dooms performance on the track is actually incredible the beat is fantastic you know very experimental very textured very Spacey and strange just like I've expected from him up until this point with previous releases one of which I want to recommend to you guys before I duck out here because he is very good and it's it's it's sad we haven't heard more from him up until this point I'm hoping that this MF DOOM song kind of gets things rolling a little bit yes dobry has a project out that goes by the name of 2/3 which in my opinion is a very good very underrated project dropped in 2006 Scott it's been that long came out on Ghostly 2/3 came out on Ghostly and this new record of his is gonna be titled 3/3 so this is literally the follow-up that record came out in 2 - 2006 so it's like over ten years later and I feel like there are some people at this point who are just like who the hell is this guy like this guy's been around a while and you know it's it's crazy that he hasn't dropped more records under this name though it seems like he had a few singles out last year that sort of flew under the radar for me which was unfortunate but again I guess it makes me all the more excited that he's probably really kind of building up to the release of this album he's not going anywhere seems like this thing is coming out on in February so be on the lookout for that and one more track I wanted to mention before I totally ducked out of here was that James Blake mr. James Blake has dropped a new track titled if the car beside you moves ahead just looks like a kind of lone standalone lone wolf single a single over here I haven't heard an announcement of an album release or anything like that just yet however this new song over here to my ears is one of his best he's put out in a long time seems like he's kind of going back to his experimental roots a little bit to his earlier weirder EPS that had a bit more of an abstract but more of a classic dubstep influence and I'm liking it a lot there's some insane very futuristic and strange vocal edits all over this track - this has been the weekly track roundup I love you and I hope to see you guys in the next video I hope you got some good recommendations out of this one and anthony Fantana mm-hmm I'm out of here for 
FnjOReNf4Go,hey everybody this new uh Fall Out Boy album it's not good pop rock pop punk and emo pop band Fall Out Boy they are back with a brand new album and they've almost been around for twenty years at this point it's a long time it's a long time for a band that relatively I see as being very young or I guess at least appealing to an incredibly young audience and I guess they're still trying to do that this time around while maintaining their roots as a pop rock band but as you guys already know young and Menace was one of my least favorite songs of last year young and Menace being the lead single off of this thing a track that in my opinion was a total mess like the production a lot of the grooves a lot of the pacing on the track just kind of felt like that of an EDM song to me on top of it like the squeaky pitched chipmunk vocals kind of spazzing out all over the course sound utterly awful so admittedly going into this record I I didn't expect that much and it's it's almost like they surpassed my low expectations but like in in they went under the bar I will spare you some of the nitty gritty details of this record outside of maybe the song champion which for whatever reason has parts on it that sound directly ripped right out of the new edge here in album there's also a song in here that is a little bit of a white boy reggae breakdown that's pretty fun a song that has a bit of a tropical vibe as well a few tracks toward the back end they have a bit of a hard rock vibe to like I've been transported back to the hair metal highlights of the 1980s occasionally the lyrics are kind of cringy but that's to be expected it's Fall Out Boy but kind of the main point I want to make on this record is I feel like albums like this are exactly the reason why or I guess indicative of the the dire straits that rock music isn't right now generally because you have some of the genres flagship bands and and we can't put all or really even most of this on Fall Out Boy because in the grander scheme of rock music how much influence how much weight does Fall Out Boy really carry there's still one of the most popular bands in the genre and you essentially have a rock band writing pretty much an EDM album but with guitars it's that over produced the sound is that compressed and overblown the vibe of the record is is that precisely cut you know if I was going to listen to some music in the style I would much rather listen to an artist who's actually devoted to the craft has been doing it for a while and is doing it relatively well I'd rather listen to I don't know a dead mouse or I'd rather listen to a lady gaga record or I'd rather listen to a Carly Rae Jepsen record or something not some rock band coming through with a facility of that type of music but just express through guitars and and not particularly well I might add oh but this thing is such a horrendous just like clashing and crashing together of just a variety of the most cliched sounds in all of these shades of rock and pop music and electronic music granted there are some songs on here that I think at their core are actually kind of passionate soaring legitimately good anthemic rock tunes the last of the real ones Heaven's Gate maybe even Church however the production surrounding these tracks is just so crazy and gaudy it's like I'm just being shot with corny neon lasers from every direction it just sounds hideous really for any genre at this point you doesn't even really factor whether or not Fall Out Boy is a rock bass and are they an electronic man what the hell are they really you could slap anybody's name on this record and the production would still sound cheap and tacky and just like way too much you know the mainstream and even the underground music landscape over this decade that we're currently in has altered and changed in a lot of interesting ways a lot of ways that I actually love and while some of my favorite music ever has come out of this decade has come out of these changes I have to say and I have to admit Rock has had a hard time adjusting to this sea change it's like listening to prog rock bands try to adjust to the new wave era of the 1980s but 10 times worse so I'm gonna just leave it at that transition have you given this album we'll listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I um next to the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is a another review that you can check out hit that up or hit up the link to subscribe to the channel and see you guys in the next one you have to be Fantino forever 
KQXYdub4Af4,hey everyone Anthony Fantino here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well I am gonna do a quickie kind of raw review here of the New Eden album vertigo an Irish project which is masterminded by one guitarist songwriter producer multi-talented individual Jonathan Eng this is the projects kind of big debut record I've been hit with a deluge of requests to cover this album just really out of the blue seems he's had some eps and some singles released previously but I ever really been following much of any of it I certainly see the appeal in what he's doing I just kind of wonder if any of it really truly appeals to me personally there's definitely an element of James Blake in his music so if you love alternative R&B if you love R&B that's a little bit sadder more sorrowful a little bit more Moody and with some interesting electronic sort of textures here and there then I think you'll probably get into what Jonathan is doing on this record there's also a bit of an element of I don't know some some bedroom produce glitch hop or something that there's certainly something glitchy and textured about it but I tend to think a lot of the experimentation on this record is a little mild and then of course you have some very heartfelt little guitar cuts on here that almost have like a little bit of an edge here and vibe to it so thinking of all of those worlds sort of coming together I do find it intriguing that he has such an odd and and totally unexpected cross-section of influences coming together on to this one record very unlikely well it does sound more interesting than the last ed Sheeran record and it does sound more interesting in a way than probably even the last James Blake record which I thought was a little bit of a mess and kind of too messy and low fight or really kind of get my head around personally I do still find it to be a little bland or maybe drowning in its influences just a little bit too much but still there seems to be like a lot of raw talent here a lot of somewhat interesting ideas I guess I would like to see them just taken to a bolder conclusion the next time around however I don't know certainly see whether or not there's any kind of motivation for him to take things in that direction because it seems like he has like a very young bright I guess positive minded millennial audience that that probably want him to keep his music sort of as as light and sweet as it currently is so while I do find some of the songs on this thing to be kind of sweet in some ways it just kind of feels like the the next logical step for you know just just just the sweet acoustic guitar strumming dude meaning just simply the guitar simply the vocals it doesn't cut it anymore you know you have to throw some electronics in there you have to throw some elements of R&B in there it's nice on the ear so but personally I'm not really crazy about it and I don't really think I'm part of ings intended audience either aging bald weirdos that have music or view channels and listen to Death Grips and Motorhead still they let me know what you thought of this record down in the comments since I have been getting so many requests to review it I imagine that there is some interest on your part in this record why is it resonating with you over here next to my head is another review that you can check out you can click on that or on the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Eden forever

0zOprEiOOyc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here intranets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and this video is gonna be kind of a different one not a review per se more of a just a listening session and reaction to what is essentially some computer-generated music now if you're familiar with composition digital composition MIDI you you know that there has been computer generated music already in the past computer-generated compositions so that in and of itself is not anything entirely new or not anything revolutionary per se however what data bots are doing here is really different and it's kind of shocking the way that they're going about creating what they create I'll just read from their website to give you guys an idea of what's going on here we use a modified sample art in an architecture to generate music in modern genres such as black metal and math rock unlike MIDI and symbolic models sample art and generates raw audio in the time domain this requirement becomes increasingly important in modern music styles where Tambor and space are used compositionally long developmental compositions with rapid transitions between sections are possible by increasing the depth and network beyond the number used for speech datasets we are delighted by the unique characteristic artifacts of neural synthesis and one of the first ways I came across this project was through a little metal album off of their Bandcamp where apparently this record over here that is is next to me is the computer trying to reimagine or reapply sounds that it gained off of Crowl is's do tema which if you're familiar with math rock and black metal is a very large epic washy loud and atmospheric black metal album so as I play a little bit of what I'm going to play right here you guys are actually going to be hearing the the raw audio in the mix of this video here so let's go let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] that that's really weird it's it makes me smile because I'm actually kind of amazed by it it obviously doesn't sound like much and is not that inspiring from a compositional standpoint but the the aesthetic is there I mean it's not perfectly clean and well assembled and smooth out like the way that Crowell is's sound is but to me it's it sounds like I'm honestly listening to a live demo of Krauss there's kind of a weird trebly ambient noise around a lot of the sounds in the mix for some reason I don't know why exactly that is if that's kind of a kink that they need to work out in whatever they're making the computer do to generate these sounds but still I mean if you had told me this was a band of people playing live honestly I would believe you I mean maybe they're playing a little awkwardly and the performance isn't that smooth you know there is kind of a rigidness to the performance I guess you could say but what I'm listening to sounds like I'm hearing drums it sounds like I'm actually hearing guitars not the best recorded drums and guitars but it sounds like I'm actually hearing regular instrumentation like regular black metal atmospheric black metal instrumentation going through the list of other records that they have on their site they've actually kind of reimagined through this program other records that I enjoy Dillinger Escape plan's calculating infinity they've done some Beatles material too which is very surreal very odd and they've actually done one of my favorite rock records of all time battles mirrored so I'm actually going to be listening to a little bit of that right now just to give it a shot and just kind of see what the computers approach is when it's a style of music that isn't quite as Spacey and as washed out as Crowell is's sound by comparison battles is much more tight muscular and defined so how will the computer approach a sound and an aesthetic that kind of doesn't leave that much room open for mistakes a sound that is a little bit more precise [Music] [Music] [Music] I feel like I'm listening to the instrumentation or at least some of the parts of the instrumentation from one of my here rock songs just like spinning on a record player that is constantly speeding up it's slowing down speeding up and slowing down but then on top of it it's really hot in the room so the record the record is melting on the turntable too as it's spinning again sort of like the Crowley's track there's not a whole lot to hear compositionally it's very repetitious when it seems like a lead melody is going to pop in it just sort of seems very messy though the tone of like the keyboard of the guitar is certainly there it just seems like kind of sloppy and drunk and like not put together enough to sort of play like a clear concise melody and then there's the vocals and consistently whenever I hear a vocal mimicked through this program on any of these albums it's it sounds like I'm listening to like you remember the movie poltergeist where the girl is second the TV and you're kind of hearing her like calling to her parents from you know beyond that dimension where she's sucked in with it with the poltergeist and stuff and her voices like kind of manipulated and reversed and it like sounds really weird the vocals kind of remind me of that still they sound like actual voices though it's just that they are really kind of surreal and trippy and really freaky and a little unsettling but it doesn't sound like anything that you know couldn't be done with maybe a little bit of vocal processing or some crazy effects in the studio again I feel like I'm I'm in a weird place listening to this music in some ways aesthetically it's eerily similar like it's right on point again a lot like the Crouch track there are some weird pieces of ambient sound around the instrumentation it sounds like I'm listening to not a battle studio cut but like a really bad weird live bootleg or like a just like a demo from a bad practice session but still even though the recording isn't super clean it sounds like I'm listening to real instrumentation it sounds like I'm listening to a real musician play a thing except you know the performance is a little off I guess I liken the the the wild approach to tempo that this program takes a lot to I don't know like listening to captain be far in his magic band bang through all these crazy jazz rock freak outs on trap masks replica I don't know man I've heard a lot of computer-generated music in the past and sometimes the compositions that computers have come together with have been pretty impressive but I feel like what daddy bots have been able to accomplish with what they're doing here is even easier and freakier to a degree because this computer is also mimicking in a way the compositions and the chords and sometimes the riffs that these bands are coming together with but really truly it's it's mirroring in scarily accurate way the aesthetics of these bands which has a lot to do with the originality of a particular group or artists sound so guys I'm gonna link dad bot site and a lot of the band camps that they have put together down below in the description box give these things a listen let me know what you think of this computer-generated rock music and just how on the money it is or isn't I thank you guys for watching I'll see you in the next video transition have you given this computer-generated music of listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful over here next time I head is

C0C-ZtZapNM,hi everyone les that he do tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new first aid kit album ruins this is the 4th full-length album from Swedish folk pop duo first aid kit who I first stumbled upon in 2012 like most people did through their breakout album lion's roar the record wasn't one of my favorites of the year but I did walk away from it pretty impressed impressed by the sisters tight vocal harmonies rustic instrumentation dramatic songwriting style and it was sad to see some of that kind of evaporate on their follow-up albums state gold a few years later which was a slightly more measured and glitzy release by comparison while the instrumentation did seem bigger than ever totally soaked in reverb there was something kind of sterile about this record in my opinion the presentation of the music seemed like a little more mainstream and kind of watered down first aid kits sound wasn't nearly as cheap and as groovy and as melodramatic as like a band such as the Lumineers but there was definitely something about this record that kind of made me lose touch with the emotional connection that I had with their previous work despite the sisters very unique vocal chemistry fortunately ruins takes things in a bit more organic direction with a new flood of sound and instrumentation this thing is not simply a full chrec 'red I mean there's a lot of electric instrumentation on this thing these sisters are now dabbling in elements of country and Americana on quite a few tracks of this thing kind of pulling from the back catalogs of artists like Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris the duo's core songwriting characteristics haven't really changed all that much though quite a few songs on this thing still feature their cheek-to-cheek harmonies that typically reach into their upper registers soaring over swelling Fulk instrumentation on the chorus an effect that is enhanced by the extra layers of guitar and percussion and strings on a lot of these tracks case in point the song it's a shame great galloping epic folk pop tune and there are moments on this record where they're kind of breaking away a little bit from the incessant vocal harmonies to deliver some singing that is a little bit more stark and raw intimate the song postcard is an example + on this track there is a little bit of what sounds like pedal steel or some very nice sweet slide guitar a bit of a backwater groove too easily one of the route SIA songs the duo has ever put together and the song fireworks is this really sweet ballad in three that has a very humble simple introduction and the song gets more and more lush and dense and layered as it progresses and it just kind of hits this really epic finish against some dancing strings and a swinging drumbeat but even though I like that the sisters are changing things up sometimes their approaches to these genres outside the Fulk world can be a little basic like on the song to live a life which is not really one of the most entertaining tracks on the track listing here plus when we're looking at the lyrics sometimes I get the sense that whiskey and wine and driving on the interstate is about as Americana as these two Swedes get so truth be told there are some moments on this record where first aid kit doesn't really have quite as much bite as they did on their earlier material quite as much urgency there are moments on this thing that go a little middle-of-the-road and predictable the slightly new direction this album goes in doesn't drum up quite as many surprises as I had hoped for and depending on who you talk to first aid kits unwavering dedication to this harmonized vocal style on every record thus far could either sound like them just sticking to their guns or painting themselves into a corner however I would argue that this album on the whole and its best tracks their appeal doesn't really come down to their risk factor but rather their warm welcoming comfortable familiar and enchanting vibe and for the most part the grandeur louder larger more refined full chimeric on a country instrumentation on this thing enhances that I mean there are some spots on this thing where the duo's music almost becomes as epic as like a Fleet Foxes song occasionally the gargantuan size of these tracks kind of gets away from the duo or doesn't come off quite as spectacular as I think they had hoped like the chorus of drunken horns and Lala's at the end of hem of her dress just comes off like really ham-fisted to me kind of reminds me of some of the worst and most gimmicky days of the indie folk revolution of the 2000s you know like some really annoying Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros type stuff and for all of its volume and noise the final moments of the closing track on this thing just came off a little too measured I mean I like that they try to bring things to a distorted crescendo so that it's really an explosive ending but the pacing up until that point is just way too measured to feel like you're progressing toward anything that's really as freewheeling and really as wild as I think they want you to feel it is with the volume all that being said though a great deal of the tracks on this album are good and well written and well performed and well recorded and produced I'm just a little hung up over the fact that I feel like some of the shortcomings of this album just keep it just ever so slightly back from being the great album it had the potential to be because I do think that ruins was really close to being the duo's best record however I feel it's fallen a bit short still though this thing is packed with rich Fulk instrumentation tried-and-true chord progressions obviously the vocal performances are good and I'm sure most listeners looking for some very direct and to-the-point full pop are gonna enjoy this thing nearly from front to back I'm feeling a light to decent 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it too jaded what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just uh you know leave a thoughtful comments in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful alright you're the best over here next to my head is a another first aid kit review you can check out

S9gg0JOTF2E,dummy dummy dummy dummy dummy here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for a review of the new jpeg mafia album veteran this is the second full-length album from Baltimore rapper and producer jpg mafia aka Peggy whose music I've been aware of for a little while now communist slow jams black Ben Carson that collaborative EP project or whatever it was he had with freaky from which one of my favorite singles of 2016 came I might vote for Donald Trump previously Peggy has kind of been on the cutting edge of this recent movement of a very noisy abrasive experimental rap music but while his material was certainly admirable I didn't find it to be all that distinct so going into this new project over here veteran I didn't quite know what to expect I was just kind of crossing my fingers hoping for something fresher just kind of strolling into it because I was vaguely interested in his previous work and I got to say the dude did it on this album he did it this thing is 19 tracks it's 47 minutes and I was just overwhelmed by how sharp and textured and creative and experimental and off the beaten path and yet how catchy this record is in comparison with his last projects Peggy is definitely working with sounds that are a bit trendier this time around definitely more dynamic there are moments on this thing where a flow or a groove or a beat might remind me a little bit of what I might hear of like from little Ozzy Verte like from an Uzi vert project even a few moments where I heard like a touch of take Hays the race but again these seem like very mild influences sort of like Peggy is embracing these sounds as a means or as a vehicle to make a larger stranger artistic statement because while certainly there are whiffs of these more mainstream elements in his music the production and the song we hang and the lyricism is totally whacked but still definitely something I think fans of artists like the cool kids or especially clipping could certainly appreciate the lyrics on thing are kind of a mix of very self-aware like self-imposed ignorant raw absurdity dark humor and just unrelenting confrontation really confrontation with anything Peggy sets his sights on whether it be moderate Lib tardes or the alt-right misogynists as well as feminists the president bloggers soundcloud rappers overly sensitive white people I mean there are songs on this thing titled I cannot wait until Morrissey dies there's also a track on here titled my thoughts on neogaf dying and then the dejected repeated chorus on that track is I don't care I don't care of course this thing is littered with very odd strange references from Mortal Kombat to tinder the album's opening track contains a verse where he says that he wants a bitch with long hair like Mike C town Mike C town of dead and hip-hop when he said that when he said that line I felt it I felt it oh me too man to deeper into the album Peggy also promises to never go blonde like Kanye and fucka Johnny Rotten I want little B we'll probably go down as one of my favorite rap lines of 2018 but J pig mafias lyrics on this thing do go beyond funny bars and quotable one-liners there is an incredibly nihilistic satirical and very cutthroat tone to this album that I love it's just as heady as it is animalistic there's so many good things with this record I don't know I don't even know where to start I don't know where to start I mean there is the verse on baby I'm bleeding which is probably going to be one of the hardest things anybody hears all year there's a moment on the album where Peggy samples the legendary intro to the old dirty bastard song going down where he takes some of the throaty noises ol Dirty Bastard was making and obviously the and turns it into this like wild throat singing loop and just wraps over that relentlessly along with like these really strange fuddy drum hits there's kind of a watery guitar transition at one point that track2 it's one of the wildest instrumentals I've heard all year there's also the very off-kilter but sleek thug tears which features these sweetly some vocals with some light processing on them it sort of sounds like some alternative R&B from another reality there's also rock-and-roll is dead which features the strange popping samples soaked in reverb like cavernous reverb it's eerie it's strange it's freaky and pairs interestingly well with Peggy shouted rap verses eventually it blossoms into this really moody piece of cloud wrap which again is one of the many crazy sudden transitions and be switches all over this album Peggy manages to pack a lot into many of these songs as far as changes and new directions or detours even into the songs that are on the shorter side on a lot of these tracks you get an intro you get a verse and then really it could go anywhere from there the song germs kicks off with what's essentially just like a bit of a glitch hop vibe with monotone rap verses and then all of a sudden Peggy breaks into these screamed raspy falsetto vocals that they kind of remind me of Prince meanwhile another vocal is layered onto the track where he's making comedic jabs of people with liberal arts degrees like he's he's not taking himself for the world that he exists in too seriously it seems like he's trying to take the piss out of everything which is kind of another thing I like about the record it's not just being abrasive and aggressive for the sake of catharsis it's actually trying to prod and provoke anybody who's listening most likely in an attempt to get them to reflect on what their sensitivities might be I could really go over nearly every instrumental on this record and find incredibly intriguing sounds one-of-a-kind unique sample ideas very freaky percussive concepts I guess just go into this album expecting to hear that sort of thing trusting me that they're there as far as downsides I will say there are at least a handful of songs on this thing that I think could have been longer could have been extended places where I think the ideas that Peggy was delivering were very sharp and could have been fleshed out a bit more like the Lib tard track which I thought was hilarious that song really could have gone on for five minutes and it would have laughed the whole way from start to finish and there are definitely a few cuts as well where I think Peggy while the songs are longer and are a bit more gratifying he does get into the weeds a little bit Williamsburg I would say is a prime example of that so maybe into the future Peggy's long game could use some work but the vast majority of tracks on this thing are pretty short pretty all over the place and I do like the almost random disheveled quality of this project it makes it feel like the nastiest gnarliest craziest mixtape I've ever heard the album's unpredictability is kind of a quality that helps it because as the tracklist moves along Peggy continues to just kind of deliver left hook after left hook and even though the tracks on here may be short not the most satisfying they all kind of weave together into this very messy tapestry and as the album goes along it just kind of gets freakier and more harrowing and more hostile especially when you hit some of the finishing tracks on this thing 1488 and curb stomp overall love this thing one of the most off-the-wall and creative rap projects I've heard in a while feeling a decent too strong eight and gave it an eight but you forgot to flannel oh that's right I did throw it to me man we transition

z_ixgs91B-g,hey hey hey hey hey hey what up everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go or what I thought were the best and worst tracks of the week let's get through it not much to say to kick this one off outside of in the description box down there we have our amazon link and our turntable lab links if you feel like treating yourself or others hit up those links and let's get into the worst tracks of the week oh yeah whoa we're getting right into it worst tracks of the week whoa all right we're gonna kick it off here with the new Takashi six nine track Kiki featuring Hedy WAP at a boogie would a hoodie millions of views on this track however I'm not that into it I mean some of his cuts over the past year have been really hype really angry really hardcore kind of exciting but on this new song over here instrumental sounds kind of average for him he brings much the same flow and delivery that he does on every single track and really the only difference is that he has two rappers featured that are pretty much on the cusp of like being washed up so like personally I don't get it I don't see the hype I don't see the excitement but I guess the music video is pretty raw I will give it that moving on from there moving on from this cut this new Laurie Anderson track featuring Kronos Quartet man this was one of my most anticipated albums of 2018 and like this is this isn't this is not a great first taster unfortunately I mean typically I'm a big Laurie Anderson fan but for the most part this tractor sounds like some some bland neoclassical music and then Laurie does just like a little touch of spoken word toward the very very very very very end of the track which is really not one of our best performances just not really seeing what's so interesting about the song at all honestly moving on from there the new Kris Wu song featuring rich Brian jouji and trippy red you figure all those names in with Chris Wu like really trying to make his way in the West over here and like really grab a Western audience recently and I mean you you'd figure with all these names like how could it be mediocre Bauer did production on this thing as well you figured all these names how can it be underwhelming how can it be mediocre and yet it is there's a beat switch in the middle of the track where it seems like a majority of that portion of the song is overtaken by trippy red and Joji the first half is dominated mostly by Chris and by Brian Brian's bars generally are pretty weak on the track you really does not bring it at all that splitting the chicken line is one of my least favorite bars I think he's ever spit trippy Reds performance is pretty lifeless Joe G was fine you know I liked his intro on the second portion of the song but just generally it was really bland track again I'm really surprised given the names that went into this thing like how GART how gargantuan this track could have been it's just not it's it's really just not and finally this new Justin Timberlake track II's oh yeah yeah it's it's it's an awful song it's an awful frigging it's an awful nocturnal pop track with very little in the way of any personality and I'm gonna be tearing apart the music video pretty soon on the Fantana channel youtube.com slash Montano go subscribe over there if you haven't already goddamn do yourself a favor and that's it for the worst tracks of the week we're gonna get into the songs that was Matt on the songs that I felt were worth mentioning but I wasn't crazy about personally maybe you guys will like him a little bit more than me knew of Montreal single over here knew of Montreal titled pant pant or like paranoiac paranoiac intervals slash body dysmorphia and it's the first single from their upcoming record and I'm really not sure what to make of this track in some respect seems like there's a huge Prince and Bowie influence here which there typically is with a lot of Kevin Barnes recent stuff but it kind of seems like they're getting back into that vibe you know sort of like a little bit more of that hissing fauna vibe however there's like I guess like a dash of futurism to this track that seems a little bit new for of Montreal but I guess the song also feels a little awkward to me I don't know maybe more listens to it it'll actually grow on me or something but as of right now I'm pretty pretty lukewarm on it pretty lukewarm on it though it does seem like they're taking some risks I do admire that about the track moving out from their new hot snakes on Sub Pop Records they're gonna be dropping a new record very soon if you're not familiar with Hawks hot snakes they're very good rock band very noisy post-hardcore e rock band was kind of like a nice rock-and-roll sort of foundation to what they do all that seems to seems to ring true for this new single over here which is titled six wave hold down good track kind of mild on the ears but still a good performance still good guitar tones on they're still good riffs the vocals are decent too so you know welcoming the return of hot snakes for sure moving on from there Madrid man Hines I wasn't really crazy about much of what was on their last record but this new song of theirs it's titled new for you I like the lyrics the sentiment of the song I thought the lyrics are pretty cute I thought the kind of fuzzy buzzy production that they had going was pretty good as well the garage Rocky I guess like a blend of garage rock and pop instrumentation and production was very nice too definitely one of their catchy or tracks I've ever heard you know not the best I've ever heard in this style but certainly more bite than I've heard them have in the past and you know if you're looking for some nice sweet carefree and in fun kind of rock music with a lo-fi indie twist I guess give this thing a shot moving on from there Drake has a few new cuts out which he has released as this scary our single two of his more mediocre cuts that I've heard in a while honestly the a side of the single is maybe one of his most forgettable tracts in years the b-side was much more quotable but there was very little in the way of like a strong hook a great instrumental great energy there you know that one line about getting out of line with a stencil that that line was great and again very quotable song there were a number of good lines in there you know sometimes Drake has this fantastic ability to make these smart witty observations from the sort of perch at which he looks down on the industry although at this point who that on those who's even really thinking or conceiving any of this stuff or if it's all ghostwritten who the hell knows who really knows at this point so I mean the b-side is decent but I don't see it carrying him anywhere you know I liked the the quote ability of it I like the lyricism of it but it doesn't sound like a typical Drake banger does not sound like the the typical Drake track that would really kind of have that viral power behind it again maybe more of the a side it seemed like the a side had a bit sweeter of a sound but the hook was kind of weak you know it was kind of a mess I I really don't know tubes weaker tracks in my opinion honestly and does not make me excited to hear what he is going to be coming out with down the pipe you know typically you drop some new singles it's got to be hot and this this unfortunately is not that it's listenable though it's listenable and new Between the Buried and Me prog metal band typically a band I'm not that into and I'm not that into this two-track either but you know if you guys are into that sort of thing between the very din and me is definitely not a band that you you want to miss and most likely you you know you are aware of them already but just want to make sure that you guys know new record on the way new song out is titled condemned to the gallows some of the guitar work on there as usual is pretty incredible and there's one more that I wanted to shout out as well but it didn't make it into the list over here and that is the new preoccupations track spean aaj preoccupations formerly the band Vietcong before that their connections to the band women and and the new track is is okay it's decent it's got kind of like a weird noisy aesthetic to it the mix is kind of off in my opinion there's a fun call and respond chorus there that I think is really good that is really kind of one of my favorite things about the track but in my opinion the instrumentation just kind of sounds like a mess it really is one of their messily one of their more messy arranged and recorded tracks that I that I've ever heard so I'm not really sure what the oh it's for whatever reason the cover arts over here though it did not land in the this section for me but this is the cover to the new preoccupations album coming out this year it's titled new material new material if I believe correctly and again this new this new single espionage not really grabbing my attention not really wow me like the previous previous record I like that debut record you know after they sort of made the name change quite a bit a lot of interesting sort of cross-sections of underground rock coming together on that album some goth vibes some industrial vibes some post-punk vibes and stuff and those sounds seem to be coming together on this new track over here too but in a much Messier way maybe that's kind of the aesthetic of the new record and maybe the song will grow on me as I listen to it more when I hear the entire album but as of right now I'm guessing that might not be the case because I'm not really that impressed with the song on first impressions moving out from their best tracks best tracks best tracks got to give a shout out to my boys young fathers whoa young fathers ah in my view new album cocoa sugar dropping this year the Scottish trio is still bringing together elements of soul of hip hop of pop music of the avant-garde and it's just beautiful it's pretty it's a soulful and kind of stunning I think if an album is going to bring them to prominence it could be this record because their previous record in my opinion the previous full-length album was a little too white men are black men too that's just a little it was it was a little too low Phi you know I liked it a lot I thought it was great but it was just too low five for your average musical sinner to really get down with previous to that I didn't really care for the record that they had released because I thought the production was just really sort of stiff though the fidelity was higher it felt like a little lifeless in comparison it was not as energized and as I guess as as textured or as layered and as interesting as their previous mixtapes however this new song over here it sort of seems to have the best of both worlds it has the high fidelity it has the beautiful layered instrumentation it has that great energy it has the great songwriting has the interesting production hoping that young fathers can kind of take a next level with the single and with this upcoming album moving on from there we have a new single from Parliament yes that Parliament I'm gonna make you sick it's a great funk song with a fantastic sort of concept theme message bassline is killer instrumental is amazing the lead vocals are fantastic and again I just love the I just I just love the the the sort of prescription-drug themes and kind of the themes sort of attacking the pharmaceutical industry in the in the lyrics it's actually pretty smart pretty fun and I'm actually looking forward to this new Parliament record a lot I'm not even sure when their last album came out I know they you know but pretty non-stop over the years but I'm not even sure when the last record came out but based off this single based off of what seems like to be just a lot of renewed interest in in in Parliament as a whole I'm looking forward to seeing you know this this record potentially take off moving on from there OTT have a new track out titled disgraced in America it is the second of two singles that have dropped so far from this forthcoming album room inside the world as you guys know that I think this is their third full-length album really love their previous album and loving the new sounds and new sort of instrumental palettes they're introducing with these two new tracks this song over here is maybe one of their most dynamic yet a lot of phases to this song and obviously given the title some very political angles coming out of the lyrics too but I do love the vocal performance do like how the instrumental is kind of always changing up and evolving into something different and I feel like the band is are really kind of growing in some interesting ways and hoping that everybody's kind of taking note of that another band that I think is growing in interesting ways on the latest set of tracks promoting their forthcoming album is the band no age you might know the band they came out of that hole the smell scene in California their big breakout record I think came out in like 2008 but I've been listening to the band for like ten years now which is kind of crazy to think there's gonna be their fourth full-length album snares like a haircut and this new song over here is titled send me and it's actually one of the first tracks I've heard from the that like really struck me as a ballad a very pretty song all of the shoegaze a very beautiful serene guitar layers on this track or something to behold in my opinion and Dean's vocals are really vulnerable and kind of raw and confessional it's one of their most pretty and mellow tracks but there is kind of like an emotional urgency to it that's really nice I don't know that this is a really enjoyable track for me and to me like a track that in a very nice way kind of holds the shoegaze torch for the digital age moving on from there Phil elrom has a new massive track out new massive acoustic track out under the mount eerie name it is titled distortion you got to get into the lyrics of this track you got to get into the very long and very patient and very I guess meditative acoustic guitar playing on this cut there are a lot of great things about this track but if you're looking for something that is as straight forward as you know sort of the death oriented themes of the last record this is a little bit dodgy er but you know Austin in a funny way kind of compared it to some recent Sun Kil moon stuff but you know don't take that in the wrong way if you don't like Sun Kil moon you know it's it's obviously with the best intentions that comparison was made but uh yeah I'm like in the track and looking forward to sort of seeing what he does coming off of crow looked at me moving on from there cynic has a new track out cynic the progressive metal and alternative metal band cynic humanoid is the name of the new single new album out very soon and to me this kind of has a little bit more bite than much of what was on their last album the bass lines are incredible and dynamic and just just relentless and non-stop I was really impressed with the soaring lead vocals on this track too production was really clean but of course the performance energy was there it wasn't like sterilized and the cleanliness or anything like that overall killer track and I would say a reason for cynic fans to be excited you know are they ever gonna bring back the the you know days of their big breakthrough record I'm not entirely sure but I feel like the single is a good start a couple more left I love the new little pump and carnage track I shine little pump snapped on this track he snapped he would insane on this song Carnage's production is awesome carnage is slowly growing to be one of my favorite producers right now like what he did with young thug fantastic what he's doing with little pump fantastic what he did with Mac Miller just like a week or so ago fantastic loving the students beats loving the wailing crazy tones coming out of the instrumental here the drums are pretty straightforward but they hit hard you know it's a banger it's Bangor Shore Denair you know really he does a great job of supporting little pump because little pump while he's not the most lyrical guy in the block everybody knows that the beat doesn't now shine him you know it's really kind of the the energy that he puts on the mic that's a really kind of his selling point and he doesn't man he kills it he kills it and finally got to give a shout out to Black Milk Detroit and and producer who has this new record coming out very soon and the debut single from it laugh now cry later is incredibly produced really odd and freaky instrumental sort of seems like a lot of those qualities that we remember you know coming out of the Stones Throw scene coming from artists like mad lib when he was in his prime J Dilla when he was in his prime but sort of a push forward a little bit into some very freaky and and almost avant-garde territory so loving the sample work on this track letting the grooves on this track and and milk's lyrics are pretty nice too you know the the theme of the song generally is pretty dark pretty grim and liking how he's sort of as effectively able to put that into words because while he's not like the greatest rapper lyricist on the block I feel like he could put a good theme he can put a good concept together on a track I want to remind you guys of that album of his that I loved most recently if there's a it's not if there's a Hell below that was his previous record I believe and I didn't care for it that much it was no poison no paradise that is a great record there's also an amazing Black Thought feature on that album but yes if there's Hell below I thought it was okay came out in 2014 decent record didn't think it was his best material or anything but no poison no paradise incredible record in my opinion and now here we are a handful of years later and we have fever coming out very soon it's gonna be dropping in February via computer ugly so be on the lookout for that and those have been the best and worst tracks of the week again our Amazon and turntable lab links are down there in the description and thank you very much for watching everybody I remember all the songs and everything we talked about in this video they're linked down there in the description box so if you want to hear any of this stuff find out more about any of this stuff it's all in the description again thanks for watching Anthony Fantana see you in the next video forever 
iOec_uiEzJg,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and this is a quickie review of the new little skies project life of a dark rose little skies for you to know he is a Philly rapper this is big breakout project like many rappers riding the soundcloud wave right now he kind of built up to this with some pretty successful viral internet singles a lot of which dropped in 2017 those come together with a lot of extra tracks on this new project over here it's about 40 minutes and 14 tracks and honestly listen to this thing I don't see the hype I don't see how little Skies is going to outdo and outlast a lot of his competition on this tape I mean maybe if one of these songs blows up or something and I mean really blows up like Gucci gang size blow up I could see that happening but as of right now I'm not really hearing anything out of this tape that is standing out to me it just kind of seems like a very general generic standard crew knee almost like an alternative R&B flavored soundcloud rap pop trap rap affair the vocals are pretty dime a dozen very boyish very light on the ears there wasn't really a moment where the vocals or skies rapping where his flow kind of made an impression on me outside of the track I'll say strictly business because I think some of the vocal harmonies on that track were actually sort of stunning the melody was pretty sweet when one of these songs really ends up catching my ear it's when the production is doing something a little weird but even that is incredibly rare because the beats on this thing are so dime a dozen I'll say that this album while it doesn't seem like it's not a major label or anything it sounds like it sounds like one of the most marketable albums in this style that I've ever heard usually some of the rappers coming out of this scene and being cut from this cloth online have a little bit of a weird rebellious strange odd at least like a slightly vaguely experimental quirk or characteristic about them and Sky's doesn't seem to have that at all like that youthful exciting and risky edge that a lot of these rappers have especially the dudes coming out of the Florida scene he just does not seem to bring to the table sure his singing is a little more prominent and a little bit cleaner than a lot of these other rappers who are running with this very similar style and again I will say that it sounds very pristine very I guess sterile there's nothing too weird about it so I could see a lot of people listening to it and getting along with it but is there anything about it that truly stands out as far as instrumentals lyricism delivery flow personality in my opinion not really and you know of course with a lot of the rappers who are sort of riding this trend right now you're not getting a whole lot of technical ability or skill or pen game out of these records so we're already going into this not expecting that so of course in order to win audiences over or at least kind of blow me away you're gonna need some strong aesthetics you're gonna need a lot of personality a lot of character some some like serious hooks coming to the table too and this album doesn't really bring much of that it's just really kind of laid-back sleepy kind of reminds me of Bryson tiller a little bit but with just like a little bit more edge like very clearly more of a SoundCloud vibe going on but outside of that like there's not a whole lot going on with this project in my opinion it's pretty plain it's pretty average and and there's not really much I have to say about it beyond that I mean there are elements of it that kind of remind me of little Aussie vert maybe like a cleaner less obnoxious little Aussie vert however that doesn't necessarily mean that it's more listenable for me I mean at least little Aussie vert as annoying and his overbearing his vocals and sometimes his songs can be for me like at least when he comes through the banger he really comes through the banger I know a little easy verse song when I hear one and he does have a distinct character when he is on the mic when he comes on a track can't say that's the case for little skies though this just I don't know just seems like very everyday very vanilla very plain sheet of paper and that's that's pretty much my take over here next to my head is another video that you can check out you can hit that up or you can head up the link to subscribe to this channel Anthony Fantana little skies forever 
_zZhWdRpDHk,hi everyone I'm so woke I'm so woke here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for the latest installment of the y-you know review where I go over gauntlet style a series of records that I didn't have a chance or didn't have the will to do a formal full length review on some releases from 2018 I believe in here maybe not a lot of 2017 December stuff this is gonna be a bit of a backlog episode but still so y-you know review all right guys let's let's transition into that shall we here we go it's a Cannibal Corpse album you know at this point Cannibal Corpse they're not gonna change it up they're brutal they're nasty they're blood cake they're gonna stick to the meat and potatoes fundamentals of death metal and they pretty much are you know they sound a little bit heavier a little bit nastier than they did back in the day just ever so slightly because the production is just thicker and more intense but it's it's your standard Cannibal Corpse record Morbid Angel definitely made a return on this one you know it's not like one of their best records yet but it's certainly it's certainly better than the last album everybody knows that it's certainly better than the last album I mean in the grander scheme of things maybe it is just kind of a generic death metal record but hey you know what some of the riffs are pretty nasty on this thing the vocal performances are pretty nice and the production it's heavy but it's not it's not too super clean it's not too dolled up this is a God flesh record that is less on the blood pumping exhilarating like side of the spectrum more on the hey we're just going to experiment and do whatever our artistic whims tell us to do side of the spectrum which is okay it does make for kind of an inconsistent listen unfortunately I thought their comeback record was just a lot more solid [Music] while I didn't love this as much as the o'seas record the orc that came out last year I do encourage anybody who enjoyed that record to also try this out of course john dwyer has his mitts in this record too although it is not a hard punky sight garage epic like that album is it's more like a kind of experimental folk vibe it's pretty nice it's pretty sweet it's very Spacey very patience testing at points but still a pretty enjoyable record man I feel like ty dolla sign you have so much character and now it seems like everything he's doing is just I don't know appeal to the lowest common denominator in the commercial R&B audience like the dude has so much chops singing I feel like he brought so much to the table and saw in terms of songwriting that a lot of his contemporaries didn't and this release to me just says he's selling himself short he's selling himself short [Music] [Music] [Music] let's know Juicy J Alba it's actually pretty tight it's actually pretty nice there are a few songs here and there where seems like he's giving in really hard to contemporary trends in pop and trap in order to just kind of stay relevant hopefully get a hit out of it or something but flood watch amazing track his flows are great production all around is pretty good you know it's also Juicy J he's not the most dynamic rapper and an artist in the world so the album is slightly one-dimensional but hey you know what it's a little better than stay trippy I would say and really diggin it [Music] would have never foreseen a day where the bassist from corn comes through with a solo record where he's just he's just playing some bass the record is an entirely bass like he has guest musicians on they're mostly drums and it's just kind of him jamming on some drum beats and stuff I mean if you're a bass aficionado and you know your basis which field is very talented you know he made his mark on metal music in a way that very few other bases have so you know again bass aficionado metalhead you'll have a little virtuosity you want to hear some sick bass jams you want to hear feel the playing some sick like bass slap riffs and then over that like soloing on it or something give it a listen cuz honestly it's it's more fun than I thought it was gonna be not seeing the huge hype behind this Maxo cream project unfortunately like it's not terrible it's not terrible don't get me wrong but I felt like his previous projects were kind of average this one in my opinion kind average like the fundamentals were there he hops on decent production but the content of his lyrics and his kind of middle-of-the-road flows and his uh I don't know somewhat average voice to me just don't just don't stick out you know I mean I guess it's a good release for the start of 2018 you know certainly more solid than a lot of what we've been hearing as far as like December and the first leg of January but am I gonna be remembering this in December probably not I didn't review this buy movie drugs album last year I have no excuse you know I guess a lot of you guys really like the industrial hip-hop style that was coming through on this record I personally though thought it was just kind of messy and all over the place you know like it could have used a bit more grooming and a bit more fleshing out some of these tracks and I think the tracklist could have been pared down a little bit however tells a respect to Denmark Vesey because I think he did come through with an experimental project that has a lot of good ideas on it but are they organized into something that is a really compelling album I [Music] didn't review this cool kids record either I have no excuse here either it's actually kind of decent I mean it's it's better than fish ride bicycles it's better than fish ride bicycles it's a little long it's a little all over the place but hey you know the duo are back some of their best tracks and years on this thing quirky production style some fun lyrics they kind of overloaded on the features and there are a few songs here and there where it's pretty obvious that they're working outside of their comfort zone in an effort to maybe just kind of gain a new audience but hey it's it's not a bad album and certainly more solid than some of the more mainstream hip hop failures to come out in 2017 I I didn't really want to review this Willow Smith album I thought the lyrics we're really cringey with every new album Miguel gets like more and more mediocre I just don't see where is rock bottom when are we gonna hit rock bottom [Music] unfortunately I didn't dig on this new Miriam the believer album as much as I did her previous record and I didn't end up covering adding it a lot of requests for and it was hard for me to just kind of like find interest in the record for myself personally I feel like a lot of what attracted me to her last album was just stripped away on this album and what I'm talking about isn't just merely an aesthetic thing because for the most part the instrumentation and the wonderful vocals Miriam typically brings to the table they're all here but the long-form songwriting and the mystical vibes of her last album I kind of underestimated or maybe didn't even completely understand just how integral they were to making that record work for me making that record just an amazing listen because this album by comparison seems so much more straightforward the songwriting approach is way more direct and yet for whatever reason the songs in my opinion kind of fall flat on their face and don't really pop I don't really mind going more straightforward but I guess if your songs are gonna be that shape they've got to kind of hit a little harder and unfortunately as it's not the case for this new album I I just could not get past the vocals on this new Baths album I I just couldn't you know as much as I have enjoyed some of Bath's music in the past the the vocals really did get to me here they really truly did and I don't know why probably probably because I suck let's just let's just chalk this up to me sucking let's just say hey yet that he sucks and that that's why he didn't enjoy the new bath record he sucks I'm glad that it seems like Chief Keef is in a better place and it's nice that he still has fans that care about his music at this point despite him not being at the highest point of relevancy that he's been in a while and it's actually been kind of cool seeing the major influence he's had on a lot of this like new wave of soundcloud rappers we have out right now however I feel like him taking a more refined approach in his music for sure it's welcome to a degree but I feel like he's not really replacing high-energy and I guess the insanity of his older music with like I don't know and any compelling sort of substance and I also feel like it is a rapper as a lyricist he's just really kind of average still at this point his voice is still just very I don't know flat to me just emotionless kind of dry drab kind of lifeless and I'm just really not seeing the excitement behind this honestly

p6T46TrMB80,hi everyone nicely shaved tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new king gizzard and the lizard wizard album gumboot soup this is the last of five albums that the Australian psych band promised us in 2017 releasing just before the year was over and all those records last year it was a pretty wild ride it went from microtonal tuning to some very snazzy elevator jazz to a record that fits into I don't know I could only call the genre post audiobook now the band is settling down at the final leg of this five album run with a record that isn't quite as strictly conceptual or as thematic as the four that preceded it gumboots oops 11 tracks truth be told they're pretty all over the place anyone who's been following the band's work up until this point are gonna catch at least a few moments of deja vu on this thing like the very serene and pretty vibraphone x' and jazzy percussion on the track last Oasis which sounds like it could have been a cut on Brunswick East except with slightly more lush instrumentation and more interesting lyrics and then there's greenhouse heat death which is eerily similar to a lot of the microtonal material off of flying banana with it's very jammy driving rock instrumentation topped with all these very twangy noodley guitar leads Muddy Waters wouldn't have sounded too awkward on that same record either and the very speedy and intense blend of punk rock garage rock and psychedelic rock on all is known that track would have actually been pretty tight on nonagon infinity especially with its multiple calls of it's kind of their thing on the album given how much material the giz has put out before 2017 and how much material he put out in 2017 you gotta expect the band is gonna tread at least a little bit of water here however the buffet style approach the band takes to the tracklist on this thing leads to some very refreshing and novel moments to the song beginner's luck is a very warm and welcoming piece of psychedelic pop vivid lyrics pronounced drum fills some very nice keyboards too that are kind of droney kind of blissful the track is just a touch of Beatles worship I would say but kind of has a quirk all its own then toward the end of the record we have the very serene but groovy sleeping in the instrumentation is incredibly mystical and intoxicating it makes my head Bob but also my eyes clothes I love the hushed intimate vocals on this thing and easily it's one of the stronger Tunes on the album - the great chain of being is probably the heaviest song King gizzard has ever recorded the band's real first major foray into pretty much stoner metal in sludge metal the song is heavy as hell the production is great and they enter this style with a fantastic amount of class and personality - and and dare I say that I think they've actually out written some of the bands that have been toiling with this style for years because King gizzards approach to melody is just a little bit more refreshing and the song superposition is a very odd track it features a kind of linear kraut rocky groove to it and the vocal harmonies on this thing have some processing on them that leave them feeling almost like cybernetic there are also some very regal woodwinds worked in the instrumental too that kind of gives the music this epic ascending quality as far as my ears can tell this record is not really all that conceptual or not as cohesive as a lot of the band's recent material especially the four other records they put out in 2017 sure while there's not a whole lot of consistency on this thing it's really only stylistic consistency I still think the band is pulled together a great crop of tracks the performances the production the writing are all there and outside of a few songs that came off to me as being a little mild or a little redundant like they could have just fit on previous records king gizzard is still delivering some of their most interesting material yet they still remain to be one of the best and most intriguing and most exciting bands in rock today and I am feeling a decent strong seven on this album transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry you just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling full of thoughts over here next to my head is another King gives a review you can check out you can hit that up or click on the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana King gizzard forever 
r98hKTgtKiU,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new cupcake album for eyes this is the latest full-length album from a Chicago rapper by the name of cupcake who's been turning a lot of heads over the past few years with her very wild very eccentric style cupcake is a one-of-a-kind rapper with a one-of-a-kind sound and an lyrical style and she's been prolifically dropping one project after another since 2016 come cake Queen Elizabeth and now this new album also audacious how can I forget about audacious if you're not getting it now a cupcake she comes on a little strong in her music it's not gonna be for everybody and the lyrical substance of her music often is very vulgar very sexual almost to a point of being like a pure gimmick but while she does put out a lot of tracks that push the boundaries of lewd I've also heard a lot of cuts on her recent albums that honestly are pretty moving she kind of bares it all emotionally on these tracks going into her personal history with abuse double standard she feels are there in the politics of sex and gender politics too and she's also come out with numerous tracks advocating for fair treatment of the LGBTQ community so my point is while cupcake is very funny she is no joke I've been following her stuff for a little while now and it seems like she hasn't really changed not even one bit as her music has gained more and more and more attention rather than changing it up now that the spotlight is on her it feels more like she is just kind of slowly fine-tuning everything she's been delivering up until this point her flow her lyrics her hooks and f Rises another artistic peak for cakey you do get a lot of the same familiar themes and topics and and flows from previous projects but there are slight improvements all around her delivery for one is more aggressive and compelling than ever she not only sounds like she's just angrily spitting on the beat it sounds like she's devouring the beat that deep growly voice of hers just seems to get better and better with every album the flows on this thing are tighter too and her pen game on record is kind of bordering on insane on at least a few of these cuts like yeah sure she's not like this a one storyteller or anything like that but she's dropping these incredible one-liners on some of the bangers of this project that are equal parts hilarious smart like that one line about her shirt getting ripped during sex and and then with that shirt being ripped it would become like a Yeezy like a piece of ez clothing also some of my favorite lines on the song duck-duck-goose go as follows this that submarine pussy mr. clean pussy this that I'm about to fuck you longer than the limousine pussy high self-esteem pussy it's a dream pussy if you broke then the pussy acting funny like a meme pussy Oh God Oh God meme pussy prudes need not apply obviously things get even crazier on the track cinnamon toast crunch probably cupcakes most aunt performance on the entire record I got bitches trying to box me like I'm Cinnamon Toast Crunch that's a bar also I should buy these hoes real suits because I'm everything they slack slack what what kill him with his tie kill him with his tie kill him with his tie that's a tie die also that one line on spoiled milk titties where she's talking about not having this person touch her booty hairs and as a result of that feeling like Solange and the song fullest which is this bulletproof closing track that features a nice sort of Latin horn sample and a great groove to has this one line on there on the refrain where she is rapping about being cold with the stick like a popsicle so overall on this record cupcakes similes are really on point I think more on point than they've been on any project before this of course in the the midst of the tracklist here she also delivers some topical tracks the song cartoons is chock full of amazing and hilarious and somewhat deep occasionally animation references the song post pic is a very funny observational track about her Instagram exploits if you have not seen cupcakes Instagram it's it's it's pretty steamy for the older people only kids don't go there yeah don't she has a hilarious bar on this track about men pleasuring themselves to her pictures on Instagram and and doing that so often the phones are messing up and and likening that sort of sexual act as like having sex itself to the point where you would like get an STD and you would have to have your blood checked the song single while taken is a love song but kind of a love on the rock situation and actually a lot smarter than I thought it was going to be when I was going into it kind of rapping about how when somebody's cheating on you are not being faithful or isn't really present in the relationship it makes you feel like you are single but also while in a relationship you're lonely but a part of a duo the song crayons is yet another tribute to the LGBTQ community not one of the best I think that she's penned but I do enjoy the sentiment of the track and I do like the angle she's taken here trying more to just kind of admirably and respectably take a picture of the community or kind of a party that she's attending there and self interview is probably the most grim and most introspective track that I think cupcake has put out thus far she has a lot of songs along these lines where she kind of self analyzes looks at her own behavior questions herself wonders where she can improve and how she can do better while also reflecting on the shortcomings of the world at large this to me is her most compelling track going in that direction overall cupcakes fundamentals on this record are better than ever I feel like she's come a long way when you compare this to a lot of her earlier material a lot of her flows a lot of the production some of the lyrics they're pretty rough around the edges I feel like listening to cupcake for the short amount of time that I have has been really a lot like just watching an artist craft their foundation and kind of grow into themselves so while those improvements are there I can't deny them there is an element of this record where I feel like the novelty has worn on me a little bit like I'm just merely listening to a slightly more polished version of something that I've already heard and while I do think this is cupcakes most professional sounding project yet I love her brazen sexuality I love her rawness I love her authenticity and I love her outlandish lyrics as well don't think she's bringing a whole lot in the way of new dynamics to these themes and to these ideas that she hasn't before it just kind of sounds better and more technically sound however my one major issue with this record and this has been a consistent issue I've had with cupcakes music in general is that I feel like the production it's pretty generic it's pretty dime-a-dozen it's your standard track banger affair unfortunately cupcakes beats in my opinion do not really truly reflect her unique personality there are a few tracks on here that feature an interesting melody or sample maybe a little bit of a dancehall vibe but honestly for as insane as an MC as cupcake is I feel like her production sadly continues to be an understatement like for as sexual as the song spoiled milk titties is I feel like going the slow subtle route on on that track was was not really the best direction among other production decisions on this record all that being said though I still think this is cupcakes most consistent solid and entertaining album yet I'm hoping this album isn't her last peek though because I feel like they're still improvements to be made from here I would love to see her open herself up to new themes new production styles that really truly complement her raw unique style and hopefully listeners continue to take to what she's doing on this record because I think cupcake really is truly a special rapper that not enough people are listening to right now I'm feeling a decent a strong seven on this thing transition have you given this album listen did you love it too Jane it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it's like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments

WY1cW0FZxm0,hi everyone wreaths Annie Greta no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Jeff Rossen stock album post New York singer-songwriter Jeff Rosenstock wants the frontman for the band bomb the music industry contemporary punk band that had some decent records in the 2000s wasn't crazy about them myself but that is partially why when Jeff went solo I was not so intrigued not so sitting on the edge of my seat to hear that however I feel like you really kind of came through and wowed me in this solo capacity especially when he broke through with records like we cool that was in 2012 not only was there a punk-rock aesthetic on this record but also a power pop one too like Jeff's songwriting really shined through this punk rock sound with these really memorable kind of funny self effacing songs that were really catchy and thymic and and kind of revealing two toward Jeff's character getting down right to the Nitty Gritty of his emotional problems and anxiety and neuroses now I just follow up album worried the lyrics got a bit more political the production got a little bit rougher and the overall flow of the album was a bit more seamless almost like I was listening to a some kind of punk rock opus or concept record and Jeff is essentially striking while the iron is hot following that record up with this new album over here just over a year later he also recently hit fans up with that dramamine single back in 2017 but again here we now have post this is ten tracks forty minutes and it contains material that almost feels like a little bit of a reiteration of Jeff's last album worried which is not necessarily a bad thing in a lot of ways worried is his best record yet he is a very compelling singer and songwriter he displays a great amount of conviction in his songs but also he's very good at playing this dejected sad-sack angle that kind of reminds you of who the big boys are and who the pretenders are who don't really kind of have that emotionally cutting delivery or writing style and instead just trying to force an emotional reaction out of their audience Jeff's music and writing just has this power behind it in my opinion that that kind of makes the individual listening feel small and reminds them makes them conscious of the fact that they're kind of being ground up in modern societies gears and that is the case with this new record over here especially when Jeff is kind of building on a lot of what he did on worry with longer more massive more gargantuan and epic songs the song USA is a prime example of that at 7 minutes long and undergoes multiple shifts in these epic musical punk rock passages lyrically Jeff kind of flips through all of these pictures of I guess his emotional numbness toward American culture some cashier like a corner store or something giggling and a dad driving badly and in a crossover with his family all this builds up to this amazing huge powerful refrain of we're tired wet bar that really just kind of takes all the pent-up anger and the the aggravation of everything jeff has been singing about up until that point just out into full throttle the song let them win is similarly anthemic and fed up there is a huge power struggle theme going on in this track the song builds up into this massive whoa-ohh-ohh chorus and eventually kind of coasts out into this very beautiful serene ambient drone that pretty much sees the album out another songwriting highlight that stuck out for me had to be 9 out of 10 which didn't stick with me because it's as big and as epic as some of the other tracks on this record rather it's a very sad modest song with antisocial lyrics and a very sad tune and listening to this track I can't help but literally envision Jeff Rosenstock just stoned and bummed out on the subway the issue I have with a good deal of this record though is that its tunes and it's slightly sloppy performances aren't quite as exciting and as up to snuff as they were on worried and even when they are it just kind of feels like Jeff is going through the motions or this is just kind of like an average moment for him I would say the overall quality of this record is is almost on par with we cool it's kind of almost there but is there a track on this thing among the two to three-minute cuts that is as catchy and smart and novel as hey Alison or hall-of-fame or especially nausea mmm the closest I think Jeff comes to doing that on this record is the dreary alt rock ballad TV stars TV star don't care about who you are yeah I mean honestly they probably don't celebrities probably don't really care about you yet we are so infatuated with them like something to consider as we yet again float the idea of electing another celebrity president come on guys come on but honestly a lot of the faster harder punchy or cuts on here while they are decent they just kind of run as like a blur for me beating my head against a wall has to be one of Jeff's most insipid songs yet like not really his most inspired writing especially from a lyrical standpoint I feel like tracks like Melba powerlessness your throat also black a certain kind of stickiness and excitement for Jeff Jeff solo discography isn't even that vast right now and yet he somehow hit this peak of predictability with these several tracks I wouldn't say they're terrible songs though still listenable still somewhat enjoyable there's just not a whole lot about this record that's making me want to come back to the entire thing you know there are a couple tracks that felt really epic really ambitious some of Jeff's best material yet a couple songs that really pulled at my heartstrings but outside of that much of the album just came off average to me you know the record is likeable but it doesn't stand out outside of a few cuts I'm feeling a decent strong six on this thing Trey mmm have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you the best what should I review next at the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling

there's also a new iron Reagan and gate creeper split out right now for those of you who are more into the loud rock side of things alright let's get into the worst tracks of the week worst worst worst all right we're gonna kick it off first with a little bit a little bit of very bland dream pop I guess rye they have a new track out new record coming on the way track is titled song for you it's it's probably one of the project's most non songs I've ever heard like it's so faint and it's so skeletal that it just doesn't seem like there's much at all going on of interest in my opinion like the vocals are barely there the instrumental is is so scant it seems like at this point rise just trying their hardest to make as little interesting sounds as possible and I'm not sure I quite get the appeal but uh honestly I've never really been that deep into the group to begin with I mean some of the earliest singles were pretty sweet and very refined like sophistic honestly off the off the dream pop deep end for me moving on from their new track from Matt and Kim forever I new record on the way and and it this is a title track or this is this this is the first big single rather and right now Matt and Kim to me sound like they're having a really awkward time transitioning into the sound of the new age just a sort of Tegan and Sara have you know with a lot of their new records - not really enjoying the more electronic and the more obnoxious sound they're going for here I I don't know what it is with so many pop and rock bands from kind of like the myspace era I'm just like going full like I don't know electro pop or whatever it's it's especially when they're not particularly good at it I get that it's kind of trendy I get that everybody wants to blow up and then sort of be the next Coldplay and and right now in rock music there's not much of an underground to kind of thrive off of but I feel like that's gonna continue to be the case as long as everybody kind of keeps abandoning the sound and abandoning the genre and and making records like this moving on from there did not care for the new Justin Timberlake single a tall man of the woods being the new album he has out or coming on the way rather and this the song titled filthy is I don't know it's kind of funky it's kind of electronic the music videos super pretentious like he's pretending to be Steve Jobs or whatever and just do not care for the instrumental at all the instrumentals like almost trash like like I hate just how many modern pop songs just kind of incorporate these really tacky like stale and really dated EDM sounds you know like I feel like a lot of these trends have totally come and gone and people are still trying to feed off of them like vultures and I'm just not seeing the appeal and and to me vocally this is not even really one of Justin's most impressive tracks so I don't know I feel like the instrumental kind of dominates the song a little bit and the instrumental isn't even that interesting to begin with moving on from there Jack white in my opinion has just literally put out his worst song ever connected by love and while the b-side to this track respect commander is leagues better both tracks feature a very jittery groovy clearly electronic vibe and feel I think this is gonna be Jack White's electronic record to everybody is is really like jumping on board for the surfer I guess the synthetic age and and I wonder if this is eventually gonna kind of rubber band back and we're gonna see people go back to sort of more organic and more acoustic aesthetics just because we're gonna kind of get an overload of stuff like this quite literally on this track you kind of have these like revving synthesizers that almost sound like vaguely dubstep ish a little bit lyrically and melodically like it's it's one of Jack's worst and laziest songs I just don't get the point of this track already it's January 2018 and I feel like I've heard one of the worst songs of the year like this track is so awkward it badly structured the groove is is like almost not there what little groove there is is just like really really like I don't know clunky and it's it sounds like it sounded like the groove on this thing is Frankenstein it's so awkward and just like like it's it's kind of lumbering around and like a I guess are like a really horrid way I I do not care for this track at all again I I think it's I think it's one of his worst worst pieces of solo material ever again respect commander better you know smoother track more interesting grooves more interesting for a production but uh but it does not make up for connected by love it really truly does not moving on from there let's get into the tracks that I thought were kind of meh this week not amazing but certainly worth shouting out thought thought they were decent a new turnstile track I thought was pretty cool definitely not the crazy hardcore kind of almost like almost alternative metal slightly like rap metal to a degree hardcore metalcore vibe that the band has kind of been riding on this track is so much more melodic and easygoing didn't really have a strong flavor in in my opinion I felt like one of their blander tracks not quite as exciting but new record coming out soon and I'm willing to kind of just see this through to a new album to really hear the bigger picture of this record and and hear if it really kind of comes together into something interesting again if I haven't said the track is titled moon tribulation has a new track out new album on the way as you guys know I've been teasing toward and talking about new songs from it however this while it's not terrible it's maybe my least favorite song teasing toward this record I've heard so far the vocal presence on this track isn't really there the vocals seems super obscured to the point where it they almost sound like background vocals like the this thing really could have used a louder lead vocal and beyond that the instrumental search seems to be in their usual I guess kind of anthemic melodic gothic style like didn't really stand out to me in in any way shape or form in comparison with a lot of their usual stuff that I've enjoyed from them in the past MGMT has a new kind of washed out very Spacey psych pop single not quite as interesting as the singles they've released so far it's it's a slow burner it's a ballad couldn't work a little bit better in the context of the record marshmallow has a new collaborative track out with little peep truth be told I'm I'm still not like super crazy about little peep sound however this track is probably one of the I guess better produce that I've ever heard him on given that it is marshmallow you do kind of have like this high-grade very glossy very glitzy EDM style production so um you know if you want to hear little peep over just like very clean very glossy very hard-hitting and very refined production you're probably going to want to hear this track I think it's one of his clearer and better recorded vocal performances as well so even though I am not crazy about it I even I can see that this is like probably one of the best little peep tracks that you're ever gonna hear you know and and and that's good that things are sort of on a high note especially since it's a posthumous track so I'm moving on from there I do enjoy the new Cali you cue kiss you to just track I need to learn to pronounce that because I'm an idiot and I told myself I was gonna do that and I forgot but she has a new very smooth kind of neo soul flavored track out featuring Tyler the Creator and Bootsy Collins that I like quite a bit the production vibe is very much like similar to that a flower boy I think you guys will dig the track a lot her voice in the past has always come off to me as just being like a little bit sleepy kind of like I'm listening to a very sleepy uninteresting version of little dragon or something but I feel like vocally she has stepped it up or herself a little bit this time around I feel like she's really kind of coming into her own as a vocalist a bit more and I think Tyler does bring a lot to the track Bootsy brings some fun additions to the cut to David Byrne has a new song out titled everybody's coming to my house and there say there are some things that I really admire about this track for one how wild and off the frigging wall the vocal is like David really lets loose vocally on this track like he really kind of brings it back to the yell P weird totally strange and and to a degree even freakier vocal twitches that he would do on so many Talking Heads records the instrumental I think is a little too calculated and a little too rigid to reflect that wild energy which does kind of make the cut a little underwhelming to me but still a good track and a song that kind of makes me look forward to this this new record and shout out to bus driver who dropped like a luciana soundcloud titled gush which is just as jittery and intense and as intricate as one would want a bus driver to be a bus driver track to be hopefully he drops a new record this year that would be amazing like a great quality perfect hair follow-up would be fantastic and here are the best tracks the tracks that I love the most this week got to give a shout out to the new tune yards cut new tune yards heart attack really loving the alternative dance experimental kind of indie dance style that they've been going for seems like they've been kind of just pulling out all of the kind of the African music influences and the the like all the international music influences that have been in their sound and have been going for something a little bit more straightforward in this track like some of the instrumentation on this thing is super sour super dissonant a little dark in a way this this in a way is like almost some of their most tortured and harrowing material in a way especially with this a music video like it's a really odd really uncomfortable really unsettling kind of music video the intensity of all of their weird movements and just the the staring right into the camera it's just really really freaky and really odd I like it probably my favorite singles so far from the bunch but that's that may be subject to change once I hear the entire record portal has a new record on the way via profound lore few new tracks out from it now one that stood out to me is freaks if you didn't know these guys are an Australian death metal band one of the weirdest and most experimental and I guess cacophonous out there right now their music like literally sounds like pee like falling down for an eternity into Hell itself and new material does not does not miss out on sort of delivering that same vibe as well really enjoying this new track also enjoying this new track over here titled King's dead featuring Kendrick Lamar future James Blake this is Jay Rock's new single J Rock of obviously excuse me freaking Top Dawg entertainment this single is also gonna be featured on the new Black Panther movie soundtrack but it's also serving as J Rock's first single for his forthcoming record really enjoying Kendricks contribution to the track loving the production and the energy of the song like seems way more amped and way more in-your-face then a lot of the material that ended up on J rocks last record although he did have some teaser material in that album cycle that didn't even make it onto the album itself so I'm hoping that well no I actually no because I've already read that this is going to be sort of the promotion for the new album so I imagine it's gonna be on the new record direct connection with the new record not just some Lucy track to get people excited so I'm hoping that we hear that junkyard side of Jay rock through and through but of course balance out with some Melora moments - on this new record that I know has been there but I feel like he hasn't really kind of like dug it out fully to just lay it all out there onto a new big massive commercial project that you know everybody is gonna be looking for and looking at because it's toppdogg moving on from there enjoying this new IDI Schrader's music beat track which believe it or not is is produced by Dan Deacon of all people dunce is the title of the song and Ed traders music B if you didn't know our music duo whose tracks I've always been kind of lukewarm on in the past I've always enjoyed how noisy and just how like raw the energy of their music is however like as a duo they really really really have made it a point to make their music sound very straight back very skeletal very minimal so bare bones so the rawness of the energy of the songwriting is really kind of the selling point to the track I've always thought that their their tracks could use more layers and this track this song over here really brings that like it sounds kind of like a weird goth rock post-punk hybrid it's super heavy it's super dense you can tell that dandy can really kind of thickens the the duo's sound up and really loving the vocal performance on this track to really kind of brings me back to some of the more animalistic vocal performers and in the punk underground and in the post-punk movement so really enjoying that quite a bit a couple more tracks over here that I wanted to shout out loving this new carnage song if you didn't know who Carnage's a DJ producer he worked recently on that EP with young thug that made it on my EPS of the Year list he has a new track out featuring made in Tokyo and Mac Miller and it's a total banger it's amazing learn how to watch it's fantastic beats fantastic Energy's fantastic it's actually one of Mac Miller's best verses I've ever heard him lay down one of his best features like this has to be like a top 3 Mac Miller feature honestly like out of all of his features it has to be a top 3 feature it's that good his energy is that is that high and I feel like lyrically it's totally on point too so really enjoying what the came together here on this collaborative track hoping carnage continues to collaborate with more people carnage continues to you know put together more tracks like this if there's honestly a producer album that I would be excited to hear right now and there's a lot of producer albums that come out that honestly it's so it's so much of a chore for me sometimes because there's not a whole lot of flow to them like the people who jump on track are not delivering their best best best stuff and it all just kind of said it all just kind of like runs like a mess in a compilation at the end of the day it's it just feels like a bunch of random beats a bunch of random features and nothing really kind of threading it all together as far as like consistency or quality but honestly like from what I've heard so far with young thug what i've heard with this track and other tracks that he's produced and worked with other artists on like if there's a producer album i would be excited to hear right now it's Carnage's it really is a few more got to give a shout out to will toledo of car seat headrest who has a new revised version of right here his most legendary band camp album he has sort of a revised version of the track nervous young Inhumans and keep in mind I didn't really enjoy wills car seat headrests previous band camp material all that much if at all you know I found it really underwhelming a really kind of messy I didn't quite see the magic there that a lot of people did so maybe for some people this new revised a new rerecorded stuff sucks you know and that that may in fact be the case to me though I'm really loving the energy I'm really loving the new layers of instrumentation really liking how he's reinventing these tracks from top to bottom and I know this new version is going to be put out in Matador records this year so I'm just excited to hear that like I think it sounds really good it sounds good to my ears you know hopefully it's not disappointing fans because this revised version of the record may turn me into into a real believer of the older car seat headrests stuff and finally the last track I wanted to shout out is this new song from Andrew W K who has a new record coming out this year Andrew looking buff as hell on that front cover and the song is titled music is worth living for and it just kind of isn't Andrews usual get wet like thick almost like too densely produced glitzy hard rock party party party rocks and the the there's kind of like a new epicness a new anthemic 'no stew it which i think is just kind of specific to this song given the title to given the topic given the subject you really kind of feel like Andrews really kind of singing from his heart on this subject matter and and is you know kind of putting some extra passion to this because in a lot of ways this is literally like his return to music which he's been teasing for years which we've been kind of crossing our fingers for four years I don't know why it in this musical landscape of all musical landscapes he would choose right now right here to return but it'll be interesting to see him come back and see what that does and what the result is I'm loving the track you know I think it kind of throws it back to a lot of his big break out records best qualities and you know hopefully he follows through and then that's all I can say so those are my best and worst tracks of the week this has been your weekly track roundup again shout out to the good people over at see geek link down below to check them out and support them for supporting the segments and all of these songs that I've talked about in this segment are linked down below obviously so there you go guys all right I'll see you in

RUAXoNP9WiU,
s2JoHn31pyw,whoo-whoo-whoo everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd 27 teens over in dead it's 2018 here's my most anticipated albums of the year maybe I'll do a follow-up video at the middle points of the year once we have you know kind of a better idea of what's coming out in the second half of the year but as of right now there are quite a few releases slated for 2018 let's talk about some of the artists that I know have records coming out that I'm really really excited for and some of the artists that I'm just kind of crossing my fingers on and hoping they drop something one new Earl Sweatshirt this year God there better be a new Earl Sweatshirt album this year I hear there's going to be an earl sweatshirt album this year I really want to hear what he's going to do next see if he builds on some of the grimy and very dark sounds from his last record youth a little bit more ambitious let's see hoping Travis Scott has a new record coming out very soon in 2018 that I'm looking forward to hoping that he actually kind of builds on the sounds of rodeo and gets past kind of this mediocre phase I think he's caught in the midst of I know migos have a new record coming out soon they've been teasing the hell out of culture too and I'm hoping that happens in 2018 also looking forward to a new Flying Lotus record very soon I haven't seen a whole lot of like hard promises on that but I have seen you know like some teases here and there I'm kind of hoping that ends up being the case Death Grips should be doing something at some point this year they had a somewhat quiet 2017 just kind of dropping that steroids mix slash EP thing which I enjoyed quite a bit liked it quite a bit looking forward to seeing if maybe some of those sounds those gabber sounds turn up on their next project after that Drake should be doing something this year he has been kind of teasing toward this idea of being like in a musical hiatus or sabbatical but I think he's probably going to drop something a little bit more significant than that more life playlist before he ducks out for a significant amount of time then we have Kanye West he should be dropping something this year I'm hoping he drops something this year I'm hoping he doesn't spend 2018 to quiet I know ASAP Rocky should have something coming out this year hoping push @t does something though I haven't heard a whole lot of promises on that still though I'm kind of crossing my fingers it seemed like his last project was like more of a teaser more of like hey this is like this is just a little bit of what I actually have coming out and then like nothing bigger ended up coming down the pipe just sort of wondering like if Pusha has it in him to sort of drop like a sizable project on his own because his you know past couple releases have just seemed believe they're a little underwhelming or like hey this is kind of pushing me towards something more after that I know Julian Casablancas and the voice whose last record I enjoyed quite a bit have something coming out in 2018 really looking forward to that I love hearing Julian is sort of in his more experimental element when he's with the voids I know the alternative metal band a perfect circle have a new album coming out very soon I know that there have been teaser tracks and there's actually been talk of a new tool album very soon - I mean I've been wanting you to album for years honestly and it would be kind of insane for a new tool record to somehow drop around the same time as a new perfect circle album it would just it would just be too much it would be too much Maynard it would be too much moving on from there Brock Hampton team effort want to hear that want to see in here if they're gonna be topping all those saturation records like I'm so psyched Brock Hampton hype J idk I really enjoyed a lot of the elements of his last record seemed like he was really kind of wearing his influences on his sleeve quite a bit hoping he kind of gets past that stage and into something a little bit more distinct and original seems like the dude has a lot of talent just waiting to hear that executed in such a way where it's a bit more refreshing and kind of in its own lane hoping the experimental hip-hop group known as clipping comes back very soon with a record really loved the conceptual experimental and and very odd sci-fi rap Odyssey they dropped with their last record hoping they'd continue to challenge listeners in such a way with their new material cattle decapitation I'm hoping comes through with a new album that would be awesome Frank Ocean is he gonna be dropping some kind of EP or project very soon he sort of spent a bulk of 2017 just dropping these single tracks here and there and kind of hoping for something more sizeable this year moving on from there Reena saw a yama who had my EP of the year in 2017 is she going to be working with clarence clarity again or other producers to come together with a full-length commercial album incredible pop artist and singer waiting to see if she kind of hits while the you know iron is hot strikes while the iron is hot in 2018 and delivers something more sizeable also Clarence clarity himself has a new record coming out very soon thought it was going to drop in 2017 seems like it's actually going to be pushed to 2018 now and just hoping to see him kind of dominate the underground pop sphere in 2018 because the dude has incredible songwriting and producer chops and I feel like he's really not being fully appreciated right now Charli XCX is she gonna go above and beyond this mixtape phase that she was in in 2017 and sort of put out a huge weird freaky and insanely catchy commercial record this year cupcake has a new record out I just say she has a new record out I'm looking forward to listening to it looking forward to reviewing it really want to hear that Freddie Gibbs should be coming out with something this year I'm hoping I thought his last project was just kind of like a hey you know I'm out I'm back and here's just like a little bit of material here with some lyrics about what I've been through over the past year or so and now that he's back I'm waiting to see him kind of get back on his grind deliver some of his best stuff again hoping Vampire Weekend has a new album this year really enjoyed their last record not quite as amazing as contra in my opinion but still you know I kind of need some catchy preppy III have more money than I know what to do with so I don't really need to release new music but I'm going to anyway because I'm just nice vibes ghost mane I'm hoping to hear something from sizeable this year really kind of got turned on to his music and enjoyed his stuff this past year at least a little of it and waiting to see if he kind of really I guess kind of hammers out some of the weird rough-around-the-edges qualities of his music and comes through with this I don't know this this fully realized dark goth metal trap sound that I'm really not hearing anybody do at his level at this point looking to see if bones does something interesting this year though I kind of anticipate he will be on his usually prolific grind with his usual sound Anderson Pak I want to hear something big from this year whether it be a solo record or a collaboration fka twigs I want to hear continued pushing the envelope this year hoping here Kimbra put out a killer record this year thought her new single was pretty funky and okay definitely some left-field but incredibly exuberant and catchy pop music a first aid kit should be dropping something very soon the singles the duo have been releasing in 2017 I thought I've been very good and showed a lot of promise thought the album would come out earlier but it seems that you know it's actually going to be dropping in 2018 enjoying the new material from tune-yards more than I am not so the experimental indeed very rhythmically enhanced hindi outfit I already said indium amaura they're back new singles really liking them kind of seems like they're going for a sleeker sound this time around not necessarily a bad thing Fall Out Boy has a new album coming out very soon thought their record that dominated some of 2017 was awful and I don't know I guess I'm just kind of curious looking forward to the new no age album the noisy shoegaze experimental punk duo have something coming out very soon I hope really enjoyed the new single to their latest record hoping that it's a bit more sizeable and more listenable than their last record which seemed more like a weird thrown together art piece more than it did like a proper album I've been enjoying the latest material from porches so I'm really looking forward to seeing sort of how and where that develops on this new record like their new stuff doesn't really sound much of anything like their old stuff in my opinion and ultimately that's good I feel like this new material is a bit sexier that moodier a bit more well produced so I'm looking forward to seeing how that kind of pans out on this new record ty Segall looking forward to seeing what he does this year hoping he puts out a more experimental project this year I feel like he had a somewhat predictable 2017 in my opinion looking for him to I guess do something a little bit more out of the box this year efrem men will mennick or you know from God speed you black emperor has a new solo record coming out very soon Brian formerly known as rich chigga he's changed his name he has a record coming out in 2018 hyper on this dude has been building and building and building and building he's had some of the hottest tracks a lot of people are looking for him to you know just kind of be this new face in hip hop right now that's just bringing a different tone a different vibe a different style and I don't know this record cannot not be big you know it can't it can't not be big it has to be a big like whether the record is good or bad it's gonna be a huge record it's gonna be a splash a lot of people are gonna be talking about it and looking forward to kind of seeing him kill it you know I think I think he will I'm thinking good thoughts I'm praying good prayers for this album franz ferdinand hoping they pull through with something interesting this year i mean maybe not i feel like their prime is kind of gone but you know there's still potential there i do love their approach to groove and i do love their energy laurie anderson has something coming out with the Kronos Quartet a lot of people aren't that into Laurie Anderson I am I know even if I don't review it I personally I'm going to be curious for whatever she ends up dropping with them the art rock and post-punk band known as ought have a new record coming out very soon have been really enjoying the more synthetic and more out there direction they've been taking their music in from what I've been hearing so far screaming females have a new record coming out very soon really looking forward to that it seems like their new set of singles and songs have been much more dynamic than usual seems like the songwriting and song structures have been getting more ambitious so I'm looking forward to seeing that kind of play out in an interesting way Andrew W K should have something coming out very soon from what I understand could be totally wrong on that and andrew has teased music in the past and then kind of totally ducked out back into obscurity but I'm hoping that doesn't end up being the case that we actually hear something interesting from Andrew W K this year David Byrne I know has a new album coming out very soon chromeo I know has a new record coming out in 2018 though I have not enjoyed the new single all that much to be completely honest but still I guess I'm kind of just pulling because I have enjoyed their music quite a bit in the past I do love the synth funk sound I do love their sexy vibes I do love the their sense of style Bruce Springsteen may be something this year that I'll enjoy a ski mask the slump god god I want an album ski mask the slump god that sounds great I want a great commercial record from ski mask Allah thump God great features great verses high-energy incredible production just something that blows everybody's minds just something that blows everybody's brains to frigging smithereens that's what I want to hear this year I want to hear that I want to hear a lot of these soundcloud rappers fucking take it next level okay you're on soundcloud you're getting all these plays and a lot of you guys sound the same take a next left I'm breaking your balls moving on from there I know Pig destroyer has something coming out this year want to hear one of the best bands in friggin grind drop a new record this year Lou the human like the the the great new hope for rap music right now everybody is making a big deal about Lou the human I enjoyed his a humane e AK project in 2017 dude raps real nice he's got bars he's got flow a lot of dark undertones to his lyrics and his themes seems to have a big sort of Eminem inspiration they're a bit of a Tyler the Creator slash Earl kind of odd future vibe to a degree really think he's kind of got potential do his own thing though looking forward to that I hear Wiley is gonna drop something this year I've seen his a pre-order for his new album up on iTunes really loved his last record so looking forward to hearing him kill it this year MGMT has a new record coming out very soon the psych pop band the neo psych band MGMT their new singles have been incredible in my opinion I think this new album has potential to be their best record yet if not their best record in a long time spiritualize I hope drops a record this year kind of crossing my fingers on that Sophie I'm looking forward to hearing the next phase of Sophie's career her latest material has been totally different than just the very quirky bubblegum experimental bangers that she has dropped in the past now we're hearing more ballads more lyrics just totally different just renovated top to bottom sound and looking forward to kind of hearing Sophie become like this major flagship artist for the PC music camp though I'm sort of wondering is it going to be too weird for everybody it may in fact be but I'm really enjoying what's come out so far igloo ghost I know has been teasing new music and has been talking about kind of the shape his music has been taking on social media and I'm looking forward to kind of hearing where he takes that next injury reserved hoping they follow up their new EP with something really great and really exciting this year Sleaford mods I'm looking forward to kind of hearing the next phase of what will they do as they kind of grow their minimal shouty and very unique post-punk sound little pump what's he gonna do in 2018 look guys little pump mixtape 2017 really enjoyed it however little pump is most likely going to just like kind of be kind of be like a fluke or a flash in the pan you know what I mean but if he actually comes through with a great commercial record in 2018 that's like legit catchy as catchy as the mixtape and has like a little bit more variety to it some better features and maybe he just like ups his talent game a little bit then I think little pump is kind of here to stay for a little bit longer you know what I mean like little pump may not in fact have a 15 minutes of fame run he may have a 30 or a 45 or you know we might be looking at an hour over here I think little pomp is very fun I'm hoping you know he's he doesn't end up kind of crashing and burning here I'm pulling for him next kero kero bonito are they gonna drop a new record EP something I really enjoyed the way that they combined electro pop with J pop and a myriad of other sounds and synth pop on their last record really hoping they drop something cool this year posts Malone really enjoyed the Rockstar single honestly like didn't really enjoy much of Elsie's put out before that and kind of hoping that he delivers on this new record of his kind of seems like he's trying to go big go ambitious and want to hear that happen moving on from there Denzel curry what does Denzel curry gonna be doing this year he dropped that pretty good EP in 2017 I want to hear that brand new album I want to hear what he's going to be doing next one I hear him kill he's one of the best young and fiery lyricist out there right now and I want to hear him just like kind of give it to us full throttle is Gorillaz gonna be dropping something this year I've been hearing that there's gonna be new material coming from gorillas sooner as opposed to later and will that sooner be in 2018 because I don't want to wait like a whole bunch more time to hear new gorillaz material even though I thought humans was really underwhelming I hope that record was just kind of like a let's just get all this gunk out of the gears and kind of really get things running smooth again and actually come through with a record that seems more centered around the gorillas themselves as opposed to hey I'm Damon Albarn I'm just gonna produce for a bunch of people who I think are cool moving on from there jouji i know has another EP coming out very soon i kind of anticipate it's going to be the same sound and vibe as the last Joji EP but you know he could change it up and I'm kind of hoping he does Lianne La Havas I'm hoping drops something interesting I think she the year she dropped her debut and she had that great follow-up record - I think she's you know one of the nicest and most interesting young singers out there a lot of talent and kind of has a kind of quirky style all her own a different approach to soul and pop music that I think a lot of contemporary artists don't have looking forward to seeing her kind of continue to push it this year if she does anything father John misty I know who's gonna be dropping something sooner rather than later to follow up here comedy so I'm looking forward to seeing if he I don't know continues on this political tip will he go back to the more intoxicating and romantic sounds people kind of love him for I don't really know ice age I'm hoping drop something very soon fan T fact South who had a pretty good EEP last year I hope continued to put out some interesting and envelope-pushing black metal in 2018 king gizzard what are they going to be doing in 2018 or they're gonna be sitting it out maybe take it a break they definitely deserve it king gizzard you guys deserve it but if you guys want to drop more music in 2018 I welcome it I would love to hear it as behemoth gonna be following up the Satanist which in my opinion has been one of the best metal in black metal records of the decade so are they gonna be following that up what's Kid Cudi gonna be doing this year what is ABS soul and I guess generally the entire top dog camp gonna be doing this year and I know Robin Peck nolde has still been working on new music and has said that you know I already have a bunch of Fleet Foxes material already written are they gonna follow up their latest record sooner rather than later are we gonna hear more material in 2018 I'm hoping so I'm not yeah I'm not gonna bet that's gonna be the case but I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't push it away also want to mention that I'm looking forward to whatever Mark kozilek does this year I think Grimes is gonna have a new album this year also tame impala to the tame impala alright guys those are my anticipated artists for 2018 hoping to hear from all of these artists this year hoping hear good music company or good stuff what are you guys looking forward to hearing this year put it down in the comments you're the best anthony Fantana 2018 music forever 
Z--fCH6D_xQ,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a classic review of the wean album chocolate and cheese this is the 1994 album from the legendary music duo Aaron Freeman and Mickey melchi Ando AKA Dean and gene ween the founding members of the alternative rock duo known as ween Wiener a tough band to explain or categorize or pinpoint after the explosive popularity of the underground and grunge rock movement of the 90s a lot of very weird bands got some pretty decent deals and a lot of exposure on some major labels that they probably wouldn't have otherwise received bands like Mudhoney & Melvin's and even Daniel Johnston has an album on Atlantic Records and Dean and gene were cut from a very similar underground oddball cloth and to simply label their music as alternative doesn't even present half of a full picture of what it is exactly that they do and if these guys are known for doing anything it's doing everything listening to a ween album can kind of be like listening to a boundary list compilation of lost musical gems from a variety of artists that nobody's ever heard of before across their discography the duo has fiddled with everything from country music to progressive rock funk to psychedelic pop sea shanties blues waltzes jittery punk rock electronic music and Irish music Latin music and that's really just the tip of the iceberg because not only does embarking on these different musical styles mean different instrumental approaches but also different singing styles different recording styles the discography of ween to say the least is fantastically eclectic and no matter what direction they head in the technical ability the execution and the songwriting chops are always there you can tell the boys took even some of the most ridiculous material in their discography pretty seriously and that's the thing with ween there's always usually at least a little bit of element of comedy of humor of just like a tongue-in-cheek attitude there are elements of their music that kind of remind me of artists that came up very similarly just laying down these really weird lo-fi songs embracing raw expression over any semblance of consistency or cleanliness guys like Daniel Johnston or our Stevie Moore and then there's also the humorous aspect of their music and this wide-ranging sense of creativity that calls back to artists like They Might Be Giants or Frank Zappa however coming to a very very different artistic conclusion Dean and jeans unmatched versatility was more of an awkward sketch than it was an undeniable truth during the earlier days of their career during their early lo-fi tape days it wouldn't be until they landed on Elektra and started putting together some professional recordings and really venturing out there into the instrumental weeds that we would see the full scope of their abilities on records like the Mullis or Quebec or white pepper and while chocolate and cheese is not quite as eclectic as those records it is the duo's first professionally recorded album with producer Andrew Weiss Dean and Jean to my understanding still pretty much played all the instruments on this thing the drums are handled by a drum machine except for the tracks on this record that featured claude on drums who is the band's drummer to this day it's not very dense it's not very lavish in a lot of ways very skeletal however it's still a very good record and a fantastic picture of the duo's abilities at the time with what little they had to work with because even with some very simple bass guitar drums and vocals they're able to pull off some incredibly left-field and vibrant ideas like the very charismatic and bluesy take me away that kicks the entire record off which sounds like a liqueur drenched live doors performance with the vocals occasionally taking a break from singing to say hey thank you thank you thank you thank you to the audience as if this is like some kind of live recording they even worked in like some fake audience sounds there's some brittle rhythm guitar on here some bongos for what it is it's executed very well but there's like a very strong note of silliness to all of it and yet also it's it's miraculously catchy later much later on the album Dean and gene just go completely off the deep end with the HIV song which sounds like a weird experimental schmaltzy piece of carnival rock with these dinky silly lead guitar melody is just kind of slinking up and down only breaking for a very short focal break where all that said is AIDS or HIV and the insanity of the record does not stop there I mean there's spinal meningitis got me down which is very surreal dark very black humored alt-rock tract that features these weird pitched vocal passages that sound like a child asking his mom if he's gonna die then there's also a very nicely executed piece of like legit southern soul on the track freedom of 76 which given its nicely executed guitars it's kind of nice vocal high notes you would never assume that this classy sweet piece of soul music would exist on the same record as a lot of these other songs and again this track is just another testament to just how much the duo can do with so little it doesn't really take a whole lot for Dean and gene to get this beautiful song across we get a very large change of pace on the song I can't put my finger on it which is a distorted and weirdly grooved bit of experimental rock that sounds like a leftover demo wet dream on Tom Waits bone machine released a few years earlier growled vocals and all drifter in the dark is a very nice country ballad with these oddly deep and dark background vocals that are kind of unsettling but intriguing and I also have to mention the hilariously dark roses are free whose subtly subversive and symbolic lyrics juxtapose very nicely against this cheery piece of funk rock coming out of the instrumental it's pitched up it's kind of got these chirpy almost slightly chipmunky vocals and as quirky and as weird as this song sounds it's it's actually one of the catchiest and one of the best written on the entire album really one of the most singable tracks vastly contrasted by the very dramatic candy the very minimal instrumentation on this track just tries to leave a lot of space around everything so that when something does happen you really feel it and I couldn't do a proper review of this record with at least mentioning the somber mariachi ballot on here buenas tardes amigo which more than any other song on this record contains this massive and prominent element of the storytelling and just acting the song is set somewhere south of the border and is sung in character the tale is captivating its cinematic it's a murder ballad of sorts and again it's just odd to think the same artists are responsible for tracks like voodoo lady and Joppa Road and that's the thing again no matter what stylistic approach Dean and Jean take on a track the talent still rings true occasionally some of the songs on here are more experimental than others but it doesn't necessarily wreck or change my enjoyment of the track or the album itself and there are moments on this thing where it seems almost like Dean and Jean kind of drop the act and and deliver a straightforward stripped back almost like authentic tune with no real sense of jokey Nisour hokey Nisour you know we're putting on a bit of a veneer here to kind of give this a bit of taste or spice most notably that happens I think on the closing track here don't shit where you eat which seems like the most honest and earnest track of the entire bunch and maybe the best piece of advice on the entire record - but this record is great this record is entertaining it has so much personality I guess you could say it has multiple personalities and above all else it is an underground experimental rock classic because very few artists out there ever did push the eclectic envelope in the way we did and did it with the sense of humor and style that they did as well especially on this album so there we go winged chocolate and G's transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you read and of course you loved it's a classic it's a good album okay over here next to my head is another classic review you can check out

cheese forever

oKl3pPQ-IRc,hi everybody Anthony Fantino here the Internet's most classic music nerd and it's time for a review of the classic album thriller by mr. Michael Joseph Jackson Gary Indiana's native son singer songwriter dancer icon King of Pop and thriller is his best-selling album well it's actually the best-selling album of all time ever in the history of albums so it kind of needs to be reviewed for classics week now before I get into this review it's worth noting that Michael Jackson was a larger-than-life figure and it would be kind of difficult doing any review of any of his albums with at least talking about him but to go over everything that's ever been documented or said about Michael Jackson I would be spending hours before I would actually talk about any actual music especially when it comes to his more controversial bits it's no secret at this point that Michael Jackson was as odd and in some ways as troubled as he was talented one most likely coming at the hand of the other the dude was basically born into the music industry and thrust into the brightest of spotlights at a very young age being a great entertainer wasn't just like a goal he aspired to as a child it was almost programmed into him from his early days dancing and singing with his family in the Jackson 5 Mikes Motown record label saw great potential in him as a solo artist so he started getting opportunities to record these little solo albums which for the most part was a lot more I don't know youthful and cute and quaint than a lot of the funkier material he was recording with the Jackson 5 a lot of the cuts on records like music and me played toward Michael's youthful innocence between the lavish instrumentation and the songwriting on these records it was pretty apparent that there was a lot of marketing and just background support behind Michael's solo career at this very early stage one of the biggest and earliest hits Mike had in his solo career was this tie in with a horror movie about like a killer rat named Ben this song ended up being the tight tract to one of his albums miraculously Michael's solo material wouldn't really have any mature bite to it until he put out the 1975 record forever Michael which was just before he jumped on to a larger label just before he started working with Quincy Jones so he's still in a very almost rudimentary phase over here the instrumentation a lot of the songs while they were very much more representative of the pop soul and disco music landscape that he existed within it was kind of generic kind of bland and commercially was sort of a flop which is a really important thing to note because a lot of Michael's best records and a lot of his greatness had much to do with the people who were around him I mean the guy ate up the spotlight but he came up as a part of a group as a piece in a unit the guy could sing he could write he could dance he could do a lot of things but doing everything on his own and not working with the right people was just not really an option and honestly I think this is something that Michael was very much well aware of even after the success of off the wall and even thriller Michael continued to release and record music with his brothers even after it was like unnecessary like on the 1984 album victory this is like one of the worst Jackson's albums even with the amazing Mick Jagger feature on here of the song it lands on is is pretty bad it sounds like a watered down version of beat it but to sort of get back to the topic at hand here a great deal of Michael's success had to do with him linking up with Quincy Jones at this point in his career which came as a result of him in Quincy both and working on the movie The Wiz which in retrospect is a lot more fun and a lot cuter than audiences sort of understood it to be at the time it was not a box-office smash but since Mike and Quincy were in such close proximity as a result of this movie it led to some conversations about Quincy producing Mike's next solo record and having Quincy on production opened Michaels music up to new instrumental possibilities it brought his songwriting to new heights and on top of it there were some really fantastic guest songwriters that landed on this record Stevie Wonder Paul McCartney Tom Baylor heatwaves rod temper tin as well who helped bring the album more certifiable hits on top of Michael Jackson's own don't stop till you get enough this album came at a really appropriate time in 1979 because not only did it end up being a fantastic disco album like a top 3 disco album but also it's kind of like the disco record to end all disco records and while Michael and his brothers continued to indulge in this sound on their next record triumph Mike and Quincy had entirely different plans for this grand pop music opus that they had planned on Thriller now while the music on Thriller is fantastic for the most part it would be a complete misunderstanding of the album's context and success to only talk about the music in a lot of ways thriller was the shape of pop to come but not just sonically but promotionally a great deal of the album sales and cultural frenzy came as a result of the growing popularity of the music video platforms like MTV became essentially the the jukebox for the new generation and still to this day Michaels music videos for tracks like Billie Jean and beaded and smooth criminal' and etc were some of the most well choreographed well shot and highly budgeted ever for Michael Jackson music videos weren't just a promotional tool they were a statement of art they were a cultural event Mike's creative process at this point in his career wasn't just focused around the creation of the album it was about the iconography and the visuals and the larger-than-life single as well as the dance craze truth be told Thriller only works as an album because the strength of its individual songs is so high not because all these tracks weave together into some holistic statement regardless of bulk of the tracks on this record are some of the greatest and most timeless pieces of pop music ever and they still set the bar today for when it comes to groove vocal ability glamour and high gloss production I mean the production on this thing was next-level on the opening track want to be starting something the groove onthis cut the shuffling percussion on this thing the nimble synth bass lines they were so tight and intricate and sharp it was like a pinprick he did align rhythm guitars the peppy shots of horns and all of the empty space being taken up by these icy synth cords that kind of wash over the instrumentation it's a really beautiful way and the blurring of genre lines on this track is so violent it's hard to tell where one style starts and another ends but what kind of goes underappreciated on this track in favor of the amazing out trope mamasay mamasa mamakusa as well as the fantastic refrains on here is that a lot of Michael's vocal inflections on this thing especially on the verses are really weird they're really out there especially when he's expanding upon his hole here that should metaphors on the bridge of the track ultimately the songs message sits pretty squarely into this theme of confrontation avoiding it or being stuck in the middle of it confrontation kind of being something that you can't escape and this would be one of many moments throughout Mike's career where he would express the sentiment of of pacifism in his music I mean that's essentially what the song beat it is all about just backing down from a fight it's not worth it it's not worth your life man don't do it also may I note here that this track is proof that you can be relentlessly preachy in a song but it could still be like a pop hit for Jackson this track also serves as a successful entry into the rock genre complete with roaring guitar leads a free van halen guitar solo some really confident thrusting chords didn't didn't didn't like the guitar work the rhythm the groove on this track is excellent but Michaels vocal work on here is really what's impeccable the fact that he puts so much emotion into the storyline of the cut and just the way his vocals his lead vocals bounce off of the vocal harmonies on the hook it almost has this like dizzying effect to it it's like it's spinning around my head the only track on this record that goes bigger is the title track and being honest it's it's a near novelty song but probably one of the best near novelty songs ever it's essentially a Halloween tune that features Vincent Price spook master extraordinaire doing like a vocal break much like wanna be starting something thriller features and incredible groove a quick little scent bass line some sparks of rhythm guitar a snare kick pattern enhanced with a little bit of hamper it's a little more modest than it is complex but that's because the groove on this track is a lot smoother and the reason for that being this stylistically seems almost like a bit of a throwback to Michael's days in Disco because the grooves on this thing stay pretty consistent throughout a lot of the song the hook just feels like such an incredible change because you have this huge influx of instrumentation making the song just feel so much larger and more panoramic because as Michael hits these high notes on you're also getting these very peppy and hot shots of synthesizers and horns of course the playfully frightening lyrics and the sound effects on the track add a lot to the character of the song to the song Billie Jean by comparison is much more low-key it's sensual it's cool it's in a little in a little little tiny spotlight that hypnotic smooth bassline as simple but fantastic beat and on top of all of it those breathy iconic synth chords and those springy rhythm guitars on repeat that just bust in on the hook though whack-whack whack-whack so crunchy there's add so much flavor to the chorus but while there are a lot of instrumental elements of this track that are fantastic it's really the narrative of the cut that kind of makes the song memorable to me I can't really think of a whole lot of pop songs as big and as relevant as this one that are about a broken heart of woman essentially trying to finesse you out of money with a kid that isn't even yours that you didn't even realize Billie Jean was an MRA anthem there are a few other cuts on here that to me feel like contemporary synthesized renovations of the disco sounds from Michael's past like PYT and baby be mine you might even be able to label these tracks like a fusion of synth pop and synth funk and disco like a post disco blend which isn't really a knock against the tracks I like both of them and I like the addition to the tracks the talkbox vocals the slinky little synth arpeggios I think they add a nice fresh dynamic to Michael's sound now there are a handful of sweet ballads on this record too that are kind of nice but they're not really the selling point of the album to me especially the girl is mine which is most likely my least favorite track on the entire record for as long as Michael and Paul McCartney have had connections through music it's the chemistry is really just not here in my opinion it's almost like too hokey in a lot of ways human nature is a little too breezy for me but I do love the way that the lady in my life ends the record off on this very grand beautiful heavenly pop soul kick and I don't really know if there's anything else I could say it's the widest selling album of all time from the king of pop its themes its musical elements are so great so well executed and so universal that I mean this record is beloved the world over and has influenced a vast number of artists both underground and mainstream the sounds on this record were so friggin cutting-edge and Michael vocally was such an amazing performer and the material he was working with on this record some his own some not was just high caliber so there you go it's a classic transition have you given this album a listen did you love it

6aq9epwmMKo,hi everyone one more than a time tan oh here the Internet's sniffily Asst use ik nerd and it's time for review of the classic album from Daft Punk discovery yes ladies and gentlemen I am filming and recording this review at the time of classics week so this is a classic review let's go this is the 2001 album from the legendary French electronic music duo Daft Punk aka Thomas Bangalter and guy-manuel de homem-christo discovery was the duo's second record and you could say that much of the music world was sitting waiting to see what thomas and guy would do with this record considering they had just proven themselves to be one of the newest hottest things and dance music with their last record thanks to major singles like the funk and around the world which by the 2000s had far outlasted a lot of the house music trends that those tracks rode in on now by 2001 dance music hadn't dissipated in fact it kind of expanded especially thanks to the vast improvements in music recording technology in the 2000s I mean for frame of reference the 90s for the most part were one major electronic music phenomenon after another and the decade really saved some of the biggest and the best for last I mean we had mobis play shares believe also Fatboy Slim eurodance this decade also being the creative peak for IDM as well and some of the biggest dance music hits and albums of the early 2000s were being recorded by the likes of Madonna Basement Jaxx and Ricky and Glacia Skye Lehmann no Crystal Method The Chemical Brothers Nelly Furtado let's not forget sono as as much as I would like to let's also not forget the deluge of remix CDs many artists came out with around this time many of which would feature thunderpussy mixes and did I say Jamiroquai I think I said Jamiroquai also several years down the road James Murphy would be singing about Daft Punk playing at his house and gorillas would be releasing Demon Days which in my opinion is a record that is pretty fantastically inspired by the smooth driving grooves of Daft Punk's music I mean the song dare off this does sample revolution 909 from Daft Punk's homework now while Daft Punk's discovery is not the last great house album it almost serendipitously sits at the end of an era where numerous shades of electronic music had this massive breakthrough into the public consciousness house in Chicago house and techno and jungle break beat big beat friggin drum and bass drilling bass all of which are groundbreaking all of which are great but guy and Thomas were kind of presented with a unique opportunity with this record because a lot of the electronic dance music artists on the more mainstream side of things weren't always writing music for an album audience there was just as much emphasis if not more probably more on the single or the remix than the album itself which is really not surprising that's mostly how electronic dance music is marketed today but that's still a major reason as to why discovery stands out as an artistic statement in electronic music today that not only guy and Thomas groomed this thing to flow like a well-crafted pop or rock record but also that Daft Punk introduced this massive element of showmanship in their music by bringing on the iconic robot helmets and suits that we know them for today also a couple of years down the road I guess in an effort to creatively give the record a second wind Daft Punk came out with the animated film interstellar 5555 the thing was about the length of the album itself the budget was four million dollars it was inspired by Japanese anime and the production was overseen by anime and manga artist Lee G Matsumoto the visuals locked up really nicely with the pacing of the record and even though there's not really any dialogue on this thing the storyline is pretty clear like a bit of a commentary on the music industry itself with the story basically being about the abduction and exploitation of this alien pop band and the movie might also be a bit of an acknowledgment of Daft Punk's transformation themselves into I guess a final form of sorts while this is not daft punk's first foray into film it was certainly more interesting aesthetically pleasing and cohesive than a story about dogs androids firemen and tomatoes like look at that makeup look at that friggin dog it looks like a bad 80s movie so I've established that discovery had a lot going for in terms of showmanship in terms of context in terms of visuals and promotion but the album's music was and still remains its greatest asset now while this record is not a total departure from the Chicago house sound that put the duo on the map with their first record it is a change of pace they kind of expand or vary their style a bit to include the shades of pop and disco and funk that inspire them in the first place but they kind of encased it in this sleek futurist robotic veneer so in other words give audiences what you already know they like especially if it's something that you think they might be a nostalgic for and then present it in a way where it feels brand new so new that it's like a glimpse of something that hasn't even happened yet now not all critics saw the genius of this record upon its initial release of The Guardian I think spanked it with two stars Village Voice gave it a see pitchforks infamous six point four review seemed more off handed than engaged and I get it Daft Punk's very repetitive and hip driven formula on this record probably did not speak to raucous sentiments at the time very well and even some listeners who enjoyed this thing maybe didn't even get just how studied and experienced the music on this record was but discovery at least to my ears at the time was very obviously not your average commercial generic soon to be forgotten dance music product sure maybe one more time may have had a somewhat incessant vocal line but the flawless grooves and dreamy horn loops and gummy bass lines are just out of this world calling on them for being too repetitive for the first leg of a mere five minute song is I don't know kind of like saying that James Brown live recordings are too repetitive especially considering the dramatic vocal breakdown in the middle of the track and the fantastic build-up that takes off from there and the auto-tune vocals on this thing are really nice they kind of give the the track be slightly robotic feel that Daft Punk typically bring to a track now as is their style as is their calling card Rome Anthony's singing on the track is really good but it sounds even cooler with the auto-tune on as his singing sort of makes these hard digital transitions from one note to the next as his vocals ascend and descend this is part dance song part pop Odyssey and Daft Punk's inspiration to do this wasn't completely without precedent think back to the great disco records that inspired the duo disco or at least the best disco wasn't all just throttle look at a before example with a lot of Abbas best tracks you didn't just have a dance groove you had a narrative you had an element of Jarama grand instrumental presentation I think Daft Punk was very much on the same tip when you have a track on here like aerodynamic which eventually breaks down at some point to bring in these squawky NAT note guitar arpeggios that build up into a great final piece of the song or on superheroes whose vocal samples kind of break down eventually to introduce these really sleek very cool robotic synth arpeggios and some very interactive lead melodies also the Moody chord progressions that are introduced all of a sudden that break up the the raw irresistible funk of the synth funk and electro funk grooves on the track short-circuit and even when Daft Punk doesn't work in a grand instrumental shift in a particular track a lot of these cuts last about three minutes and change these are bite-sized Tunes the duo was clearly crafting songs for the ear of an album listening audience and somehow kept these tracks at a pop music listeners attention span the tracklist on this thing also features the groundbreaking single harder better faster stronger one of the duo's most iconic tracks ever and for good reason the springy baselines the creative sample chopping and layering all the incredibly colorful shots of guitar and since but the most memorable element of this track has to be the instantly catchy and memorable robotic lead vocals work harder make it better do it faster makes us stronger maybe if you look at the lyrics on a piece of paper they don't look like much but hearing them paired up with the timbre of the vocals the effects the manipulations together with the melodies it's just such an amazing and memorable mantra and the structure of this track is fantastic it's just like an on the edge of your seat dance gassim with each bar so finely crafted and edited to make each section of the song unique it's far from just your average copy and paste job job job and also I cannot do a review this record without at least mentioning for a bit the duo's grand romantic statement something about us these sweet keyboards on this thing the sensual bass grooves the very cute quaint wah-wah lead melodies they deliver this serene but funky foundation for what sounds like some incredibly intimate robotic lead vocals Daft Punk also works in a love angle on the much poppier and peppier digital love which musically and vocally I think has always had some pretty obvious similarities to the Buggles New Wave hit video killed the radio star but nearly every track on this thing has its own style its own flavor its own direction giving this tracklist a very versatile flow the song night vision is a very nice interlude point on the album the song various quote seems pulled right out of the Giorgio Moroder playbook it sounds like part 80s sci-fi soundtrack part 70s electro disco hit and in a lot of ways the song face to face brings back a lot of the punchy beats and and clunky sample edits and chops that made the duo's first record so great except this time it's a bit more refined but more cleanly put together a bit more detailed and has a great lead vocalist on it to the 10-minute song too long that finishes the entire album off is is really the only track that you could probably say goes a little long although my main critique of it has to be that the lead vocals on the cut are little too human in tone like they could have been manipulated or changed up a little bit in some way to kind of give it that Daft Punk feel still though the intro builds a nice tension there's a nice changeup in the middle point of the track the ending is pretty climactic all in all the album just ends as strong as it finishes and just goddamn what a great electronic music record what a great dance album and dance album really for the ages a dance album that's so good like even so many years down the road it still doesn't even really sound at a date there's probably numerous places where you could work many songs off of this thing into a DJ set and they'll still go over really well so classic record incredible record the production the sounds the ambition the grooves the cutting-edge aesthetic so well put together and still stellar to this day and most likely for many days to come Daft Punk discovery transition

SipouoqLyxM,hey everyone blow that in the nose no here the Internet's busiest music nerd well really the Internet's stuffiest music nerd and it's time for a review the new Charli XCX mixtape pop - Charli XCX futuristic pop diva hailing from the UK whose work I have warmed up to quite a bit lately since she made the very essential shift from run-of-the-mill pop run off to freaky electro pop in left field bubblegum base she dropped two mixtapes in this vein in 2017 the first of which was number one angel and pop 2 is the second and once again Charli XCX is teaming up with a lot of producers from the PC music camp the likes of easy fun Sophie Agee cook so the sound of this thing is almost guaranteed to take the shape of pop to come and it's kind of easier than ever to make that leap given just how accessible and an almost present day a lot of the material on this new tape is it's like we're seeing the slightly experimental and not so distant future as opposed to the the the weird wild and freaky my head hurts I have a headache the weird wild and freaky tone of pop that we might be hearing like a generation down the road so while this tape isn't quite as out there as number one angel nor is it as bordering on avant-garde as her vroom-vroom EP was EP of the year EP in a freaking year Charlie just continues on this trend of dishing out very inventive contemporary pop music with just wall-to-wall features the only moments when the album falters in my opinion are twofold one when a featured guest kind of just causes a lull and a track because they're not that interesting sort of like Tommy cash on the song delicious just not really seeing the appeal of his performance here the vocals are kind of generic and the sudden stop and transition into something entirely different in the midst of this feature leads me to believe that that may be there you know there wasn't really that much to it and while we're on the topic of underwhelming features jay Park is maybe one of the most generic pop rap performances that I've heard this year and number two I guess there are some moments on here where I feel like the production falters a little bit as well like on the song backseat featuring Carly Rae Jepsen I do love Carly's performance on this track her and Charlie match each other very well and it was really appropriate putting her on this song because there's a bit of a slow-mo glistening glamorous 80's aesthetic to it however the very molasses-like pacing of the track and the roaring bass and the kind of very jagged synthesizers that close the track out are really noisy unnecessarily messy you just feel kind of like cluttered not really the payoff I would have wanted given how slow and how patient much of the track is these song tears is similarly cluttered to my ears as much as I do love the inclusion of what sounds like these very odd squeaky screams throughout the track that that were really unexpected but exhilarating all the same while the song out of my head does kind of sound like a very standard dance or electro pop track definitely one of the more commercial cuts that I've heard Charlie put out in a while not really anything too experimental about it the hook is just too sticky to deny also some of the very lewd and somewhat gritty and self-effacing lyrics that Charlie brings to the table definitely bring a tone different than that of your average pop song and even tuflow one of the most average performers and singers and contemporary pop couldn't even ruin this track now there are some bangers in the tracklist here that I loved quite a bit and they take things down a slightly weirder territory like I got it featuring Brooke candy and cupcake I love the quiet aggression of this track I like the really odd sputtering very spastic groove I love how Brooke candies feature is so much quieter and has this very subtle tension to it meanwhile when cupcake is introduced on the track the volume just pumps up so much attitude and this track just kind of takes me back to the hardest and the craziest and the most off-the-wall moments of the vroom-vroom EP and the song FEM ba is one of many moments on here but maybe the most prominent one where Charlie seems to fuse this idea of the digital world and the romance world being human but also kind of being a digital representation of yourself or like a cybernetic being talking about this infatuation or love that she has for this other person making her short-circuit again and one of many cuts lately where you have singers pop singers addressing love in the internet and the information age and the technology age and this you know just throw it on the pile of the many songs in this vein that I enjoy but really for me the selling point of this track is the punchy beats the very nimble and kind of jumpy and manipulated vocal lines from Charli XCX and the fantastic miki blanco feature which is absolutely gnarly their cuts that take a slower more ballad like tone like lucky or the first leg of the song track 10 both of which allow me both of which are incredibly sensual especially Lucky's lead vocal as it ascends into these like distorted kind of weird manipulated falsettos another moment on this record where I feel like Charlie is almost kind of morphing into a moment where she's part human also part computer like she's just a digital embodiment of a woman who was just crying out into the night overall this is a very enjoyable mixtape for me at the end of the day there were some tracks that I don't think quite hit the mark mark mark mark II but I'm still enjoying hearing Charlie work with the PC music camp I'm still enjoying what she's doing with her sound on these records but I can't help but feel like we haven't quite heard Charlie XCX with this sound fully realized yet like we have something bigger and better and more ambitious and more gargantuan coming down the pipe so while I am crossing my fingers for that I am still enjoying pop - as is I'm feeling a like two decent seven on this thing Tran I transition so I hope you heard this tape I hope you enjoyed it let me know what you thought of it down in the comments over here next to my head is a another Charlie XCX review that you can check out and that's uh that's it guys I'll see you in the next video ethany Fantan Oh Charlie XCX forever 
LAEe4bj6cLA,"[Applause] hi everyone no crap news an incident an about here the Internet's busiest music nerd also also still new theny shelf tan oh here still new shelf new theny shelf tan Oh literally who care its shelf its shelf who care I'll tell you who care me care okay and it's time for a review of the new any Rd record no one ever really dies any Rd or nerd or no one ever really dies is a music trio hailing from California they are back with their first record in seven years it's kind of easy to see why things have been put on hiatus considering the group's flagship member Pharrell Williams has been really busy with collaborations and solo records and singing competitions this has been a gigantic decade for Pharrell thus far so now it seems like he's kind of coming back to any rd doing a victory lap with a group that kind of helped put him on the map and this was easily one of my most anticipated albums of 2017 considering how hot I was on the lead singles to this thing lemon featuring Rihanna and 1000 featuring future and it's actually spectacular to hear Shea Chad and Pharrell once again back at it creating these very catchy snappy fusions of pop soul rock and hip hop for the most part any Rd succeeds in bringing back the carefree but methodically put together the fun but incredibly experimental vibe that made the group's so interesting in the first place in fact it's like it's never even really left the biggest difference though between this record and previous any Rd releases is most likely this huge influx of trendy rappers and singers NER D in the past not really a feature heavy group but all of a sudden now they are but but that's kind of the case for everybody now everybody's got features just features out the wazoo and a lot of them are actually pretty great and add quite a bit of character and personality to the tracklist maybe with a few exceptions though I mean Ed Sheeran's boyish vocal harmonies on the closing track here feel more like a footnote than a feature wall A's appearance at the end of voila kind of takes the track in unnecessary territory like it could have easily ended before that whole be switch started and it would have been a completely fine track the only feature on this thing I would say that is more boring than this is mi a taking up the last leg of the song kites Audrey three thousands verse on the record is perfectly fine I just think it comes in really late and as far as production goes the song he features on is one of the Messier and more unkempt and and least pleasant that I've heard in the bunch and the second Kendrick Lamar feature on this thing is obviously inferior to the first one which was really the only one we needed still though I love the attitude of this record I love the instrumental direction Pharrell and company took this album in any Rd once again brings a very familiar blend of stylistic influences but this time around things are sounding a little more aggressive slightly punky er which fits pretty well with the lyrics generally on this project sounding a little more political and socially aware than usual but still even while making politically charged statements with their music ne Rd manages to maintain this zany very upbeat attitude that comes off very playful it's like I'm hearing elements of hardcore and even like the music of Devo playing a much larger influence in the group's music overall now of course this isn't any Rd record it's a Pharrell record so the production is one of the biggest selling points of this thing and generally it's incredible the grooves on this thing are here in full force the sounds are crafted to have this consistently gummy colorful bouncy round rubbery and quirky sound on the song lemon I love the twittering trap hi-hats the very round resonant bass the cute blinky little percussive melodies playing away in the background the beats which from Pharrell section of the track to Rihanna's is pretty fantastic it goes from like this kind of driving alternative dance sound to this very laid-back head bobbing hip hop you have more driving kick drums on the song deep down body thirst and even though the percussion is very tense on this thing generally the beats are matched with these very glamorous keys some crunchy guitar chords and fluttering pick bass lines it's like I'm listening to a punked-out version of a very smooth sleek modern soul sound which works out pretty well a lot of the time with Pharrell's boyish shouty vocals which come off even more appropriate on the very aggressive and very in-your-face 1,001 zero zero zero this track is just this exciting sensory overload for me with it's odd sound effects samples and its chiming sense and the booming breakdown that introduces the future feature is fantastic I just love that beats which I love that tempo change whatever you want to call it just that that it's like I've been shifted into another dimension it's orgasmic I feel like I'm listening to what is the essential blurring of all lines between all genres as every sound kind of coalescing into one style one genre and this is it cyber rap Punk's living in a dystopian future ah there are a few moments though on this record where the cutting edge gets slightly obnoxious like the repeatedly triggered samples can get pretty grating and redundant during moments of voila the very loud robotic vocal refrains on that track are really enough already and again more constantly triggered vocal samples on the song rolling them sevens it's it's just it's a lot I kind of feel the same way about the song kites too also on this track it's it's like the driving somewhat punky beats that kick the record often sounded super fresh and super different not only for any Rd but just for popular music in general they get kind of formulaic by this point like you've heard them executed time and time again on numerous tracks before and it's just like okay you're doing it and it's kind of unfortunate because truth be told any Rd is one of the most versatile music groups out there I know they have more up their sleeve than this but it's kind of like they restricted themselves a little bit to this sound and this vibe and the style to get a bit more of a uniform style for this entire record but maybe a little bit too uniform I think the record could have used maybe a couple more supremely freaky or weird cuts like secret life of tigers I love the descending guitar line on that track such a catchy captivating moment and also the very bouncy and catchy and an odd cut ESP you've got energy but you ain't gonna use it a track that's this unexpected I don't know reaching your full potential anthem with a few preachy lyrics here and there and I cannot finish a review of this album without mentioning the beautiful epic and lengthy lightening fire magic prayer this thing is equal parts Odyssey futuristic and psychedelic it's cybernetic and yet it's also pretty soulful I loved the very lush clean glistening synth layers which are juxtaposed against these somewhat rough somewhat gritty very punchy beats I love the way this instrumental eventually transitions into this sound bed of water samples head bobbing beats ascending synth arpeggios it's really worth the seven minute runtime pays off with a nice climax at the end Pharrell's vocal performance here is one of the prettiest and most compelling on the entire thing the closing reggae number again featuring ed Sheeran on this thing is a little rough around the edges seems a bit too casual the entire cut seems almost like a goofy afterthought still though the whole sound palette and the intricacies of the production are so nice it almost makes up for it I do like this album quite a bit it's a little inconsistent it's also a bit one-dimensional appoints however I feel like this record is a tribute to Pharrell as a creative force because with this record he's taken some major musical risks he's gone totally out there into the weeds while simultaneously succeeding in the highest echelons of mainstream music the production on this thing is some of the freshest of 2017 the socially aware lyrics are a nice change of pace when they're on point a lot of them come off more like slogans than they are salient points however that they are really catchy and even when Pharrell on this record isn't trying to make some grand statement there's some kind of freewheeling absurdity to his bars that still wins me over despite its handful of flaws this is still easily one of NER DS most fun albums and probably the best record they've come out with since flyer died like over ten years or so ago its best moments are pretty electrifying pretty inventive and I could see a lot of tracks on this thing being comebacks for me I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're feeling

LxU-y-udwlA,hi everyone new year's city new shelf tan Oh new shelf not not here over over there right there new shelf the Internet's busiest music nerd here and it's time for a review of the new honcho Jack album honcho Jack Jack honcho is it usually this bright in here I feel a little out of sorts it's been it's been a week is I'm not used to the lights again I'm not used to the lights this is a new collaborative record from two rappers based in the Atlanta area Travis Scott and the migos own quavo it would seem suddenly release projects from trendy rappers is kind of all the rage right now with recent releases from offset 21 savage and Metro boomin as well as future and young thug being some of the most talked-about records of 2017 and this will most likely be a larger and larger trend moving forward in 2018 because it's a lot easier to sort of build a record off of the hype of two brands colliding rather than working for years and years and years on a single project trying to fashion an entirely new sound or bring the trendy sounds you wrote in on up to a higher level which in my opinion is what Travis Scott did on his rodeo record however since then he doesn't seem quite as interested in taking risks and redefining standards as much as he is just kind of playing it safe and playing to expectations still though I did go into this thing expecting greatness especially considering how much I enjoyed without warning if that thing could just pull up out of nowhere and be pretty good then this for sure it's possible also one of my favorite artists of all time Ralph Steadman did the cover art for this thing I am a huge hunter s Thompson and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fan and the whole honcho Jack Jack honcho lore behind this thing is it's pretty intriguing too unfortunately this record is not quite as epic or as ambitious as I had hoped and while it is listenable it's its cardinal sin is actually that it's it's way too predictable and running the mill and bland it feels kind of like I'm listening to a handful of cool ideas that have somehow been stretched out past the 40-minute mark I mean despite the pretty dense list of producers on this thing the instrumental palette of this record ends a pretty uniform it's pretty much just one moody Spacey trap beat laced with sad hypnotic melodies after another mostly made for just vibing out there are some interesting sample choices throughout the project here and they're the ones that stood out to me or at least the ones that I recognized right away was you had a Mack DeMarco sample on the song how you feel there was a pretty nice Otis Redding intro on the first track to this thing and another thing about this project that pops is occasionally some of Travis Scots and kwai bose layered auto-tune vocal harmonies come off pretty heavenly prime example being the song go however not so much on the song best man which seems way too weakly improvised and off-the-cuff to actually sound like a legitimately written and conceived track and shows in a way just how little effort went into this thing overall but again back to the uniformity of this album it's really too uniform at points to really truly pick out any highlights from it because while there are some tracks on here I do enjoy more than others they're not really that much better in comparison there are a handful of tracks on this thing that barely past the two-minute mark don't really leave that strong of an impression Travis Scott sand Cuevas warbling auto-tune rap flows kind of bleed into one another and become more and more redundant as the project draws on the offset and takeoff features on this thing or actually like serious highlights here because they break up the monotony of this thing a bit and I get that there's not going to be a whole lot of lyrical substance to a project like this but still even some of the hooks which you really want the hooks on this thing to pop seem pretty phoned in from the yeah yeah yeahs on saint laurent mask - rapping about looking at other people in the eyes and touching the sky on i - i please miss me with that I get that this album mostly comes down to aesthetic but the aesthetic is only so interesting because there's only so much aesthetic here it doesn't change up that much I mean unless a certain instrumental bit or a hook on this thing blows up the there's not really much to talk about here I love the hook on st. you could see the road i blank do bash it dubai whips too much of alcohol we need more option but still at the end of the day all I can really say about this thing is is that it's just listenable it's merely listenable its pleasant its woozy it's not nearly as unique or as memorable or as finely written as some of me goes and Travis Scott's more recent work especially when comparing this to culture especially when comparing this to rodeo or some of the best tracks on birds sing in the trap for the most part Hunter Jack seems very wash rinse and repeat to the point where if you're not paying close attention to track after track after track of this thing you're gonna get deja vu it's almost kind of like getting lost in the forest on this thing not to mention that this collaboration seems more like just a mere series of tracks that Travis Scott has masterminded and quavo has merely featured on I mean you could plug a number of different trendy Auto crooning rappers onto some of these tracks and you would get roughly the same results I think the art the marketing the branding these two artists coming together was certainly smart and certainly has created a lot of buzz a lot of interest a lot of listens but this project is just very low on ideas it's very bubblegum it's very shallow and in my opinion exemplifies just how uninteresting some of these sudden collaborative records can be when you have a listening audience more interested in the names attached to the project than the substance of what's actually being recorded I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what's your dire view next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you're angry or a thoughtful comment if you're feeling thoughtful over here next to my head is my rodeo review you can click on that or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one forever 
uMn-d0uT6z0,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd we're gonna do a fun little list here as some of you may remember we will link it down there in the description I did a video a little while ago where I talked about the 10 worst songs of my adolescence the response was so overwhelming with other terrible songs it just seemed like a good idea to revisit the whole concept and do a 10 worst songs of my adolescence part - some of these I liked some of these I never liked I will not admit which one is which but what I will tell you is the first to kick off this fantastic list of musical winners is stains it's been a while one of the most needlessly angsty rock songs of the 2000s and it is unquestionably stains most tedious single it's been a while it's been a while back this vocal line this lyric is sung so many times throughout this track it's really difficult to think of any other lyric or bring any other lyric to mine but when one does you get gem-encrusted word smithy like where I musta feel this way just madness it's like all the melodrama of radio metal in the 2000s super saiyan charged with expensive coffee and cigarettes not to mention this song features a vocal style that would go on to influence many a local bar band but as wonderful as this song is we can't dwell on it all day which is why we're going to move on to cold chamber would it shock the monkey when new metal and alternative metal hit and just hit this peak of craze stained definitely saw quite a bit of kickback from that as did coal chamber they were one of the harder' gruffer more aggressive bands in this trend and even though a lot of people crap on nu metal they say it's terrible they say mud veins awful get corn out of here you can put down these bands but very few groups in new metal have the bragging rights of getting an Ozzy Osbourne feature on their record and that's exactly what happens on here if you didn't already know from the title of this track shock the monkey is in fact a Peter Gabriel cover so we have Ozzy on a Peter Gabriel cover and it's an alternative metal version of that song it's like all the awkwardness of famous seventies musicians trying to translate into the 80s times 10 there was just something about these new metal groups they saw something in New Wave music you had disturbed covering shout you also had orgy with blue Monday that was their biggest single ever but even those tracks are marginally listenable this call chamber rendition of shock the monkey is is barely tolerable especially with Ozzy bringing maybe the most inappropriate vocal accompaniment for this song hey hey even upon first listening couldn't figure out whether or not this song felt more menacing or more hilarious however it could never be as hilarious as our next track here saliva click boom this is just another instance of a really bad rap rock even groups that didn't necessarily have rapping throughout all of their rock flavored songs at least had you know it's just a little bit you know it's just such a popular fusion on the radio and on MTV at the time everybody was dabbling in it you can mostly thank limp Biskit for that and we will not be featuring them on this list actually mostly because I think this song is sort of even inferior to some of their worst material imagine what biscuit is being like a terrible nuclear power plant and saliva is just like the runoff that streams down the river as a result and this is true from everything in the the jump the riffs on this thing my mom and dad were perfect you know your do cry dance bitch it for me laughing seems to be on everybody city there's a lot of funny lyrics on this track about being on the radio and getting popular and opening your mind however that sensation is felt much more strongly with this next track Aaron Carter's I want candy Aaron Carter is kind of like America's first attempt at Justin Bieber in the late 90s in the early 2000s there was a boyband craze like the world has never ever ever seen some of you guys are freaking out about one direction right now about how terrible they are boy bands now they're not as big as they used to be you could not get away from them we had the Backstreet Boys we hadn't sing we had 98 degrees LFO who I mentioned the last video apparently LFO I didn't even know this it stands for light funky ones we had five they were all bad boys in dream Street we had a boy band made before our very eyes on a TV show their name was o-town you can look at live videos of them singing on the Internet they were awful and we liked them anyway you can be my liquid dreams around the same time we had the second coming of the new kids on the block who are putting out solo records that were on the charts Jordan Knight and Joey McIntyre all of this was just was just not enough what we had to do was get the younger brother of one of the Backstreet Boys Nick Carter and give him a record contract and on his big breakout record not only are there amazing songs on there like my internet girl who any girl that you're trying to hit on over the internet send her that track she'll just fall in love with you but the song I vividly remember being younger and not being able to get away from was Erin's cover of the 1965 Strangelove's hit I want candy the song that hilariously starts off with Erin on the phone talking to one of his bros being like hey man can't come out tonight I want to go see this girl her name's candy she's awesome the instrumental rendition of this track is just completely gutless it continues to strip out the jungle drums of the original track and even further distances the song away from the Bo Diddley beat that this track was originally built on the song was just corny on impact it's only gotten worse with age and not only that but Aaron Carter with this track and his debut album as well actually precede the whole Kidz Bop thing the Kidz Bop concept I actually think this album this artist was the archetype for Kidz Bop maybe if somebody grabs a time machine they can go back in time Terminator style and like help Aaron Carter go into chemical engineering because we do not advocate murder on this channel next no mercy where do you go these guys are a Florida pop trio this is like their huge big breakout single and this track was basically your favorite song if you were these guys not only is it kind of disappointing to hear that someone who has the name no mercy is not a badass metal band no rather they're coming out with terrible Latin music flavored eurodance with a cheesy house beat some bland reverb cliche synth stabs and a really just corny acoustic guitar lead and the song incessantly asks where do you go whenever this song is playing in the other room is the answer for me and if somebody walks out with you that person is a keeper next rapper rap man Nelly with the song batter up one of his earlier singles one of his more terrible singles Nelly southern rapper part of st. lunatics who were actually featured on this song a guy whose visual gimmick was having a bandaid on his face here we go yeah let me paint a historical picture for you in the hip-hop was totally tired of street cred and being hardcore and decided that instead it was going to hand us a bunch of mainstream friendly pop rappers that looked like kittens in comparison to the artists who are making great hip-hop music before them not only does this track feature a horribly dinky beat that gets old even a minute into the song but the track as a hook that gets even older batter up lots of very tacky flows all over this thing Nelly delivers an awful verse where he is talking about licking it in it sticking it did I say licking it yeah licking it lots of bad baseball metaphors and just some generally vapid verses moving on to our buddies Canadian pop rock outfit the bare naked ladies for the track that maybe has one of the most iconic intros of a radio rock song from this era brand yeah it's bad grab the Barenaked Ladies their first big breakout single one week a track that sounds like it was focused group by bringing together a bunch of 90s kids who were incessantly bullied out of their lunch money every day at school and just that riff Bam Bam how now this this song is just a party for people who wear their pants too high but even the music video itself oh my god it's so awkward chickity China the Chinese chicken you have a drumstick and you bring this up second you know that the verses the rap verses on this track it's it's really like a can of worms in and of itself it's a Pandora's box of pain that I am Not sure I'm willing to open because if I do it's really gonna be like we're kicking off Maze Runner right here it's gonna be a labyrinth of evil from which this video will never escape so we're gonna continue on to the offsprings get a job these guys were at one time actually a pretty great punk and alternative rock band they have the bragging rights of saying they have the biggest-selling independent album of all time smash this album sold tons of copies when it came out on epitaph in the 90s but instead of continuing on with this winning Punk alt rock formula offspring went on to write some of the worst pop rock of the late nineties easy as they started writing really tacky commercial friendly singles like pretty fly for a white guy maybe the most obnoxious single to come off of this record of offsprings is get a job it's like some really bad Scott pop rock with steel drums a completely intolerable chorus say no way say no way yeah not only this but the chords and the structure and the melody of this track seems like it was all written in a really long studio session where every member of the band listened to the Beatles song oh bloody Oh blah da over and over and over and over and there are these really silly patronizing overly simplistic stories of significant others being lazy and not having a job it's just so like blue blue blue hear all these things you can relate to here all these sweet catchy straightforward things don't you like this song no I don't like this song however I might like it just a little bit more than this next track some forty ones fat lip not only were the two thousands a pretty terrible time for hip hop in the mainstream but it was also a pretty terrible time for punk in the mainstream absolutely there were some iconic groups to come out of this time period who really defined pop punk in the mainstream in a pretty positive way like blink 182 as well as Green Day but still even with these bands they were sort of reducing punk down to just pop rock with hair dye and piercings and nowhere is this lack of true Punk spirit and ethos more then on this sum 41 single fat lip especially with all the anti conformity lyrics on this track sadi and once we glide out of these super punk choruses we have rap rock verses yes they're here too because what's more Punk and anti conformity doing what everyone else is doing and we're gonna finish this list off really polish it off give it a nice buff a nice Sheen with the Godsmack song to Tenten I could have talked about that song that appears in all that army commercials on this video or even Vudu awful track but really we had to talk about the song that got Godsmack where they are today no I'm not talking about down in a hole because that's an Alice in Chains song we're talking about Godsmack don't get a mixed up one rips off the other not the other way around no I'm talking about the song whatever a track that hilariously stayed popular even though the message of the song is go away for sure this track does I think have one of the better and more listenable and gear worm guitar riffs of any alternative metal song coming out in in this era but the track is so redundant not doing the best I a beer okay we get it you are trying your best but if you are why is the song so terrible especially when we get down into the lyrics of the verses here you are my pets all the time you get say what you will about Scott Stapp but I find the vocals on God's max records to be so much more excruciating and those are 10 more tracks that were some of the worst tracks of my adolescence let me know what were some of the worst songs of your adolescence genre don't matter share your mind share your opinions share your preferences and and I hope you have a nice today Anthony Fantana worst music adolescence [Music]

YU-MFIbWsK4,hi everyone last anyone tanno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our final installment of last week where I go over what I felt were the 50 best albums of 27 teen we're gonna kind of roll through the first 25 in this list and then go deeper into detail once I get into the higher echelon picks I had to redraft this list again and again and again and finally I think I think I'm happy with the results so let's do it kicking things off at number 50 shout out to Sinjin Hawk with the very excellent and trappy and forward-thinking electronic music album first opus at number 49 death from above with what I feel is their real comeback album outrage is now at number 48 Dying Fetus with wrong one to fuck with brutal death metal album of the year in my opinion at number 47 and 46 we have Paul bear with heartless and sampe with process at number 45 it's kung-fu Kenny with damn what happens on earth stays honor and at number 44 metalcore heavy hitters converge play to their strengths on the album the dusk and us at number 43 it is elder with reflections of a floating world one of the most epic metal records of the year with doom sized heaviness and lots of progressive song structures at number 42 it is run the jewels with our tj3 which makes it onto this list because it came out super late in 2016 to the point where it missed that list week so it lands here and at 41 we have one of the spacer and more experimental and progressive alternative R&B records out there this year a Colella with take me apart at 40 it is rhapsody with LYLAS wisdom and 39 Feist with pleasure at 38 code orange with forever and 37 it is Joey badass with all-american badass at 36 it is Fleet Foxes they returned with their first album in a while crack up beautiful little folk record and at 35 all Vaes with antisocial antisocial lights one of the catchiest and prettiest little dream and indie pop records of the year number 34 probably my favorite grime album of the year it's Wiley with godfather at number 33 an excellent post-punk release from proto martyr relatives in descent and 32 Ariel Pink's new record dedicated to Bobby Jameson at number 31 one of the most electrifying punk records of the year one of the most electrifying Punk records to come out of the UK in a while and that is idols with Brutalism and number 30 New York stand up for princess Nokia with the deluxe version of her 1992 project her and Rough Trade records expanded this thing into one of the most interesting underground rap records of the year at number 29 an inventive fusion of Araby funk music post-punk electronic music and more the new a bo Sound Machine album ooh yay at number 28 we have one of the many records dropped by King gizzard and the lizard wizard this year flying microtonal banana the band's foray into microtonal tuning and number 27 this record is one of my favorites of the year but yeah I just wanted more material from it but what's on here is just insane and crazy it has the gutsiness of like an x-ray Spex album but it's kind of quirky funky and electronic and off the wall like an ex TC or a debo record I'm talking about the new gorilla toss project GT ultra and at number 26 the conceptual and self reflective and introspective new album from quali Chris being you is great I wish I could be you more often and now that we're in the top half of the list let's go at number 25 we have another noisiest loudest heaviest ugliest and most nihilistic albums of the year a record that in a lot of ways reflects my attitude on 2017 the new primitive man album caustic this is such an ugly heavy noise doom album love how hideous and brutal this record is it's it just really grinds down my soul into a fine powder which I then snort like cocaine at number 24 uncommon NASA continues to prove his salt as hip-hop's answer to Rod Serling with one of his darkest and most political and most conceptual albums yet with written at night definitely an underground experimental hip-hop album that you want to listen to if that is your bag along with the new Billy Woods album at 23 known unknowns Billy woods comes through with one of his heaviest punchiest most aggressive and most consistent projects yet you still kind of get his very shouty almost spoken word style very esoteric dense very opaque lyrics on this thing a few of his best hooks to great production just all around a good grimy East Coast hip-hop record at number 22 Jay Z gets personal philosophical and economical on his new project 444 kind of lo-fi and in very low-key production from no ID on this thing from front to back like Jays rhymes on this thing like the more I guess introspective and down-to-earth approach that he approaches this thing with generally I'll say something I said in my review for this this is the first true Shawn Carter album not so much a jay-z album but really a true exposure kind of a pulling back the veil of jay-z the man at number 21 John Darnell and company tribute goth culture and its rise and fall on the new Mountain Goats album Goths also a very interesting record in the Mountain Goats Canon because this is the first project from the band that is completely without guitar and that leads John and his band down some really interesting instrumental roads that I don't think they would have headed in otherwise of course the lyrical and the narrative content of the record is very quality a few sleepy songs underwhelmed me here and there but all around a very good album and one of my favorite additions to the Mountain Goats discography in a while at number 20 a crazy punky driving psychedelic and garage album incorporating elements of experimental rock and crack rock - I'm talking about the new o'seas album orc john dwyer and company come through with some amazing electrifying performances great production good chemistry between everybody playing on this record all around just a very good rock album at number 19 really experimental and kind of archaic Old English influence but still that there's a there's a very post modern quality to the lo-fi nosy production and the layering of the instrumentation on this thing it's an incredible and very uh just very unique folk record I'm talking about the new richard dawson project peasant if you like your folk music off the beaten path and a little on the freakier side especially with a strong narrative element you're gonna want to listen to this and and richard dawson he's also no slouch when it comes to an eccentric vocal so do do anticipate that at number eighteen sharon jones & the dap-kings with soul of a woman a very tight very well written and performed and produced and very consistent soul record and an amazing final chapter to one of the best bands to kind of carry the torch for this sound into this decade at number seventeen we effectively here open mike eagle digging through his past on brick body kids still daydream going back to his stomping grounds living in a project in chicago and kind of waxing poetic on the destruction the demolish meant of that project and sort of what it meant to him the community he came from open mike reflects on memories gentrification in general it is one of his most low-key albums not quite as peppy or as instantaneously memorable as like dark comedy however what sort of intrigued me and kind of was an effective swap out for that was just how incredibly revealing the album is of open mike eagle as a person at number sixteen this record really kind of grew on me this year though i did like it when i initially reviewed it i was very much on the cusp of adding it to my loved list but i thought maybe it was a little inconsistent and didn't quite stick the landing however the more I listened to it the more impressed I was with it and the more I came to realize it really truly is one of the best R&B records of the year and it really truly is actually one of the better ones of the decade to I had to give it to a scissor with the album control split apart a lot of these songs boil down much of the time to tracks where scissor is is almost like the side chick or the other woman and in a lot of these tracks stand very well on their own but when you actually take all these cuts together in a wider scope as an album you kind of get a story of a who kind of starts at that point but then eventually kind of learns her lessons grows as a person gets more self-confident kind of goes from girl to a more kind of womanly protagonist depending less on the validation of others specifically her lovers to kind of get where she wants to be and feel good about herself production is good features are very good and honestly I'm looking forward to hearing scissor grow more as an artist into the future because considering how underwhelmed I was by that Z project way back when I feel like she's truly come a long way at number 15 one of the most enigmatic I've said this again and again but I'll say it I'll say it one more time one of the most enigmatic electronic music producers out there right now amazing new artists on brain feeder cannot wait to see how bright this kid's future is igloo ghost with neo wax bloom very jittery dense mind-bending from a totally friggin different dimension this album is I just keep talking if I allow myself to keep talking just check it out at number 14 shout out to tyler the creator for really kind of improving all fronts on the record flower boy not only are we getting more interesting lyrics this time around seems like tyler has matured as a person he's rapping better he's really improved on his rap skills he's truly improved on his production skills he's brought on some great collaborators on this thing too just really impressed with the jazzy beautiful soulful direction of this album and the bangers on here hit hard to just really like the flow and progression of this record as well all around again improvements everywhere for Tyler the Creator did not think I would enjoy a tyler album this much since bastard but here we are at number 13 it is shoo-shoo with forget with one of the noisiest most abrasive and unsettling and freaky art pop albums the group has dropped in a while in a lot of ways they kind of go back to their roots on this record a little bit but in others like this is a whole new level of weirdness and in Distortion Jamie Stewart's vocals are just as chilling and strange as ever and I also can't really complain about a lot of the very dark subversive and sexual themes playing out in the lyrics on this thing Shu Shu just continues to be one of those Indian project that continues to stay interesting continues to push forward continues to experiment and I'm looking forward to seeing that boundary pushed even further in the future at number 12 one of my new favorite Australian artists this year Alex Cameron with the album forced witness Alex delivers a bunch of weird glitzy hilarious like soft rock tunes and synth pop tunes many of the lyrics on this thing boiled down to a character portrait of a very creepy individual who like a bit of a horndog a total male chauvinist who just like thinks the world of himself I guess and the character kind of turns out to be like a bit of a lovable or a likeable asshole in a lot of ways I guess and and not only is the album selling point this character portrait but also just the amazing hooks the catchy lyrics the sensual and soaring melodies all over this thing this has been one of the most addictive tapes I've listened to this year I just really could not get my ears off of it when I initially listened to it and still it's even hard today especially when I have other stuff I need to be listening to and doing so you know if you want an addictive weird little tongue-in-cheek top record give this thing a shot at number 11 an experimental rock record that took a while to kind of warm up on me but when it eventually did it just continues to impress me to no end with its very eccentric vocal performances with its lush arranged instrumentation with its clean and amazingly produced bass rock instrumentation I'm talking about the new Oxbow album the thin black Duke or rather just thin black Duke I just really love the poetic lyrics on this thing loving the tortured and very moody vibe of this album this record has a vibe that very few rock albums do it's it's very mystical it's very strange there's certainly a sense of wonder to the album in my opinion and here we are in the top 10 let's do it number 10 gotta give it to Mike for the new perfume genius album no shape not only does this record contain some of perfume geniuses most well-written catchiest and versatile material to date but also if there's one simple reason to put this record in this spot if there's one reason to put this record in the spot is beautifully produced and and arranged like the instrumentation on this thing there's so much diversity across the length the entire record and every sound is so gorgeous is so luscious is so vivid there are moments of just soul-crushing heaviness on this album and then there are moments of just like beautiful breezy airy very refined sounds as well just thoroughly impressed with the instrumentation on this record it provides an amazing foundation for again I'll say some of Mike's best songs to date so there we go at number 9 a revolutionary record in my opinion the new Algiers record the underside of power an album that I just cannot get away from not only am I in love with the performances on this thing the production is amazing but again I've said this before I'll say it again they're so few groups out there that to me sit at the musical cross-section that Algiers does I mean if any other groups the influences of soul and blues and post-punk and goth rock and punk music add to that the political element in the bands music as well there are very few groups out there that to me kind of embody the time that they come from embody the time that they exist with then better than Algiers does I think generally everywhere there is a certain level of unhappiness and unrest with the current state of things and I feel like Algiers kind of channel that in in a way very few groups do and another amazing thing about this record just the versatility across this album tracks that feel like a wonderful fusion of very dark rock and soul tracks that feel like weird since the experimental droney odyssey's tracks that feel bluesier and smoother tracks that are like driving heavy hard-hitting synth punk this record really is all over the place however it's the band's kind of eerie atmosphere they're dark despondent almost epochal dick tone that really ties it all together really well into this fantastic package which the album art was a little more interesting though at number eight this record was reviewed very late in the year for me and was kind of a dark horse that I just stumbled upon looking for some records off the beaten path that I had not covered that I might be interested in covering I'm talking about the album Los Angeles from roselia roselia is a Spanish folk singer who teams up with a fantastic producer and guitarist on this album to pull apart and celebrate the Spanish folk and flamenco music tradition by just kind of rehashing and re-envisioning and rewriting and repurposing so many of these older songs from years and years and years ago into this new set of folk tunes that are amazingly performed if there's one reason to put this record this high on this list it is Rosalia's vocal ability she is a vocal powerhouse a vocal stunner and that is the case from the beginning to the end of this project her range her volume her passion it really is kind of enough to get me all teared up and even though this record is pretty much just Spanish guitar and Rosalia's voice it's a very versatile album that sort of pulls at my emotions in different directions and I just love how slightly blemished and untouched this project is like the performances on this thing are so raw are so intimate it's almost like I'm just listening to a live record in a lot of ways and and what Rosalia has done on this record is just so beautiful it doesn't really need to be doctored up it doesn't really need to be touched up all that much like it's just kind of special and electrifying again organically in the raw on its own to me she's one of the most interesting voices in folk music at the moment and I'm just looking forward and excited to hear what she's going to do next at number 7 another one of my favorite Australian artists at the moment this is an amazing pop record guys like he really kind of made a fantastic transition here into a poppier glitzier glam ear record a glam ear sound that is Kieran Jay Kalinin with the record bravado such a display of pop prowess on this thing and the tracks on this thing really runs the gamut from freaky Punkie experimental rock moments like she loves to hang to inspiring and heavy and passionate and soaring and hard-hitting pop anthems that sort of introduced these driving EDM style house beats like this record has a little bit of everything and I love it and Kieran just kind of leads the whole bandwagon of pop triumph with this truly eccentric and strange personality that in a lot of ways feels like a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek parody of this vision he had in his head or just like I don't know like the the most overdone characteristics of masculinity itself in one breath what Karen is doing in his music feels almost like a parody but then in another the songwriting the execution just everything else about his music is so incredible and so special that you can't help but just take it all super seriously Kieran is an artist that I was a little late to somebody when I went down to Australia to do a speaking engagement to her handed me a copy of his last album embrace ISM I was really impressed with it and I knew from there like next time let's do drops an album I have to listen to it I have to find it no matter what because I know it's gonna be special and I'm glad that ended up being the case I really am my number six spot may make some people groan I'll admit that however it is an important album to me it is a significant album to me it's it's an album from nielsie serega mashup master with his latest project here mouths moods sure nielsie serega may be greatly influenced by meme culture there's really no denying that at this point out of all the mashup music that i've been listening to over the course of my life and i've been listening to a lot like I was there when Danger Mouse was getting cease-and-desist s' over doing the gray album I was there when Girl Talk was like the hottest coolest most interesting thing on the planet I've interviewed Stein ski like I've observed a lot of mashups over the years but in my opinion Neil just takes a different a refreshing and a very inventive approach to kind of melodically repurposing one song making it map and match over another he just kind of brings together these musical worlds that one would never think would fit together and in a lot of ways the the unforeseen and the unintentional genius of his work is just to kind of show that just how small artistically or I guess structurally compositionally the world of popular music is that you can essentially just grab these random seemingly random pieces of it and have them collide in a way where it just coalesce --is so beautifully so smoothly and so sensibly and sure there are plenty of jokes and laughs and gags and everything on this record but there are a lot of moments on this thing collisions of songs and pieces of music that I genuinely love and enjoy that I'm actually in awe of and and mashups that actually make me see the two three four however many pieces of music and and samples are coming together on one single track in a completely different light actually kind of recontextualizes the song itself for me and I can't go back and listen to the song in the same way because I just kind of see it from a different angle now so this record a lot of ways has kind of altered my general opinions and my views on pop music and mashups in general and I feel like yeah even though you there are a lot of jokes and there's a lot of silliness to be had on the record it's certainly something special I think Neil is doing whether listeners understand it or not or even whether Neil understands it or not and number five one of the longest albums and longest album titles in the list here Sun Kil moons common as light and love are red valleys of blood mark kozilek the main brain of Sun Kil moon is is marking at his most kozilek on this album I guess you could say on this thing you essentially get two hours of very lengthy very linear experimental rock and folk tunes that have a strong narrative element to them mark is telling tales he is rambling he is going into every minut detail of whatever topic he has set as the subject for a particular song but in my opinion mark writes some of his most and tells some of his most compelling songs and stories that he has dropped since Benji and sure while this album may not be as tunefully as that record or many other triumphs in marks discography the instrumentation at a lot of points rocks a little harder delivers a harder heavier groove it's almost like I'm listening to Mark kozilek be subconsciously influenced by the work of the fall or something but I think the cherry on top is just hearing mark deliver these interesting narratives across the record some of which are greater and more social and more political some of which are very personal moments where he's tributing in song a friend who passed away and just kind of describing who this person was as a person what made that person so special in the eyes of so many people who he knew talking about interacting with fans talking about vague rock songs and kind of lampooning contemporary music in general one track remark is going into detail about his thoughts about the pulse nightclub shooting it is a very long dense album that is difficult to sort of work through and I'll admit I don't always have the time to listen to this record from beginning to end but for me the appeal and beauty of this album really has nothing to do with convenience or ease of use it's really kind of like a great series of short stories like a collection of short stories in a book and I think it's just an interesting moment in Mark's progression and career now keep in mind this is one of many many many albums mark kozilek has released in this year under different collaborations so mark kozilek has had a really prolific year and for him to in a way kind of kick things off with such a huge fantastic record in my opinion has been really good even if everything to come after it hasn't been quite as up to snuff hardcore mark kozilek fans have had a lot to celebrate this year and this album is is certainly one of those things at number four we have a double album from the king remembered in time himself mr. Big KRIT with forever is a mighty long time I definitely commend him for keeping it up with the forever sort of a mention or mantra going on in his album titles I do I do like that a lot but this dude really kind of outdid himself this time and at a point in time in his career where I thought that we had pretty much heard the last of interesting music from big crate not that I felt like he completely fell off but with releasing so much music in such a short span of time without allowing himself that opportunity to kind of grow experiment and get out of his creative bubble a little bit I feel like we were kind of hearing Big KRIT paint himself into a corner but now that he sort of got off his label he's back on his independent thing he's doing things more on his terms he really kind of came through with an excellent double disc album of southern hip hop that is really all over the place like man he pulls off some incredible bangers on this thing some great pop rap tunes a few rap country fusions a gospel number that's really incredible a run of personal introspective tracks on the second disc that do really well some great features excellent beat switches on a few of these tracks too and I just love the Big KRIT still comes through with this will to try different things take risks and he still just has this level of hunger that is inspiring and you can really kind of feel it in his music too especially on this album like this to me is Big KRIT soaring this is Big KRIT triumphing this is Big KRIT just like really pulling out all the stops and just totally burning down everything and building it back up into this like amazing like castle just thoroughly impressed with what he accomplished on this thing hoping to see him push forward even more with another album at some point in the future it's kind of sad that there are some people who are unfortunately sleeping on this thing a little bit and don't seem to be quite as aware of big crits existence now that he's not sort of getting that Def Jam push that he used to but you know make no mistake this is one of the best hip-hop records of the year hands down at number three also a very powerful record we have the new Mount Erie album a crow looked at me I've done a pretty in-depth review of this record and the back story of this album isn't exactly obscure at this point and it's not anything I want to pull apart once again in this video I just ask that you know if you are curious just look it up yourself but the the story of death and dying losing a loved one that is close to you is not a story and not a narrative that is completely new in music however this album just kind of brings it up in this vivid sort of high-definition reality to the point where it's it's almost hard to stomach it's almost hard to kind of look at straight in the face the musical style is a little meditative the instrumentation the folk instrumentation is very rough around the edges as to be expect with a Mount Erie production from a Phil elrom production but I do like the instrumental vibe of this record it kind of goes back to one of my favorite mount here releases dawn so it's kind of like this somewhat I guess loose Fulk instrumentation set to poetry and the poetry the words the Phil pulls together on this record about the loss of his wife to cancer are just really hard really tough and I don't know there just have been very few records this year that have sort of shaken me emotionally to my core in the way that this album has and as difficult as this album is to wrestle with in some respects I do think it is a beautiful album I do think it is one of Phil's most inspired and well put together albums despite the fact that you know obviously this topic the subject matter was very difficult for him to sort of approach in the way that he did on this record all I can say past this point is you know I hope people continue to support Phil and Mount Airy through this time I hope he's doing well I hope he's healing I hope he's doing better I hope his you know family is doing okay and just looking forward to I guess hearing more music from him and looking forward to kind of seeing him you know continue to grow and again I'll say he'll and just survive and number two this group come lately just shook things up and wrapped this year with three fantastic records one after the next of course I'm talking about Brock Hampton with saturation one two and three I was kind of debating on whether or not I would sort of separate them and have them at different points in the list but honestly now that I've heard all three of them and they're so close together in terms of quality and consistently and I feel like the power and the statement of all of them is amplified by having heard all three I just couldn't separate them so they're all in the number two spot here Rockhampton West coast-based boy band featuring guys like Kevin abstract on McLennan Merlin would a mere van Matt champion Georgia Bear face the gang's all here the gang's all here these guys really killed it this year man like they came out with so much great music so much essential hardcore hip-hop pop rap they just really kind of run the whole gamut man sonically stylistically and they have such great chemistry and energy together when they're all rapping on a track such eccentric kooky colorful production such great personality coming out of this thing with each member sort of having their own voice their own direction their own lyrical style been a long time and I mean a long time since we've heard a collective that has kind of gelled together this well and yeah it may seem very recent that we kind of went through a clique phase in hip-hop where you know you had your Pro era and your MMG and your good music and your odd future but none of those groups really kind of came together cohesively as a unit as Brock Hampton has on these three records and it seems like the longer they stay together the more music they put out together the more risks they're taking the more that they are learning to kind of create as a collective and push forward as a collective and I'm just really excited to see what the future holds for these guys I mean if there's one artist or one group that I am excited the most for the future of its Brock Hampton right now I'm most excited for Brock Hampton the most and my number one record of 2017 is an album that in my opinion is 2017 through-and-through and that has to be the new father John misty album pure comedy father John misty in my opinion came together with an album that is not gonna be for everybody and that's totally fine my feeling is for putting this record at the number one spot are very personal although all my picks on this list are personal but given the state of 2017 I feel like I needed a pure comedy I needed an album that sort of pulled apart just a lot of the reasons why things are so shit not just simply commenting on the surface level of that or the symptoms of that but getting down to a lot of what makes humanity so broken as a species but also addressing topics that manifest themselves and interesting ways in the Internet age such as narcissism humanity's ego and then toward the back end of the project Josh Tillman goes as far as to almost like predict a humanity's demise at its own hand and while a lot of people find this record very sad very depressing very dreary and very long-winded do keep in mind the the title of this record is very intentional there is certainly an element of very real dark and deadpan and somewhat ironic humor to the way that Josh approaches these topics on this record and that is very much a brand of humor a humorous style that I subscribe to myself I feel like sometimes the world is so messed up is so dark is so horrifying that you really can't do anything but laugh at it and I feel like in some respects this album does that very well and there's also the musical style of this album this is not the folky and romantic and luscious and intoxicating sound that you may remember from father John misty instead Josh comes through with a much colder and a much more theatrical base of instrumentation this time around and that's one thing as I've listened to this album more and more I've come to appreciate about it there's like a real sense of musical theatre in drama too a lot of these narratives and a lot of these songs it's like I'm listening to a lot of the characters josh is singing about on this record play these scenarios out on a stage and like any play or satire on the problems of the present Josh kind of takes a lot of the modern-day issues that we're dealing with and pushes them to an extreme rolls the clock back a certain amount of time into the future so that we've just entered dystopia and I love it when an artist can kind of pull that off really effectively whether it be in music and movies and video games wherever the the medium may be I don't think this album is gonna be for everybody I'll say that again but it certainly is for me and and again I feel like this record really does embody 2017 and all its faults and those are my favorite albums of the year guys thanks for watching let me know down in the comments with some of your favorite albums of the year work and I will see you guys very soon in another video love you love you

jTW5_KvkGoE,hi everyone GOP tax bill here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for us to continue our 2017 westward video stirs where I go over some of the best and worst music of the year in this video in my opinion these are the top 50 singles of 2017 I'm gonna roll through the first half of this list not give too much detail but then after I pass the 25th spot I'll talk a little bit more about each track that stuck out to me that I thought was special what made it special let's go at number 50 we have Kimbra with top of the world and at number 49 yung lean with red bottom sky at number 48 it's the killers with run for cover that's really punchy fun song and following that up over at number 47 its Ke$ha with pride yeah at number 46 it is Juicy J with flood watch one of the most fun pop rap songs I've heard this year and after that at 45 we have mister playboy cardi with a New York I'm mid-level the song Magnolia at number 44 one of the biggest and hugest and most undeniable and inescapable songs of the year its cardi B with Bo - yellow at number 43 it is Fleet Foxes with 3rd of May and after that at 42 ski-mask the slump God with one of the craziest and most insane tracks that he's dropped this year amazing flow on this track catch me outside at number 41 it is Colella with waiting at 40 it is Charli XCX with Boyz at number 39 we have Feist with pleasure and at 38 it is always with plimsoll punks at number 37 roger waters returns with an amazingly powerful and political track deja vu at 36 it's little pump with Gucci gang good game good game good game good game good game good game good game good game good game at number 35 its Rhapsody featuring Kendrick and Lance on her new track a really good collaboration amazing energy fantastic be good flows thoughtful lyrics 34 proto martyr with to goda and the CID at number 33 it is Vince staples with big fish 32 st. Vincent with pills at number 31 it's Big KRIT who is keeping the devil off at number 30 it is the chilling leak beautiful single from EBE featuring Kumasi washington deathless n ER d with lemon featuring rihanna is at number 29 and number 28 it is lou the human one of the most interesting up-and-comers in rap right now with his single McLemore at 27 it is a video sound machine with the pot is on fire and at number 26 we have the mountain goats with rain in Soho from their latest album Goths let's move into a bit more detail a little bit more passion here with the top 25 singles of the year let's start at number 25 one of the most enigmatic electronic producers out right now drops the song white gum I'm talking about igloo ghosts from his latest record neo wax bloom jittery fun insane production on this thing so much colour kaleidoscopic intense energy lovely he's bringing to the table and excited to see what he's gonna be doing in the future at number 24 sophie reinvents herself with a new beautiful expansive passionate art pop ballad simply not just producing weird quirky bubblegum base under the sophie name anymore and I'm really excited to sort of see where this vocally led production and in style of pop music sort of takes her down the road I think 2018 is gonna be a year where Sophie really kind of leaves a mark especially if she's delivering material like this at number 23 we have scissor singing her sultry and very sexy song of being that side chick on the weekend a grey R&B cut among some of the best of this year at number 22 Ariel pink dips his toes into the pool of dream pop a little bit on feels like kind of going back to his more lo-fi and nostalgic sound on this new record of his really enjoy the tune really enjoy the aesthetic as far as underground experimental and quirky pop music goes Arielle pink very much still has it and at number 21 one of my favorite mainstream chart-topping pop rap songs of the year I couldn't really deny it it's post Malone's rockstar featuring 21 savage there are so many tracks in the past that post Malone has drafted that I just had not cared for at all as you guys remember I did it not good it's a big breakout record but for whatever reason this track just sticks with me love is vocal melody Anna sing love 21 savages contribution to the track love the instrumental it's just a really cold-blooded melodic fun catchy song just really AM enamored with it and hopefully post Malone grows from here would love to see him come out with more tracks at this quality level at number 20 Paramore matures and expands into the realm of pop music with hard times love the disco grooves on this track these smooth synthesizers Hayley Williams kills it as the lead vocalist as usual but you know just just new for a new sound new aesthetic that I'm enjoying so much more and hoping that the band kind of sticks with this going forward at number 19 MGMT experiments a little with some kind of alternative weird dark almost gothic sounds on little Dark Age one of their better Tunes that have heard in a while and I don't know it seems like most people are pretty impressed and excited for MGMT has to offer on this new album of theirs and and I am too it's it's been a long time since MGMT has has really kind of hit it out of the park at number 18 it is the beautiful and gorgeous slip away from perfume genius one of the most lavish and beautiful art pop tunes that I've heard this year at number 17 mama told me not to so work me goes t-shirt my favorite single off of their new album culture yes even better than bad and boozy as it's popular and as viral as that song is and it's technically not a 20-17 single anyway even though it was a huge song this year but still t-shirt for me amazing song great flows super sticky chorus everything fantastic about the meego sound condensed into one very chill laid-back and in an instantaneous ly memorable track at number 16 we have grinding brutal and aggressive post-punk music coming from the band idols on the song mother it's a very socially charged lyrics on this track to dealing mostly in gender politics as well as one of the catchiest punk songs that have heard this year and number 15 got to give it to my girl poppy with Mac computer boy not only is this really great fun bubblegum pop music but I just love the lyrics love the very electronic beat lovely quirky production love the funny lyrics kind of dealing in love and romance in the internet age ever since I've been hearing a few artists here and there kind of deal in that topic it seems like the floodgates are finally opening which i think is a great topic I think it's a cool thing for art and music to explore because thanks to the Internet the the battlefield of love has really just kind of changed in a lot of ways and it's interesting to see artists write songs about that interact with the way that technology has affected love or kind of find new ways to attack the topic of love using the information age at number 14 it is Tyler the creators very beautiful lavish single with Rex orange county finds and time fan some time to do some of course if you couldn't recognize that from my horrible singing voice that is the song boredom loving the jazzy dreamy very pretty direction Tyler took a lot of the songs on his new album flower boy in especially this track over here which is why it had to make it on this list at number 13 it's one of the most beautiful and personal ballads that Lord has ever laid to tape of course it is Liability great spare piano instrumental in the background her vocal performance is really impressive love how she sort of attacks the topic of love in the limelight in the lyrics here too all around great song one of her best and looking forward to seeing her mature even more as a songwriter down the road at number 12 it is one of the most fiery and exciting and experimental punk songs that I've heard all year HM Ltd's or Happy Meal Limited's as their I guess were formerly No the song to the door there's so many things going on in this track like the driving groove the weird kind of spaghetti western guitars the almost like trap influenced electronic breakdown in the midst of the song off-the-wall insanely vocals just full of vibrance and energy at number 11 shout-out to my dude open mike eagle for his song 95 radios off of his latest record brick body kids still daydream beautiful personal album going back into open my Eagles past and the song brings the LP into a very beautiful introspective and nostalgic moment on the album in the second half loved the chyme e keyboards on the track loved open mike eagle singing on this track to one of his best vocal performances even if it is very low-key open my eagle continues to approach these fusions of hip-hop of pop music in a way that no other artist does and I feel like he only grows bolder and more distinct with each release and songs like this are proof of that and number 10 were in the top 10 now my dudes in injury reserve with the song see a sweat from their new EP drive it like it's stolen one of those rare moments where you have a pop rap song that has a strong dance beat behind it one you could probably play in the club but the aesthetic the the the the performance is very quiet it's very subtle it's very very very just like hushed so they're trying to write this kind of super low-key super nocturnal dance club e pop rap song and for the most part they really pull it off the instrumental is great grogs and Ritchie have some good vocal performances and flows on here too huge Pharrell and I I guess I would say nerd and Neptune's influence on this thing comes together really well really liking what they did with this track and of course always excited to see what injury reserve is gonna do next at number nine one of my favorite duets of the year has to be Alex Cameron with these song strangers kiss featuring angel Olson if you haven't heard angel Olsen's album last year please do it's fantastic but this is one of many great songs off of Alex Cameron's latest record forced witness not many of the tracks on the record are like this one though a lot of these cuts add up into a really weird character portrait of a very sketchy individual but but for whatever reason we have this cut over here which stands out on the album as this moment of serene beauty even if the the lyrics of the track do tell a much darker story than the sound of the song does at number eight I picked one of the most memorable most bold and thoughtful tracks I think this artist has ever released and that has to be jay-z's the story of OJ this is one of many tracks on his new album where he sort of takes on the idea of poverty in the black community kind of laying that at the foot of or illustrating its connection to generational wealth there's been a lot of politically charged music especially hip-hop in 2017 and jay-z is one of the few artists that I think approached it in song with a super like high level bird's-eye view and also tried to come his listeners with not just problems but also solutions and did that while simultaneously coming through with some of his best material at number seven shout out to Reena saw a yama with cyber Stockholm Syndrome again one of many tracks like Poppy's computer boy which addresses sort of love in the Internet age love how glamorous the instrumental is here love her vocal melody on this thing like the lyrics quite a bit Sabbath Sandra the whole vibe and aesthetic of the track feels like a throwback to a lot of the pop and R&B songs of the 2000s but approached in a much more creative way at number six it was kind of a difficult pick because I feel like there were several singles on this album that it was it was a bit of a toss-up as far as like a favorite I feel like I'm gonna go with Kendrick Lamar's humble huge single for me this year obviously one of the biggest singles of 2017 there are parts of me they're like you know what like go with element element is a fantastic song love element so much like so many of the moments on element lyrically and instrumentally just kind of stick out to me a little bit more and there's a part of me that's like humbles a little overplayed this year so maybe like you know down the road once I kind of have a little bit more distance from it I'll be able to appreciate a little bit more but I at the end of the day I think I am gonna go with humble which is obviously one of the best pop rap tracks of the year one of kendrick lamar's biggest and most popular songs period really creative track love how he kind of approached a lot of these trap and pop rap trends in song in a way where he wrote a hit he wrote a frigging banger but he kept it thoughtful he kept it in such a way where it didn't feel like he was sort of selling himself short or cheapening his craft and just handing the listener garbage and when you think about Kendricks career in general like that's what he's done most successfully written hip-hop music that has a high level of accessibility to it while also delivering a message or at least some you know artistic and experimental quirks that put it outside the norm and above way above the average at number five a track that is going to stand out to me as one of the most chilling and soul-crushing tracks of the year and that has to be Phil alvrez real death from his new album acro looked at me a very sad and depressing lo-fi folk song which is in his typical songwriting style a lot of the sounds and aesthetics of his latest record kind of go back to an earlier project of his titled dawn an album that I'm happy to see is getting a bit more attention and shine after this album has been released and he's talking about how dealing with such an intense thing such a huge gargantuan loss the mother of his child sort of makes him see death differently this is a topic that he has approached countless times in song in the past and now that it's sort of real it's a real thing it's not just something to make art with it's not just something to you know just sort of see in the abstract it is this real thing looking him in the face changing the trajectory of his life and essentially putting him in a state of severe suffering and it's a unique moment in music where you can really just kind of hear what the artist is going through it is translating so clearly through the according through the song itself to the point where it's just it's chilling and moments on this new album of his it's almost too real but that is a part of the strength of this new album of Phil's and especially this new track I had a similar experience with what sits at number four on this list but instead of translating in a very real way the sense of death we get a sense of dread over the socio-political landscape that we're currently staring in the face it's very ugly horrid orange face at the moment and that is the new Algiers single the underside of power not only do I love the tune on this thing recording and performance are excellent but also I just kind of love the messaging of this track love that the band creatively fuses elements of rock and gospel and blues and punk on this thing the track also features one of the catchiest most passionate and roaring choruses I've heard this year too and I just feel like Algiers is one of the sharpest and most creative bands doing it right now and I'm just excited to hear them continuing to push forward because when it comes to underground music out there that has a strong political edge to it there are a lot of bands out there that are sort of doing it with Algiers flair and creativity in my opinion at number three Brock Hampton with keep a gold chain I'm a net the boys are here one of my favorite rap singles of the year I guess my favorite rap single of the year if you're a pop rap single of the year great beat on this thing amazing little piano keys fantastic verses from each member of the group great energy great vibe just everything that made Brock Hamptons special to me in 2017 brought down into one track although one track cannot sort of fully explain the the Brock Hampton universe they dropped three records this year each one of them fantastic in its own way each year I pretty much do one single one artist and I just try to pick my favorite single from the artists so we can get everybody sort of in on the list but listen if I if I didn't do that way this lists would be littered with Brock Hampton singles let me tell you that it would be littered with them at number two a slick sensual pop ballad that to me says a lot about ego this bravado from Kieran jcalahan love the gutsy vocal performance on this track love the slick synth pop instrumental love the groove Kieran is just such an accomplished and passionate vocalist and every time I hear something new from him his songwriting just gets better and better this song is proof of that for me like I could not stop playing the song this year I could not get this song out of my head this year it is just one of the stickiest tracks creative colorful production on this thing I could just talk about this song all day love it love it love it love it love it ah and finally at number one a track that to me exemplified 2017 in a lot of ways because I feel like this year outside of the musical realm this year has been  and for me if there's a song that that really kind of spelled out why that was kind of getting at the root of the the human condition that had to be the title track the lead single from father John misty 's latest record pure comedy to me the song is just so 2017 it's so 2017 because I feel like you couldn't really live through this year without reflecting on just how divided just how ugly just how awful things have gotten not just at home but abroad and I feel like on this track Josh Tillman boils a lot of that down into this grand showy theatrical piano ballad with wonderful horn crescendos and lyrical shots a humanity and religion let it just be known if there's ever some kind of missile strike that happens somewhere in my vicinity and and I am lucky enough to see it coming this will be the song rolling through my head as shits about to go down and my final moments on this earth are being counted down and those are my top 50 singles of the year guys hope you enjoyed this list hope I made some good recommendations hopefully you got some artists out of this thing that you hadn't heard before

Lc_b_5Ewq74,
_s1NfR6tjRY,hi everyone run theny fast Hanna here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it is time for the next installment of list week listing things out lists and things out in this video we have the top 10 worst singles of 2017 let's go at number 10 we're gonna kick it off with one of the worst pop singles I've heard this year and one of the most hideous departures from a groups particular sound that has to be Weezer with the overawe glitzy glossy pop production on this track is absolutely gross some of rivers Cuomo's most uninspired lyrics as well i just really dislike the sound and aesthetic of this track in a very strong way i'm very repulsed by it from the shiny splashy piano chords to the soaring vocals it's about every millennial pop cliche that you can think of hi I just think it's awful I have no use for it I just have no use for it this next track is not one of the more well-known on the list however it did stand out to me personally as being most tacky and tasteless that I've heard this year the new MNDR and scissor sisters collaboration swirl yes the song is as disgusting as the title sounds it's literally like a pop dance sort of alternative dance tune talking about a variety of different dances and moves that one can do sort of fusing them all together into one gross gyrating movement which they dub swirl which literally sounds like the noise I make when I'm throwing up just broke the groovin beat on this thing is kind of nice but generally I find the sounds on this track to be way too digital way too lifeless the vocals are really really annoying like it's it's it's basically a really obnoxious novelty song like I don't know like that that weird frog guy what happened to that weird Frog guy that the Frog guy at number eight we have Machine Gun Kelly was at my best featuring Hailee Steinfeld this this to me is essentially everything wrong with white pop rap everything that's disliked about it everything that's tacky about it everything that's melodramatic about it and awful to the ears is just exemplified in this track if there's one trend that I wish would just disappear and die out it is just overly dramatic pop rap songs with huge glamorous explosive choruses an awful vocal feature who sounds pretty much just like every other vocal feature who appears on these kinds of tracks and let's be honest here it's it's all just a ripoff of Eminem style anyway but a very mediocre version of that and we've heard a pretty a pretty awful Eminem this year let's let's say that but surprisingly the Eminem singles from this year we're not awful enough to make it onto this list they just squeezed out of the list but we have provided this terrible Eminem ripoff moving on from there one of the most annoying singles of the year has to be Iggy Azalea smoke valance yeah it's it's just as redundant and mindless and repetitive is like you know that that song that big sean has about ass banger be is really obnoxious Iggy Azalea sounds goofy on the track I just don't see her career coming back at this point I'm just I just I just don't think it's coming back at this point just not with material like this not with material like this at number 6 it is Fall Out Boy with young and menace the band is back with a record that is actually even a worse departure than Weezer on feels like summer like they're pretty much embodying every terrible EDM cliche and EDM is is no longer even the the zeitgeist at the moment so why they would think to rip it off now I don't know but I don't know what I hate more on this track is it the super overblown beat is it the weird chipmunk tree VirB echoes splash sound of like a cat being strangled to death this track sounds like Skrillex and m83 going on a really bad blind date it's pretty much what it sounds like not really sure what else there is to say about it it's just a really garish dislikable single at number five this is a track that was kind of on the fence with but now that I have heard it in the context of the rest of the album that it sits on and I know that the album is god awful little yachties bring it back yeah I mean this song is so awful it's it's almost so awful that it's kind of enjoyable as like a bit of a goof as a bit of a gag but essentially this is like little little yadi singing out of tune and very awkwardly over like this shimmering ad style pop rock instrumental in a way I do kind of enjoy the track as a joke especially with the silly music video is attached to however I do have to at the end of the day acknowledge that an awful track is an off track and and that is what this is bring it back this thing is so off it's so incredibly awkward and the the song stinks like Jesus cries the lyrics what you can derive as a vocal melody out of this thing I mean I don't know who finally approves this stuff like it no nobody said hey go back and clean it up a little bit so that it's you know like synced up it make make sense but whatever I guess all in good fun anyway at number four some of you guys actually thought the only Smith that was gonna be worth hearing this year was a Jaden Smith and you were sorely mistaken because his father Will Smith dropped a new track this year titled get lit well Smith it's getting away this is one of the worst things I've heard this year like bad how did this happen I don't think Will Smith has an album coming out or anything so he he just decided to drop a track out of the blue and it's just awful not only are we talking about huge gigantic electric daisy festival sized percussion on this thing but also there's like a little bit of a reggae and dancehall vibe coming through on the keyboards on this thing of course there's auto-tune on the vocals it's like every awful mainstream cliche going on in music right now executed in the worst way possible the lyrics are trash and Will Smith sounds just as corny as ever like easy sounds just at number 3 this track comes from a fellow youtuber which was actually a hotbed of awful music this year not just the music industry because a prevailing trend on the platform in 2017 was youtubers going rap and putting out like diss songs and stuff so you have a bunch of people who can't really wrap all that well paying other producers sometimes getting ghostwriters to like basically come up with a tolerable song for them so they could put it on their YouTube channel and they look cool and one of the greatest cultural offenders on this front has to be one rice gum and while he did drop quite a few awful tracks this year I have to specifically point out his response track - Jake Paul's it's everyday bro it's every night sis I do not get rice gums bag honestly like he's so popular I don't really understand why because he makes so much money it seems like there are a lot of people out there who like him but he just oozes this lack of self-confidence and you can't really step on the mic and sound like you have no self esteem at least not in a way where you're like I hope no one realizes I'm a bitch everything about the song sounds like a novelty song but rice gum probably doesn't think it's a novelty song from his flow and his delivery to the really generic beat it's like a joke song with no jokes it will actually actually does have a joke rice gum rice gum is the joke in the song he's the joke at number two inching it out in front of every night sis of course it's everyday bro Jay Paul and team 10 everyday bro it does have to take up this spot because it not only is it a garbage song but it's also kind of responsible for taking a lot of this YouTube rap outside of the YouTube bubble and putting it into the mainstream I have a sneaking suspicion that the popularity of this song and the effect that it's going to have culturally will lead to a peak track the death of trap especially considering that Gucci Mane just did a feature with this dude on the it's every neighbor a remix generic trap beat terrible rapping garbage bars mediocre everything mediocre people a man from England who says England is his City you hit my phone last night and it was 342 and I got a tax up there were a few good memes to come out of this music video and song and Jake Paul for the most part seems we're an accepting of the fact that he's become the Internet spud bag however there are moments when he seems like way too much of an idiot and a little too offensive for me to just like grapple with I think a low point for me culturally on YouTube was when he went down to Houston after the hurricane to basically turn the tragedy into a photo op for himself so yeah this song is poopoo its doo-doo it's caca flush it down the toilet and here we go number one the worst song of the year and in my opinion has to be a the new Hopson single happy ending this is the most racist I've heard all year honestly Hopson on this track essentially goes to an Asian massage parlour and raps from the standpoint of a few women who work there in a very high-pitched nasal broken English dialect he is essentially rapping in yellow face on this track and if that wasn't distasteful enough on the track he's he's basically rapping about getting sucky sucky and fucky-fucky and then after that he goes into grave detail as to what the woman is doing for him and when when he finishes and you know at the end of the day it's not even that the song is graphic it's not even that there's an element of prostitution in the song it's just the tacky Cornelius ISM the fact that Hopson feels so emboldened to brag so openly about a time he paid for sex all right aren't I cool I'm really cool if you want to get sexual in a song it's totally fine but the joke in this track is just really not there and the racial overtones are  disgusting he's just really trying to capitalize super hardcore on these ugly Asian stereotypes and you know that's really enough to make it the worst song of the friggin year and I think we are going to leave it at that everybody transition relevant links and reviews to some of the artists who made these songs are down there in the description box thank you for watching leave a comment if you have a thought on this video over next to my head is another list week video you can check out I will see you guys in the next one anthony Fantan Oh worse of 2017 forever 
TVcu3R_qLFM,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and list week begins officially with me going over my 15 favorite ep's of 2017 we are gonna blow through the first five of these and then get into the top 10 where I talk a little more specifically about the releases that I have in this list all of them are linked down below in the description box at 15 we have some pretty nice death metal with extremity extremely fucking dead at 14 a wonderful little EP Tony Allen put out as a tribute to Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers at 13 we are gonna go with David Bowie's posthumous no plan EP released very early into the year at number 12 it's gonna be Paul White with Danny Brown on the accelerator EP Paul White produced quite a few beats for Danny Brown's latest album atrocity exhibition and you essentially have a few extra tracks over here titled after Paul not Danny landing on this EP they're pretty cool and at number 11 we have perturbator with the new model EP if you're looking for some very dark electro music then give this thing a shot and in the top 10 we are kicking it off with yucky duster it's just quite a nice little indie EP with some of my favourite little cutesy indie tunes with a you know a bit of a slacker rock Flair very funny playful quaint lyrics - it's a little low fly it's a little rough around the edges but it's quite nice it's it's one of my favourite tapes I picked up this year at number 9 shout out to my dude Kumasi Washington with his harmony of difference EP definitely one of the better jazz EPS that came out this year although stylistically musically sonically didn't really come off that different from a lot of what the material was on the epic which kind of kept me from reviewing it but still it's a quality EP it's a jazz EP that you should not miss if you are a jazz fan and if you are a jazz fan you most likely have not had this EP slip by you so it sits on a list it's it's cool it's nice number eight shout-out to my dudes at Street sects for coming together with an altogether different direction on this new collection of tracks not quite as harsh in abrasive and as industrial and noisy as a lot of the material on their amazing album and position they sort of take things a much darker murkier gothy er post-punk year direction on this collection of cuts they're nice they're pretty cool it's it's nice to hear the band sort of experiment with some new sounds greater sense of melody clearer songs and structures even though the end result is a bit more faint than I would have liked it to be I'm still hoping that this is a sound that they experiment with more that they push forward with more incorporated into their usual sound and just kind of grow in progress with at number 7 we have fancy facts Seth with void masquerading as matter the span a handful years ago came through with one of the most brutal and animalistic black metal albums I have heard this decade really great album they have now followed it up with this EP and they've kind of taken this brutal heavy very progressive sound very busy sound and laden it with these epic like gigantic very glossy icy synthesizers in a way it's kind of orchestral but also they use these sense to add this great layer of dissonance in intensity to their music to so it's not just all melody and harmony being brought by these scents like the band's music is still really abrasive really intense really tight performances really creative black metal all around I'm liking what the synth layers are adding and I'm hoping that they sort of experiment with them more do something with them on a new record definitely one of the better metal EPS I've heard this year at number six shout out to Denzel curry for come through with the 13 ap really grimy aggressive lyrical hardcore fast fiery spitting trap Denzel curry continues to prove why he is one of the most promising young voices in rap right now at number five young thug and carnage team up for a handful of fantastic colorful eccentric bangers on the young Martha EP definitely not a rap EP that you want to miss this year at number four it's injury reserve with drive it like it's stolen I'm glad the guys did not sit 20:17 out and delivered unto us a handful of good tracks some good singles ones that sort of took a darker space ear in somewhat murkier tone it was kind of interesting to hear them take a holy pee in this direction they're just continuing to drop quality tracks continue to prove their versatility as a group number three was a bit of an upset to me it's an EP that I did not anticipate enjoying as much as I did but I did like quite a lot the new Nine Inch Nails EP not the actual events it came out very late in 2016 after list week in 2016 which is why I'm incorporating it into list week in 2017 this EP was a bit of a an aggressive throwback to the very harsh and catchy industrial rock that put Nine Inch Nails on the map in the first place and I think Trent just kind of pulled it off really well at number two shout out to Death Grips for the steroids Crouching Tiger Hidden Gabbar megamix where the experimental hip hop trio the industrial hip hop trio manages to work Gabbar music into their repertoire they also kind of return to a much darker more noisy lo-fi and hectic sound on this one kind of returning to the the kind of very renegade production style that you might have heard on their ex military mixtape really enjoying that hoping the trio continues to experiment and expand in the future and incorporate some of these newer sounds into a more high fidelity album next year or in 2019 and finally for me EP of the year has to be Rina saw a Yama's Rina wonderful pop EP some of the best pop music singing and production I've heard all year I mean actually the best because I mean there's like what is is like the Katy Perry albums better not really but really though the instrumentation on this thing is dense it's fantastic she works with Clarence clarity on the production there's something kind of fruity and kooky and strange about a lot of the beats but the melodies the the glossy scents the very propulsive pop beats they're all there they're undeniable they're so frigging ear wormy the songwriting and the sounds of the instrumentals kind of throw things back to the era of pop divas and boy bands in the 2000s and Riina's voice just lives up to that task so well the singing on this thing is it super flashy or anything it's everything you need it's nothing you don't it pops in all the right places it's not really trying to sell you on anything other than quality tunes that latch themselves on to your brain and those are my top 15 EEPs of 2017 all of which are linked down below in alphabetical order check them out down there and you are the best over here next to my head is a another link to other list week videos you can also click on the link to subscribe to the channel and I will catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana top 15 DPS of 2017 forever 
14Py6kcxKKQ,"Hey, everyone. Fresh Orange here, The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd™... and it's time for a review of the new Eminem album, Revival. Wow. Wow! This album is bad, it's... It's really bad. Like, I don't wanna waste your time. I don't wa- I don't wanna waste any more of my time... It i- It is bad. I feel like this record has already sucked away enough of my life force, so let's not beat around the bush. Legendary Detroit rapper comes back, and releases a sequel to some of his most disliked albums, Relapse and Recovery. In a way, this album is kinda like a meditation on his waning relevance, or at least, that's how he sets the tone on the opening track here featuring Beyoncé. He pens kinda, like, a lyrical odyssey on his fall from grace. The bare piano instrumental in the background was a nice touch, Beyonce's hook on the track is very pretty... I find Eminem's story and introspective lyricism on the track pretty compelling, despite this weird, erratic angry staccato flow that he seems to be locked into lately. He sounds like, uh, a malfunctioning tone-deaf robot who's, like, finding out what feelings are for the first time. So, he writes this huge emotional track about his fame, his feelings on his fame, his alleged perfectionism And then, immediately after this, he spends the rest of the album delivering to us 18 cuts that, uh, pretty much exemplify why he's not taken as seriously as he used to be. To kinda take it track by track, we have the barely tolerable ""I Believe"" and ""Chloraseptic."" The former of the two there is kind of an extension of the opening track, but a bit more aggressive.
Both songs feature these very subtle, kind of muddy trap beats. Phresher, who's featured on the song ""Chloraseptic,"" is the album's lone rapper featured, but he doesn't actually rap. He just handles the hook. You hear him occasionally on there, but then he just kinda disappears and falls into the background as Eminem's delivering these triplet flows on the chorus. It's kind of just, like, a really weird mix. It's one of many weird mixes across this entire album. Like, how he has sold millions and millions of records and his songs are mixed like garbage, I don't know. After this, we have the song, ""Untouchable,"" which could essentially be the centerpiece to a ""Hamilton""-style rap musical inspired by white guilt. I get the sentiment behind the track. I get what Eminem is trying to communicate on the song, but I feel like his approach is just so grossly preachy and reductive. Not to mention, his yelpy vocals and the instrumental are absolutely hideous and annoying. Way to go ruining a completely good Cheech and Chong song. Eminem is right in this song, though, because sometimes it can be really embarrassing to be white. This moment is certainly one of them. [Eminem, ""Foolish Pride""]
♪ Blacks and whites sometimes mix ♪ ♪ But black girls only want your money cos they're dumb chicks ♪ ♪ So imma say it like this: ♪ ♪ Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss. ♪ The song ""River"" featuring Ed Sheeran is, of course, a terrible, melodramatic rap ballad, the worst bar on this track being: ""Actually just shit on my last chick / And she has what my ex lacks."" Ex lacks? Get it? Ex-Lax? Musically, the song just sounds really cliché, really trite, overly dramatic... The lyrics are all about being in a relationship built on lies and taking advantage of one another. It's pretty unlikable. N-no reason to listen to this track ever again. The song ""Remind Me"" ruins another perfectly good song: Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock n' Roll."" It's this really garish, ugly rap-rock fusion, with the worst bar on it being, ""Your booty is heavy-duty... *sigh* like diarrhea."" Yeah, it's just stomach churning. It's sickening. I can't stand it. The song ""Like Home"" is this anti-Trump anthem that is trying way too hard, *way too hard* to be meaningful, anthemic, and inspiring. Like, I wish that Eminem had just recorded an acapella of his BET freestyle and just put it on here. Some of the bars on this thing are, like, so corny in comparison to his performance there. The overblown kick drums and the glossy MIDI pianos in the mix do not help. The worst bar on this track has to be: ""Cos this type of pickle we're in's hard to deal."" As- as in- as in-*cough* As in, like, d-deal. Like ""dill,"" like ""dill pickle."" Also, on this track, he rhymes ""Nazi"" with ""not see,"" and ""General Lee"" with ""generally."" On the song ""Bad Husband,"" I don't know what's worse. Is it the instrumental and the X Ambassadors' hook?
Th-the weird sputtering electronics in the beat? Or is it Eminem's lyrics about, ""How can I be such a garbage, abusive spouse but such an amazing dad???"" Which, I mean, I get it. Some people are terrible at some things and good at other things. It's not really rocket science. It just seems like a really weird, kinda, humblebrag. Y'know, now that I think about it, it's definitely the X Ambassadors' hook. Tha-that's grosser. Tha-that's the grossest part, even with Eminem's final verse on the track trying its best to evenly distribute the blame across both parties... *cough cough* really desperately. The song ""Tragic Endings"" literally sounds like a demo. The mix sounds like crap.
It sounds like a demo song.
Why is it on this album? I think this song just goes to show that all the money in the world cannot buy good taste. It apparently cannot buy good production, either. The song ""Framed"" is actually one of the better sounding tracks on the record. Lyrically, it's a pretty funny song. Eminem comes through with this zany, very expressive flow. Kind of feels like old Eminem. There's a bit of a serial killer vibe coming through in the lyrics, too. It's kind of fun, however, I think Em sort of botches the hook on this thing like he did his marriage. ""I was fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamed."" ""He got nothing to do with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee."" We have more excruciating melodrama on the song ""Nowhere Fast."" It's pretty much your typical Eminem ""tugging-at-your-heartstrings"" affair, but with Kehlani on the hook. Ehh... There's really nothing special about the track outside of Eminem's vocal passages at the 3:20 mark, which is some of the worst vocal layering I've heard all year. It sounds like Eminem trying to harmonize with MIDI strings and a tone-deaf robot. [Eminem, ""Nowhere Fast""]
♪ Who knows what the future for us could hold? ♪ ♪ Another shooter? Uh-oh ♪ The song ""Heat"" is this really stomach-churning country-rap. It sounds like Eminem took every terrible quality of a Yelawolf song and tried to condense them down into one song. The hook kind of makes me laugh, maybe not in a way that Eminem intended, but that's, uh, I guess that's an upside. And there are numerous contenders on this thing for the worst bar: ""Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the backburner / You got buns, 𝐼 𝒢𝒪𝒯 𝒜𝒮𝒫𝐸𝑅𝒢𝐸𝑅𝒮."" ""I just bodied the beat, so that whole must have been dug / cuz it just died like food coloring, duh!"" ""So let's get turnt like a shish kebab / Twist it, ma, like an air conditioning knob."" *KOFF* On the song ""Offended,"" I am offended, but maybe not in the way that Eminem intended me to be offended. Because there's nothing really all that edgy about the song, you know? It's just kind of childish, that's all. And there are actually some decent bars on this thing. I like that line about ""[not being able to] catch a body if somebody fainted,"" or that other line saying that his competition can't see him because he doesn't own a mirror(!) which, I think, inadvertently, is kinda a statement about Eminem digging himself so far down into a hole of mediocrity that he's literally lost all touch with the outside world and and he's the only person who he-who he can talk to. No really, I mean, with this track, I'm just kind of offended that I wasn't offended that much. The most annoying thing about the cut is, uh, the moment where Eminem breaks it down into, like, a playground rhyme, where he says everybody is gonna eat his turds. For the most part, this is just zany, off-the-wall Eminem, y'know? You have lines about Bill Cosby, uh, facializing an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal There are moments in the song I think are kind of funny,  and pretty entertaining, but it does not make up for every awful track I've had to sit through thus far! The song ""Need Me,"" featuring P!nk, is-is really like a P!nk song featuring Eminem. She takes up a bulk of the track, which, maybe, is a saving grace if you like P!nk and you don't want to hear so much Eminem anymore on this album. The song ""In Your Head"" completely ruins a wonderful Cranberries song. It's one of my favorite Cranberries songs. It's one of the best songs of the 90s. [In Your Head] totally wrecks it.
What is with this album and the lazy sampling?
(Spoiler alert: Rick Rubin.) Most of the time it just sounds like when there is a sample on the album, Eminem is just rapping over a badly mixed and muddy cut of the song itself, and Just leaving it like that with some extra drums pumped in just to give it some punch. I mean, for the majority of the song ""Arose,"" Eminem is just rapping over, like, this very faint sound of somebody singing, uh, the LeAnn Rimes song ""Some Say Love."" Maybe it's a sample of the original track. I couldn't quite tell. It was super quiet, and something about the the sound of the vocal sounded a little off and weird. The song ""Castle"" is one of the few tracks on the record I legitimately enjoy. The female singer on the track is quite nice.
Her vocal melody is very eerie and alluring. The instrumental is decent too. Eminem is rapping, from a very heartfelt place, about his daughter about to be born. There's this really strong sense of emotion and nostalgia and time passing on this cut. There are moments where the storytelling and the narrative power of the track, like, almost approaches, like, ""Stan""-levels of amazing. There's a moment where the tone of the track almost starts to take that of a letter. Eminem takes some pills, and then it's like he's dead, essentially. Which brings us into the next track, the final track, ""Arose,"" Where Eminem pulls off a pretty heart-wrenching performance where it seems like he scares himself into having to say all these things to his family and his loved ones that he wishes he would be able to if he did, in fact, die. It's a pretty moving moment, although he does occasionally sabotage it with some very corny puns. Eminem is on his deathbed on this track, and he's still writing bars like there's a bunch of dudes in the emergency room going ""Oh. Oh. Woah. Aah."" So, there's a point in the track when he sort of rewinds, and sort of goes back in time to where he doesn't take those pills, doesn't put himself on his deathbed, the beat of the previous track reintroduces itself, and he ends the album flushing the pills down the toilet. Which is actually kind of fitting for this album: to end with the sound of a toilet flushing. Yeah, this, this thing is awful. Light 2. Tran- sition! Have you given this album a listen? Did you love it? Did you hate it? Did you love it, or did you hate it? What would you rate it? You're the best, you're the best.

band in the studio over here but you have these little blurbs written by other artists for the band for the book even de Amanda galas is featured on here saying your band sucks your voice sucks and you have small Jamie Stewart of Shu Shu is quoted in this book as well like a lot of people just talking about what makes Oxbow special and and this is a photo of Eugene actually taking a piss in the subway with the rest of the band just like oh boy there goes Eugene peeing on the subway platform again that that's that's just Eugene so this first piece of vinyl you guys may already be familiar with because I recently gave it a review if you have not watched my review of this thing please go back and do this is the record highly rare from mkhaya McRaven this is an interesting little jazz record he is a jazz drummer and essentially pulled together a bunch of live recordings of him and his friends chop them up into beats so it's this cool kind of like jazz beat music crossover that's kind of grimy kind of lo-fi not a whole lot to say about the packaging here you know but it is a very nice sounding piece of vinyl very nice record not a whole lot of material on it you know it's it's almost like an EP of sorts in a way but the material that's on here is really killer just straightforward black vinyl nice little interesting design on the sleeve there definitely give this thing a listen if you haven't I do like that little fun jacket sleeve there which does contain like a nice little fun explainer as to what the record is all about and there you go some of these are actually so new I haven't even opened them up yet I'm just gonna pop this one open with you guys this is actually a copy of the new Armand Hammer album I hit up Billy woods on PayPal bought a new CD copy of his known unknowns album because toward the end of the year I do tend to go back and whatever records I have not purchased yet that are some of my favorites of the year I pick them up I buy a copy support the artists and just sort of get a get a physical copy of Nam that I really like and he sent me a vinyl copy of the new Armand amour album which I mean it was a little underwhelming to me in a way but still I do think it is a kind of a special record and I do like the grimy aesthetic and vibe to it and I did like the last Armand Hammer record quite a bit so it is nice to be able to kind of continue the collection ooh I didn't know you did color it on this Billy have a nice kind of brownish vinyl here like a like a like a chocolatey a milk-chocolate vinyl record here that's quite nice

all time one of my favorite movies nice beautiful ah beautiful gatefold oh the gatefold is making me have a SATCOM baby sorry if that was inappropriate oh this is a nice little beautiful little lighter note package over you're explaining the whole thing cool ah wonderful wonderful oh nice nice sleeves thank you so much yeah hey Jeremy what a beautiful gift it's nice to have friends who know things and are nice alright guys you know what it is this thing also came with like a card and a decal I haven't even pop this open either I'm sorry guys they're just so many of these haven't popped but I've heard this record so many times already I've listened to the vinyl itself but it was most likely recorded digitally so I can't imagine the vinyl is gonna sound too much different from the actual digital version oh nice album photos go here album photos go here an amazing photographer and I took some sick photos for this album that were supposed to go here but her agents or what the fuck ever said that it couldn't happen so I relied on cell phone pics love you next time okay well I guess album photos were supposed to go there and they did not go there so it just that just is what it is I suppose Oh beautiful clear beautiful orange oh it's so big nice it's is very nice oh very cool you have a nice little lyric sheet over here with the different sections with each song sort of featuring some images and different colors and different lyrics obviously the whole back of the poster is sort of like the print of the J card for the cassette version that's that's funny that's creative very happy with this this packaging is really good even the you know sort of the what ended up happening here is kind of funny kind of silly so definitely in lead with Tyler sense of humor one more that I have not popped open the rest of them I have is this raincoats copy this is actually one of my favorite little post-punk albums I didn't anticipate the packaging was gonna be that illustrious I just kind of wanted it on vinyl because I mean I figured this this record this album I mean it was recorded during an era where it's gonna sound best and sound most appropriate on this format and it is a nice fun little noisy female post-punk record with a lot of personality to it some nice fun little pictures of the band some looks like some lyric sheets and everything really good band ah oh I didn't even know this my heart be still it's like a beautiful cherry red Wow I know that I know it's gonna be a beautiful cherry red wonderful things are just coming up melon got a nice red raincoats vinyl I didn't even know it's gonna be red if you guys have no idea who the raincoats are I highly recommend their track Fairy Tail in the supermarket or the wonderful cover they have done of the song Lola by the kinks one two three Ramones I mean you can't really go wrong with this Ramones record so many other best songs are on here blitzkrieg bop beat on the bear being on the brat Judy is a punk today your love tomorrow the world fucking love that song 53rd and 3rd this is this is a slightly used copy of the album nothing really to report about it all that much other than that some of the greatest and most classic and amazing punk music of all time is located on this thing what the heck what the heck is going on over here the fucking label is printed off fucking center of the record what am I gonna I'm gonna have to take the shit back what's what's what is there a way you can peel this shit it is literally over the last song on the record it's not like that on the b-side besides totally fine besides good each side is completely far all right well I know I popped this open and I've already listened to it and it's fantastic this is the debut album from Betty Davis a funk and soul singer who used to be married to Miles Davis and a lot of ways was a muse to the guy introduced him to a lot of psychedelic rock and funk music that greatly influenced a lot of the experimental and jazz fusion stuff that you would do later on in his career she was married him for a very short time came out with these records afterwards and this debut album of hers is an amazing contribution to the funk sound incredible record finally please actually sent this over to me really happy with it lyric sheet over here very nice like glossy classy black finish on this thing and the record itself is absolutely gorgeous it is this kind of silvery grayish blueish finish and it's it's not just a grey it's it's literally if you see it in person it might not show up on camera it's kind of shiny there's like a silvery shiny quality to the wax on this thing and the music itself is amazing one of my favorite funk records I'm so happy to have it on vinyl I'm so happy to have it on such a special package over here if you give a listen to this thing the grooves are amazing like every groove on this record pretty much every groove on this record sounds like the roughest wildest longest night of sweaty sex you've ever had in your entire life that's what it sounds like that's what every groove on this record sounds like and of course Betty Davis is just like high-pitched raspy wailing voice like only enhances that quality and her incredibly sexual very very rough lyrics and there's also a very nice little insert in this thing sort of detailing Betty's come up her background her connections with miles it's actually a very nice amazing funk album amazing funk record got to give a shout-out to sleep picked up this 12-inch copy of the clarity released or re-released on Southern Lord Records a little while ago picked up a nice orange copy for myself features a cool little itching of an astronaut on the album which I'm not exactly sure rather the 12-inch I'm not sure if you guys can kind of see that you kind of can you could kind of see it one side has the etching one side has the clarity on it which if you're into stoner rock and stone or metal it's pretty good you know not quite as epic as some of sleeps more notable material like holy mountain but still very good couple more in the pile left Prince controversy 1981 album actually came out shortly before a Purple Reign and all that not quite as iconic with all of those grand large poppy ballads all over some of his following records but I still feel like this album is a little underrated and very good I like the groovy synthetic danceable vibe of a lot of these tracks kind of reminds me of like you know what artists like LCD Soundsystem would be copying decades and decades and decades later so the grooves on this record actually really great incredible and actually one of prince's most political tracks lands on this album ronnie talked to russia I believe it's called yeah so it's not often you hear Prince getting like kind of political on a track and finally it's just pretty much a straightforward black vinyl packaged 180 gram but also just got to show you guys over here this this this is uh this is this is a quote me on this this is my summer bod right here 2018 Anthony Fantana this is my summer bod give it a shout out here to primal scream I always forget how to pronounce this album Screamadelica I I guess it's easy i I keep thinking it's like scream Adelia but it's it's string is Screamadelica this is one of these albums from the 90s that kind of exemplifies just how much of a musical melting pot the 90s were I feel like there's so much going on stylistically it should not under any circumstance work not only because it should come together like a mess an entire album but how many bands are there out there that can combine such wonderful elements of dance music and rock music and like soul and gospel music and there's just so much diversity on this thing so many amazing tracks one of my favorites has to be don't fight it feel it amazing grooves on that track and you know nothing too special about the packaging we have a nice little insert over here nice picture of the band track listing and heavy heavy heavy black 180 gram vinyl over here not a gatefold or anything like that but amazing sounding album the production sounds so good there's so many amazing fusions of sounds on this thing that it's it still blows my mind to this day that there's so much versatility on that record and what primal scream made on that album was was so special that not only could a lot of their contemporaries not recreated but even they couldn't recreate it to an extent with their following records and finally this one I got because I'm a bit of a bit of a Devo nerd this is like an amazing huge lengthy and involved compilation of like demo material from Devo I haven't even made it through all of it yet and it is for LPS for LPS on like a weird mini CD which I don't know how I'm gonna play this thing this is like what if I put this into a regular if I put this into a regular CD player like either in my Mac or in my car is is this gonna get lost will I never see this again most likely so not exactly sure when or if I'm gonna play this but there are four LPS on this thing including a fun little poster that I have not opened up yet yeah I feel like you have to be kind of deep into Devo folklore to sort of know and appreciate what they were coming from where they were coming from on that a lot of people who enjoy Devo or know DeVos music don't quite know or understand the backstory or sort of the concept of the band why they dress the way they did why the music sounded the way it did but it's it's definitely an interesting read if you get a chance to and from what I've heard so far of this compilation and again four whole LPS of it here's a nice orange e reddish sort of yellow a little splatter e but some of this early demo material and I've heard a bulk of Devo studio stuff and I enjoy a lot of it but a lot of this early demo material sounds really whacked way left-field some of it is much weird than a lot of what ended up making it onto their studio records and some of it sounds like I'm listening to an entirely different band such a talented group such talented musicians in the group it's amazing to kind of hear them in the raw like this to sort of hear this completely unfettered creativity sort of guide them into these like really weird caverns if you're a hardcore Devo fan and you've ever wanted to hear the band in a different light like I haven't even heard this whole thing yet and I can already highly recommend this and honestly for demos like a lot of the material on this thing it doesn't sound too bad it's not too distorted it's not too low Phi it's not too rough the sound is is quite nice which sounds rough some of the time is a little bit of the mixing and performances and the way the instrumentation is assembled but really the sound itself is pretty good everything comes through pretty clearly so again hardcore Devo fans take notice a Devo REE combo DN a nice fun little compilation containing a lot of early stuff that hopefully I get a chance to listen to that all the way through because there's a lot of interesting material that I've heard thus far and guys that's gonna do it for this vinyl update hopefully you got turned on to some cool stuff in this episode hopefully you get the chance to listen some stuff that you haven't heard before or that you saw some interesting things that might make you want to pick up a vinyl package that you hadn't previously considered picking up and I love you okay have a good one transition over here next to my head is

-5qQvKlPYjo,hi everyone bump can can hear the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Chris Stapleton Tintin from a room volume 2 this is the second of two album released this year by singer and songwriter and former singer and guitarist for these steel drivers mr. Chris Stapleton now I'm familiar with Chris's last album as well as the album he dropped earlier this year and personally I've been having a hard time appreciating him as much as I think I should this feeling mostly being generated by the unbelievable hype for Chris and his music with him being pushed not just as a talented musician but as a breath of fresh air in the country music genre like just because he's not indulging in the same wash rinse repeat cycle that many mainstream country artists are that he's like God's gift to Nashville and for sure credit where it's due Chris does have some good songwriting chops his voice has a very nice range but up until this point he had really failed to drop any music that for me would make him an artist that would leave a lasting impression on the country genre he did get a Grammy nod though and he is getting praise from the mainstream to the underground of the country scene and he is writing above the very low bar set by the CMT set so maybe that's enough it's far from just run-of-the-mill modern country a lot like many of Chris's more interesting contemporaries like Kacey Musgraves and Jason Isbell or Sturgill Simpson he's not simply a country purist he fuses the genre with other styles in his case soul blues and rock music not a revolutionary combination but certainly enough to leave these nine tracks feeling pretty diverse pretty versatile like the hard grooving guitar chords on the song hard living which contrasts very nicely to the rustic folk ballad Rhian scarecrow in the garden occasionally the instrumentals on this thing run a little generic a little bland for example the song drunkards prayer checks about every box one would need to to make a stereotypical country song it's almost like Chris is just working from a template on this thing with the twangy acoustic guitar chords and drawling lead vocals I mean the one saving grace about the track is it's confessional lyrics and even those are loaded with their own cliches and occasionally on this thing Christmas songwriting does tend toward being overly sentimental like on millionaire and friendship but you know when he's on point on this thing he's on point like the roaring midnight train Memphis which is very good a fiery country rock tune about being put in jail for 40 days because he can't pay a fine he talks about being surrounded by shotguns and barbed wire hearing a train in the distance moving along free while he's cooped up in here obviously this trope reminds me of Johnny Cash talking about the train rolling as he is stuck in Folsom Prison then there's also the very funny trying to untangle my mind where Chris is talking about distressing handling his mental problems through just getting high trying to relax it's this introspective soulful but also kind of lowdown track I get the sense in the lyrics that Chris is in need of some kind of personal change and yet he doesn't know how to muster up the strength to actually change him or the world around him there are some great background vocals on this thing and overall the song sounds like a great country rock tune you could hear roaring out of the front door of some dusty southwestern bar simple song is one of the more underwhelming cuts here but it does have some compelling lyrics dealing in life and mortality some of the mentions of like having high cholesterol and stuff kind of remind me of some of the lyrics from Sun Kil moons Benji but with like a country veneer on it and I cannot end this review without mentioning nobody's lonely tonight which is pretty much a vocal stunner Chris is often touted for his vocal abilities and if those shine on any track here it's this one I love the dreary descending guitar chord progression on this thing the three-four timing it's all a very good subtle pretty little foundation for when Chris just kind of wails out and reaches into his upper register his vocal performance is just great there's also a spot lake guitar solo that's quite nice I wouldn't say I'm a Christian convert but I'm definitely starting to see the hype on this thing this thing doesn't quite have the roots Ygritte or bite that I usually enjoy my country music to have at least not in spades anyway but the production performances and songwriting are most certainly here hardcore fans of his work are most likely already familiar with this album but for anybody who has been Chris Stapleton sceptical up until this point I recommend you try this thing out I'm feeling a light too decent 7 Tran [Music] 
sL0YnMbzmow,hi everyone x 30 site tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Brock Hampton album saturation 3 West Coast rap outfit merillia boy band Brock Hampton they're back the whole gang is back Calvin amen Marlin the guy Mathew Timbaland no really these guys have a lot of members just just just look just look just look just look at the personnel this is the third record they've released this year this is the final installment in what essentially they have dubbed the saturation series the group essentially tried to saturate the scene with so much music that they would be nearly impossible to ignore whose successful experiment I'd say because they delivered fans approximately 50 tracks over two hours of material they really blew my mind on the first installment saturation one with one banger after another with just as much color in the production as there was coming out of the members each with their own individual little voice and personality and lyrical style of course there were some very obvious influences coming through on saturation 1 and saturation to Kanye West's nerd clips as well boy bands and mainstream pop of course odd future Wolf Gang kill them all a little Mac Miller as well all of these influences really kind of worn on the group's sleeve however their great execution and their good song writing quality to me always overshadowed any obvious influence coming out of their Tunes and honestly I've just been in awe of the group's consistency thus far especially considering how much material they've been dropping in such a short amount of time now one major complaint I had with saturation 2 is that it kind of just sounded like more of the same I mean I do love saturation 1 so I guess that's not a huge problem and I think saturation 2 has grown on me a bit since my original review because it kind of makes up for its lack of surprises and experimentation with some very bold hooks and a very tight tracklist going into saturation 3 though I still hoped that Brock Hampton would kind of find a way to pull out all the stops and it definitely seemed like that was going to be the case with the teaser track to this thing Boogie goddamn this track was their most insane single by far by far the police sirens the buzzing bassline the squawking horns Laden into this thing the dance beat the dense vocal overdubs there's a lot going on here like it's it's really a lot to take in and on top of that you have each member trading these really aggressive amped energy filled mini verses Joba especially standing out more than he usually does with one of his yell piest appearances on any Brockhampton release ever I wouldn't say there's a whole ton of lyrical substance to this track but it certainly makes up for it with its intense and immense amount of kinetic energy so was my mouth watering after I heard this track yeah yes it definitely was even though in the back of my head I was kind of afraid that this would end up being just more of the same the sequel and it does feel like that in pockets of course on this thing you have a forlorn one-minute track thrown into the mix a few spoken word passages of course performed by Roberto not to mention you're gonna hear something on this album I would like to call the Brockhampton flow especially from Amir on numerous tracks [Music] so yeah that does that does come up a lot keep in mind though Amir is not the only person in Brock Hampton who has used or uses this flow so and there are a few other moments on this thing I kind of saw coming from a mile away like the closing track team which is yet another shimmering reverb heavy guitar ballad to close the album out featuring bare face on lead vocals which to me as an ending is nowhere near as satisfying as previous endings to saturation 1 & 2 waste and summer but the huge and shoegazing rush of guitar chords in the second leg of this first portion of the song are kind of a nice payoff kind of orgasmic and points for the beats which up in the middle of the track which leads to an unexpected set of rap verses also that one line at this moment in the track talking about how you thought your world was progressive because you had a black president that hit hard and stains in my opinion it's kind of one of the group's most average tracks it's it's a very by-the-numbers moment for Brock Hampton in my opinion there's nothing really all that sticky about it from Matt and Aamir's very glazed-over flows to the somewhat sleepy beat which relies heavily on these kind of low-budget synth horns that kind of have a Tyler the Creator quality to him I do like the vocal harmonies and the beats which up toward the end of the song though and that's another thing there are more beats which ups on this project then I had anticipated certainly more than there's been on saturation 1 & 2 which is good that was actually something I hope Brock Hampton would experiment with a little bit more it also happens on the last moments of Alaska the last moments of bleach on the song sister nation which is easily one of the weirdest songs Brock Hampton has ever recorded period the first portion of the tracks sister features these punky driving beats very jagged angular bass lines some weird psychedelic shots of horns pitch vocals as well it sounds like I don't know some kind of wacko land version of Death Grips I love Matt champions fiery flow on this tracks of the screaming sputtering synthesizers also a really unsettling intro verse about coming off of mood stabilizers and becoming violent and tagged at the end of this track is like a weird space rap dream sequence I wish it wasn't so washed out and reverb but some of the heavenly background vocals are actually very nice now hottie is kind of a weird moment for the group easily one of their Poppaea Strax yet to the point where it doesn't really feel that much like a rap song at all especially with pretty much every verse on this thing emphasizing melody more than actual flow or lyricism the song rental is one of the catchiest and sweetest songs on the album - with a pretty cool combination of sounds that feel like they're coming from like 80's electro funk 90s R&B and contemporary rap and as long as i mentioning sweeter spots on the album I have to mention bleach which features these hauntingly beautiful odd like mutant angel vocal harmonies some very sad and vulnerable rap verses it's just one of those many introspective moments the group pulls off so well especially with do you make mistakes or do you make a change the feel to mention a few bangers the song zipper goes into supremely odd in unexpected direction with its schmaltzy horn and piano samples it's very uppity dance beat and zany singing it sounds a lot like I don't know Marshall Mathers LP era Slim Shady like it's on some real Slim Shady shit with like a dash of Outkast it was kind of a turn-off like a weird combination of sounds and flavors at first but as I listened to it more and more I just kind of grew to love it oh yeah and Merlyn says my fucking name on this track which I'm pretty sure is like an invite to join I'm gonna I'm gonna join Brock Hampton Oh for real can I join too no no no I'm the one with the mixtape I got the mixtape you never did a mixtape I don't care the song Johnny features some neat jittery beats and some smooth jazzy samples our guitar chords as well with each member of the group trading verses over this thing that to me I'm getting a lot of themes of growing up having a hard time adjusting to the world neurotic feelings anxiety having a hard time living up to the maturity level expected of you and again there's kind of a wild little hook on this track that to me reads as more outcasts influence and the last major banger that I have to mention on this thing is stupid which is groovy hypnotic features these very plinky synth chords like these wailing synth leads that to me read as more g-funk influence which I caught pretty prominently on their last saturation project a heavy bass line and this mantra hook that just sticks in my head boys wanna play with myself I know I know buddy see what's in it overall I really like this project as far as the quality of these tracks goes it's just as high as nearly every piece of the saturation series thus far productions their hooks are their verses are their vocal performances are their there are a few predictable moments here and there on this thing for sure mostly because I think Brock Hampton has consciously tried to stick to a formula and a style for the saturation series however they changed it up pretty adequately for this last installment especially from an instrumental and a musical style standpoint because in a lot of ways saturation 3 is the papas but also most unorthodox installment in the trilogy but I do wish things changed up a little bit more lyrically though I'm catching a lot of the same themes that I already have on saturation 1 & 2 especially in regards to sexuality feeling like an outcast in society dealing with emotional problems is just this general sense of millennial angst still though this was a pretty great ending to this 3 album series and will remain to me is one of the most iconic moments in rap for this decade where you had this group who just blew up and just made this amazing run of Records in a very short span of time it was also really nice to hear some members who have previously been a bit more obscured on previous saturations a bit more prominently on this one and at this point I think it's pretty safe to say that Brock Hampton is not going anywhere anytime soon they've really established themselves as a figure in the hip-hop scene right now and this record really assured me that their creativity and versatility it's real and it's certainly going to carry them on to whatever the next metamorphosis or chapter is in their career once they drop their next record and all I can say right now is that I'm looking forward to that I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it your the best year the best swish should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave the thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful over here next time I head is another Brock Hampton review and I'll see you guys then this one Anthony Fantana Brockhampton saturation free forever

h_k1muvplJU,hi everyone company struct tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Big Sean and Metro boomin project double or nothing Double or Nothing is a new album from one of Atlanta's star producers right now Metro boomin and Detroit's own Big Sean which is a part of a string of successful collaborations linked to Metro boomin where he teams up with 21 Savage on savage mode savage and offset from me goes on without warning and now we have Big Sean big shot is a bit of a surprise Metro boomin typically works very closely with a lot of the rappers and artists that are in his scene however that has not stopped him from working with the Detroit native here and coming together with 10 pretty tight tracks which feature some of Metro boomin 's best production a day I love the dark beautiful swirling chord progressions and the haunting woodwind samples on the track go legend which matched very perfectly with Travis Scott's husky crooning vocals we also have these sharp little fluttering acoustic guitar samples all over the track who's stopping me the glistening dreamy looped keyboard notes on no heart no love and of course I get a lot of tracks with very basic straightforward track percussion and very moody piano phrases and synth leads this is this is pretty much a vibe and a sound that metro pulls on very heavily on this thing on pull up and wreak on savage time on in tune I would say the one beat that just felt so bland to me are kind of letting me down was the song so good the the the production felt super skeletal on this one felt like a very average take on this very groovy Bay Area sound it's it's a bit of a DJ mustard style track the overall sound on this thing is very dry it's very flat just felt very unimpressive to me but again the production on this thing generally it's very solid it's very consistent pretty straightforward trap style with lots of melodic nuances weaved in if I do have a problem with this project it's it's it's really with Big Sean I guess aside from the sway lis feature in the second half of Reason which makes him sound like a horny teenage boy trapped at the bottom of a well [Music] my opinion on Big Sean in the past has been no secret I think he's one of hip-hop's least essential characters his last album I decided was easily his best record but his best album is like is like a decent Drake album still to this day I just kind of see Big Sean not as a unique personality or creative mind in the hip-hop landscape but more like an amalgamation of whatever his contemporaries are whatever's trendy whatever is doing well on the charts no question Big Sean can rap he has good fundamentals and the singing on this record that he delivers is pretty listenable he even gives some clever wordplay on this thing here and there but a lot of my issues with Big Sean on this thing come down to delivery and tone because every once in a while he just drops these bars that just make me raise my eyebrow like did did he really think that sounded cool and some of them I think could be delivered well maybe by a rapper that had a zany air personality or just like I don't know a more tongue-in-cheek demeanor like knowingly winking and nodding to the audience that hey you sort of know these lyrics sound a little silly too and it's all just didn't good fun but Big Sean sounds like he legitimately thinks lyrics about pinning your girl up against the wall like she's art or you're not fly you're an ostrich are supposed to like oh oh whoa fire fire emojis like on the song who's stopping me where he's rapping about the some girl who was eating out pussy tasting like Sara also the line about my girl being the only one on top of me and this constant fantasy that he sort of throws out there that he's the greatest he's the best nobody sunning him I know it's supposed to be in the nature of a rapper to brag but it feels almost like when Big Sean does it comes from a place of insecurity that he's out there in the rap game he's doing well he's on the charts but he's not quite the top dog like just the visual of Big Sean looking at himself in the mirror saying himself who's stopping me who's stopping me who's gonna stop somebody who's not a threat like no that's that's if nobody's stopping you that's really that's why and then we had the song so good which is essentially a sex song which I'm not against a sex song but Big Sean is neither sexy nor is he that clever like the bar on here about not fucking his girl in the ass because her pussy is is just that good that we're talking about how it barely fits like Oh Jesu of you must acquit if anything makes this track it's the cash doll feature it's it's certainly not Big Sean it's certainly not the instrumental and then there's a big helping of emotional cringe on the song savage time or Big Sean he sounds like he's on the verge of tears he's talking about he's gonna grab the water from Flint and bring it to DC he's gonna make the president drink it I just think the delivery and the execution of this leaves a lot to be desired like these are obviously issues and problems that need to be addressed but Big Sean is approaching them in a way where he sort of paints himself as the hero later in the same track you have Big Sean rapping about doing it like his life is on the line talking about how stressful all this stuff is and he needs to get his crystals and his incense so he can just distress and that's the thing it's it's not that these issues shouldn't be brought up it's that Big Sean brings them up in a really self-serving way it's not about the problem it's not about the people who it's hurting it's about how much it's stressing you out and you need to grab some fuckin crystals Oh God like there are some bright moments here where Big Sean is rapping about how a lot of people are in need of help from God and in need of a blessing and as a result they're lined up around the corner at the church but for the most part this track was more of a miss than a hit I do kind of like the lyrical concept of the track even the odds I kind of like the driving kick drum on that track it's very tense it builds up as the song plods along that kind of puts me on the edge of my seat makes me feel like there's gonna be an epic finish to this track Big Sean lyrically is saying this aina this is that which is kind of fun it's cool it's an interesting lyrical angle for the track to take but it's pretty shallow and gets very old very quick not to mention young thug's verse on this thing has a pretty questionable Bill Cosby reference uh and for whatever reason Big Sean just like pulls off these really funny vocals and the last leg of the track that don't quite [Music] it's like he's found a weird middle ground between whiny and mumbly that I I don't quite care for and this isn't even the only time where I think the vocals on the album sound ridiculous what is that Flo it's it's barely on beat when he busts into it it's it's you know in the last moments of this album Big Sean sort of pulls out these really monotone flows which get kind of underwhelming very disappointing especially on the song in tune even though I'm not really a big sean fan I sort of hoped that he would come through on this given that he's working with Metro boomin and it's gonna bring a lot of attention it's gonna kind of cause him to maybe work at a bit of a higher level or just bring more ambition to the table and there are some good things about this project the beats are very good I think the features make a lot of these tracks but unfortunately Big Sean is playing too large of a role on this album to ignore and he continues to be very average very middle-of-the-road very predictable and very mediocre for me at the end of the day this thing it's just kind of alright it's it's just alright it's not the worst thing I've heard and it's certainly not the worst thing I've heard Big Sean involved in but it's just kind of okay I'm feeling a strong five too late six on this transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I argue next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling

STeN0JQkatw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for us to continue with last week where I list out some of the most significant musical and cultural moments of the year I'm gonna be talking about the 10 greatest music related memes of yeah that's right we're bringing the standards down a few pegs and we're gonna be talking about the the MEMS we're just going to be talking about music related memes music culture and meme culture they're they're sort of intersectional eyes in the internet age [Music] the game back stronger than ever buffer number seven on this list is go to big Shaq with ting goes jack is is like it's a comedy thing he's it's a joke take comedian did this freestyle it was kind of like a bit of a parody of this current trend going on in the UK with UK UK drill it could be completely wrong on that because I don't really know anything about UK hip hop I'm a mean man I'm just I'm a simple I'm a simple man who likes his memes well this little like mean performance of onomatopoeias caught caught fire it was a super-duper viral thing now it's an official song with a real beat in a real music video as I say well as you can listen to and miraculously this song has become like one of the most popular songs from the UK and it's basically just a novelty song which is like I guess kind of upsetting and disappointing for anybody who really enjoys hip hop music from you but you know it's actually a pretty funny game it's actually decent man it's kind of a Normie mean like everybody can get into ilium it's a very Normie asked me Borat meme you know it's up there with Borat me still made it to number seven out of 36 on our top 10 memes list peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter at number two on my list this one comes from one of my favorite Australian music artists of all time of this year mr. Kurien jcalahan has a great record that came out this year big enough I really enjoyed it but after I reviewed I was kind of upset kind of unhappy that it didn't seem like the album was getting quite the support quite the attention that I think you deserve but then Karen eventually drops us a music video featuring Alex Cameron but it also features one Australian music legend named mr. all that beautiful screen footage this man screamed sort of builds up to one of the most epic points in the song and it's it's a very iconic and a very strange sound this imagery of him thrown in like front of the sky with the mountains and shit is incredible it's like this cowboy man comes out of the skies I'm gonna and it's it's just a little much it's a lot that's a lot to take in and amazingly people have sort of taken this was interesting things that clap into a myriad different situations of compilations and a variety of different movies and television shows so it's it's very creatively spliced and meaned and lightly knitting a neem dank meme and I enjoy that the meme is sort of a sort of pushing Kieran's popularity [Music] yeah number 6 on our list it's one of the most iconic and moving images of this year mr. Travis Scott during a recent live performances of flames blown crazy and the background was on stage with a mic stand just pushing it up and down kind of like in that spongebob episode where the drawn spongebob like has the pencil over us and he's like yeah yeah he's kind of like the the drawn spongebob I don't know what it certainly does not evoke in in me the rage that I think he might have been feeling at the time though I do like you know Travis Scotty is kind of a very rock and roll sort of stage presence Bryce is very energetic you know really kind of lesson all fly out there but no there's just something about what he's doing here with his mouth open with the biker throat state overhead that's slide oh baby kind of you kind of missed the mark on this one though of course it became a good meme and what I love so much about this meme is that you don't really need to doctor it you don't really do anything to it I need you to look at it because is this ridiculous it's just hilarious on its face so big good good me pretty good number four on our list we have Kendrick Lamar with syrup sandwiches now safe to say that Kendrick Lamar with his recent album damn this has been his most meme centric music album cycle that he's ever hectic Lamar in the past in my opinion has always been one of these artists who I think people have taken his music just a little too seriously to be meaning it like crazy however I feel like that change with a piece of Bama Slama teen and I understand why there are a lot of crazy funny hilarious completely out there quotable moments and lyrics and and images coming out of the album coming out of the music videos that he came out with promotion of this album so it's not odd to think that some memes would be coming out of this record a what my favorite memes is no not playing the album in Reverse it's not that that is a pretty good one that's pretty good me but really my favorite meme is this reverence to eating syrup sandwiches on the song humble which of course you know Kendrick talking about has come up younger he used to eat some serum sandwiches you know I mean just just I guess a necessity to have something to eat that the readers going it seems like syrup sandwiches could potentially become the next moms spaghetti for mmm you know hand palms are sweaty mom's spaghetti moms zucchini moths ah mobster gets amazing remix on YouTube which is one of my favorite videos on YouTube this year where somebody essentially takes almost every hurt humble and replaces it with stare sandwiches let's roll that beautiful bean footage and that's it there's not there's not a whole lot to it it's just it's just syrup sandwiches syrup sandwich is syrup sandwiches at number four once again because we have two number fours in this list for some reason we have little pump with Gucci gang not a whole lot to this one little pump has written one of the most repetitive songs of the year I think it's kind of catchy all there is to it he says Gucci gang like a million times in the song and as a result people just kind of repeat Gucci Daigoro gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie gootchie game my favorite rap memes of the year number three is when XXX sent accion took part in the double sure he was just it was too edgy he was just too much he got my guys the rap game Shadow the Hedgehog well during his cypher double XL and XX had decided that he was too good to just wrap on the beat like everybody else he had to sort of you know crouched down enemy villain style let's go hit early you guys are your peasants you're all beneath me Jesus devil I'm gonna I'm gonna hate you so much fires gonna burn Oh mom I don't want to clean my room you want to clean my room mommy they're very edgy little display of hedge was just too much for the Internet to handle so of course it was a series of amazing remixes of this meme air X would just step up to the mic get into his Crouch position and then all of a sudden it would just break into I don't know a variety of different things just like poppy songs happy songs babies crying you know a lot of different shit it was a good it was a good little meme relatively low effort high payoff and that's a good mean I mean that you just put shit ever get to but just it ends up being hilarious where there was like a tree talking about how redbone would sound if you were like in a bathroom or something and then that caused like a million people to the remix remix it okay here's a redbone that sound like it this here's a redbone would sound like if that here's a redbone would sound like if the other thing by myself even got in on the fun but certainly kind of like a freaky kind of prince sort of vibe on here personally I I don't quite get this me I don't really get a lot a lot of the entertainment value but I think people have done some really creative things with it following some amazing remixes and sort of you know vocal edits and stuff like that so it's one of the most popular music news of the year shout out to Childish Gambino keep those memes coming in and the number one but second-to-last meme of the year shout out to my boy DJ academics nervous DJ academics meme has been one of my favorite memes live here I love this meme my boy DJ academics was recently on the red carpet over the BT Awards with his do Joe Budden who he co-hosts everyday struggle with shut up complex their mic there my network I make my network very proud with it with the type of content I make on this channel this is just letting you know it's just an awkward conversation going on with me goes talking about bad bougie and there was a little bit of an ego thing going on because not every member of me goes on Ben bougie let off bad bougie are you or you know I look I look at the song bad and bougie but it sounds like you're not on that bougie it's it's I'm literally looking at the song and it's a it looks like you know I can't I can't hear you what excuse me good sir do I look like I'm left off the bed and the bougie snow button has an issue with this he feels like this is all a little dramatic this is all little you know so much that's one of the things I like about Joe he's very real like whatever he's feeling something you just like BAM even if it's a little like you know out of pocket a little bit in that in that old head mindset or something you just kind of get something just like fuck this fuck this amigos get a little dramatic over that they all stand up like they're in fighting position like they're about to form like fucking Voltron academics is here in the corner just like what's going on why that's really kind of in one of the most perfect reaction images of the year just like DJ academics looking really nervous as shit looks like it is about to go down and I which is why it's one of the greatest music memes the number one music meme of the year but this is sort of a random randomize list so we have a couple more number ten we have the shooting stars meme boop boop oh no likes like videos some stuff about to happen the sudden like it just it just breaks into the end of the song with like it's fun it's creative Katy Perry uses it in a really dumb way though in that music video that was bad you just ruined memes all the time finally at number nine we have our good dude Nick Crompton who is featured in that terrible Jake Paul song which is one of the worst songs of the year every day bro and this track has a very odd funny little verse from Nick Crompton which of course was written by Jake Paul is Jay Paul is admitted in a following video Nick is rapping about you know just just some braggadocious shit you can hear the dude's got a little bit of an English accent coming fruit and you're just talking this talk he's walking his walk gets to this line was saying you know Nick Crompton from Compton and then he says where he's from he said he says England is my city he says England is his city Nick counted from the City of England oi ChIP chip cheerio where are you from my fret night off from the city of England I'm from my favorite city Ward oh you ordered that sounds like quite a foreign city the singing of England I sure would like a visit is open 24 hours a day 865 go to the city the old England so yeah it was just like kind of a cringy awful geographical moment for music this year you know about on par with that line on that new little gaudy album where he says that you know this girl blows him like a cello even though a cello is a boat it's tremendous sort of fucking it's what you blowing - wasn't quite as viral as England is my City pretty much it those those are the means the best memes music-related me in the top ten list I hope this video was terrible and I hope you regret watching it thank word over here so my head is another video that's probably better than this video you can click on that or click on the

E54_Y06Gyk0,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerds gonna go through with a quickie mostly raw review of this new quality control mix tape control the streets volume one quality control is a music label associated with the hip hop trio migos and they have just dropped this massive compilation of tracks which the bulk of them feature migos or members of amigos or a little yachty or other artists associated with the label and its god it's it's 30 freakin tracks it is 30 friggin tracks it's an hour and 40 minutes long given the artists associated with this project you know stylistically what you're in for you're gonna be in for those melodic auto crooning track bangers with some slight variations in okay we have more rap verses more straight rapping on this track it's hard-hitting it's more aggressive the lyrics and more braggadocious and then you sort of slide down the spectrum eventually where you get Spacey or production more singing on the track you're not really gonna hear anything on this project that kind of totally surprises or goes so far left that you're like whoa I didn't even see that coming it's pretty predictable and honestly listening to it as as a whole piece is pretty grueling I have a feeling that most people are not listening to this thing all the way through and most of the people actually do listen to this thing all the way through are likely not going to do it again and rather just go back to whatever tracks were their favorites or I guess if you are listening to this thing over and over and over again repeatedly it can't be with a totally intent ear sitting on the edge of your seat like eventually some of the sounds on this thing especially during the last leg of the project kind of fall into the background this this tape this compilation it starts really strong it does I'll admit that there are a lot of bangers a lot of incredible hard-hitting tracks in the first leg of this thing that I like quite a bit and I think for convenience sake at the end of this I'm just gonna list out what tracks I felt were the best and most entertaining it does kick off really well I was like holy like imagine if this imagine if this whole thing is as good and as consistent as like the first ten twelve tracks it's unfortunate that things just kind of drop off and you start getting these really corny I I wouldn't even call them love songs because they're not really about what but tracks like she for keeps or thick and pretty where you do get some truly awful vocals and and then some kind of cringy hooks and then once the floodgates of mediocrity have kind of opened on this thing you get moments like violation freestyle or on me where it just seems like I don't know it just seems like they're not trying to write or trying to craft songs that are quite as catchy or as hard-hitting or as memorable as the cuts that kick the entire thing off the whole compilation feels very front-loaded at this point it just kind of feels like this is one of those releases that unfortunately has to come to this really terrible trend of stream spamming where it just seems like you have a project it's overloaded with tracks it's overloaded with runtime in the hopes that you just have more material out there it means more streams which means more money at the end of the day but you know I'll come out and say that my favorites on this thing have to be we the ones total banger we took about that one's great ice tray fantastic Joe Budden diss on that track is is is kind of mean it's mean Hellcat stood out to me but really mostly for the very eerie beautiful instrumental on the track same thing with the track South Africa which has this incredible sax sample that place there at much of the song it like really kind of makes the the cut I'm yeah with car DB car DB kind of makes it you know she really breaks up the monotony of all the migos features over and over and over what it do is a mindlessly repetitive track however I did find a sticking in my head and I did find it kind of enjoyable like it's not as repetitive as Versace so I guess you can give it that the song interview total banger the song sides is easily the best autocrine ballot on the entire project and then there is holiday which day like there's a really kind of weird odd groove and angular melody style to the track that I feel like compositionally it's one of the more unique tracks on the entire compilation and it's like such a weird song for a little yachty too this is maybe one of the most experimental moments on the entire project and again speaking merely from the standpoint of the vocal melodies really odd the groove is really odd but somehow it comes together and it just works and yeah you know those are pretty much my favorite tracks on the entire compilation listen not a whole lot of pressure on this thing don't feel the pressure to listen to this thing all the way through if you don't like something just skip it it's just such an inconsistent compilation like just pull out the tracks that you think are the best stick to those and just do that and just enjoy yourself alright guys over here next to my head is another review you can check out I'll see you in the next video Anthony Fantana quality control forever 
sdKg4hREYt8,hey hey hey Anthony Fantana here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for another installment of our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week guys you know it you watch it you expect it you get recommendations out of it let's go of course I have to mention that we have a sponsor in this video the good people over at seek geek if you are aware see geek is a wonderful app that aggregates tickets to live events from all over the web to make ticket buying simple they put a 1 to 100 score on each ticket to let you know if you're getting a good deal or a bad one Green is good red is bad the in app view from seat lets you know where you're going to sit and if you hit up the app you look up a concert you want to go to enter code drop at checkout to get $20 off your first order that is code D ROP information is down there via the link in the description box thank you again to the good people over at sea Greek alright let's start with the weekly track roundup guys no more be Essen you already know down there we got our Amazon Associates link and our turntable lab link if you hit up those links buy yourself some anything holiday season presents for other people presents for yourself we get kicked back from it does not add to your overall price and here are the worst tracks I mean that was a that was that was a fast Schill intro as a fast shell intro we're getting right into it right now the worst tracks you know I typically take my time because I don't want to go into the worst tracks too fast because they are the worst tracks but Jesus Christ here we go new new Rus track lean on you I just do not get where this guy gets the gall to hype himself up because this is just really bland crew knee pop rap with a forgettable instrumental forgettable vocals the guy the guy has barely any vocal chops no personality to his voice the lyrics are bland the instrumental is just wallpaper music like what is so interesting about this why is this so hype what why are people like dying for this it's so uninteresting I I would rather just listen to a fountain just trickle trickle water it's it's it's literally about as interesting as that the fountain is more interesting the fountain is more interesting this this is this is drab this is really drab moving on from there got a shout out one track maybe in my opinion the worst track on this new quality-control compilation there are actually quite a few dope songs on this compilation I will be talking about it very soon in depth but this song Schieffer keeps with Nicki Minaj in quavo is like one of the worst like croon e-wrap love songs that i've heard in a while one of these terrible sort of like autocrine tunes it's very mellow it's very trashy it's a it's it's very uh vomit-inducing it's it's probably the corniest song in the entire tape but hey you know if you listen to this thing and you if you avoid just this track you're you're doing yourself a big favor and you're gonna enjoy the project a lot more I promise you that moving on from their new GE Z song sober it's it's G easy it's it's annoying it's it's not quite as gross as the as this track over here but but it's pretty gross it's pretty boring it's it's pretty average and finally this this new Eminem track over you're untouchable this is a perfect example of what seems like good intentions going into a song but like terrible terrible terrible delivery terrible execution it just seems like Eminem thinks the audience that he wants to relay this message to is really stupid and as a result the song and the very worthwhile message comes off very like insulting and snide and and I get that the topic at hand here is a very important topic and in one that's worth getting mad over but I feel like because of Eminem's tone of the song and because of how just annoying the song and Eminem's flow and delivery are on this track it's just gonna fall on deaf ears but hey what do I know I'm not a hardcore Eminem fan so like this song probably was never going to aesthetically appeal to me in the first place but the it's it's uh it's it's just really hideous it's just a really hideous song to listen to I wish Eminem would just light a fire under his ass like he did on on Marshall Mathers LP - but I just fear that he's never gonna do that again and that record is really just kind of gonna kind of go down as a fluke but that's gonna be it for the worst tracks let's move into the tracks that I thought were kind of myth certainly what's shouting out certainly worth some attention but I wasn't crazy about them personally excuse me your old ruk has a new single out via the Adult Swim singles collection they're due in 52 weeks this year which is pretty crazy I haven't talked about every single one but you know do go to the link down there in the description check them out every week brand new song you the type your old Droog of course this has kind of a hard core very laid-back somewhat jazzy East Coast hip hop 90s flavor to it that's just Droog style but of course with this track like many others he comes through with a really sharp and funny and clever lyrical topic and concept so uh this song is a one of his more fun ones that I've heard in a while so shout out to him for that moving on from there this new track with trippy red featuring Travis Scott Dark Knight demo is it's a pretty decent song you know it's it's one of the more high gloss and heavy that I've heard from trippy Reds so far who you know he's kind of been consistent but I do have faith in him I do have faith that he can come through with like a solid project I do think he has a unique voice and a unique approach to a lot of this autocrine stuff and I do think he holds his own with Travis Scott on this track so it is pretty gargantuan it is very much in that lavish very heavily auto-tuned very Spacey very moody but very heavy Travis Scott instrumental style and I think trippy red takes to that sound pretty well moving on from there mr. Hudson with vic mensa on this track a funny little kind of / rappy song about like listening to Coldplay I can't say I was crazy about it the chemistry wasn't really there for me personally but I thought the concept was interesting you know and it certainly was intriguing to hear vic mensa team up with mr. hudson on the track also interesting to hear vic mensa team up with Kristian scott tonday ad WA on freedom is a word which is actually a pretty nice little piece of a very explorative jazzy rap music of course there are a few points lyrically and emotionally where vic mensa takes it a little too far and it's kind of hard to take totally seriously but it's actually a very nice performance and you know very nice fusion of worlds and some of the trumpet playing on the track is incredible so do not miss out on that and finally I want to mention in this section this new Charli XCX song out of my head which is one of those Charli XCX tracks that unfortunately is just super duper average you know it's not one of her more quirky and off-the-beaten-path and kind of eclectic takes on pop music this is really kind of one of those singles where she's trying to appeal to the largest fan base possible and it's it kind of stinks because it is a very plain song it is a very plain production the vocals aren't really kind of that same sassy bratty very colorful and and in tone and personality that I typically enjoy from Charli XCX scenes a little reserved for her hoping that she takes it a little bolder on her next single though this one isn't it's it's not terrible you know certainly listenable let's move on to the tracks that I thought were awesome this week the tracks that really blew me away tracks that I really kind of was 11 number one my boy ty Segall has a new album coming out soon in 2018 and he has a few tracks out from it so far but this one over here in particular stood out to me everyone's a winner it's got kind of a weird quirky lo-fi glam-rock kind of vibe to it the guitars on it are really funny and playful very tongue-in-cheek it's easily one of his silliest and yet most hard rock in singles I've heard him drop in a while liking that between what I'm hearing here and some of the recent singles he's come out with and his last album which has been one of my favorites of his in years that tie is getting a little bit more fringe and odd and and silly with his music you know it seems like there's a real sense of humor there but the experimentation and you know some of the songwriting that he's pulling off is is very seriously good so really enjoying that tie is having a at least what seems to me a little bit more fun with his music as of late next's got to give a shout-out to tune-yards abc123 which is now my favorite single from this current album cycle kind of brings back that same quirky funky danceable sound though it doesn't come off quite as international as it has in the past the vocals aren't quite as yell P either but you do have some strong political themes coming through into lyrics so I'm actually pretty pleased about that it's sketchy song is song it's a sharp song it's a thoughtful song so looking forward is sort of seeing what sounds like tune-yards going in a slightly more mature direction this time around and just kind of finding out what the result of that is on this forthcoming album next Sufjan Stevens drops a song about Tonya Harding out of the blue at around the same time that you had this huge press push for this forthcoming movie about Tonya Harding which is kind of like a dark comedy and I'm in in soufiane spiel about the song he didn't mention anything about the movie I'm sort of wondering if he wrote this inspired by the movie if he wrote this is there some kind of connection between him and the movie is gonna be on the soundtrack or something or like well like did he did he just put out this song because he had it laying around or something and it was around the time that the movie was gonna be released so maybe it would have created him across traffic I don't really know what his reasoning for writing or releasing the song was all I know is that I like it it reminds me of you know some of his Illinois's era stuff or Illinois era stuff where you know you have him writing these very beautiful intimate little songs about certain figures in history or places that are very compelling and especially this version of the track because there are two versions linked on Bandcamp this version is in e-flat major and it's just pretty much Sufi at piano the other version in D major is a very washed out very Spacey very dreamy it's very heavy not quite as intimate in my opinion though still a nice song but I do like the the more intimate piano based version the more acoustic version better a very beautiful tune next sophie has dropped a new track she is killing it with this new material like 2018 it's Sophie's earr like this track it's such a banger and it's crazy it's like sophie has always been one of the most insane producers and sound curators on PC music and this song just like confirms this is this is one of the most insane things that I've heard on the label and it seems like they just get crazier every year this is one of the most insane things if not the most insane thing I've heard on the label and I just listened to that new girlfriend of the year or GTA GF oty album which in a quickie review that I did I said that that was easily one of the most eclectic insane things that I've heard on the label if not the most and now this just totally blew that out of the water like it's such a dirty filthy sexy hedonistic but experimental and loud and blaring and just like gut-punching track the beat is amazing the noise is incredible the lyrics are like really dark and disturbing and and odd if you're a bit of a fetishist you know someone who likes to be dominated probably get quite a bit out of it I'm just gonna leave it at that love the track and I'm just so frigging hype a Nicolas Jar my dude Nicolas jar dropped a couple of new tracks the one that stood out to me the most is wild flowers kinda reminds me a bit of his dark side project that he had not too long ago the vocals are quite nice the instrumentals quite nice of course you know he's dropping very Spacey strange electronic music not quite the micro house that he rode in on when he broke through in the scene not too long ago but uh but still very uh very subtle very beautiful very intriguing and hopefully he drops a new album soon because new Nicolas jar album would be quite nice quite nice and finally got to give a shout out to JPEG mafia who has a new track out titled baby I'm bleeding and while in the past I felt that this guy's approach to industrial hiphop was maybe a little run-of-the-mill a little forgettable this is easily one of the best singles that I've heard out of this project thus far really hard-hitting be great flow good energy some interesting lyrics as well very political and edgy and revolutionary which has been sort of part of the course for the project thus far but still it seems like the production value in the delivery has kind of been up to notch and I'm really liking that so that is everything that I wanted to recommend to you guys remember it's all down there in the description box all of it is down there in the description box all these tracks all of these songs check them out giving some time and also our Amazon and turntable lab links and again shadow to the good people over at see geek for supporting this segment all right guys you're the best I'm almost over my my congestion thing I swear all right I love you love you love you forever forever 
7KQyTYscOpk,ah oh yeah hi everyone greet in lines you know here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new princess nokia album 1992 deluxe rapper underground fashion icon New York native Princess Nokia she has been making waves for a little while now the biggest of which was last year's EP 1992 a digital release that kind of went under my radar last year but now Rough Trade records has picked this EP up and together with Princess Nokia they have expanded this thing into a 16 track monster that 16 tracks without a single sketch or interlude nokia is a bit of an enigma in the hip-hop landscape right now she has a pretty strong buzz but somehow she's still sitting on the fringe of rap and she's a true oddball that represents the melting pot of New York City not just racially but also culturally and contextually and all of this reflects in her music in a really big way for one the instrumentals on this thing bring a mix of very Spacey dark moody cloud rap hard-hitting trap bangers as well as some kind of soulful nostalgic 90s throwbacks she also raps in a number of vocal registers on this thing sometimes she has a very deep husky delivery that she usually hits with much slower flows reads like she's bringing like a lot of gangsta boo or little Kim influenced here maybe even a dash of Tupac on the song saggy denim her voice also reaches like a weirdly pitchy Tambor on the song goat too that's still enjoyable it's just really kind of odd very unique and of course on a lot of the songs on this thing that there's there's like a distinct New York accent coming through on a lot of her rapping and of course there are tracks on this thing where she's rapping in this much higher pitch just very bratty girlish delivery it sounds much younger but it's way more aggressive like on the song brew house or tomboy or especially katana katana katana katana she's a bit of a vocal chameleon on this thing I mean there are even moments were her inflections on the song Greenline read a lot like that of fellow New Yorker wiki's when he raps who is featured on the track just before this one on this very project Nokia constantly changing it up from track to track to track doesn't necessarily take away from the consistency or enjoyability of 1992 though because her eclectic personality always pours through in a track via her versus her song topics her reference points on 1992 Nokia is pulling on everything from weed to goth culture to anime to MySpace to videogames drugs fashion and in the wealth of cultural tidbits that one could bring up living in New York City the project is kind of emotionally varied too there are moments on here where you see Nokia bringing these braggadocious tracks that just had this bulletproof confidence to them and then there are other moments where she's addressing growing up just being a bit of an oddball and people kind of ridiculing her and putting her down there actually multiple moments on this project where she kind of recognizes her own outsider status on the song different which is honestly one of the many things that makes this project special I love that Nokia takes the time to kind of fly her freak flag and just boiling down all of those weird personality quirks and interests that make her special and really just lacing them very deeply into her music it's that personal detail and it's that charisma and it's that willingness to be so open with the audience that makes 1992 really entertaining even when it's hitting some shortcomings like how pretty much all the songs on this thing flow like a bit of a compilation not really like a formal album occasionally Nokia's wordplay is a little obvious or her word choice can be kind of corny still though in spite of that it's still interesting to hear Nokia kind of explore things like her own femininity and how she kind of veers off of the gender norm path on the song tomboy occasionally the production on this thing can be kind of flat or Hollow leaving Nokia feeling just a little unsupported for me however as her popularity grows I'm sure this is something that will improve and there are some moments on here where her rapping and her delivery comes off a little stiff like on receipts or on the song Bart Simpson but still I really enjoy these tracks for their raw and rugged demeanor for their amateurish charm for just how I guess revealing they are in a way how vulnerable they are you know rapper rapping about themselves is altogether nothing new but this is one of those rare moments where I feel like I'm listening to I'm going to do a deep dive into themselves and we're kind of hearing a very layered person on the mic some of which I think is definitely a result of showmanship like when I see Princess Nokia in a music video on social media hear her in a song I do get this sense that she's building up a bit of a character or kind of embellishing elements of her personality of her life to just kind of make the the the vision of Princess Nokia even bigger which i think is great I feel like to make it in rap music you kind of need to have a larger-than-life personality and the cherry on top of this is just that there's so many songs on here where she just approaches with a really sharp or really smart a really interesting song topic or concept again like the song tomboy which I mentioned Gitana which is pretty much just like a fight anthem on the song ABCs of New York you have her tributing her city talking about all the things about New York that she loves also taking shots at white supremacy the song mine in my opinion is maybe one of the smartest and most fun tracks to approach this very touchy subject of women's hair talking about ownership and wigs and extension and beauty salons the song is catchy and it's way more educational and informational than it is confrontational songs like different in goth guitar where she is kind of wearing that weirdo label proudly goth kids specifically getting into the emotional side of things talking about how being goth being a dark person emotionally isn't necessarily about the clothes on your back it's just about how you feel and how you see the world also there's a strong element of femininity to this project to I would say for a rap record it's pretty feminist I mean princess Nokia is really rattling on about the patriarchy or anything like that but there is this really strong sense of wanting to break down social barriers and social expectations put on women through her art and through her power as an artist this thing is a really great mix of tracks way more hits than misses I'm sorry I'm late to it but better late than never even though this is technically a 2016 release I think Nokia and Rough Trade have really expanded it into a whole nother beast one which to me says that Nokia is easily one of wraps more interesting figures right now I hope she continues to just grow experiment and carry the torch for just all the freaks and geeks out there I'm feeling a light decent eight on this thing transition have you given this expanded deluxe edition a listen did you love it did you hate it what

aXHFPuiFjzA,hey everyone respecting all people here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new mkhaya McRaven album highly rare Micaiah McRaven is a contemporary jazz drummer based in Chicago who has been making some waves in the genre for a little while now he had a pretty well-received the semi live album back in 2015 titled in the moment it was a very creative album that fuse together jazz with elements of electronic music and funk and hip hop avant-garde music as well there was so much good music in 2015 I just kind of overlooked it and I I regret that I highly recommend it if you haven't heard it already the flow is kind of rickety because it's really more of a compilation than an album stringing together all of these bits of live recordings and session recordings with his friends and then taking these sessions and kind of boiling them down to their most essential interesting moments and highly rare is very similar in spirit essentially another compilation of live recordings all laid down to tape at Danny's tavern in Chicago essentially pulled together on an old four track and then McRaven took the source material and fused it into beats transforming these jam sessions with his friends into these noisy lo-fi funky and clunky jazz hip hop crossovers the sound obviously is not perfect but the whole project has this really interestingly grimy aesthetic to it that balances out really nicely with some really flashy and beautiful improvisation throughout the project like the drum solo at the latter half of the song the locator which took an incredible amount of muscle finesse the wailing sax solos all over the track above and beyond which fit very nicely on top of the head knocking beat and then we have the noisy free jazz freakout in the second half of Venus rising which reaches its climax point after a very beautiful and mellow build-up even when the music veers off of the jazz path sort of it's still really gratifying like on the track left fields which is an 11 minute cut it feels like this odd international jam with sound source material and performance styles that sound like they're coming from around the globe and sort of convening into this one track it's groovy it's driving its geographic origin is sort of hard to place there moments that feel vaguely Middle Eastern moments that feel vaguely African the song is loaded with these disembodied vocal samples and chants these metallic Warped kind of strung out weird strumming noises driving drums which are really Bumi and claustrophobic I love how just enveloping and and encapsulating the track is and then there's rfg the third where the crowd can audibly be heard really loving the bass scrunching jazz funk Jam and when I say face scratchy I mean like you hear the groove and you hear the jam you're like ooh ooh then of course this Jam is chopped up and played out in a series of hip-hop inspired loops that sort of enhance the groove the closing track is a bit of a dud on this thing though I do admire McRaven trying to use some samples of the crowd noise to enhance the drumbeat that he's working with on the track and I just wish there was more to this project I wish there was more material on it I wish there wasn't quite so many moments that either felt a little underwhelming or you have a couple tracks on here that are roughly just interludes on here too like I just wanted more because what I heard for the most part was so great I feel like this thing is almost a really good EP and yet it's it's somehow basically the length of an album but still I really liked it and thought it was a refreshing combination of sounds and ideas I get that there are a lot of artists out there who have similarly brought together elements of electronic music and jazz and rap music I'm on Tobin or Flying Lotus or Jagger Jazz's the list is pretty long but McRaven certainly has his own approach on this thing with him being a jazz drummer with him having some pretty close collaborators on this thing these beats these productions have a very freeform element to them like you can have these sequence loops and grooves and samples on this thing but at any moment they could shift into something totally different or hit a free improvisation passage that element of change in the improvisational cacophony certainly made this a bit of a standout record for me at least in this particular genre again this is pretty invigorating very fun listen very fresh I just wanted and was wishing for more out of it I'm feeling a decent strong seven from this thing transition shout out to red scroll records where I got the the the beautiful recommendation for this thing over here next to my head is another review that you can check out or you can hit the link to subscribe to the channel I'll catch you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana highly rare microphone microphones on forever 
2WnDjpoMxjE,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well excuse the ambient drone in the background there's a little ambien drone figured it would be appropriate for this review it's time for a review of the new current album rainbow mirror this is the latest full-length album from West Coast moyson ik dominic Fernau AKA current this thing is out now via profound lore records and it is not just an album but also in a way a bit of a celebration of the inception of korean as a musical project 20 years ago so given that this is a special occasion we have three discs of material on this thing a bonus disc and to make these recordings dominic brought on two collaborators jim bras and matt Folden and together they conjure a series of live explorative pieces that were carefully mixed in the studio after they performed them in in a session and believe me when I tell you these tracks are really freeform I mean this has to be one of Dominic's most indulgent releases yet rivaling even some of his most obscure and shortest run tapes and splits over the years but what makes rainbow mirror different than a lot of those earlier projects is its size and I don't just mean the length of this thing I also mean the sounds the sounds on this record are massive they're huge the sounds on this thing are really full really evocative texturally this record is kind of to die for and there is a huge element of how how is he doing this the jagged brittle burning distortions on this record the splashy vast reverb all the warped tones subterranean bass sputtering noises and and that's really just the tip of the iceberg for sound descriptors on this thing this record is kind of beyond accurate description at some points I could talk about the industrial drones and the weird tapping sounds and the distant crashing sounds and the high-pitched ringing which make up the first leg of the song April Fool's Day aspect sinister and then in the second leg of the track you have a total sound palate shift of tweeting synth notes these metallic sounds kind of diddling away and what sounds like these singular twanging notes kind of ringing out in a very eerie way and all of those descriptors are just barely scratching the surface of what exactly makes this piece this very lengthy glacial piece tick just know that going into this record you're gonna get elements of industrial of dark ambient of drone of noise sometimes all at once sometimes separately aesthetically and emotionally the sounds presented on this record are not too unlike Koreans last major project on profound lower records frozen Niagara Falls but what made me love that record and what made that record kind of a game-changer for prayer ian is a lot of the compositions on there we're pretty direct also this record seemed to take a lot of the sounds the past ideas from previous prayer and releases give him a higher fidelity a higher gloss finish not to mention the prominent placement of these very icy synthesizers that sounded like they were coming out of a an 80s sci-fi or horror movie soundtrack a lot of these same sounds turn up on rainbow mirror but in a much more deconstructed fashion most likely as a result of these songs being slightly if not completely improvised each song has a pretty discernable sound palette though I wouldn't be surprised if dominic and company went into a certain track knowing what sounds they were gonna use and knowing maybe what intensity points they were going to reach but how and when they would exactly get there it's a little up in the air each song has a pretty discernable pack of sounds you could really think of each track on this thing as being its own individual color palette so while each track on this record doesn't sound the same there is a sense of say meanness to each song here the repetition the stillness the formlessness of these pieces so for a lot of people structurally this record is probably going to leave a lot to be desired it's too long it's too directionless it doesn't go anywhere which sure it's a somewhat fair point for this record but if that's your only issue with this album it's a bit reductionist this album is best moments for me we're not so much songs I was listening to but pieces of sound art I was immersed in or surrounded by if I could just sidebar here for a second music has this really unique dependency on that other artistic mediums don't a piece of music is happening and occurring for a certain amount of minutes and seconds meanwhile a painting or a sculpture is always there it's always on once it's made its it's just their existing 24/7 whether somebody's looking at it or not except for maybe ice sculptures that  melts of course music can be listening to over and over and over but each composition has a beginning and a middle and a finishing point and it seems like on this record with some pieces Dominic is trying to break that sense of time that sense of position and a piece by making certain songs or making certain pieces on this thing really redundant really repetitive really easy to sort of just whoa where am i what did I just hear am I remembering what I just heard where am I going I'm lost I'm totally lost I had at least a few moments listening to this thing when I was just kind of zoning out and meditating to where it felt like these pieces could really just go on forever all that being said though could Dominic have rendered some of these pieces down have some of them made them a little bit more direct in their progression in their structure and maybe given them a bit more impact in the process I mean sure absolutely there are at least several pieces on this thing where I'm not so much upset with the length of the piece but that I began to grow uninterested in exploring the soundscape before the piece is actually over and while these songs do have a sense of place truth be told some places are more interesting than others some places are cool and vibrant and interesting and fun to be in meanwhile others are a little some tracks delivering a series of sounds that are maybe slightly bland or uninteresting or just don't really evoke any kind of emotion or mental stimulation out of me or just features some odd progressions that kind of make it difficult for me to immerse myself in the track like the song cruel worlds which does deliver some of the most interesting sounds on the entire record especially in the last leg of the song but the track features a few different pieces and points that don't really segue all that seamlessly in fact you kind of get sounds and progressions just completely stopping and going silent and then things kind of kick back up again the song barefoot god which features these very low-frequency drones distant crashing sounds like cymbals and what is possibly like 808 claps I mean it's okay it's just not really quite as significant as much of the material here although I guess maybe Dominic wanted to ease listeners into this thing with a five-minute piece and while the revving tones and the muffled vocals on nature come are kind of interesting would I call them inspired it's one of several tracks that I found to be kind of stimulating on first listen to this record but as I return to it more and more and more the sounds kind of lost their luster for me I also love the high-pitched intense and noisy walls of distortion on the last moments of the song chaos sex it takes a while to get to that point the first leg of the song leaves me kind of feeling like I'm sitting in an orthodontist office in hell waiting for my name to be called so I could be tortured with a dentist drill which I guess is certainly a feet on the album it's certainly more pleasurable than being slowly annoyed to death by the cycling whirring synthesizers aimlessly navel-gazing over a buzzing drone on the song blue kimono over corpse the song path is short is one of this album's most incredible and genuinely frightening moments on the entire record like if I was locked in a room with this piece being played repeatedly at high volume I would probably go insane especially if the room were pitch black it was a pitch-black room I would go insane I would go crazy to mention April Fool's Day aspect sinister again love this track love the weird woozy tones on the song the odds sampling or pacing or whatever it is about this track that makes it feel like I'm constantly speeding up and slowing down it's speeding up and slowing down it's really kind of a mind-bending surreal moment on the record I also like the track Okinawan burial vaults even with it's constantly disappearing and reappearing subtle industrial grooves that guide the listener through this ever morphing textured drone I wish it did have a steadier pace to it but it is a unique moment on the record and then we have the two part Buddha strangled in vines which combined is a thirty minute piece on the record the first part of this two-part piece is actually one of the most engaging moments on the album it's probably the closest this record comes to delivering a true and a very clear composition a majority of which is executed through these hypnotic twinkling synth leads and shots of distortion and rumbling bass now many of these sounds actually carry over on to the second part of these two pieces but in a much more uneventful fashion which leads me into a bit of confusion like I feel almost like the first ten minutes of Buddha part two could have just been part one I truly do feel like I'm listening to a more drawn-out less eventful version of part one for maybe like the first 13 minutes of the track unfortunately this record was not really the gargantuan and mind-blowing dark ambient and drone and noise experience that I was looking for not really a game changer despite just how massive and ambitious and scope this record seemed to be I'm glad it exists though it was certainly one of the most unique listening experiences I've had this year given that I'm sure there are some people going absolutely apeshit over this thing and while length was certainly an issue here and there I do think there are some pieces that certainly were there welcomed out after a while primarily my interest in this record came down to whether or not the sound palettes were actually intriguing many of which were on my first listen but after repeated visits to this thing that there were a lot of moments that kind of lost their magic for me I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it - J hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I

2P6KBsONYWo,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantino here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a cookie review of the new Noel Gallagher's high flying birds album who built the moon Noel Gallagher singer-songwriter you most likely know him from the band Oasis which he was in for years with his brother Liam who also came out with a solo record this year that was pretty good this is the third high flying birds album though I have never really been that much into Noel's post Oasis stuff however some of the lead-up singles to this new album over here said to me that maybe this album was going to be the most experimental and psychedelic yet in the high flying birds discography and most certainly it is not that the high flying birds haven't had psychedelic leanings in the past they definitely have but Fort Knox who built the moon like the tracks the previews that I was hearing from this thing such dense thick heavy kaleidoscopic colorful instrumentation and some weird sound sounds like samples on this thing that you wouldn't necessarily expect like the incessant ringing alarm clock on this thing that plays throughout much of Fort Knox there are also some weird pieces of instrumentation and tape loops and electronic sequencing on this thing so the sound it's pretty dense it's compressed a lot too and full of reverb it's like a big brick almost to a fault though it points because Noel's vocals really are washed out wash away in these instrumentals and in my opinion he's not that strong of a vocalist of a songwriter to begin with so for his song was to get kind of a little overpowered in these linear groovy hypnotic instrumentals it's the songs man and the lyrics that's just where this album obviously falters like Nowell clearly has some shortcomings when it comes to lyricism just look at the lyrics for the song holy mountain or she taught me to fly like maybe two of the hardest moments on this record to stomach it just simply from a lyrical standpoint meanwhile the songs the chord progressions the melodies the core of these instrumentals are not that interesting a lot of the time either sure some of these tracks do have incredibly climactic instrumental finishes the man who built the moon which has these amazing wailing loud blaring lead melodies calling out over this dense instrumentation keyboards guitars bass it's so friggin heavy it's so powerful it's an amazing final moment to the album but still it feels like a lot of the time Nowell is coming through with these groovy linear kind of repetitive instrumentals first and then maybe writing songs to that either that or he's drumming up these songs acoustically and then somehow losing the body and the nuance and the intimacy of the song in the process of just throwing in all this layered instrumentation either way it feels like we're kind of losing a touch of dynamics or sort of an emotional connection to these tracks a lot of the time which just is what it is I guess there are lots of bands and lots of records that go in this direction write songs in this way that I don't quite mind in fact I enjoy quite a bit but if Nola's going to take a record in this direction it just has to kind of go farther the sounds are certainly there though a little compressed though a little overblown but I feel like the instrumentation the experimentation it doesn't quite go the extra mile especially on if love is the law or black and white sunshine whose instrumentals I find to be kind of plain it's just funny to get to Gallagher brothers records in one year because it kind of creates this a yin and yang situation this record has the sense of Sonic Adventure that I wish Liam's album had meanwhile Liam's album has the songwriting quality and the single power that I wish this new Noah album had I could see myself returning to some of the songs on each of these two records occasionally but for completely different reasons this new Nowell album is decent there are some points where it's a little middle-of-the-road it's a little bland but I didn't hate a single song on this thing even on moments where I found the song to be kind of underwhelming there were some incredible instrumental ideas floating about I feel kind of a light too decent six on this thing from being completely honest it's okay but let me know what you guys thought of it down in the comments did you love it - Jada why what do you think I should review next and I will see you in the next one over here next to my head is that Liam Gallagher review you can check that out you can click on that or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel Anthony Fantana Gallagher's high flying birds who built them in forever 
XGboPnsVrU0,uh-oh man I love being healthy hmm no feeling sick for Cal I'm a healthy boy I feel bad for anybody who's sick not me hey everyone sickness a tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new EB II album ash eBay is a French Cuban musical duo consisting of sisters Naomi and Lisa Kai and a Diaz who made their full-length debut on XL Recordings a few years ago with a self-titled project that featured stunning vocals some very dramatic and primal beats some piano some minimal electronics the duo's sound seemed like a simple but very futuristic take on art pop and R&B that was deeply rooted in the musical traditions of Cuba and the Yoruba it's an album that I wish I gave more attention to at the time I'm kind of late to the party once again on this new record of theirs over here but hey hey and this is a pretty interesting follow-up to their debut album in some ways it's an advancement in other ways it does leave something to be desired the sound of this thing for the most part is gorgeous aesthetically wonderful I love the minimal beats on this thing the very dramatic and chilling chord progressions and of course the stark and densely layered vocal harmonies that come from the Diaz Sisters the vocal melodies and harmonies on this thing are truly the bread and butter of the project the selling point of the project as well as the very poetic lyrics and I love the eBay's compositional approach on these songs is everything you need nothing you don't they don't need to busy up the mix with a bunch of sounds they don't really add anything so when they do bring something a little bit extra in the mix like a Komachi Washington saxophone solo hey Chilly Gonzales piano phrase another synth layer or a bit of extra reverb or a mala Rodriguez verse you really feel it its presence is huge you do have the occasional shot of auto-tune on the Dia's Sisters vocals on this thing which some hardcore fans have kind of taken the wrong way as them ruining their voices or ruining their sound personally I think the beauty of their singing still shines through a lot of the auto-tune and I think much of the time it adds a very nice and a necessary degree of separation from the lead vocals or the vocal harmonies that are more raw and naked and untouched it allows them to add more vocal harmonies and lead vocals into tracks or into a mix without it sounding like you're just listening to four or five or six layers of the same person and there's also an undeniably sharp digital texture to the auto-tune too that I think plays well in the mostly open and organic aesthetic of these songs all in all it's just a nice contrast the one moment where I would say the auto-tune goes kind of overboard is on the closing track ash which generally I think the instrumentation and the mixing on that track is a little chaotic a little muddy to the point where it just really takes away from the song more than it adds still though there are tons of quality tracks in the track listing on this thing for one the song a song that features these captivating sweeping vocal harmonies a booming Cerebral beat stunning lead vocals it is essentially the simple beauty of eBay's music encapsulated into a three-minute song the song deathless has some pretty creepy lyrics about a young girl having a run-in with this total creep who's just impeding on her very existence in a very violent way with how the lyrics read on this thing it seems like this girl's untimely death comes at the hands of this guy and from what I understand this song is inspired by a real run-in with a racist cop that one of the Diaz sisters had the song numb is kind of a smart fusion of eBay's typical sound with a bit of a trip hop vibe complete with these very heavy droning synth chords and a dusty hip-hop beat and the very epic transmission is a wonderful track that seems to ideologically push for a better tomorrow a clearer sky the song has multiple phases to it each one more stunning the next I wish there were more songs that sort of hit a length that was this satisfying and this cut is one of many moments on this album that seemed to be a direct response to the current social and political climate and just only a sidebar something about this record this is a deeply deeply feminine album this is not just two women making an A political art pop record this album has a mystical womanly vibe to it that shows incredible concern for the treatment of the fair sex across the world the song I want to be like you is one of the most heartwarming and catchiest tracks on the entire record the refrain the chorus on this thing is so quiet and yet so snappy and just burned into my head instantly and the sentiment of the song is beautiful it's about essentially wanting the innocence and the carefree nature of a younger child to be yours like you're envious of this younger kid that they're so hopeful and they're so bright and they're so looking forward to what the world has to offer them but yet as an adult you sort of understand just how dark dark things are there's a slave trade in Libya right now Jesus Christ the one thing about this track though is that it is criminally short and that's kind of an issue for me I wish some of this album's best moments just had more length had more structure felt more like fully completed songs as opposed to over extended motifs namely I carried this for years which i think is a beautiful introduction it just doesn't really land the ending and then there is no man as big enough for my arms which I love the vocal harmonies on that well the sentiment of the track love the Michelle Obama samples but again it doesn't really feel like a song as much as it does just a motif meanwhile tracks like waves in va feel just a little too skeletal to captivate as much as some of the other songs on this thing though there is something about how naked and stark and basic the song waves is that it kind of makes it a standout in the tracklisting so there are a good number of tracks on this thing that do leave me feeling underwhelmed like I just wanted more however the vast majority of the songs on this thing are great this album is really wonderful I recommend it to anybody who's looking for a pretty strong art pop release this year it is a beautiful little album that is deceptively simple and has a huge heart I'm feeling a decent of strong 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're

y-77qqjouwg,hi everyone the war on Christmas here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of our 2017 list week series where I go over some highlights musical highlights of the year and in this video we're talking honorable mentions albums that were certainly culturally relevant wanted to mention them didn't want to leave him out but didn't quite make my year-end list because I didn't think quality wise they were quite there but still these records didn't make too large of a splash to completely ignore or we're significant enough to me personally to want to mention let's kick it off with this onda Tropico record by leigh buck enero a highly anticipated follow-up to the colombian musical supergroups debut album which was a huge musical undertaking like 40 members so many tracks like it's a gigantic project if you love Latin music if you love Latin jazz I highly recommend this album this follow-up though is is much more meager in comparison however that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable it's a little rough around the edges at points but it still celebrates an amazing breadth of Latin music styles as well as incorporating elements of reggae and hip hop this time around pretty well it has its lulls in the tracklist but this is still a very exciting musical project that I hope continues I hope follows this new album up very soon next I have to shout out this new Colin Stetson album all this I do for glory the solo saxophonist is back he's finding new ways to incorporate some different sounds here and they are into his repertoire but mostly you have once again these cycling hypnotic solo saxophone pieces that make use of his continuous breathing technique so you kind of get these endless uninterrupted pieces however Colin does have a certain way of writing these pieces which i think has become pretty apparent so this record doesn't totally pull out all the stops it's not chock-full of that many surprises still though the writing and performances on this thing are undeniably good the production is pretty stunning like there's definitely a beautiful vastness to a lot of these pieces and having an opportunity to listen to one of the most enigmatic and talented saxophone players on the planet right now is always a treat this new Roger Waters album really surprised me like he's he's very much at a point in his career where he shouldn't be putting out some of best stuff or you would assume that's the case but this new record of his is truly a great album I mean sure there are many points on this thing where it is very Freudian it's gonna make you miss like some old-school Floyd's stuff it very much kind of eats and breathes that sound it's not quite as progressive musically compositionally as I would have liked however the songs are there Rodgers vocals are there and there is a huge element of social commentary going on in the lyrics and the themes some of which get pretty dark pretty morbid also a lot of sound play a lot of sound collage on this album which I find pretty interesting too there are a few songs on the tracklist that pale in comparison to others but overall I think it's a great album I think it's a great statement on our current social and political climate next this new Paramore album after laughter this record certainly has its shortcomings and its flaws but nonetheless this was very much an upset for me this year I have like many other people before this album never been a Paramore fan never really been that interested in Paramore but they made a total 180 with this new album coming through with like a dance Rock a dance pop record that has tight funky colorful fun instrumentals I hope this is the beginning of a new chapter for Paramore that sees a lot of good albums coming out another very good pop record this year though not that consistent in my opinion is the new Lord album this record certainly had some shortcomings but you can't really discount this album entirely it's one of the biggest pop records of the year and I would say one of the more quality pop records of the year when you consider the field of pop on the hole with the new Taylor Swift album like you could you could do a lot worse with mainstream pop records this year you really could and while I do think there are a few tracks on here where Lord really kind of gives into pop trends pretty hard selling her sound kind of short she has some of her most captivating ballads on this thing like Liability one of her best songs ever and overall the record is a pretty interesting meditation on youth fame partying just millennial woes in general I guess next I have to give a shout out to one of the better rap collaborations of the year and that is the new offset 21 savage and Metro boomin project without warning like I I didn't anticipated that this would be as good as it is like it just kind of comes across like a mixed bag of tracks so as an album the flow is just kind of okay but there's some incredibly dark trappy Spacey and hard-hitting tracks on this thing and for whatever reason even though offset and 21 savage have entirely different rap styles they meld together pretty well on this thing like they provide some nice contrast from one another the whole thing is pretty murderous pretty creepy pretty cold-blooded and I'm actually very happy that this came out next I'm shouting out the new Bjork album utopia while this record did on its face have some pretty weak tracks on it conceptually I do find this to be one of York's more interesting albums it does address a lot of the topics of romance and love and breaking up that her last album did but in a much more raw sense like it seems like there's no filter on her when it comes to the lyrics on this album a lot of expose is on this record a lot of very personal and raw feelings that she's still feeling to this day revealed but I also enjoy the musical aesthetic the compositional concept of this album with Bjork incorporating all sorts of field recordings of birds and just nature recordings in general on top of that we have the wonderful course of flutes that plays throughout much of this record then these song structures on this album are pretty open pretty vast leading to a lot of these songs to feel sort of meditative I guess from a song quality perspective it's not one of her most gratifying record and sometimes the production is a little off sometimes the tunes aren't quite there because they kind of suffer at the hands of the narrative but it is easily one of New York's most emotionally intense projects next got to give a shout out to the new forests Ward's album compassion dug this album quite a bit even though in retrospect I do think it is maybe a little one-dimensional and vibe but still I do love the primal very cerebral and organic electronic music that occurs on this record it's very open it's very spacious I do wish it brought more variety to the table but still it was one of the more interesting electronic music lessons I've had this year next on my list I have to give a shout out to a record that unfortunately is not going to be making it onto my year-end lists because of extraneous issues personal issues here but still I can't come on here in my honorable mentions video and tell you guys that this record this new Alan Vega album it has easily been one of the most intense insane and incredible listening experiences I've had all year like this album is pretty fantastic and it's a posthumous record as well Alan Vega if you didn't know is a synth punk pioneer known for fronting the band suicide and this record of his his final album is really up there with David Bowie's Black Star and the new Sharon Jones album as far as albums that sort of center around the the passing of the artists creating art like this record is so noisy it's so fantastically performed Ellen vega's vocals on this thing he sounds like like a demon that smokes too much the lyrics are pretty minimal and morbid and despondent the instrumentals are redundant but have a very raw noisy industrial feel and there's really a sense of place to these instrumentals like each instrumental is like a weird hypnotic sonic torture chamber that Alan sort of performs these shouted word poetry slam vocals and hopefully what I'm saying about this album is kind of selling it because I do truly think this is the best project on this entire honourable mentions list and certainly worth a listen certainly worth your time if you are into experimental music if you are a suicide fan are APL and Vega the man has an incredible and a fantastic musical legacy and this record is an amazing closing chapter to that so there you go okay so this final record on my honorable mentions list it's a controversial one it's a hip-hop record a lot of people got mad at me because I gave this thing a 7 some people saying Anthony why would you give that project to seven I mean my score on this thing kind of became a little bit of a meme upset quite a few people but uh you know the student has just been having an incredible year a huge year I mean he's really kind of changing the game and making a lot of waves so I had to mention him in this list of course the the cultural significance the impact of this project could not go unacknowledged of course I'm talking about lope [Music] [Music] ition have you given these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I have you next hit the

dSDbbWaXI9U,hi everyone dayquil here the internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a sickly review of the new Glassjaw album material control 15 years later and finally a comeback album from Hempstead New York band Glassjaw a post-hardcore outfit who fractured in the 2000s after two full length records everything you ever wanted to know about silence and worship and tribute neither of which are really truly highlights for me in the genre I certainly see the appeal of worship and tribute sure but aside from the occasionally frantic and dissonant and sort of spastic guitar passages on that record I found the band compositionally to be average at best and the singing of frontman Daryl Palumbo always struck me as being borderline silly always pulling off these super overdone vocalizations that I just could not really stand for whatever reason yet somehow I'm really into the band blood brothers figure that one out in the 2000s I think it's safe to say that I respected Glassjaw more than I actually enjoyed them I thought they were definitely cut above a lot of the sweeter post hardcore bands out there that had a strong appeal in the emo community but they weren't really clicking with a younger me like I was very much more a Fugazi guy Drive Like Jehu guy big black or even a McCluskey guy so as a result I can't say I went into this new glass draw album with the highest of hopes but I was definitely curious as to how the band would sound after over a decade of studio album silence and I got to say I think they really kind of came back with a vengeance on this one some parts of this record are a friggin barn burner the band is going full volume on this thing full density full energy full dynamic range the mix on this thing is thick like a cheese cake lasagna the guitars and bass on this thing are mixed to sound so heavy which of course are topped with all these wild freaky dissonant guitar leads and solos the drumming is very OnPoint though a lot of the time I'll say it's pretty lost in the chaos and miraculously Daryl has kind of refined his vocal style on this one while the studio here doesn't sound quite as organic as it has in the past the band is definitely sounding cleaner and sleeker especially now with Darrell singing sounding like a combination of Chino from Deftones Mike Patton era Faith No More a little bit of Perry from Jane's Addiction and just like a smidge of Cedric from Mars Volta and at the drive-in it's not the most original sound I've ever heard but certainly is appealing to me a little bit more than much of the band's early material and it seems like all the band's I just mentioned are having like a bit of a compositional influence on glass jaw this time around too though the band is pretty much known as being a post-hardcore group from over a decade ago you can't really come away from this album saying that they're just carrying the torch for an old sound or that they're stuck in the past still though occasionally Darrell does come through on this album with these obnoxious overextended vocalizations like on Bible land or my conscious weighs a ton or especially on the song citizen [Music] I I just do not see the appeal of this vocal style seriously extending your vocal notes out to the point where the vocal melody loses any memorability is just kind of the still again I do think this album presents vocal improvements all around just keep in mind that's the opinion of somebody who wasn't really a huge glass jaw fan to begin with in my opinion when this album is at its best its delivering to listeners these layered sour tense verses that suddenly transition into these crushing riffey hooks that just destroy everything in their path like on the multi-phase Pompeii which considering the structure of the song it's kind of progressive also the incredibly enraged new white extremity that kicks the entire record off and then you have the surprisingly sweet Shira which transitions into a soaring and an incredibly melodic and a really captivating hook that if there's any point on the album that shows a huge Deftones influence it's it's right here the closing track on this thing is relatively solid too there are certainly a number of highlights in the track listing here but there are also a handful of completely innocuous cuts that only seem to pad the track listing out which this is only like a 36 minute album there's not that much material on it to begin with an album of this size and shape and expectation level given that it is a comeback album should just be all killer and no filler and yet we have the title track on this thing which is like a weird Bumi drum loop complete with these frantic little guitar passages it sounds like a battles demo and then the song Bastille Day seems like a weird percussion circle that never quite goes anywhere interesting though it does transition into the following track kind of nicely and then we have the very moody and long-winded strange hours whose atmosphere whose aesthetic is very despondent I do like the emotional variety it brings to the record but compositionally this this entire song would just be awash if it weren't for the swell of distorted guitars and melodic vocals on the hook it's not interesting for the entirety of its runtime nor is it one of the better songs on this thing overall this is a pretty good record considering it's been 15 years since the last one it certainly came through harder and heavier and more aggressive than I thought it was going to be but it's still kind of an inconsistent album and yet one-dimensional this album rarely veers outside of the tone that is set at the beginning of the album with the pummeling guitars and the wailing lead vocals and when it does it leads to some of the album's most awkward moments I do hope that glass drought continues though it does seem on this record they wanted to give fans something different and show them that after all these years they're still willing to continue to evolve and take risks as opposed to simply just pandering and doing what they've done all along as long as they continue to maintain that mindset there's always going to be a chance for interesting music coming down the pipe I'm feeling a decent two strong six on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments

people over a turntable lab where you can buy colorful vinyl pressings of records that I have talked about on my youtube channel here we are worst tracks of the week got to give it first to my boy ed Sheeran I just saw like this over-under video on pitchfork with Noel Gallagher and I and I think he called him the ginger fury and I just could not stop laughing at that ed Sheeran the ginger fury new version of the song perfect out with bee say it's it's just as awful as perfect was before Beyonce was added into the mix nothing nothing really sick bout it outside of that it's still a corny corny ballad but let's really kind of get into the worst of the worst this week there's been a lot of holiday projects dropping this week so far and we're only like three days into December we have that terrible new C a holiday album it's it's not that good and that Gwen Stefani holiday album is absolute trash but none of it is as trashy and as disgusting as every single track on this new Jake Paul EP littmus Jake pollen team 10 pretty much jake paul rapping terribly over a bunch of trap style renditions of already popular holiday songs as well as a christmas remix of everyday bro so this made me want to die this made me throw up in my mouth especially on the twelve days of christmas where he raps about his dog giving his seed and then he then gives jake eight new puppies on the eighth day of christmas it's it's the first time i think in a rap song i've been confronted with the the visual of dogs semen so not too happy about that but um you know the this this thing is shit it's absolute trash i can't even pick a single track out of it to mention in the worst tracks of the week segment it's just all trash it's all shit from the nick crompton intro to jake paul pretending to be logan paul on one track it's it's really all terrible i really seriously didn't listen to this thing from from end to end and it's really just like a human centipede of song just each song just shitting into the next song only for that song to shit into the mouth of the following song so i really don't know what else to say except that on iTunes in Apple music and spotify probably as well you can loop this EP so really it's just kind of an endless human centipede with each mouth sort of going into a ring so it's just mouth to ass in a circle so a complete circle of mouth to musical Human Centipede that's really all I have to say all right let's move into the mess section checks that I thought were worth shouting out worth mentioning though I wasn't totally insane and crazy for them first off shout out to my boys They Might Be Giants one of the best rock groups and pop groups of all time in my opinion though lately a lot of their stuff is kind of watered down in a little bland and the production is kind of dry and on the uninteresting side sort of remains to be the case with this new song over here last wave but still got to give a nod to my boys they're the best also a TK my itza with Danielle Harrell sorry I can't pronounce anything I'm a I'm so lit from Jake Paul's litmus they have a new track titled bum bum which to me reads like Azealia Banks if she stayed good as opposed to like starting to come out with terrible music so so this is kind of like a nice sweet banger not a whole lot of substance to it I do think the hook and the refrain does get old after a while but still great instrumental shout out to a rapper from Down Under and yeah just check the track out it's a fun time it's a fun time I'm just not sure I'm personally gonna get a whole lot of a replay value out of it next shout out to my boy igloo ghost who did a cute little remix of little pumps moly which is up now on his soundcloud page it's kind of short I wish he did more with it but all in all it is a pretty fun little remix next-best coast does a cover of the fantastic little Christmas song you guys know Beach Boys Brian Wilson all that stuff it's it's kind of bland in usual Best Coast fashion however it's it's hard to really truly mess up a cover of little Saint Nick as long as you sort of keep it kind of rocky and light-hearted and cheery it's a very fun rendition and it's one of many indie for the holidays songs that you can find on a new amazon original compilation that is pretty decent on the whole pretty decent moving on from their beak who you you know might know is connected to the amazing portishead and so on and so forth Geoff Barrow all that stuff they have a new track out a holiday-themed track Merry Christmas face the future and it is one of the dreariest Christmas songs that I've ever heard in my entire life it is a little maybe too drab not just because of the whole holiday theme and everything but I do think there is kind of a bleakness and a muddiness that I think kind of hurts the songs overall appeal but I do like what they're trying to do on this track quite a bit I do like kind of the miserable dystopian vibe of the song and that it's a I don't know just like kind of one of the most warped Christmas tunes I've ever heard so shout out to this track if you're looking to have a weird Christmas give this thing a shot and now let's get into the best tracks of the week in my opinion let's do it the Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam let's just shoot them all out BAM number one ty Segall awesome noose Kroenke honky saxophone back track which is titled the main Pretender and it's heavy it's fantastic it's a part of several singles he's released recently on Bandcamp all of which have been pretty good this has stood out to me as the best one though and I'm really excited for when ty makes his return with a new album probably at some point next year moving on from there show me the body got to give a shout-out to this new track the New York kind of experimental punk outfit has a new song out titled talk it's it's like a bit of a grimy heavy distorted Punk throwback it's very brutish it's very thuggish it's very goo blue you know it's like very I don't know lunk headed I do kind of like that quality about it it's kind of like mutant Punk or something really kind of digging the vibe and the aesthetic that they're pulling together on this track feels old-school but kind of has like a new-school weirdness about it that I like quite a bit next no age has a new track out titled drippy which reads to me is like a noisy layered kind of psychedelic piece of pop punk which is pretty Pleasant pretty sweet on the ears pretty interesting so definitely enjoying what they're putting out so far with these singles to this new album certainly more than I did with their last record really do have higher hopes with this new upcoming project I guess it's it's gonna be on Bandcamp but uh that's nice I like band camp moving on from there try not to get distracted here nerd or any Rd Pharrell all that new song out new album on the way December 15th this new one featuring future is 1000 this track I liked even more than lemonade like this is fucking amazing the youthful brash like kind of post-punk II verses on this thing are incredible the chorus is banging it's like a weird mix of like the futuristic experimental approach to pop and rap that we've expected from any Rd so far but their elements of punk and synth punk in there they're elements of trap in there and it's it's just such a menagerie of sounds and ideas but they all come together so well like it's it's such an incredible song like I can't really say enough good things about it and I'm kind of really excited for this album because any Rd so far they're two for two they are two for two like this might be a bit of a like I'm trying to think like a D'Angelo situation here you know where you have one of the best albums of the year come out yes before this week just at the tail end of the year so I'm pretty high pretty excited honestly next probably my favorite Christmas song this week is this new marching Church song Christmas on earth which the Ice Age fans are probably well aware of marching Church at this point they're a northern European rock band with kind of post-punk vibes and a huge like Nick Cave influence going on and I love just how downtrodden and miserable and bleak but also melodic and beautiful this ballad is and that's really truly what it is it's like a downtrodden Christmas ballad that breaks the heart and really kind of love that about it which is why it's it's it's my favorite Christmas song this week it's the favorite Christmas single of the week so if you listen any Christmas singles I have recommended to you in this video for the love of God please listen to this one this one this one is fantastic give a shout out to first aid kit this new song over there that they have coming out of their forthcoming record ruins this track friggin fireworks has a bit of a like a 60s girl group vibe to it or something like a bit of a Brill Building vibe to it and it comes together really well like it's very soulful it's very sweet it's very poppy but I think there's a modern edginess to it too it's not just an exercise in nostalgia or anything like that and of course the the duo's usual sharp songwriting talent and vocal talent shines through on this track - really excited for this new album of theirs could be one of their best could be their best so yeah I think it's really shaping up with the singles next I got to give a shout out to DRAM big baby DRAM who has a new Christmas EP out one song actually features his mother big baby mom it's their rendition of silver pelts and they kind of fucking kill it like you wonder where DRAM gets his singing ability you wonder where DRAM gets his pipes like his mom can really go toe-to-toe with him like there there are a few like awkward moments here and there vocally and and not just with her but with him because it seems like a lot of what they're doing is very kind of impromptu and very sort of off the cuff like it doesn't sound like the most rehearsed version of silver bells that you're ever going to hear and it is a tad short - but man the vocal ability is between these two and just the chemistry between them singing you can tell that this is not their first time singing together and that you know his mother has been an incredible influence on him musically so it's actually kind of beautiful and heartwarming and fantastic to hear both of them on a track and just hear it coming together so well and also could I just say like DRAM as a baby in this picture he's just so this picture he is just so I I imagine like this is just like he's just maybe it's nap time or maybe it was just after nap time he just seems like so out of it I love this picture I love this rendition of silver bells really happy to hear it shout out to dream dream fans have a self-esteem dram fans have self-esteem DMX has a new single out which has been released with Spotify Spotify has been dropping a lot of holiday Singles like a lot of exclusive tunes with a series of different artists doing holiday songs and holiday covers and this is of course a rapper edition of that legendary clip of DMX you know sort of pounding out a sort of acapella version of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer now it has been sort of graced with a studio version with an instrumental thank God praise Lord Jesus Rudolph guiding his sleigh through the night with his nose so bright I'm really happy that this exists the meme has come to life and I'm glad that DMX has embraced the meme and so definitely make sure to listen to this one and finally got to give shout out to Charlie bliss who had one of the more fun kind of bubblegum rock records of the year they have a fantastic and a cheery and a sweet rendition of the song and given just the high pitch register of the lead singer of the band it's it comes together really well it comes together really well like they definitely put their own sort of stank on it and it's quite nice and that is it guys that is it for the holiday installment of the worst tracks of the week the Boonton the met tracks of the week the best tracks of the week aka the weekly track roundup make sure to hit up once again our amazon link down in the description our turntable lab link down in the description and the good people over at Squarespace who sponsored this fantastic holiday episode thank you very much

LSX82ylZhJ0,hi everyone no theny dope tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new CyHi the prynce album no dope on Sundays this is the long-awaited debut album from Atlanta rapper CyHi the prynce who started making some waves in the rap industry back in 2010 with a few mixtapes and a prominent feature on Kanye's legendary My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy after being signed to Def Jam Records Kanye quickly brought him into the good music fold it seemed like big things were to come very soon for psy high at the time however it seemed like signing with Def Jam and teaming up with Kanye sort of put his career on the slow track he had a regular stream of features for sure with a series of other artists who were relevant at the time but news of an album just sort of seemed to totally evaporate eventually CyHi was dropped from Def Jam in 2015 which caused some drama everybody involved seemed eager to smooth over really quick he dropped a diss track called elephant in the room which afterwards he said wasn't really a diss track although if you look at the lyrics they're pretty aggressive and kind of get to the heart of his frustration with being signed with Def Jam being dropped from Def Jam not feeling like support from Kanye side of the aisle so things clearly were not cool but everybody's kind of acting like things were cool all along like not too long after this psy high dropped a lion single which had the the the good music emblem on ax is if he was still with good music while not being with Def Jam and of course he has the dash side single that T's toward this new album which of course features Kanye West so whatever I don't know and totally understand all the drama surrounding this it seems like everyone involved with much rather just kind of get along with their lives in their career instead of just letting this derail everything so I went into this album hoping psy I would really come into his own on this thing I heard a lot of ambition on two of his most recent mixtapes black history project 1 & 2 the afro centric themes and concepts he was trying to pull together on these tapes were pretty huge which also kind of come through on this new album over here although overall there's more of a focus on the grimy violent very drug centric content that you might catch on a lot of rap albums these days but CyHi is far from one-dimensional though on his tracks where he's rapping about gangs and dealing drugs he openly acknowledges the moral failings of somebody who might sell hard drugs to somebody in their own community getting them addicted as well as the real downs and dangers of this lifestyle it's very clear that CyHi tries to find a balance between brute and brilliance a lot like a jay-z or maybe a push a tee but I wouldn't say he is as flashy or as technical as those guys he's really more of a dude that has a persistent rap to his voice a very steady flow and more than ear to the streets kind of like a Jeezy or a Jadakiss and speaking of those guys the 2000s seemed to be a huge reference point for CyHi and his music like there are a lot of flows and beats and songs on this thing that I could see getting a very warm reception like 12 years ago however there are also lots of concessions on this album to the smooth atmospheric melodic trap flavored sounds of today like with the R&B tinge to 80s baby with bj the chicago kid then there's the really spacey moving around which features a pretty punchy trap beat some faint hypnotic keyboards and a very moody schoolboy q feature and then you have i'mfine which features Travis Scott's auto-tune vocal riffing all over the track then you have looking for love which is this equally hideous and hilarious auto-tune rat ballad where the the singing is a little much justjust not-not-not into that it's a bit much there are some sturdy rap songs on this record without a doubt with solid dense verses decent beats but only a few cuts on this record actually managed to stand out to me on the entire thing while sighs Hart is often in the right place it's rare that this album really Wow's or dazzles that's definitely the case on murder which is helped out greatly by an incredible reggae flip in the instrumental and then also new Africa which i think is also incredibly hard-hitting and blood pumping the political sentiments on this track are pretty strong and kind of refreshing too and CyHi does have a lot to say on this album and these tracks which is often why songs on this thing that don't even have a feature go over four minutes you can tell he's really been waiting a long time to say what he's trying to say on this record you can tell he's really been waiting a long time to make this album and on some of these tracks he pulls together some really compelling imagery based off of personal experience like on the song don't know why but truth be told psy high is not really that dynamic of a performer on this record with the way that he raps I mean he has good fundamentals it's steady it's there he's on a beat there's nothing inherently awful about the way that he's rapping but there's no real emotional emphasis to any one line or verse over another at least not a great deal of the time which causes his rapping to kind of turn into a bit of a drone and while CyHi does come into this project with a very strong baseline of talent he does not come through with the gravitas that I think he needs to carry a project of this size on his shoulders even with the incredible amount of features on this thing his flows a lot of the time are pretty middle-of-the-road and despite the fact that this thing is his first album he kind of sounds like a relic from the 2000s who's trying to keep up with the times of today it's like he's a seasoned vet who's trying to make music for young kids but he doesn't have like a series of classics under his belt from 15 or 20 years ago and to kind of make up for the fact that he's not keeping up at the times he has a bunch of trendy guests and features on this thing the album flows like it's been focused groups so you have to have a saw and a tone and a tune for everybody you got to have the love song and you got to have the ballad and you got to have the grimy song and you gotta have the confessional personal song and he gotta the banger it's just a mixed bag that doesn't really come together as a cohesive project he seems like a good guy and he seems like he's putting it all into this right now but there are just too few defining characteristics for CyHi to make him stand out in the current rap landscape however I know he's a fighter and it seems like he's got a lot of experience he's like level up to 75 so you don't totally want to count him out but I feel like this album is average at best and it's just kind of pure indifference at worst it's not awful but I would be lying to you if I told you it was significant and special in some kind of way even with his attempts on here to come through with some weird segways and interludes and be switches like he's just bringing on these musical epilogues on a song to make these tracks seem less meager than they actually are certainly this album and CyHi comes through with good branding but this this record does leave a lot to be desired when it comes to substance and when it comes to execution I'm feeling a strong five to a light six on this thing transition have you given this out boom oh listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should

M29NZ7rj7BA,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and I'm gonna lay down some quick thoughts here on this new gf oty album or rather compilation GF oty bucks GF ot Y is one of many pseudonyms on the PC music label right now which if you're not familiar with that music label they are a burgeoning pop and electronic music label out of the UK that has been delivering some of the most experimental and trendy sounds in these genres this decade and whenever I've caught a PC music compilation volume 1 volume 2 GF oty has always stood out to me as being one of the weirder projects under the PC music umbrella this series of songs which are spread out over 30 minutes there's like well over a dozen cuts here not a whole lot of run time for each song on this thing there are a number of interludes as well where there's kind of like these weird vocal short vocal renditions of already well-known pop songs like all the small things from blink-182 for example is one of several and the cuts on this thing are these short disorienting jagged completely almost like unpredictable and ugly hedonistic hideous but also really stimulating and strange I don't want to say sound collages because I know nearly every sound packed into these songs is an original sound at least it feels like that but it almost feels like nearly every single passage internally every piece of percussion piece of vocal piece of synth lead whatever is like pulled from another place it's almost like they're taking every awful idea like all the worst pop cliches of the past 15 years and just completely rendering them down into something that's almost completely unrecognizable and is totally I don't want to say unlistenable but is super super gimmicky and just totally off the wall like one would not listen to this looking looking to it to delay for the same kind of instantaneous pop joy pop thrill that you would typically get out of the music that clearly influences this stuff like this is like a Frankenstein monster of pop music sort of takes those usual pop cliches and turns them up to the point where you have incredibly hedonistic lyrics on here just about drinking drinking drinking sucking dick sucking dick sucking dick I'm not even joking like it's it's it's definitely comment it is definitely a comment it's it's a it's a really weird experience I'm not gonna say I got much out of it after a couple listens because once the complete unpredictability of it and the gimmicky kind of quality to it wore off of it I grew more and more tired of it but it is a fun thrill for at least a few listens in anyway it's it's kind of tough as a review because very few tracks on here I think work effectively as standalone cuts because nearly every track on this thing feels like a weird Bridge to Nowhere a motif that doesn't really build up into anything just a weird disorienting display of pop nonsense and then on top of that while I think that it works much better as a tapestry as an overall experience it does grow kind of old but I'm not gonna say that there's absolutely no value to it whatsoever I like the concept and I like the attempt of what's going on here however it's just not very listenable after a while and does kind of grow a little tiresome however I'm absolutely positively sure that was certainly an intention here I mean I'm looking over the tracklisting here there are at least a couple tracks on here that I would certainly recommend and I could certainly see myself coming back to whether that be the Christmas song on here which I thought was very cheeky very funny the song tongue which I thought was pretty hilarious and catchy USA was certainly awesome though I remember that track had being released earlier than this compilation and of course Friday night being a one of the grossest and most hedonistic and ridiculous songs on the entire project so there certainly are some songs I will come back to and G fot you I will most definitely remain a project in the PC music camp that I continue to look out for let me know down in the comments what you thought of it like did it resonate with you are you seeing more to this project than I am are you getting a lot of the same things out of it than I am and like what do you expect from PC music right now going forward over here next to my head is another review you can check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel and I will catch you guys in the next one forever 
4EXtbijQOgY,hi everyone over 9000 here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Rosalia album Los Angeles this is the debut album from contemporary Spanish folk singer Rosalia featuring longtime composer and multi-instrumentalist and producer Raul were free on pretty much every single track and this record was truly a hidden gem for me this year I went trolling through the internet looking for esoteric and obscure albums that I might have been interested or forgot about or wanted to return to this year just kind of checking to see hey should I review this do I need to review this is this something that I love and I'm gonna regret if I don't talk about it because it could end up on my year-end list I was also doing this in preparation for my 15 underappreciated albums of 2017 video which you should watch and I was filing through dozens and dozens and dozens of records and finally this one just stopped me in my friggin tracks I mean it was like a hard stop it was like a stop on a dime stop it was a stop I was just hit with this stunningly beautiful Spanish folk music with these fluttering nylon guitar strings being picked in such a wonderful way the dramatic strumming on this thing and the choice of chords I felt like I was listening to a moody progressive flamenco album the guitar on this thing is really the focal point of the background instrumentation very rarely are we getting any other piece of instrumentation but when we are maybe it's just like a little touch of strings some very calm cool gentle vocal harmonies on the song poem you put them to low passin we have this weird tape like a cassette tape fast-forwarding and rewinding sound effect going on in the background which creates a very odd texture and tension that I think adds quite a bit to the track so there's not a lot of instrumentation on this thing outside of guitar acoustic guitar and vocals but Raul and Rosalee are actually pretty dynamic performers in the first three tracks alone on this thing there is a large sea of difference in mood and style and tone you have be welcoming and the gentle and the gorgeous opening track on this thing which feels almost like a lullaby it's one of most beautiful songs on the entire record and eventually it morphs into this incredibly sad tune with these weepings string sections then you have the really dramatic and hard-hitting de plata which features these aggressive and very fastly strumming guitar chords this echo that is enveloping it's soaking the song it just resonates off of Rosalia's vocals which have this incredibly tight vibrato her vibrato is actually like acrobatic it is that tight it's that incredible it's that fast and with the speed and just the intensity with which she's singing it's like I'm listening to a call to prayer and the incredibly subtle no squid almost solely tous makes creative use of silence and volume to create tension and swells of emotion gorgeous gentle vocal harmonies at the finish of this thing and the guitar playing on this thing has this huge classical influence coming off of it so these shifts in style and emotion are here on this album it's just that they're not overt changes because the baseline instrumentation remains the same and it's not really something that needs to change because the performance is on this thing are so incredible they're so impeccable they're so versatile like for one there's the vocals which I haven't even gotten into yet Rosalia's voice is a stunner her range on this album her passion her youthful but very powerful tone her volume she just really rifts out these notes that just stay at this incredible peak of intensity for long periods of time with just like no variation in in in in in energy it's like her voice doesn't doesn't get weak it just has this incredible amount of power no matter what she's doing I don't mean to say she doesn't understand the power of restraint though she shows an incredible amount of restraint on numerous parts of this album which is when she hits you with those emotional with those high volume highs it just feels so great it feels so incredible it's so exciting the singing on this thing is so dynamic it is so raw which for me was really refreshing because it's rare that you get a female singer this talented who is is is recording an album that is this raw this intimate as you would typically expect the music industry to push someone like Rosalia into the overproduced world of pop music where her voice is obviously going to be doctored and doctored and doctored and then wrapped in a bunch of lifeless production one of the few alterations consistently made to Rosalia's voice on this record is just that she gets a splash of echo a splash of reverb which when that hits it's like her voice becomes this all-enveloping bullhorn sound that just fills my head she just has an incredible voice on this record one that if honed will only become more interesting with time as far as the song structures on this thing go it really is a range there are some tracks on this thing that are sort of long meditative cuts that are a little patience testing but they still come to a strong conclusion and then there are cuts on here that are more straightforward rootsy folk ballads with twanging guitar overdubs or really endearing vocal harmonies like tave and arrow or not yeehaw day at one Simon and then there are a handful of songs on this thing that are super short or maybe a little redundant and come to a somewhat inconclusive finish and then you have the lyrics on this record which obviously Spanish is not my first language so there was a language barrier to get acclimated to which I think for a lot of people is going to be kind of a hurdle with this record because the language of the album is a defining characteristic of one of the two major instruments on this album and my understanding of Spanish is super bassline and of course you're not just talking about Spanish words and sentences you're talking about literal poetry on this thing so of course you can't just literally transcribe every single word from Spanish into English and get the full translation because you're going to have metaphor you're going to have symbolism that you may be overlooking but generally the imagery that is conjured in the lyrics on this album is pretty mournful it's pretty dark a lot of direct connections between love and death or maybe even losing loved ones like on the song Catalina which is a bit of a musical revision of an older folk song from Manuel Vallejo and then there's another song on here which is literally about one brother going to wake up another brother at 2:00 a.m. to tell him that their mother died so again very mournful and a very morbid album to the music this thing is beautiful and it is inspiring but it is not a feel-good album that's for sure now strangely enough this entire album is topped off with a Bonnie Prince Billy cover of the song I see a darkness which is sung in English not one of my favorite tracks on the entire record because I think the guitar plane could have been a little bit more interesting I think the duo on this thing could have taken a little more liberties with the original song like they did with much of the source material that a lot of these songs are based off of because many of the tracks and the track listing here are not actually entirely original they are based off of older Spanish folk music song - which is really one of my favorite things about it that these artists are taking from something old lifting that to create something new which is in essence what folk song is all about folk music at its roots is kind of like a game of musical telephone passing down melodies and stories for generations which is a tradition that has kind of been lost in this age of popular music and contemporary copyright law so it's great to hear a new album that is quite literally keeping that tradition alive and doing it beautifully I'm thoroughly impressed by this album few tracks here and there I thought paled in comparison to others and obviously it would be interesting to hear Rosalia take advantage of more instrumentation maybe more guest musicians in the future but this is a very strong and well performed album and again total sonner for me I'm feeling a decent strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I over you next hit the like if you like please subscribe please don't cry over here next to my head is a folky album review that you can check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you

zjJ4L1GOrOA,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for my 60th Grammy Awards picks and predictions video I'm gonna go over most of the major fields that I am most curious about in this installment of the Grammy Awards and give you who I think will most likely walk away with the trophy and who I would like to walk away with the trophy the Grammy filled this year is looking pretty solid it's looking pretty good like the picks are better than the than usual I will say that much I'm pretty happy about that I feel like I'm not going to maybe be as disappointed this year as I was at the previous Grammy Awards however let's remember here the Grammys ultimately are not important when it comes to artistic integrity artistic ability and the longevity of a particular artists career in fact there have been countless grammy awards given out over the years to artists who are utterly irrelevant right now whose music and albums we barely remember and that is because the Grammys routinely and still to this day it has not changed are just an industry jackoff they are just a popularity contest however let's get wrapped up in the fund and pretend like it matters for a little bit and just just go through these picks so in the general field we have record of the year right here we have Childish Gambino's redbone des Paseo from Luis FONSI of course jay-z's the story of OJ humble from Kendrick Lamar and Bruno Mars 24 karat magic I honestly would not be unhappy with any of these songs walking away with this award even despedido which I know a lot of people out there may be a little negative toward it's AI I get it you may be annoyed with the song it's a little overplayed but I think it's actually a pretty landmark moment for Latin music but honestly the song that resonated with me the most the song that I thought had the most significant things to say had to be the story of OJ I think I would be most happy seeing that song walk away with the award however I love humble I think 24-karat magic is one of Bruno Mars's best songs and of course redbone is one of the most fantastic tracks and memes of the year so literally would not be unhappy with anybody walking away with this however I would probably give it to Childish Lewis or I would say Kendrick it's got to be one of those I could even see Bruno getting it because he would be a super safe super popular pick that everybody kind of likes and and that's another thing about Grammy picks they're typically very safe next the album of the year field we have the new childish gambino awaken my love jay-z's 444 Kendrick Lamar's damn melodrama Lord Bruno Mars 24 karat magic personally I would love to see either jay-z or Kendrick walk away with this wouldn't even mind seeing childish walk away with it I like the Lord album - I liked the Bruno Mars album as well though I wouldn't say that they were as good in comparison I certainly would love to see it go to Kendrick I would love to see it go to jay-z because they did both come out with really fantastic records and maybe if childish gets it he'll actually be incentivized to make some sort of return to music and continue down the very funky road that he kind of embarked on with awaken my love and while I do pick Kendrick and I do pick jay-z here I wouldn't be surprised to see it lean a little bit more toward Lord or Bruno or even childish now with the song of the year filled of course once again we have des besito we have 444 we have issues Benny Blanco we have the suicide hotline song from logic and we have of course Bruno Mars's that's what I like personally I would have to go with 444 though again jay-z I think he's the older pick I think he's the least trendy of the bunch and as a result I think he is less likely to win an award however he is kind of a legend in his own right and you may have more people voting for him just based on that so I'm not entirely sure as of this point but because jay-z's new album because his career isn't exactly at the highest point that it has been in the past I'm gonna say that it's likely to probably go to something more hyped Esposito probably the logic track maybe even that's what I like I would actually maybe even predict here that it would be despedido now with the Best New Artist category which is always weird because sometimes the artists that land in the Best New Artist category have actually been around a while which is certainly the case for who would be my pick here I would say I would love to see sizzle walk away just to see her walk away with an award though I know she's been nominated for numerous awards it would just be awesome to see her just walking down with numerous Grammys in her arms because she did come out a really good album however I wouldn't be surprised if this ended up going to little Aussie vert because he is just a little more hype right now Khaled and Elysia cara would also be super super super safe pics that i also would not be surprised by now as far as Best Pop solo performance I would have to say I would love to see Lady gaga walk away with this one because out of all of these tracks I think million reasons is the most solid song if not the Lady Gaga track then Kesha with praying that's probably the most passionate and anthemic ballad of the whole bunch I really cannot stand any of the other tracks from the other artists on here the Kelly Clarkson track the pink track the Ed Sheeran track however I wouldn't be surprised to see edge here and walk away with it just because of how huge of a single shape of you has been but still I'm kind of pulling for Gaga on this one for the Best Pop duo/group Performance I have to say I'm not really pulling for anybody in this category I mean maybe Portugal the man though I was not big on their new record at all I'm just gonna I'm just going to ignore this category number eight the Best Pop Vocal album four albums containing at least 51% playing time of new vocal pop recordings it's like it's like a really odd requirement and I love that the first Best Pop Vocal album in this list is an EP from Coldplay obviously not pulling for that one Lana Del Rey's for life the new imagine dragons the new Kesha the new Lady Gaga at Sheeran as well I would not be surprised to see this go to Coldplay or Ed Sheeran here personally just like one of the previous categories I'm pulling for Kesha and Lady Gaga I think they had the better records over here though I wouldn't be surprised to see imagine dragons walk away with it either though I guess they're not as popular as they used to be so probably not and honestly as much as I was a little disappointed with the new Lana Del Rey record like it wasn't quite the mature album that I've been looking for her to make it would be nice to see her walk away with something I feel like she's been making so many waves for such a long time she's had such a large impact on the pop music landscape like it or not that it would be nice to kind of finally see that acknowledged for the dance and electronic music section we have Best Dance Recording in this field I have to say that I am going to be pulling for the new gorillaz track with DRAM definitely one of the better tracks on the band's new album though I did find the record bland overall the rest of the field bonobo sure but obviously not that into the new LCD soundsystem odessa's new project was completely underwhelming to me I'm pulling for gorillas it's most likely going to be gorillas given the stature given the high-profile nature of the project however wouldn't be surprised to see LCD Soundsystem walk away with it I'm surprised we don't see any more hype tracks on here but I would like gorillas and I'm kind of predicting gorillas and Best Dance and electronic album gotta give a shout-out to Kraftwerk there I haven't even heard this I would just love to see craft work have a friggin Grammy that that would just that would just be great come on electronic music you owe them one getting into the rock section over here Best Rock performance we have leonard cohen's you want it darker Chris Cornell the Promised Foo Fighters Run chalo no good nothing more go to war personally would love to see Leonard Cohen walk away with it but I'm thinking it'll probably either him or Chris Cornell it's probably gonna be one of those pics where it's a posthumous Grammy you're gonna have lots of votes and lots of people pushing for it to go in that direction because they miss those artists and their feeling for those artists even though a lot of people seem to dig on the new Foo Fighters record I'm thinking that's where most of the sentiments for this award are gonna lie it's just kind of a matter of who's it going to go to is it going to be Cohen or Cornell and because Cornell passed away the most recently and because rock fans I think just have more of a soft spot for Cornell than they do Cohen who I think is just more of a singer/songwriter figure not typically thought of at the top of your head when you think rock music I think it'll most likely go to Cornell for Best Metal Performance it's really kind of no contest I'm pulling for Code Orange here their record was fantastic it's amazing to see them counted in this category and I'm really happy about it though it would be amazing to see body count walk away with a Grammy though I'm not predicting that that will be the case however I think Mastodon will probably walk away with it since they seem to be the most popular of all the bands and despite the fact that I just like their newest record it was kind of well received amongst some fans so for Best Rock song of the year we had Atlas rise of course from Metallica blood in the cut K Flay go to war from nothing more run Foo Fighters the stage Avenged Sevenfold personally I'm pulling for Metallica it's most likely going to be Metallica however I wouldn't be surprised to see Foo Fighters walk away with it I would be even surprised to see Avenged Sevenfold walk away with it as overblown and as awful as the stage was typically you know the most over raw rock songs win in this category and hoping for something just a little bit more raw you know like that Atlas rise song and Best Rock Album though I have heard all of these record I feel so not that invested in this category because I know better rock records have come out recently but you know of course we have the new Macedon record new Metallica record new nothing more new Queens of the Stone Age new war on drugs personally pulling for Queens of the Stone Age it would be interesting to see them walk away with a Grammy and I do think that that was probably the better record out of all of the ones listed here it's most likely going to be Mastodon or Metallica probably Metallica and alternative music album is also kind of no question for me I am pulling hard core for the new freaking pure comedy record from father John misty I love that album so much I actually wouldn't be surprised to see it go to father John misty Josh Tillman has been making a lot of waves this year he's been turning a lot of heads a lot of people in a lot of high places seem to be really enamored with his music and he seems kind of like an artist's artist I wouldn't be surprised if he hadn't up winning people over I would love to see him walk away with it I think he could walk away with it I think he has the potential to walk away with it the National I think are also a band that has a very similar appeal to a very similar crowd that Josh does they could be serious competition Arcade Fire is kind of a predictable and an easy pick as well as guerrillas because both of those artists are very popular however you know in the alternative category it can be kind of a toss-up LCD Soundsystem as much as I like them and I guess they do appeal to a crowd similar to that of father John misty and the National I just feel like they're kind of on the downturn right now as our guerrillas Arcade Fire which is kind of what is creating the X Factor here for father John misty and the National just kind of crossing my fingers for Josh josh Josh josh Josh Josh to my knowledge josh is also nominated in the packaging category which the packaging for peer comedy is amazing and I hope he wins on that as well it's really it's really good packaging in the R&B category you have some interesting pics we have Kalani's distraction we have Daniel's Caesar on get you we have Ledisi on hi Bruno Mars scissor the weekend personally pulling forces on this one do you love that Bruno Mars song quite a bit but I do think that track is one of my favorites off that noose as a record however wouldn't be surprised to see Daniel Caesar walk away with that he's been having a really good year as well as Kalani but I kind of predict Bruno Mars here would love deceases up but predicting Bruno Mars I think Bruno Mars he's been having a great year and I think he's gonna walk away with a lot a lot of a lot of awards and the best traditional R&B performance we had the baylor project laugh and move on childish game being a redbone who makes it into this category obviously based off the fact that his sound his style on his new record is a bit of a throwback Anthony Hamilton in the Hamiltons Ledisi and malli music with still I'm gonna go with childish gambino that's who I want to see take it and that's most likely he was going to take it in my opinion if not him Anthony Hamilton for Best R&B song I would also be pulling for Donald Glover would also predict Donald Glover I do like that says attract supermodel though I don't think it's one of her strongest and for the best urban contemporary album I'm gonna be pulling for scissor control and I'm gonna predict scissor control as well or maybe even the weekend actually maybe the weekend I think the weekend might get it still though pulling forces I do think control is the strongest out of this crop of records but the weakens been having a pretty good year he hasn't been nominated in too many categories on this thing and I think this may be his one opportunity to sort of nab an award I think star boy for the most part left a pretty positive impression on a lot of people so and in the Best R&B album category I like the Bruno Mars record it's probably gonna be the Bruno Mars record but I would actually love to see Daniel Cesar walk away with it for freudian it is a really solid album I would love to see Daniel grow and continue from here and I think it would really kind of get things off to a great start for him to just get a Grammy this early in his career now of course in the rap field we have best rap performance Big Sean bounced back I actually like that track quite a bit one of his best car DB bodek yellow jay-z 444 humble Kendrick Lamar bad and bougie migos and little Uzi vert this is a tough one I'm gonna knock out jay-z because again he's a legacy pick and I don't think he's going to get as many awards as he has nominations in in this year's Grammys as much as I do love 444 and I think it's it's one of his better projects moving on from there though I think it's gonna be one of these more hype tracks and there are some really hype ones on here I think we kind of maybe knock the Big Sean track back it's it's most likely not going to overshadow the other cuts here it really could go to cardi B because that is that really is like in a lot of ways the song of the year you can't really deny it and it's such a landmark record-breaking song in a lot of ways would love to see Kendrick walk away with it of course I think that is the best song here out of the probable picks but would not be surprised to see cardi B take it in fact it would be kind of cool to see cardi B take it wouldn't be surprised to see the migos take it away either because bad abou G that has also kind of been one of the most landmark rap songs of the year for the best rap and some performance I would have to say I'm also kind of pulling TDE on this one loyalty with Rihanna would not be disappointing though I don't think Kendrick is as interesting on that song as he is on other tracks I do like the Rihanna feature though I do love love galore with scissor and Travis Scott though would love to see either of those artists walk away with it I like family feud though I don't think it's the best song in the field over here I do not enjoy that goldlink song at all and I kind of think Black is an industry plan honestly I'm gonna predict it's gonna be Kendrick or Sousa on this one for the best rap song we have cardi B with bodek yellow we have Danger Mouse and run the jewels and Big Boi with chase me enough run the trolls landed in here Kendrick Lamar humble sassy with Rhapsody which is actually pretty fantastic the story of oj with jay-z there are so many personal favorites in here in this best rap song category we would love to see Danger Mouse and run the jewels walking away with a freaking Grammy would love to see Rhapsody walk away with the Grammy because I think her record has been one of the more underappreciated rap albums of the year like people who are in the know love that record and appreciate that record and she has had a lot of praise it has had a lot of reviews it's it's not obscure album but I feel like there are a lot of people sleeping on the record a little bit not celebrating it quite as much as they possibly could or I feel like the celebration the praise it's a little phoned in you know what I mean it's a little phoned in people are kind of praising it I feel like because maybe they feel like they should not because they're actually appreciating what she's saying and what she's trying to do on the album that's just my personal opinion though would love to see her walk away or the Grammy though however I'm just gonna say that it's it's most likely gonna be one of the more hype tracks on here probably boudic probably humble and for the best rap album of the year we have jay-z with 444 Kendrick with damn culture migos Rhapsody maila's wisdom flower boy Tyler the Creator I'm actually pulling for Rhapsody and Tyler on this one I think they came out with more solid records I think they came out with the best records in this whole bunch I'm just pulling for them however I think Kendra's gonna walk away with it I think now that Kendrick has just become such an accepted force in the music industry and he's become so beloved across cultural and genre boundaries that he's most likely gonna be walking away with a ton of freaking awards this Grammy session if he walks away with album of the year he's probably gonna walk away with the wrapped album of the year too you know maybe that might change maybe but most likely not but still though pulling for Rhapsody pulling for Tyler wait there's a best album notes category like how do you determine that how do you determine has the the best notes and one more section that I want to shout out is the production non-classical section where we actually have a nod to no shape from perfume genius that album as I noted in my review is one of the most excellently and gorgeously produced in engineered albums of the year that album sounds wonderful that album sounds lavish in orgasmic actually that new Roger Waters album is pretty impeccably produced as well but even more so the perfume genius I am pulling for Mike all the way in that category and I think it may go to Roger I think it may go to Bruno but I am pulling so hard for Mike and that is going to be it guys those are essentially my picks and predictions for the Grammys this year thank you for watching hopefully you guys got something out of this video let me know who you're crossing your fingers for at this year's Grammys who do you thinks gonna walk down the carpet holding a bunch of Grammys like babies and yeah I'll see you in the next one over here next to my head is my video for the previous Grammys the 59th annual Grammys and that'll be it see you on the next one transition have you given the Grammys a listen did you love him - je t'aime what would you rate them but well I don't I don't even know why I'm doing this on even though I'm here forever 
OKYedko0w8Y,hi everyone no finnish ain't a no here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Hopson album no shame Hopson is a California rapper known for his eccentric look his fast flow cartoony music videos and preachy lyrics Hobson's breakout into the hip-hop limelight was a kind of confrontational one with the fourth installment of his ill mind of Hopsin series this wordy rap diatribe took a whack at a series of weird characters as well as Tyler the Creator in this 1999 Eminem flow that Hopson still rocks to this day and I feel like there was a grace period between 2011 and when Hobson's next album would come out pound syndrome in 2013 where he had some serious artistic potential but unfortunately Hopson has spent the better part of this decade recording some of the tackiest rap imaginable very high on skill but low on perspective especially as he tries to impart his holier-than-thou advice on to his fans like a bossy cult leader who thinks he knows better than everybody else as to how to run their lives but consistently in his own music he reveals that he barely knows how to run his own this decade so far for Hopson has been full of memes full of drama to his most infamous quotables to his falling-out with the funk volume label and being arrested in and banned from Australia last year which a great deal of this new album over here revolves around not that I knew that going into the album because some of the teaser tracks to this thing were pretty general had nothing really to do with no shames semi core narrative you have the aggressive trunk knocking production very slick fast flows and kind of clever fun wordplay on the track the purge probably the first time I've been genuinely impressed by a Hobson's single in a long time and then we had the equally exciting witch doctor which was full of like very primal drum circle style hand percussion lots of horror movie style piano phrases and equally interesting lyricism however I can't say my expectations for this album were that high given the release of the single and music video for the track happy ending which is literally a rap song about getting laid at Asian massage parlor chock-full of stereotypical Asian woman speaking in broken English impressions woven throughout hopson's versus talking about given sucky sucky and fucky-fucky no I'm not joking it's like the most racist ass shit I've heard all year and I don't know what the target audience is for a rap song where a grown man goes into his sexual exploits with the excruciating pictorial detail of like a hardcore porn a real virgin this olive oil is extra virgin it's my favorite is it weird that Hobson feels the most at liberty to rap about his sexual abilities on this album when he's having sex with someone he's paying to have sex with which also happens on the track money on the side I mean it's pretty much like performing to a captive audience all criticisms of these tracks and Hobson's corniness aside some of his best songs of this decade do land on though shame there are some quality cuts on here with solid production listenable or even catchy hooks some clever wordplay and maybe even a compelling backstory like the very catchy and braggadocious twisted or the song right here where essentially we see the seed of hip-hop planted into hopson's head which grew into this passion that he's turned into his career love him or hate him Hopson has turned his independent hustle into a huge career and kind of formed a lane for himself that nobody can really take away from him on the song panorama city we get a younger Hopson kind of growing up as a misfit kid in his home town set to a nice g-funk instrumental and the song I wouldn't do that or I wouldn't do that is more than listenable to the problem is the tracks that I think are decent on this thing only make up a fraction of this album 73 minute runtime and to get to all these tracks I had to sit through numerous cuts about Hobson's personal petty drama and his complete inability to reflect on his problems to reflect on his life choices in a meaningful and an introspective way for somebody who routinely finds himself in crappy situations it never seems to dawn on Hopson in song that may be what he's dealing with has something to do with him his attitude his is decision-making case-in-point there is a song on this thing titled all your fault where he's essentially rapping about the girl who he had a falling-out with in Australia as well as the people at his former label which he fails screwed over by now according to Hopson she says that he beat her to the police which he claims as a false allegation and this track is supposed to be his side of the story this track is supposed to be him setting the record straight but even in his version of events he doesn't completely come out looking like he's the good actor here like he admits to getting physical with her and physically intimidating her on the track which given the current social climate of things why he saw reason to release this song well I mean whatever he came out with the fucking happy ending song so the his tone deafness really kind of knows no bounds he clearly wants audience members to listen to this track hear his story sympathize with him feel bad for him but yet when he comes through with the ill mind of Hopsin part 9 which is supposed to be this wrapped letter to his son who he now can't see because he's not allowed in Australia but even this potentially sweet and meaningful moment he turns into this really bitter and petty shot against this woman who he says screwed him over he really kind of has this mm complex like he needs a woman to screw him over he needs a woman to hate in his music he needs a woman to hate to sort of complete him as an artist with a tragic backstory like the whole part on the opening track when he just breaks down crying saying oh no my girlfriend she's do it suppose shit because apparently it's it's revealed to him that she works at a strip club which sure you know that that would probably be really upsetting and surprising to a lot of guys if they didn't know that earlier when I guess they were prepared to marry this person and have a kid with this person but they're like a million and one more logical options one could take from learning this information after this point you're a rapper with millions of dollars you can just take this person out of the scenario and just pay their way and bring them to America you could just break the relationship off from there and just shared joint custody of the kid there is just so little room on this album for self-critique that it's it's it's kind of gross there is the song I must be on something which is a moment where Hopson kind of attacks his mental illnesses his emotional imbalances but it only seems like he presents us this song in an effort to create this man versus man scenario it's not like he takes this knowledge and applies it to anything that happens to him in the outside world we get a small whiff of that though on one of the final tracks of this thing Marcus's Gospel which is this very downtrodden very sad gospel flavored track where it's it's almost like a spoken word cut in a way but this song while I do think it has quite a bit of emotional meaning for Marcus it's kind of just like a shred of true self-reflection in this sea of narcissism but honestly for most listeners this spot will most likely slip by totally unnoticed or at least overshadowed by like black sheep for example which there's a lyrical moment here which gives into a teenage frustration fantasy of Hopson shooting up his old high school because he was bullied there while there are certainly some slight musical improvements here and there in the production and the songwriting and the choruses on this thing this record is just as gross as most hops and albums it is incredibly self-serving it is again super narcissistic and a total turnoff for me I'm feeling a light too decent seven on this thing oh fuck light too decent seven what am I on crack I meant to say a light decent for Thank You Ally too

T0TP8Ts__sQ,ah hi everyone miss in the out-tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and in this video I'm gonna be listing out what I felt were 15 of the most underappreciated underrated albums of 2017 a list of records that I thought were special unique interesting enjoyable and didn't quite get the praise didn't quite get the positive reviews didn't quite get the warm reception that I hoped that they would some of these records didn't even really get that much praise from yours truly because I might have even kind of missed out on them I'm hoping to kind of remedy that problem before the year is completely over but given the relative silence on a lot of these albums I'm not expecting that to change anytime soon hence this list exists ever since this album dropped I cannot say enough nice things about it uncommon asses written at night is easily one of the best conceptual and intriguing and dark and kind of tortured mentally hip-hop records that I've heard this year it is deeply political creatively produced it's got that grimy lo-fi experimental abstract New York sound the feature list on this thing is fantastic and uncommon NASA really kind of guides them into the lyrical concepts of a lot of these tracks so they add to the narrative of the concept of the album I can see why this album isn't gonna resonate with everybody it's a little odd it's a little left-field it's a little fringe it's a little off the beaten path but if you consider yourself a fan of lyrical hip-hop of experimental hip-hop of hip-hop that challenges more than a panders then please listen to this record I could definitely see why this new Oxbow record is not resonating with everybody instantaneously it doesn't quite have the sound of a lot of the Bands classical material plus on top of it it is a difficult record to kind of wrap your mind around I myself took a while to kind of warm up to it even though I wasn't really sure as to how I felt about it 100% when I initially heard the thing I knew there was something kind of weird and intriguing about it that I needed to revisit there there's definitely something to the lavish and wonderful and dead string sections on this thing the very steady grooves the awesome guitar tone on this thing dynamic playing and of course on top of that you have Eugene Robinson's vocal performances which are incredible like dude stylistically is all over the place these hushed whispers the aggression the animated character and vibe to his voice like he's a man of a thousand voices on this thing he's just hard to pin down and every performance that he delivers on a track is dramatic is compelling is creepy is frightening is primal is theatrical I know it's a bit of a slow burner and it isn't going to necessarily pop out at a lot of listeners at first but if you give this album patience I promise that it does give back in dividends given the title of this project and just how bold the album cover is um kind of surprised that I just let this slip by me entirely but this is a loud crazy abrasive insane and totally over the top and like gargantuan experimental industrial record with just like so much pent-up rage and animalistic ferocity that I don't know man I'm kind of in awe of the vibe of it I still feel like I don't 100% know as to whether or not I love or just kind of have generally positive feelings toward this thing but it is it is kind of nutso and that about it I do we admire this angles 9 album to my ears has been one of the most colorful and direct and creative experimental jazz albums I've heard in a while like there's something really odd about it yet simultaneously like it's it was kind of a breeze to listen to I haven't quite put my finger on what exactly kind of makes it seem so experimental yet so easy to just kind of take that boldness in and enjoy it like it didn't come off to me as being like super perplexing or anything yeah it's it's it's something I still need to kind of get more acclimated to myself and I definitely do want to do a review of this thing but if you are a jazz fan and you are looking for some jazz that is not you know your average jazz record please do give this thing a shot Alex Camryn's forced witness is easily one of the most fun pop records I've heard this year like goddamn this dude his lyrics are absolutely hilarious and I think in a lot of ways now that I've had more time to kind of take in the entirety of the record it really kind of gets down to the hilarity and the flaws of masculinity as kind of a concept or a social norm a lot of the time the character that he plays on this record comes off like a lovable and a hilarious creep so there's a strong lyrical and narrative component it's like a long ongoing character portrait the Alex is pulling together on this record but that's just kind of the the the the verbal side of things on this record the production has this wonderful splashy catchy like 80's synthpop soft rock vibe to it that is incredibly infectious I mean obviously the aesthetic is fun the aesthetic is a little gimmicky it's sweet it's a tried-and-true sound and it's pulled together well I wish there was more guitar in the mix but still it's it's pulled together well ultimately though it's the songwriting that really sells the the fact that the hooks on this thing really pop the little instrumental Editions on this thing like all the saxophone are pulled off with an incredible amount of finesse and it's just a record that has a ton of character if you want to hear a pop record with an old-school vibe and a sharp eye for social satire and a good sense of humor give this thing a shot one of DFA records best releases in a while this new guerrilla toss record is unfortunately going a little overlooked this year in my opinion the band has taken a while to really kind of appeal to me personally I've always thought that their recordings were just a little bit too brittle meanwhile their performances and songwriting style while freakish and very colorful we're just maybe too frantic and unkempt but I feel like the band has finally channeled that oddity and that freakish side to their character into a series of tracks that are well performed very steady danceable grooved out perfectly celebrate the weirder side of post punk and new wave and dance music in the 1980s I'm hoping they stick with this sound progress it do more with it in the future and that this record is just the tip of the iceberg of the Bands potential past this point Algiers man like one of the most interesting fusions of stylistic influences I've heard in a rock band in a while and even more so on this new record like their elements of hip hop of gospel and soul of blues of post-punk and punk rock and goth rock on this new album over here and they're all blended so well and add on top of that that there's also this incredibly bold and in-your-face and revolutionary political element to the lyrics I III just don't get why this band isn't resonating with more people I mean maybe it's not the right time maybe people really don't want politics in their music as much as they want them in their Twitter feed I don't know for whatever reason it's unfortunate the Algiers aren't turning more heads especially since I hear so much raw talent in what the band is doing from a technical perspective to the singing the performances the production it's just kind of confusing because I feel like in 2017 we need a band like Algiers and there are a lot of people out there who could probably use a band like Algiers and yet the their new album is just kind of falling out a lot of deaf ears I present to you one of the funkiest albums of 2017 this new god damn Bibby of Sound Machine album this group is fusing elements of New Wave and funk and post-punk with afro beat music and electro and the the sound the end result is just so fun and incredible the production the songwriting the singing everything that I thought that was great about the band's debut record is just improved so much more on this new album in and has just grown into this colorful kaleidoscopic amazing heart pumping multicultural display of what makes modern music so great listen to it listen to it listen to it listen to it listen to it yeah quale chris has a weird rap style that is not for everybody it's true it's very a subtle and as white that's how I want amber to it however I do think a lot of what he's saying on this record is interesting I think this is one of his most thoughtful albums so far it's a very introspective rap record this is this is the kind of rap album that I feel like it's it's really kind of like you facing a mirror at yourself and if you don't like introspective music if you don't like music that sort of causes you to look inward and face yourself then you're probably not gonna like this album but for listeners who like abstract hip-hop who are pretty patient with their rap music and do like music that kind of challenges them on that personal level then I think this record is certainly for you I think this record is certainly worth your time and I think there are a lot of people out there who most certainly would get something out of a record like this but maybe this album just does not reach them for whatever reason and if anything I've just said makes sense or appeals to you give this thing a shot I have not given this motorcycle album a fair shot even though it seems like one of the most epic rock records of the year it's 90 minutes and it seems loaded from front to back with this good hard rocking and kind of blissful psychedelic rock and stoner rock the band's been at it for years and years and years at this point they sound pretty good for how long they've been at it for the length of this record like I feel like being at this stage in their career and dropping an album at this length could have gone very very very wrong and this record seems pretty pleasing to older fans however I think it's newcomers that are kind of missing out a little bit even I myself took a while to kind of get this album in to my ears which I did only after the recommendation of somebody in an email I'm not exactly sure if I'm gonna have the time between now and list week to fit it into my schedule but I am glad I am aware and have heard at least a great deal of the album to kind of recommend it in this video shout out to Drag City for coming out with this experimental weird freaky and beautiful Fulk record but this is just one of those records in one of those discographies that comes from an artist or a group who's been releasing music for a while you never quite cared for them but then all of a sudden new record drops kind of a different mood ear and I don't know more avant-garde sound in a way and for whatever reason it just clicks it's just compelling I would say the the heart of this album lies in its very skeletal and simple folk instrumentation and the hauntingly strange lead vocals that are laying onto every single track here which even if this doesn't end up being one of my favorite records of the year will probably leave a bit of an imprint on me for the foreseeable future and if you want this folk record to haunt you too then give it a shot oh my god oh my god I have to review this I cannot not review this this has to get reviewed this is like one of the most beautiful things I've heard all year what the hell what the hell guys seriously what the hell this is like this it visit what what what this is what what what rest and peace to Sean price listen to this goddamn posthumous album one of the Crimea snoods to ever do it listen to it shoutout to southern lord for putting out this new unsane album I'm kind of saddened that this record didn't get more hype this year I didn't even get a recommendation for this record this year I don't recall like in my comments and my social media I mean it's probably there somewhere but really like the requests for this must have just completely just vanished or just been so few and far between I didn't even notice that this album came out but even though in a lot of ways this does sound like nearly every other album from these noise Rock veterans this is one of the slowest and sludgy ax stand heaviest records the band has ever released so you can't really say the band isn't trying anything new on this record or that they aren't you know venturing out or doing something a little different and just recommending this to make sure that people out there who are also interested in unsane don't let this album slip by them and finally this record from this death metal band that I've only recently become aware of suffering our is like 39 minutes of some of the most exciting death metal black metal fusion that I've heard in a while it's so low fie and grimy and dirty and nasty but the performances are incredibly tight and propulsive and adrenaline pumping but really it's it's the guitar work on this thing that kind of sells the album like there's so much raw talent in the guitar playing on this thing and not only is it very technical and occasionally very flashy but also like some of the ideas that the guitarist pulls off on this thing are really noisy and wild and experimental and crazy and it just adds so much flavor and character to otherwise very dingy and dark and decrepit music like obviously in these genres of music that's that's kind of something that you want but the guitar playing and just again the wild and weird totally unexpected experiments just add that extra bit of oomph that extra little bit of flair that kind of just just puts puts more gas on the flame and that's it those have been fifteen albums that I think have been vastly underappreciated and underrated this year thank you for watching the reviews that I have done for some of these albums will be linked down there below for the ones that I have not reviewed yet hopefully again that happens some time between now and the end of the year fingers crossed and I will see you guys in the next video transition have you given these albums listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment in the comments if you are angry okay which I don't see why you would be you're getting music recommendations just just get recommended music and listen to it and enjoy it okay over here next to my head is

ikquXWiyaj8,hi everyone painting poetry anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new Bjork album utopia this is the latest full-length album from Iceland's owned Bjork her ninth studio record following up her 2015 album volnek Kira a bit of backstory on this record back in August Bjork described what was this forthcoming album at the time as her tender album a description that at the time felt more confusing than enlightening but now that I have a firmer grasp of the lyrical themes of the album it seems like Bjork is writing the emotional antithesis to her last full-length album essentially a breakup album where Bjork went into great detail about the build-up to an aftermath of the breakup of this romantic relationship that Bjork had forged in the early 2000s this kind of causing her to reference back aesthetically in a way to her 2001 album Vespertine with lots of dense and lavish layers of strings which brings us to the yen to volnek euros yang utopia now while utopia does have its moments of emotional anguish it is nowhere near as dark and as depressing as its predecessor it's quite the opposite most of the time a lot of the instrumentation on this thing is light its Airy it's bursting with color especially given that a bulk of the Arrangements on this album are handled by a fluke chorus a chorus of flutes which of course are backed by all these field recordings of birds that sound like their chirping away in a mystical forest on the production and even the musical side of things we have Bjork working very closely with ARCA once again which is pretty interesting considering that I think this is the most consistently she's worked with a single producer since like Mark Bell or Nelly Hooper in like the earlier days of her career now the lyrical themes of this album are of course a bit of a reversal as well this being Bjork Stender record Bjork's words don't seem quite as methodically organized and chosen here rather it seems like she's kind of throwing caution to the wind and just firing out all of these feelings of love and hate and infatuation out there with almost no filter considering this lyrics like on that of blissing me which is a track where Bjork can be heard unapologetically crushing on a new love interest firing text messages and mp3's back-and-forth with someone who she has in mind on this track it just makes a lot more sense all of these thoughts on sex and romance and the dynamics of men and women they're all very off-the-cuff and that's for better or for worse I think Bjork's newfound artistic freedom and the overall lack of boundaries on this record does lead to more interesting moments than not like the crashing explosions of auditory color that kicks the entire record off B song a rise in my senses a track that I wish was pared down a little bit honestly it could have been more dazzling as a more brief introduction but still the very bright sound of the track does kick the tone of the album off very well and we also have the very beautiful and ominous the gate which in my opinion is the musical equivalent to interdimensional travel I just kind of feel like I'm slowly being pulled into what I I don't know as I'm listening to this song it's all just very otherworldly with Bjork's beckoning vocals and the very strange warped samples orbiting a lot of this music all these really eerie distant kind of sparse tones the bold swells of Floop here and there and the track utopia and nearly every cut following it makes me feel like I'm listening to a majestic space opera being performed in like an exotic bird sanctuary which is kind of the core aesthetic of the record it does take a while for it to really kind of kick in and get into full swing but once it does it's like oh now truth be told a lot of these Bjork tracks don't have the clearest and boldest of structures to them a lot of them are quite meditative which occasionally leads to moments that come off a bit breezy these kind of chirpy interludes that I think pad the album more than they add and I think there are some cuts on this thing that fade out in a somewhat inconclusive way namely the title track here however there are plenty of very bold and very vast songs to follow the song body memory is this wonderful amazing and like mind-bending nine-minute lyrical odyssey that takes sexuality and lovemaking into the metaphysical the track is as erotic as it is epic considering all the dramatic musical arrangements all of the primal beats sequencing and lots of samples of like a big cat growling Bjork takes things from physical memories to emotional memories on the next track features creatures where she essentially sees somebody who has character traits similar to that of her ex-lover and it takes her back to a time in her head emotionally where she's still in love with this person it's like she's been transported back to a time before this betrayal even occurred the song courtship features some of the most nimble flew arrangements on the entire record very beautiful the cut also features some of my favorite beats sequencing on the entire thing I love the tambour of the percussion on this track it has this kind of light sputtering sort of acoustic feel to it it's an amazing pairing between Bjork's vocals and the atmospheric and huge flue arrangements to these subtle yet very dense percussion and the lyrics on this track I found particularly interesting because they sort of explored the cold sting of rejection and the and the bliss of attraction and the flue arrangements on st. are freakin godly where the album really falters for me is on the production side of the cuts loss and Sumi where the very loud suffocating mix on the beats as well as the distortion on them as well kind of fails to respect the beauty and the space of Bjork's voice and the flute arrangements it's pretty tolerable on loss but on Sumi it turns borderline hideous especially when one gets down to the narrative component of the song which reads like a very gruesome lashing out against Bjork's xMAP Barney for suing her over joint custody of their daughter the song talking about sins of the fathers and bloodlines it's packed with all this really vague all-encompassing terminology which comes off like vaguely sexist despite what she describes as Barney cheating and leading a double life and basically betraying their family and the tract personally I went through my parents divorcing at a very young age and it can be really weird and kind of confusing to hear two people who you know made you out of mutual affection say the worst things in the world about each other over the course of your lifetime that incredible sense of loss and betrayal can really light an undying flame of anger that defies all objectivity and civility and sometimes that anger and vitriol coming from both sides can be gendered and personally I'm willing to assume that that's partially what is fueling this right here whether Bjork is willing to admit it or not as a fan it kind of sucks to see her succumb to that a little bit on this track however I feel like if this album is anything it's an admission that Bjork is just as human as the rest of us while I don't think some of the feelings and sentiments on this track are the best of looks I do think it adds to the unfiltered approach that Bjork is taking on this record whether that be unfiltered affection or unfiltered bitterness all things consider though I do give the track points for being incredibly intense the last thing I would probably ding this album on is its length utopia is far and away Bjork's longest record to date at 70 plus minutes and while I haven't really shied away from albums around this length in the past I feel like this is one of those instances where if the record had just been pared down a bit its impact would have been so much greater some cuts could have been reeled in some cuts could have been left out altogether some cuts could have just used a bit more structure while this record will certainly sit in a unique place in Bjork's discography and it is one of her most revealing albums ever it is also one of her most bloated and unkempt - but to start tearing things out of it could have sacrificed the raw emotional feel of the album so I guess you kind of take the rough with the smooth on that one I would say this album is yet another pretty bold addition to the Bjork discography not one of my favorites of hers but certainly one of her betters I'm feeling a light - decent 7 on this thing transition at beginning this album a listen as you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next if the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave an insightful comment in the comments if you're feeling insightful there's another björk review next to my head over here that you

PZs-si-SE1c,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for another installment of the wino review where I go over a series of records that I did not get a chance to do a formal review of so I'm reviewing them goblets style one after the next and you guys know the segment you guys have watched it before let's just get straight into it no BS no further ado Tran pretty decent ambient album from video on this one the textures aren't really evocative and it's pretty minimal not a whole lot of density not a whole lot of harmony but what few sounds do show up on this thing I think are very eerie very ghostly very pretty it's it's nice in the background as a lot of good ambient music is but I wouldn't say it really pulled me in that could have been videos intentions so if you're looking for an ambient record with a little bit of a sad eerie note to it give the signal listen I'm typically pretty into John Mouse however in this instance this record to me just sounded like like a like a sort of uninspired version of the new Ariel pink album I just don't know where that came from I expect a job to kind of go in his totally own different direction because he is a he is a unique artist but for whatever reason he just sounds so much like this really weird version of his fellow tour mate and contemporary on this thing I don't know how to take it I don't know why and I just have no feelings on this record no feelings Mack Fabrice can come through once again third record over here with an album that is a nice healthy combination of punk rock a little bit of reverb II and very Spacey like twee rock you know and then sort of dreamy pop and rock from like the Glasgow scene though they're not from Glasgow it's just got kind of that you know that dream poppy cat6 type of sound to it it's nice it's sweet on the ears it's very energetic at points gets me a little whipped up though I wouldn't say it really kind of stands out stylistically from anything the band has done up until this point sure it's it's a little better recorded than their debut record but it's pretty much on par with their last album it's just kind of more of the same and I was hoping the band is sort of taken above and beyond with this record sort of like the band always did with their new album but it's just just kind of just kind of more the same which is okay but that just means it's it's okay please don't run for Senate please don't run for Senate please don't run for Senate please don't run for Senate okay I wanted to like this vault-tec album I really did I really did and I love jazz I love soul I love funk and a lot of the guest artists on this thing make the album pretty good though there are a few kitschy tracks here and there on the record but it's so it's so so it's so mild it doesn't get my hips gyrating and that's that's kind of what I want out of this style of music it's just so in the yellow this Australian band has a nice noisy intense chaotic sound a little bit of a metalcore grindcore vibe on their last album that really got me all whipped up loved that record gave it a very positive review however there's a new album over here much more brittle in comparison a little more chaotic and not in the best way it seems like a little less meticulously and a little less well put together a little less muscular in terms of the performance it's just not caring for how treadley it all is but if you're looking for some nice noisy and frantic spazzy extreme rock music from Down Under give these guys a listen Jesus Christ if there's one thing that can take the the libido out of your band it's it's signing to fueled by ramen that's that's the conclusion we can come to hear it's two and a half hours i I never listening to this no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah I know I've been kind of hard on yellow Wolf's music in the past but I gotta be honest I gotta be fair I got to be serious here this is like one of his better projects like it is not the super commercial super sugary overproduced record that radioactive was nor is the ham-fisted series of country tunes that his last album was to me this seems like the trunk Muzik era yellow wolf but just a little more mature with some more ballads woven in that are actually pretty well put together and i wish this was the follow-up to that album i wish this is the he had been coming out with all along this decade I think his career would have stayed high had this been sort of the focused effort that he dropped early on it's it's just a shame I haven't gotten too many requests or a lot of interest on this album from a lot of people watching the show because it's it's a pretty good album it's got some good qualities too I'm not saying it's amazing it hasn't made yellow wolf one of my favorite artist of the year obviously but I think there are a lot of good qualities about this album not so many moments that are making me there just kind of like wince and pull away I mean even the country flavor tracked with the super speedy tempo featuring Travis Barker and Juicy J pretty good like pretty good and actually like a pretty successful experiment given the collaborators given the musical style given yellow Wolf's flow on that track just all around a lot of good things about this record a record that excuse me I think hardcore fans can be proud of I think Yelawolf can be proud of and honestly I think yellow wolf curious listeners or people who have sort of expected more from him all along and didn't quite get it this is an album that you could you could seriously try out and and I think you'd get a lot more out of it than is a couple past couple efforts I didn't know he had it in a machine girl dropped a pretty good digital hardcore album on this on this project over here it's a little one-dimensional some of the lyrics are slightly cringe and the production is a little too brittle for my ear sometimes but it is aggressive it is very complex at times like the rhythms are insane and it's got a great energy Death Grips fans take notice old-school digital hardcore fans take notice because this thing is it's like a Viper it'll bite yeah I'm not listening to this boring ass Billy Corgan record I'm not David Firth from from freaking salad fingers Fame experimental ambient record brain feeder records listen to it one of my favorite recent noise industrial experimental rock projects Street sects out with a new EP it's out now on Flynn sir and this is not quite as aggressive and as abrasive as their end a position album that I loved so much that they dropped it's a little Spacey er a little darker it's kind of a more reverb II and downtrodden and a depressing style of industrial it's a little roughly recorded not quite as meticulously crafted as the debut album but I do kind of like this mood I do like this direction and I hope the band explores it more in the future with more hard-hitting tunes and just just some some better recording quality that's all I like it I recommend it try it out listen to the band's debut record please it's it's so good it's it's a hell and a half have you given

VaiMDDi8NJc,hey everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sharon Jones in the dap-kings record soul of a woman soul of a woman is the seventh and final album from Miss Sharon Jones and her dap-kings a soul revival band who has come out with some incredible music over the years I would recommend albums like 100 days 100 nights naturally for me however the band started to slowly get more and more predictable especially on their last album of original and non holiday oriented music give the people what they want however I can appreciate the band's long-term adherence to this mission that they have to just kind of revitalize this classic soul sound now the reason this is the band's final album is this record is also a posthumous one because unfortunately we lost Sharon Jones after a series of pretty rough cancer diagnoses and a set of strokes that came along the same time as the 2016 US presidential election with all of this personal chaos with all the touring going on in Sharon and her band's life I just wonder when they found the time to put this record together but they did and it's actually 11 of the best tracks the band has laid to tape and a very powerful last hurrah to a pretty fantastic career instrumentally aesthetically Sharon and her band on this thing aren't really changing things up too much of course what you see is what you get listeners who have heard the band's music in the past will surely know what to expect going into this one and even the album cover itself looks like a glamorous throwback to the late 60s early 70s this album is full of tight cohesive performances that take full advantage of the dap-kings dynamic instrumental range the guitar work the backup singers the fantastic groovy drumming the horn section the occasional shot of strings just to sort of give things a bit of a dramatic flair the production of course has this old-school anachronistic sheen on it something that sounds 50 years older than it actually is throwing it back of course to artists like James Brown I can Tina Turner Otis Redding Marvin Gaye Aretha Franklin countless Motown artists on the soul side of things there aren't too many instrumental surprises on this album to report but certainly highlights like the funky shuffling drums and bass on the track matter of time the splash of echo on Sharon's vocals on just give me your time which I think thins out Sharon's voice a little too much for my taste though I'm sure most listeners will appreciate the change of pace and while I'm complaining I think some of the background vocals on the track when I saw your face are just a tad awkward it seemed to sort of float above the track and a kind of disconnected way and on top of that the the the melody is just a little sour still though I love the romping groove and the bongos on the track rumours it gives the track a lot of character and the kind of psychedelic rush of strings on the track girl you've got to forgive him and of course there's also the slow swaying gorgeous gospel direction taken on the final cut of the album - what really sells the album for me though it really makes it stand out against other records and the band's discography that I think are merely ok is just the quality of the songwriting whether it be sharing sort of looking forward to a better world on the opening track a matter of time or searching for a new day or the personal motivation hantum on the track come be a winner which is essentially about trying to better oneself in an unfair world the track almost feels like it was written with a mother's love or something it's really gentle it's assuring it's encouraging an angle not often heard in a lot of music in 2017 and Sharon singing and her asking for help from God on the closing track here was a kind of near religious experience for me of course there are also loads of songs on this thing that are about love and heartbreak has to be expected on a dap-kings record I love how sassy and playful the attitude of the song rumours is despite the fact that the song is essentially about kind of calling out your lover after you think they're doing things they're not supposed to be behind your back the incredibly depressing pass me by is about separating and painfully so and the song these tears is another one of the more instrumentally lavish tracks on the entire record with tons of strings laced into the instrumental and it's so bitter it's so passionate it's gorgeous as well and just tugs at those heartstrings and the way that great soul music does this album is just full of hope it's full of positivity it's full of love it's full of raw emotion it's full of great instrumental arrangements and performances it's just one of those records where it actually kind of makes my job a little easy because it just sells itself and everything that's fantastic about it is just so on the surface you don't need to dig too deeply for it though that's not to say that there aren't interesting intricate details of this album that you can certainly eat up and peel back like an onion as you listen to it again and again and again definitely the case obviously the tracks don't arc over in a huge ambitious thematic way the songs kind of function as just a very quality high quality collection of tracks all with their own story their own flavor their own instrumental personality but still this is a great very well-written no BS no frills soul record that rounds out at about 30 minutes one killer track after the next and it's just beautiful that Sharon and her band were able to kind of end things on a high note I'm feeling a decent two strong eight on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it here the best you're the best what should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry over here next to my head is another review that you should check out please do or click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next one forever forever forever forever forever

YABApZSuUIA,okay camera lights album where's my oh are you looking for this I know you were looking for this you're not gonna do my boy Jaden like that you're not gonna do it to my boy Jaden Anthony he's a good rap man he's got good raps huh oh you got them hi everyone come on us seriously here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review and the new Jaden Smith album sire this is the breakout project from heir to the Smith family fortune Jaden Smith no but seriously though Jaden Smith is an actor a rapper and embarrassing tweet writer and son of megastar Will Smith and he's been hinting at jumping into the rap game for years now dropping every once in a while a new single a new EP a new mixtape stuff that was sort of listenable but not really worth taking SuperDuper seriously and I get it I understand why everybody wants to be a rapper right now but also simultaneously Jaden is following in the footsteps of his father becoming an entertainment industry jack-of-all-trades however I'm willing to bet that Jains musical career is probably going to be less significant than his father's was and don't get me wrong I can go back to songs like summertime and parents just don't understand even getting jiggy with it and they're pretty great pop rap tracks but you know even Will Smith will tell you that he was not writing music that was as essential as Public Enemy or nas he accepted that Lane as an entertainer and that's kind of been the key to his long-lasting success not trying to be something that he isn't Jaden however has somehow gotten the impression that he's deep which is an attitude that comes through pretty plainly in his music especially as he's so desperately trying to convince the audience that he's an icon before actually having achieved anything significant in his artistic field and he's not really shy about making references both Musical and lyrical to his canoe merarys like Kanye and Kendrick as if he should be mentioned in the same breath as those guys as much as he may openly say that that's not what he's trying to communicate he would certainly like the audience to come away from this record thinking that it's as great and as spectacular as like a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy I mean with the vocal snippet at the very end of the song breakfast Jaden essentially tasks himself with saving hip hop which is a mentality that leads to probably two of the worst attitudes that you can have going into a rap record that one the the genre needs saving and two that you're the one to do it this is pretty much a recipe for having your head up your ass I kind of feel like I'm getting ahead of myself with what makes this album so mediocre however I don't really want to do a play-by-play of what happens in every single track on this thing it's 17 tracks it's 70 minutes long I feel like that would be a waste of everyone's time I will say though I can't totally hate on this record Jayden makes a lot of very good production choices on this album he flows pretty decently on these songs songs like breakfast and the passion and George Jeff featured these instrumentals that our total bangers several of many on this thing and you could pretty much put any rapper with an above-average flow or charisma level on these tracks and you would get a very enjoyable song and musically speaking the for Part B lue that kicks the entire album off is actually one of the most epic intros of 2017 with the kanye inspired distorted vocals and rumbling bass on the song be the refrain I could put you oughta with on the song hell and of course you falling down falling down on you is like so oh it's such an orgasmic rush musically this album is pretty grand in presentation however it doesn't take long for Jaden's relative lack of experience and perception to set in I mean you will get a sneaking suspicion if you take in every single lyric on the song l which is the first hefty verse on the album Jaden is not shy about comparing himself to Martin Luther King twice which is one of many many many comparisons and name drops throughout this entire record what's even weirder is that as he's mentioning Kings name he says he's kamasutra Inge he says Kendrick is coming out of him and he'll Elvis is coming out of him too also this one line about needing to be up in the Senate I mean I guess Donald Trump is president so why the hell not but still it's like Jaden is trying to project this weird sense of struggle into his lyrics when the fact of the matter is he's been born into an incredible amount of privilege which is great I mean your parents worked really hard for you to have the opportunities that you have and there's nothing inherently wrong with that Jaden would be far from the first artist in popular music to start rich however let's not pretend that Jaden began anywhere but the top now ignoring genes poetic faults and lack of perspective on things this kind of becomes impossible as the album draws on especially as he's hitting listeners with bars like spitting radiation like Chernobyl there are entire verses on this thing you could essentially skim through and not find a single witty line a single quotable if you like you could have a little bit of a giggle on the song hope with some pretty pathetic attempts at trying to say something political on this very song Jaden does a little nod to the building seven conspiracy theories which have been debunked again and again and again and again so it's pretty apparent pretty early on that Jaden lyrically is not really that deep he's not saying anything that essential despite the fact that he certainly implies that but at least Jaden has good production on this thing at least Jaden has great instrumentals but there is a point at which even the album becomes less aesthetically pleasing because unfortunately Jaden's money cannot buy good taste there are multiple songs on this that have these weird totally unexpected boring unnecessary extended instrumental passages that take a song from one section to another section to another section or just kind of tack on this really just bland outro like the sudden beats which on the song breakfast that comes right after this ASAP rocky feature where it just sounds like some pitch down mumbling vocals that I mean I guess it's probably ASAP rocky but how is this a feature or the 9min song lost boy which is essentially the same hip-hop beat acoustic guitar young boy moaning combo for nine minutes this song did not need to be nine minutes or the song Batman which is essentially some very boring average run-of-the-mill woozy trap music that rips off the Jumpman flow as if that's interesting anymore while the song watch me is this really awful tacky rap/rock fusion that so obviously rips off black skinhead there are tracks on this thing that have a more hard-hitting a catchy er more exciting vibe songs like the passion and icon but even these cuts while they did leave a good first impression on me the more I listened to them the more tired I got of them and the more it felt like I'm literally just a shade or two away from just listening to rice gum flex on his haters on a stupid youtube diss track there are certainly some things that in general I can appreciate about this record that the instrumentals are mostly epic and enjoyable and well put together I can enjoy this album's extravagance its youthful exuberance its thirst its ambition it's obvious desire to be something more be something great however whether or not Jaden actually has the tools and the talent to achieve that it remains to be seen and the cons of this album far outweigh the pros Jamin essentially gives his ego a completely undeserved blow job for 70 minutes he's constantly implying as if he is educating and informing and enlightening listeners despite the fact that he has very little of substance to say about anything on this record except for whatever topics or political flavours of the month that his contemporaries have also addressed but much more deeply in their songs he recycles this silly your verses or your lyrics sound like dirty dishes line a couple times on the album as if it was good the first time on multiple occasions he brags about his record label as if anybody even is aware that his record label exists overall there's just a lack of vision a lack of scope there's not a single song on here that really needs to be longer than three or four minutes also the record periodically delivers these wee skits or transitional moments with that reference Jaden or sire being asleep or being in some kind of dream state like he's progressing through a narrative but the narrative doesn't actually build up to anything or go anywhere I have a feeling that he kind of got this idea from either a Kendrick record or like from because the Internet but he didn't really know where to take it so it just kind of eventually disappears at one point on the album and you get no more references to these skits or transitions anymore I'm really just kind of feeling like in general this record is is is fake deep it's it's kind of it's kind of fake deep there's just too much filler there's too much awful moments there's too much completely drab boring average run-of-the-mill trendy thoughtless and middlebrow songs on this thing for it to truly be entertaining and worthy of the runtime that Jaden has given it ah transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're feeling like you have some thoughts I will

1moThJ2KXOs,hi hi hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for our weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and the worst tracks of the week no lighting this is a special after dark edition of the weekly track roundup where we get a little crazy a little sexy little nocturnal of course before we get into all the tracks I have to mention down there in the description box our our amazon associate and turntable lab links if you live in the US if you live in Japan if you live in mainland Europe if you live in Canada you can if you live in the UK as well you can hit up the link down there in the description box it'll send you it over to Amazon if you were going to do some shopping especially some holiday shopping we get kickback from whatever you're gonna buy off Amazon and yeah that's all there is to it's easy to use use it to buy some stuff you were gonna buy anyway and the good people over a turntable lab like I

on the channel as well as equipment like speakers and turntables for the budding record collector in your life or yourself treat yourself and let's get right into the worst tracks of the week shall we only a few tracks in my opinion only a few tracks landed as worst as worst this week kicking it off first with the new u2 single American soul I can't even say I'm disappointed in this track because I didn't expect much from this track to begin with because I haven't really dug any of the music from u2's forthcoming album so far but was sort of broke my heart about this particular track is that the vocal on this track is the exact vocal that lands on that Kendrick Lamar xxx song from his latest record damn so basically that feature that you to feature was just a sample of this forthcoming album and sitting you're wondering how exactly was this discussion had and how did it go about like did you purposefully seek out you two to be on your record and then they just sent you a track or like a vocal that you could sample or did you to approach you wanting to be on your new record did they send you an advance copy of the album and you just liked one particular vocal off of it it just seems like I don't know a really weird futuristic way of pre promoting an album because the feature was merely just a sample from u2's forthcoming album and now that I've heard that XXX tracks so many times and it is one of my favorite tracks off of damn at least a few bits off of it now that I've kind of had that bono vocal contextualized in that song in my head it sounds really silly and out of place on this particular track even after multiple listens though I have to say that's not even the worst part of the cut really it's the kind of I don't know uppity chorus on the cut that just seems like a little too giddy considering the tone of Bono's voice on that particular lyric about America yeah it's I'm not I'm not feeling this cut at all I have to say and I guess not looking forward too much to this forthcoming u2 album next on the worst section has to be the new G easy song featuring Zoe Nash the beautiful and the damned this track is painfully corny I could barely get past missing Ash's opening vocal on this thing like this track is pretty much everything cliched and awful and terrible about some of Eminem's like most mainstream singles in the 2000 2000s like condensed and boiled down to the most potent concentration the overblown production the corny and cringy rap verses and the barely tolerable guest singer who is just trying way too hard to sell the track like nobody sings like this like nobody nobody legitimately it's the singing the guest singing on this track is pretty much the musical equivalent to overacting I guess I would say and and I'm just gonna leave it at that the track generally just grosses me out but most most gez does so no surprises there let's get into the cuts that I thought were man wasn't crazy about him didn't think they were terrible either but certainly still thought they were worth mentioning and shouting out and pointing in your general direction first off screaming females aka scream ales have a new song out titled deeply new album on the way wasn't too crazy about this new track over here sounds like the most low-key of all of the singles they have dropped so far however I still am enjoying the fact that it seems like the band is definitely changing pace trying to become more versatile trying to become more dynamic and this could easily become a song that grows on me with more listens it's just not really that effective as a single doesn't really get my mouth watering or anything like that but I do like the fun painting concept of the lyric video if you guys do pop into the description box and check this track out as well as all the other tracks we always link them down there in the description box if you didn't know by now next the new Noel Gallagher's high flying birds cut which i i've heard has scissors on it or probably not or yeah I guess there was a recent live performance with Nolan the band and somebody was playing scissors on on the song which hilariously led to Liam encouraging somebody to peel potatoes during one of his live performances so somebody was literally in the crowd like playing the potato peeler during during one of his live performances I would be surprised if this upcoming NOLA record is better than than the Liam album the Liam album was pretty good was pretty good not perfect but a pretty good effort from him the best effort from him musically Post Oasis in my opinion but this new Noel Gallagher track it's a beautiful world certainly a lot better more superior more dynamic and not quite as overblown and overproduced and claustrophobic as the last single to come out from the band it's very Spacey it's very groovy it's got a nice blissful psychedelic vibe and that's the thing the last track kind of had a bit of a faux psychedelia thing to it that kind of turned me off like a neo psych sound that kind of rubbed me the wrong way this track is much more pleasant texturally very kaleidoscopic very pretty and moving on from there the nude ram and playboy cardi track crumbs I kind of weigh into this track expecting big things and I feel like I didn't get it personally there have been a few DRAM tracks singles as of late that we're kind of growers maybe this song will grow on me however I'm not really sort of seeing that to be the case case in point being that playboy cardi for the most part only has ad-libs to add to the track when his versatile e comes in he's totally boring I feel like this is just the exact wrong way to utilize playboy cardi I mean certainly his ad-libs are part of what makes him appealing but to kind of just pepper them all over the entire track even over some of the parts where you're going toward RAM or you're in the midst of the DRAM performance is a little distracting and doesn't really aid the song at all DRAM on the cut is very expressive very fine entertaining as usual but the hook on this thing is like really underwritten there's not really anything all that memorable about this chorus it's cool that these two landed on this track and collaborated in such a big way but I feel like this was the exact wrong way to utilize playboy cardi and DRAM again while he was fine the hook definitely needed some retooling in my opinion it was not as explosive or as catchy or as exciting as that of some of his recent material and especially his debut album diplomats had a new track out titled once upon a time if you are a fan of Dipset you're gonna like this cut you know chopped up soul bangin beats pretty much everybody does their thing it sounds like friggin Diplomats track from from like 12 years ago it's not bad it's not amazing either they just kind of come back with their trademark sound they do their thing and it's it's fine it's fine not a bad cut at all not a bad cut not disappointed at all considering recent solo or not rather a recent feature stuff I've heard from these guys I think it could have been much rougher but in fact it ended up good moving on from there the new Bjork single unfortunately was not really that into the new Bjork single the track titled blissing me I gave the track multiple listens anticipated that it would grow on me that it would sort of blow me away given that it was a little more hard-hitting than the gate which I did enjoy despite how just kind of vast and Spacey and formless the track was this new cut like I said more straightforward more direct however instrumentally it just to me kind of seemed like a weird middle ground between Vespertine and vuln akira so we're very much kind of in that same wispy very beat heavy and very string heavy sound palette björk's vocal melody gets really stale really fast like she does not progress it all that much over the course of the track in my opinion and on top of it the lyrics are I guess what you could have expected given how Bjork teased the album calling it her tinder record calling it a record that was kind of like you know her crush record her dating record her love records with love song record a record where she's essentially kind of transcendently blissfully in love with a certain person or infatuated with a certain person she's literally talking about sending mp3s to this person who she has a crush on and texting back and forth and I don't know not that Bjork's music hasn't come from a very personal and a very down-to-earth place in the past I mean some of my favorite cuts off of her early work like debut and post deal in very reality based concepts however it just kind of seems like really and really cheap and just really average for her to be describing this particular situation in the way that she does like it doesn't seem very evocative of anything and it certainly isn't worthy of the otherworldly vibe that comes along with the instrumentation on this track or much of Bjork's work as of late it's it's definitely not taking me off into another galaxy like some of the best material on Biophilia does which is certainly been the intention of that record given just how I guess conceptual and just how not of this world that album is however this cut over here just felt like I don't know just felt like I was listening to a horny millennial write the lyrics to a Bjork song and it was just a little off-putting maybe it'll end up growing on me a little bit more when I listen to it in the context of the album and maybe am hit with more tracks that kind of back up this same theme and then then maybe it'll make more sense but as of right now I'm kind of mild on the track you know there are elements of the instrumental and her vocal performance that I like but the substance of the song and the structure of the song I'm kind of kind of cold on to be fair moving on from there 50-cent has a new single out the single is titled still think I'm nothing featuring Jeremih certainly an interesting single title he essentially is challenging people on this track with a message challenging people to I guess kind of a call him out or write him off for not being as interesting as he used to be not being on top like he used to be and while it's not really anything entirely new from 50 if you're familiar with any of his old stuff it does sound like 50-cent Hungary again like certainly the flow is indicative of that he is kind of aggressive on this track much more aggressive than he was on any number of cuts from his last album tape whatever I've already forgot about it have already erased it from my brain it was that frigging boring this however did kind of piqued my interest 50-cent fans should certainly take notice to this this single over here and let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best of the week the best so the week first off shout out to the band tribulation the lament is the new single from the upcoming record that the band has coming out very soon this band if you didn't already know is kind of this gothic blackened metal band that has elements of just very strong balladry and melody and songwriting to their metal Tunes sort of on par with a band like ghost but not quite like a band like ghost like they have their own style they have their own vibe they have their own aesthetic but they're very much akin to ghost and that they just have this strong sense of boundary and songwriting and a lot of what they do and this new tune of there's the lament is one of the catchiest I've heard from them in a while love the chord progression love lead vocals love how eerie and gorgeous some of the melodies are I love the dark kind of gothic vibes on this thing you could light your fucking candelabra to this shit so give this track a listen thought it was great liking this new Chris Stapleton track surprisingly I've always thought Chris was a little too mild for me personally I feel like he gets a lot of credit for being a route seer and more authentic country artists being a country artist who's a you know a little bit more lowdown and dirty a little bit more outlaw ish but I feel like that's only the case because mainstream country the CMT brand of country that we see today is so freaking vanilla that somebody like Stapleton can come in and it's like whoa this guy's like a breath of fresh air and certainly he is that in a sense he's no Sturgill Simpson in my opinion however this new track over here certainly has me warming up to him a little bit this new cut is trying to untangle my mind which is a very smart very witty very well-written lyrically little track where he's kind of going over basically what's ailing him emotionally what's ailing him mentally and the stuff that he puts himself through to try to get to a place in his mind where he finds peace finds calm and of course you know being a country artist being a purveyor of sorrow in his death you know he has his troubles and he has his issues with a getting to that place and the corporation is solid vocal melody is solid too overall it's a good tune and looking forward to this follow up Chris Stapleton is going to deliver very soon over here we essentially have a two tracks that I wanted to feature which both come from the Paul Institutes one big hyped to do this week has been the fact that Jay Paul essentially is back with his brother and they have announced the start of this Paul Institute thing which is not just like a label where they'll be releasing music but it's literally a frigging Institute it's literally a place where it seems like giant his brother are going to do what they can to work with artists bring artists in foster talent I imagine they're going to put this record label or whatever to good use and then have people on the label and sell tracts and print records or whatever so it seems like they're doing a really interesting little in-house thing here and the way that they have kind of announced Artie's toward this is that they've released two singles here one from Fabiana pallet Palladino and one from Ruthven and the two tracks respectively are titled evil and mystery and even though we're hearing two very different artists here who have different styles both of them because because they feature production from Paul it seems like the it's almost like they're the same artist or both of them could be on a Paul record as like vocal features or something like the production has a very kind of cold frigid a little eerie a little nostalgic 80s vibe to it Fabiana more of an 80s synth-pop vibe whereas Ruthven more of like an 80s synth funk vibe even though it is like different musical styles there are some very clear like sonic similarities between the production choices between some of the synth patches and stuff so it's not like these two songs are completely disconnected or anything like that so what a lot of people are hyping here is essentially that we're kind of hearing new Jay Paul in a way but not truly you know I personally am not really wondering or worried about whether or not we're gonna hear more from him in the future not that I don't think he can't write a great record but I feel like at this point if you really wanted to come out with that new album like he would have by now I don't know what's keeping him from doing it I do not know what's keeping him from doing it everybody is waiting with bated breath you know and maybe somehow this will be a tease toward doing that but if if he wanted to do it he would have done it by now however I do enjoy these two new tracks I think they're great tracks I think there is kind of a weird minimal sort of odd intentionally awkward strange vibe to both cuts that I really like and both of the tunes I think are really catchy at their core as well I especially enjoy the lyrics on the mystery track from Fabiana both beautiful tracks both weird 80s vibes to them both off of the Paul Institute label both connected to Jay Paul's so make sure you check these checks tracks out I think they're good cuts and it does sort of make me excited to see Paul potentially fostering talent with other artists if we're going to continue to get music that's this interesting moving on from their tame and paula has a new like b-sides and remixes EP a lot of people asking me if I am excuse-me gonna review it no plans to review it honestly you'd be given that it's just labeled as b-sides and all that stuff I do like currents though um however the track that I do want to point out here is this song over here titled list of people to try and forget about it is a very enjoyable song it's not the most solid melody that you've heard from tame impala but it does feel like one of the more rock-oriented tracks that could have landed on currants or rather just kind of came from the currents sessions and it does have an interesting little multifaceted structure to it which does make the the progression of the song really interesting listen none of the material on this EP is awful which is why I'm kind of mentioning it here this is in the best track section and I'm kind of reminding you guys not to miss out on this EP if you're not aware of it yet but to me it's it's just kind of a handful of cuts a couple remixes not a whole lot to say just make sure you get your ears on this thing if you love currents and you're a big team Paulo fan it's all I got to say definitely I dig in a little bit of the material myself but that's not a lot a whole lot to say and finally I got to give a shout out to health and apparently experimental music producer no life coming together on this new single over here totally out of the blue hard to be a guy and really kind of liking how heavy and noisy and strange and almost kind of like industrial this new song is I feel like some of the best elements of Health's music kind of marry with no lifes production in a really interesting way and hopefully this is not the first time we hear from both of these guys because this is one of the darkest and strangest songs that in my opinion health is released in a while certainly more interesting than quite a few cuts off of their last fulling to help them and that's all I got to say guys you know if you're into some weird noisy electronic music Noise music sort of abstract I don't even know what you would call some of health's music it's certainly not pop music but experimental electronic music that has pop influences and undertones but also punk in undertones and sort of noise rock undertones but like also coming from a different dimension but a shout out to health for coming out with this single I think it's one of the best ever this week and those are the best and the men and the worst tracks of the week

_NlQanKlme0,hey everyone lift the knee wait tan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a violent date with some banging everything going on in the background please bear with me it's not something I can help right now but I still want to get you guys a good old a good old nice vinyl update cool cool we have a lot to go over on this one a lot of different material sitting in my lap right now so let's get into it first starting with a couple cassettes one off of secretly Canadian from one of my favorite records of the year a singer-songwriter by the name of Alex Cameron who has teamed up with Roy Malloy on this new album over here forced witness what a creepy look on your front cover and it's a little red tape there's little red cassette over here so there you go Alex Cameron forced witness I've got to give a shout-out to my dude hot dad for this tape over here of his wrestle cassette which is this tape that he dropped where he does nothing but record and perform sort of self envisioned theme songs for different wrestlers many of whom you can see are listed now if you love wrestling and if you love sort of corny cheesy 80s flavored pop and rock you're gonna love this tape you're gonna want to try this tape out not only because of just all the funny wrestling references and the hilarious instrumentals but also there's just like a really weird ongoing joke in pretty much every song where hot dad is singing about the wrestler in the song wanting to kiss the opponent and at one point in pretty much every song here he mentions the wrestler needing to have to take a piss so let's go on to our final little tape over here my dude uncommon nASA has a new project out called written at night and this little tape over here is the instrumental version of the project when I bought this I actually thought I was just buying the tape itself I didn't know I was buying the instrumental version but it's actually kind of cool to have the instrumentals since I already have the the songs digitally and though it's actually kind of cool about this is on the inside you fold it open I hope I'm not giving away the keys to the kingdom over here if you open it up NASA actually lists like the gear that he uses to put a lot of these songs together I think it's one of his best records it's one of the best political rap records I've heard in a while now I'm gonna get into the records in this segment before I do I want to talk about an app called snupps or these sites snaps calm where if you collect any number of things for me personally its music its records its physical its physical copies of music it's basically a place where you can upload pictures upload photos of your collection organize it structure it share it with other people share in the collecting experience with people who have the same sort of passion for a particular thing that you're collecting that you do using the app itself is pretty straightforward it's pretty simple I mean if you use Instagram before you can pretty much figure this thing out in a matter of minutes I've started four different shelfs so far which is basically a different place where you can place things in your collection we have weird and rare which I'm going to add to very soon personal favorites a bunch of old stuff I've put a bunch of classic records in there and in each little section there's all the albums that I've uploaded you can see the different pictures the different descriptions a little you know sort of blurb about my experience or what I think about the record and there are all sorts of just a variety of different details you can add to each piece in your collection I've actually started a little needle drop group if you go to the Explorer option you search up the needle drop the group pops right up a few people already members of the group whoa people are already adding things to the group and if you hit the explore tab and look up vinyl it turns out there's a bunch of music collecting communities and groups here already and just generally in the Explorer tab there's a ton of other groups that are devoted to collecting a myriad of different things so yeah I hit up the needle drop group I'll go over some of the posts that you guys post there if you throw in some of your favorite records in your collection and maybe I'll review them for a future vinyl update and remember this app is available not only on the snupps comm web site but also for iOS and Android devices as well so basically grab the app on the app store wherever you grab apps when you're on Android or you can actually just use the site on a desktop or on a laptop computer snaps calm I'm gonna add really quickly this dope body album BAM I'm gonna just I'm just gonna add that later in my personal favorites section because don't body is lifers is a personal favorite of mine all right let's continue with the vinyl update here's another sweet little personal favorite of mine Oh oh boy pick destroyer tear fire this is a powerhouse of a grind core album this is animalistic it's noisy it's crazy it's insane it's intense I mean there's not really much to speak of with the with the packaging or anything you know it just sounds great it's super heavy if you're looking for a grindcore album with a lot of noise a lot of favor of flavor a lot of chaos a lot of personality not your just usual oh just like meeting potatoes kind of grindcore album definitely check this pig destroyer record out of Terra Fire it's when my favorite Pig destroyer records all right this next one is an interesting one it comes with a little letter from from the people who sent it over to Anthony Fantana McHale chesta this is terrible and now it's yours feel free to mention it or review it burn it in your backyard enjoy question mark sincerely Reuter and Chris basically they've sent me a 45 edition of the Hong Kong 97 soundtrack which is a video game that if you watch the Angry Video Game Nerd you should should be familiar with and I can't believe this exists on a 7-inch I cannot believe this exists on a 7-inch now it says on the back of course the year 2017 has arrived a herd of fucking ugly Reds are rushing from the mainland to release the Hong Kong 97 soundtrack on limited edition vinyl side chin is femur mastered sight Tong is love Beijing Tiananmen and this is the fifth of five copies apparently there are only five copies of this in existence and this is one of them Jesus Christ this exists this friggin exists thank you very much guys for for saying that along to me that was a really sweet of you really really sweet really sweet in a in a mean way this next one also comes from someone who loves the show Adam sent this over Adam sent over a wonderful copy of the king gizzard and the lizard wizard wizard album quarters which truth be told is not one of the band's most intense or heavy or electrifying albums but still it is an interesting album concept with the record being split up into four separate parts four separate pieces and actually loved the album art to this thing because you definitely have like the separation of the four separate visual pieces with the four separate musical pieces which you actually get in the gatefold and it folds more than one way so you actually kind of get all the four pieces which is amazing and you know obviously lyrics and details and stuff like that in here but but the cherry on top of all of it which I did not know going into this record over here is the wonderful multicolored like purple blue red clear splatter coloring over here this is gorgeous gouge as' and listening back to some of the pieces on here like the jazzy piece and five on this thing it's not bad you know it's just it's just not as blood-pumping as stuff like mind fuzz or nonagon infinity and you know honestly it's it's not neither is paper mache and balloon you know and that record is good so I think um this is a nice record it's not one my favorite King gizzards but I do appreciate you sending it over like huge thank you on this thing big props on sending this over gotta give a shout out to car seat headrest over here with the album teens of denial one of my favorite records of last year when it dropped we got a nice gatefold over here heavy heavy heavy like cardboard packaging excuse it excuse again the banging and very like messy like sort of visual sort of writing here with the I love the kind of messy traffic jam aesthetic going on here with all the lyrics on the record a black vinyl pretty straightforward though it does feel like a somewhat heavy pressing and hometown hero's on a one sleeve dark sleeve with white lettering cosmic heroes I love this quote over here to this quote from Luke truly I tell you no prophet is accepted in his hometown that is absolutely true so shout out to will shout out to car seat headrest which I was just thinking the other day despite the fact that I like this band that's one of my least favorite band names but I digress next gotta give shout-out to my dude igloo ghost my dude England ghost new record over here neo wax bloom out now on brain feeder albums debut full-length record early you know is debut for brain feeder and this is a very nice package this is very nice packaging if you can get this sort of you know higher-end package of this record please do not only is the cover our killer and not only is the lettering on the back here the the blue the red the yellow the green like the the primary colors and all that it's gorgeous it's wonderful obviously green not being a primary color but you get what I'm saying sticker set on this thing you get a friggin sticker set download code obviously nice cardboard sleeve not a paper sleeve nice cardboard sleeve gorgeous crystal clear vinyl so gorgeous crystal clear record over here I love that weird warp travelling jelly worm with the witch hat it's actually kind of wonderful and what's awesome about this package is that it adds to the story and the mystique of the whole background of all these characters that igloo ghost says that his music is based around because it comes with this weird little like little big pamphlet slash graphic novel where it's like a little a little comic strip series and it basically details all these characters and things that are happening in their little world I'm not gonna go into the storyline of it because I don't want to spoil it for anybody who does end up picking it up but it is a really amazing cool little addition to anybody who really enjoys a glue ghost music and for me personally I've always been super curious about like what the whole narrative behind all these wayne zany wacky characters that sort of seem to go into the visuals behind his music are and like what their whole deal is and it's cool that he's like sort of like detailing it here in this little comic and it would be awesome to see if in the future he comes out with like some music videos and stuff like that that kind of goes deeper into that lore next shout out to Kendrick Lamar damn on record gatefold all the freaking uh production credits over here Alchemist 9th wonder Steve Lacey Anthony Top Dawg tiffith yep I love production credits and to records both of them blood-red damn very nice packaging very nice well put together the record itself didn't sound too much heavier deeper III couldn't really tell much of a difference between the packaging here are not the packaging but rather the sound of the record and just the digital version I had already been listening to but that's not necessarily a bad thing just noticing now that the letters themselves do have a gloss on them whereas the rest of the album cover does not and I actually got myself a copy of the signed version so we have a little Duckworth signature over there and actually think the way that they did the signed version is kind of genius they send you the sealed version of the record you're gonna listen to and they send you an empty sort of a you know little uh sleeve over here that's signed and that's actually smart because you can frame this and then put this on the record player and just enjoy listening to it and you can just sort of keep this in the frame on top of it it hurts and sort of prevents uh you know the whole you know throwing the crap up on eBay because this is not this is not sealed this is not in shrink wrap or anything so you just frame it just put it up on the wall you know we're just like throw it in a sleeve put in your collection keep it there and you know always have this version tap to play and listen to and ever you want to play and listen to it and you don't got to worry about touching it handle in it whatever you know sort of adding wear and tear to it and you just sort of keep your signed copy sort of nice and clean so I like that I think that that's really good so shout out to Kenny and top dog for doing that next this one's gonna give everybody a little bit of a giggle however in and me as well but to me it's a little it's a little bit more serious but I got to give a shout out to Lou Reed and Metallica on this vinyl copy of Lou Lou I just picked up I'm meaning to buy the self buy this for myself for years and I finally yeah I was real istening to it and it's still very clumsy it's still very clunky it's still very odd record however I still enjoy a lot of Lou Reed's lyrics on this thing I still enjoy a lot of James Hetfield singing I still enjoy a lot of Metallica's performances and I still very much admire what both artists were trying to do going into this record it's still a very flawed album but I do think this is a very unique sort of occurrence in music that that needed to stay in my collection because it is one of the more notable musical moments of the decade in my opinion and you know I do think Lou Reed does not get enough credit for this record did not get enough credit for this record and hopefully you know years down the road he does you know not not saying that's guaranteed that's just I just cross my fingers and hope that that ends up being the case you know double double album gatefold over here a black vinyl a nice little insert inside where they kind of go over Lou Reed's lyrics the kind of detail the the whole concept and the history of the collaboration and what inspired Lou to sort of do the whole collaboration in the first place so um yeah I mean I get why people don't like it I understand still you know and and my opinion on the album hasn't changed too deeply but still wanted to finally have it just have it because I do I do respect the album I do respect the album for as father flawed as it is I do the album and finally here's the last one we're going to talk about in this video though I am a little just disappointed in this particular one and that is kind of the deluxe book version of Radiohead's a moon shaped pool now a Moochie pool you guys already knows one of my favorites of the year love this album I think it's one of my favorite records from Radiohead period but this book over here for as much as they charged for it and for me was not really like worth the hype like I feel like I could have used a little bit more bang for my buck and I didn't buy like another copy of this and gave it away and hopefully that that person's copy is faring a bit better now I mean the thing is like there are a lot of nice things about the book you know I do like the giant visuals I do like you know however I do not care for the cardboard sleeve if the records are housed in and I just say I guess I just don't care for just the different types of paper that the book sort of transitions from from page after page after page after page it seems a little messy and not really all that cohesive and on top of it there was just something about the book when I first picked it up and when I first started handling it like there was something just a little I don't know like a little off about it I'm not gonna spoil all the pieces of visual art in this thing though I do think a lot of them are very beautiful especially this one I actually like this one quite a bit I do like the color gradient on this one but kind of the weird like I have no idea what the heck material this is or why we've transitioned into it but I do like that we are getting some lyric sheets in here it just seems like I'm getting a bunch of different books in one single book and I'm not really caring for all these like sort of textural transmissions some of the pieces I'm not really as into as others and on top of it I've maybe opened this thing like like five six times like a maybe opened it five six times and you know sort of thumbed through it and like the the book has already split off from you know you see that split in the middle of the book alright I just ended up again for the fifth or sixth time and the book just split apart it just split off and it's like what is this what like how are you making this stuff that it's just like falling apart after you've only opened it a handful of times and it's just like it just seems like it's just a thin strip of glue or whatever it's not even properly bound together from beginning to end and if you're gonna have a book this big you're gonna pull the other so many different types of paper and material and you're gonna put it between two giant covers and you're gonna charge as much for it as you did like the least you could do is just properly bound it all together so that it literally does not just fall apart when it's sitting in the bookshelf so I don't know I'm kind of disappointed about it the vinyl itself sounds fantastic the vinyl is very crisp it's very Spacey it adds to sort of the alien quality of the sound of the music on the album but uh but again just super disappointed in the quality and the assembly of this book like I know that there's probably not a whole lot of copies of this thing floating around anymore so any chance I had of potentially warning anybody about this thing is probably long gone at this point but um I don't know just not really that crazy about it to be completely honest I mean I'm not gonna get rid of it since the vinyl is already here and I have the extra CD in here which is nice but um yeah I'm just not really crazy about this whole deluxe version of the album to be completely honest but those are my thoughts on that and that has been this episode of the vinyl update again shout-out to our sponsor snaps calm thanks very much to them for supporting this segment I'll see you guys in the next one over here next to my head is a playlist of all of our vinyl updates that you can check out

tdcpjrCZMAc,hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here Internet's busiest music nerd you know who it is and I'm gonna throw together a little quickie review here of the new Liars album TF CF put down some short thoughts on this record I've been really mulling this album over for week after week after week after week this records been out a while now and Liars excuse the banging it'll be over soon but Liars is a band that I've enjoyed their work from drums not dead to a lot of their recent stuff today wish you and freaking mess I think it's a fantastic electronic music album fusion of electronics and post-punk and experimental music and noise and it's it's an incredible record in my opinion but I I didn't anticipate at all the direction that things would move in sonically on this new record over here but also in terms of personnel because believe it or not Angus Andrew who's the sole member of the band who has sort of existed throughout the group's entirety is sort of going it on a solo capacity on this album and I went into it thinking maybe that's not that big of a deal because I kind of dug some of the lead up singles to this thing and given that he is in a lot of ways the main brain of liars how is it gonna be really I think of a deal of some other people who were in the band not too long ago are now out of the band maybe he'll have more interesting ideas bubble up because he'll be in total control of everything and I the the exact opposite has kind of happened I feel like in comparison with nearly every other liars album where Andrew essentially has somebody to collaborate with this record is kind of tedious this album is kind of lacking in a variety of sounds and exciting ideas and compelling songs to a lot of the production a lot of the cycled loops and beats that play throughout this thing get really stale really fast there isn't a whole lot of details or layers or nuance to the progressions and structures featured on this album the lyrics aren't really that intriguing in my opinion the melodies and instrumentation he tops these beats with sometimes simply just some vocals and acoustic guitar are kind of lost on me because they don't really bring the interesting edits and production work and sound play that I usually get and enjoy so much out of a Liars album that weird eerie chilling unmistakable trademark atmosphere liars music is typically soaked in is nowhere to be found here and it's essentially been replaced with nothing I feel like I'm kind of listening to a stripped-down skeletal demo version of a liar's album that they may have taken into the studio and then built up beyond there and turned into a whole new beast this to me kind of feels like a liar's album unrealized a liar's album unfinished a liar's album unsure of itself truly a solo effort in that it feels very isolated and very short-sighted and like it really could have used the perception and the outlook of another set of eyes another set of ears another brain to sort of throw another splash of creativity or add to the recipe that andrew has pulled together here because as is it's not quite as evocative and as vivid and as sound rich as all of my other favorite liars albums this to me seems very reserved it seems very grey and a little lifeless in my opinion to me there's not really anything other than Andrews vocals that says to me yes this this is a liar's record and even his vocals on this thing are not really like the most important or the most exciting thing about this record yeah I'm just really kind of underwhelmed by the tunes on this thing by how redundant a lot of these songs feel and just by the lack again of overall that trademark creepy bone-chilling Liars atmosphere so I'm really kind of feeling like a strong four to a light five on this thing really don't care for much of it I get really tired of it really quick and it's it's truly an album that that that I'm a little let down by unfortunately ition over here next to my head is another liars review you can click on that or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I will see you in the next one Anthony Fantana Liars tea çf forever 
vhlH7LmWlgE,hi everyone rigged the knee primero here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new destroyer album Ken this is the latest full-length album from longtime Vancouver band fronted by singer-songwriter mr. dan Behar who over the years has moonlighted in other notable groups such as Swan Lake or the New Pornographers and Dan is as prolific as he is one of a kind his very poetic but frankly Racal style his eccentric yell P vocals his records that are typically full of whimsical and effervescent indie pop and rock instrumentals packed with a lot of beauty a lot of swagger a lot of chamber instrumentation and while Dan's discography is not perfect each album does come with just a note of reinvention or a different direction like the light groovy sophistica put or all of the folk rock instrumentation on destroyers rubies the theatrical dramatic and kind of stage II poison season that came out a few years ago also Street Hawk I think has a super clear glam and David Bowie influence that often goes kind of underappreciated and while it is not his most nuanced album there are a lot of elements of trouble and dreams that I enjoy you know it's it's a pretty decent brash loud in-your-face indie pop and rock album so we're Dan Behar would take the band on their next record is kind of anybody's guess and it seems to be new wave for some reason not that I don't actually like New Wave synth pop the New Romantic movement I do actually quite a bit but for whatever reason Dan's usual poetic and instrumental finesse does not carry over onto this album or onto this style because for the most part on this thing we get a lot of synth pop cuts that sound painfully awkward Haggard rickety like they're struggling to breathe like on the song in the morning which features these loud gurgling guitar chords and screaming totally out of place leads these stringy milky bass lines all of which are just very unpleasant texturally and add up into us like a new order song on its deathbed also you have a pulsating beat in a chorus bassline on the song Tinseltown swimming in blood which is pleasant but painfully forgettable the dramatic and slow piano chords which almost sound like they're suspended in space on the opening of the song Rome combined with the dramatic guitar chords comes off like I don't know Dan Behar singing over a vaporwave instrumental eventually things on this track swell up toward the end and it sounds like this this really off attempted trying to sound romantic I guess is romantic is taking your date out to McDonald's to order off the dollar menu with these glistening synthesizers and kind of half-hearted saxophone leads at a few different points the song sometimes in the world tries to distract from just how cliche the instrumental is by introducing these roaring distorted brittle guitar chords that just totally smother everything in anything going on instrumentally but this is not nearly as uninspired as the plain boring guitar chord progression on the song stay lost or the pitifully sputtering keyboard leads on ivory coast it's so weird because I feel like the musical genealogy of what Dan is doing on this record is not that far removed from what he was doing on caput I mean obviously different musical styles but I feel like the same kind of light sensual smooth groovy music that he made on that record could have easily translated to a new wave album why much of it just goes over like a lead balloon on this album I do not know and say what you will about Dan's music in the past being more stylish than substantive or that his lyrics a lot of the time are pretty much poetic voguing at least he was good at what he did and unfortunately his usual level of grace and finesse just does not come through on this thing he sounds so painfully out of place on these instrumentals which was clearest when I heard acoustic versions of the cuts on this album toward the tail end of the deluxe version of this album which sounded a lot more sensible and natural I get that Dan might be feeling a little restless in his on this new record and that's why he probably wanted to change things up a little bit but unfortunately it sounds like he did not give himself the the proper time to acclimate this style to his songwriting because a lot of the time it just sounds like he's meandering lyrically over these microwaved leftovers from the 80s which do not play at all two destroyers usual level of showmanship and storytelling though I will say Dan's vocal performances on this record did leave a lot to be desired even if this was an all acoustic record the singing could have been more exciting there are a few cuts on here weird Anne side steps this whole new wave aesthetic cover from the Sun as well as the very acoustic and Spacey saw you at the hospital but the former is a kind of straightforward and forgettable peace of sunshine pop where Dan does not write his best lyrics while the latter only serves as a kind of sleepy acoustic interlude moment whose ending is sort of morphs into a groaning drone I did not care for this thing at all unfortunately I think this is actually destroyers most lackluster albums since the earliest days of the band when Dan was still kind of finding his footing as a songwriter and once again I feel like he's in that position because things just sound lost on this record frankly just lost the vibrance the eccentricity the drama the tension the sexiness it's it's just really not here and it's not being replaced with anything instead this new record it just sounds flat and lifeless and drab and I'm just hoping things come back on the next album that's all I can hope for feeling a strong four to a lay five on this thing transition may be given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate or the best year the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful over here next to my head is another destroyer review probably at it review the last album you can click

JvQDSJk2QNE,ah hi everyone what person here the Internet's busy it's a and it's time for a review of the new yung lean album stranger this is the third full-length album from swedish internet rapper and sad boy Jonathan lean doer has stood and say what you will about the dude but he has had a handful of good singles drop over the years he is stuck very passionately to a strong style and aesthetic in his music he is certainly one of the more notable artists out there when it comes to the spacey and blissful genre of cloud rap and he kind of helped pave the way for a lot of dudes doing their thing on the internet in the rap game today however this latest album cycle for this new record of his has been one of his most low-key yet teasing listeners with basically a handful of singles and then a seven-minute short film and I've actually enjoyed most of the tracks leading up to the release of this album all of which have featured leans usual combination of Spacey trap beats and deadpan vocals but just with a little extra the song red bottoms sky hit me and appealed to me right away mostly because of its beautiful and very I guess kind of earnest vocal melody it's like a wonderful lullaby and vocally this is one of leans more passionate performances to date the song is as catchy as it is pretty it embodies the feelgood intoxication that most good cloud rap songs do the harmonious bridge builds up into a lavish and heavenly crescendo and this is maybe the first time that I would ever refer to a young lean song as being elegant then there's the slightly more aggressive ski mask which features these very memorable Doong Doong Doong lead synth melodies sputtering high hats groaning bass and also one of leans weirdest flows of course it's slathered in auto-tune it's got a bunch of weird vocal inflections in it the beat is so friggin nutty so are the vocal effects and I like how that pairs up with the very laid-back vocal delivery the song metallic intuition I recently had a somewhat negative reaction to in a best/worst tracks video and I still think it's one of the more skeletal and underwhelming song on the entire project but with more listens to this song I kind of appreciate that lien is doing something a little bit more eerie and spacious and dark on this cut trying to get a bit more introspective however leans lyrics nor his flow is interesting enough to carry a song that instrumentally is this skeletal by contrast the song fallen demon does a bit more with so little the song could have used like a hook or some more variation but I do like leans consistent flow on this track the kind of devilish vocal effects the light distortion on the vocals to the very warped base and the dizzying woodwinds synth leads and the instrumental I feel like I've been transported into some kind of semi satanic musical underworld and there are a number of other equally minimal tracks in the track listing here that go over a bit better but mostly because yung lean comes through with a solid vocal melody like on drop it / scooter and I will say that his verses on this project are a bit more evocative than usual addressing topics of individualism and isolation loneliness excess aspiration and ambitions young Lean's flows and his delivery his lack of enthusiasm on his songs does tend to be his Achilles heel still some of the flows he delivers sort of trail off into I don't know singing or just like another rhythm pattern or something like he's not really giving the audience the artistic fortitude or stamina necessary to come through with a consistent verse with a laser focus on a flow much less a topic there are some tracks on here that I think kind of work despite lean doers sort of disheveled demeanor like Silver Arrows whose hook really sells the song the somewhat peppy and very sugar-sweet hunting my own skin and sort of Iceman a track that I think the more I listen to it is kind of underwritten however I do love the instrumental here I do love the Weeping guitars woven into this spacey dark moody trap B even though I don't think there is as much substance to this record as I would like or as much lyrical fortitude to this record as I would like I do think this is leans mo aesthetically pleasing album to date with the exception of maybe the song push whose vocal mix is really whacked really kind of overshadows the beat slathered in this terribly grating auto-tune despite the fact that I like how glitchy some points of the song are it's it's not very pleasant to listen to the song is a little repetitive too but as lien states in the song agony he can write hooks but not so much songs which is absolutely true I mean I'm glad that's a critique that he gives to himself that I can repeat and agree with it is in fact true the songwriting on this thing does leave a bit to be desired more in the way of variation detail substance lyricism hell I mean even energy level all of these things could have been amplified increased despite the fact that I think the album starts off and ends stronger than I expected it may be a while before yung lean comes through with a truly solid and a definitive project but I will say stranger is a step in that direction all the things that I've critiqued him on before in the past I feel like have improved noticeably the songs while not perfect some end very abruptly some trail off some are kind of one-dimensional but this is still leans strongest crop of tracks yet and if I'm being honest musically instrumentally vocally some of these tracks are kind of experimental like there's certainly more going on here vocally and lyrically and texturally than there has been on leans more vapid singles that have been released in the past much of the appeal of this record for me might come down to the melodies and production which are very sound rich very beautiful very unsettling at times young lean has usually been more about aesthetic than anything so I wasn't surprised about that going into this project I kind of expected that but seeing that aesthetic in that style improve and mature by leaps and bounds and then also hearing these slight lyrical improvements here and there these slight vocal improvements here and there it has kind of made a world of difference I mean it's actually leans most likable project yet I would say I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like subscribe and please don't cry just leave an angry comment to the comments if you're angry or leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're

JLu1xs35rXM,hmm hi everyone been thony clem tanto here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Benjamin Clementine album I tell a fly this is the latest album from one of this decades most enigmatic songwriters and performers mr. Benjamin Clementine a singer a composer a pianist hailing from the UK who made a somewhat pretty big splash back in 2015 with his at least for now debut on which he delivered these incredibly dramatic regal piano ballads that were this exciting fusion of classical music and jazz and art pop and chamber pop and progressive pop some of the tracks on this thing were a little long-winded a little winding a little patience testing but for the most part Benjamin's songwriting was very OnPoint it showed incredible promise and it also helped that his singing was so freakin bold and expressive even though I didn't love this record I walked away from it feeling like Ben had a bright future and that seemed to be the case going into this new album because I really enjoyed teaser cuts like God saved the jungle as well as phantom of Aleppo Ville and another thing that excited me on my initial listens to these tracks is that his songwriting was coming off a bit more direct it sounded like he was bringing more instrumentation into the fold we were gonna get more drums more cents more bass more vocal overdubs so yeah and the result of that is that this latest crop of songs certainly sounds bigger and grander instrumentally sometimes it actually feels like Benjamin is kind of thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and not just sonically but structurally - as tracks like Aleppo Ville feature these numerous phases and movements across the length of the song however in the case of this record this is kind of one of those situations where more is kind of less because the additional bells and whistles that Benjamin brings into the fold on this album I think often distracts from a track that could have been a bit more cohesive or consistent a bit more focused to mention the track Aleppo Ville another time the song kicks off with these booming heavy drums very nice harpsichord arpeggios some vocal theatrics but then the track loses steam when it makes this sudden transition into very slow moody piano passages where Benjamin starts singing about his own experience with bullying and I think he's trying to liken that to the situation in Aleppo or just bullying in international politics it's not the most sensible comparison nor are the lyrics that Benjamin uses at this point in the track incredibly profound the track has a nice sentiment but I feel like the execution leaves a lot to be desired even more the case for the song Paris cor blimey which doesn't seem to move past this stage of just a really lackluster narrative being delivered flatly over these really Stage II pianos and some of the deeper cuts on this record feature these looped very groovy pieces of percussion backing nearly the entirety of the track and much like Benjamin appearing on the new gorillaz album which had you know some very punchy and very looped and very cycled production hanging in the background there I feel like it just kind of saps the drama out of his singing and his performance out of his song in the case of ode for Joyce or one awkward fish there are so much going on or at least it feels that way you have these panas you have these bustling pieces of percussion Benjamin singing maybe a bass line and none of it really feels all that connected I feel like I'm listening to several different pieces from several different songs that have somehow just managed to be the same tempo and assembled into like a digital audio workstation and just but and not that things are necessarily aesthetically pleasing when compositionally the songs are a bit more logical or have a clearer flow like the song by the poet so you're by the poets of Europe by the poets of Europe by the boats up Europe which compositionally I think is one of the prettier tracks on this record but the incessant by the ports of Europe refrains on this thing just really come off as grating to me they really do not they're kind of more annoying than exciting though I can appreciate the Benjamin is trying to do something weird something strange something quirky with his voice but Benjamin does have a very unique tambour to his singing and I think layering so many of his own background vocals over themselves just kind of leads a sound that's really kind of kooky and not in the best way the record certainly starts off strong with farewell Sonata and God Save the jungle and better sorry than safe which had this weird kind of fake fade-out in the midst of the track and then it just kind of instead of fading out completely goes back into an instrumental break which a few other artists I could think I've done before I think it's pretty interesting idea but overall this album for me was really disjointed whether that be the instrumentation on a particular track not really gelling all that well or you have just a lack of consistency in terms of songwriting style from cut to cut to cut this record unfortunately I thought was less dynamic than its predecessor despite it having more instrumental layers and the lyrics weren't really anything to write home about either I didn't get that on the edge of my seat feeling that hanging on every word feeling that I did on Benjamin's last album and despite the fact that Benjamin is clearly trying to be theatrical on this album this record falls short of the debut on that characteristic - I'm mostly indifferent toward this thing honestly I could see hardcore fans enjoying it or finding it mildly Pleasant but really most of the good was completely cancelled out by tracks that to me did not hit at all feeling a decent five on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful over here next to my head is another benjamin clementine review you can click on that or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel i'll catch you guys in the next one forever 
gV46UqL5GIQ,I guess we're doing it hey everyone Anthony Fantino here internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it's time for our weekly track roundup where i go over what i felt were

sort of b-sides collection phases that is out now I'm not planning on doing a formal review of it or anything like that because it's a mix of tracks that I've heard before and it's b-sides and all that however angel Olsen we enjoy her music over here at the needle drop we want to support her we think we should we think she does some good stuff so make sure to not let this a little a collection of tracks slip by it if you are a singer-songwriter fan angel Olsen fan whatever alright let's start off just by talking about the new Eminem single new Eminem track Eminem legendary MC legendary rapper new album on the way new single he's already been making tons of waves over the past year or so with anti-trump tracks and verses that bTW a little freestyle that he did that I thought was okay you know it's pretty good I thought some people were a little too cynical approaching it because you know why are you making a political drag he's not saying anything we have before but I think some of what he said needed to be said regardless so he's got this new walk on water track now for everybody who's been groaning about Eminem trying to be political and trying to get attention by being political with his most recent verses and features and so on and so forth this is a track that is purely about him this is purely about Eminem walk on water is just about Eminem and from a very personal standpoint and not that Eminem hasn't gotten personal before in his music he most certainly has but this is a personal side of Eminem that we haven't seen before because Eminem is now kind of in the third act of his career he's far beyond the heyday of his rap career he's far beyond a lot of the worst records that came out during his second act and now like many other rappers who were his contemporaries in the 90s and 2000's he's now finding himself less relevant he's finding himself with so much more in the way of just age and distance between those most classic record of his most classic records of his he's finding his fanbase waning he's finding this new generation of listeners are not quite as passionate about his music as you know he once found people to be as he mentions in this track used to have the world kind of eating out of his palm these days he gets frowned on clowned on so on and so forth and this track sort of four goes drums four goes anything in terms of any heavy direct hard-hitting hip-hop beat in favor of just some strings some pianos and Beyonce very angelically singing this pretty beautiful chorus definitely one of the better guests sung choruses that Eminem has had in a while in my opinion you know right up there with some of his best with Rihanna and so on and so forth this is definitely one of the better guest song courses on his tracks which a lot of the time end up being a little too overdone or too ritzy or just too much of a contrast from his typically gritty hard aggressive and straightforward style this was a nice change of pace from that though not so much so I think Eminem sort of bent a little bit to the style and the vibe of the song because it is very personal track there are a lot of moments on the track where he does seem to be vocally more vulnerable than usual though toward the beginning of the song he still does come through with that very erratic start/stop staccato which I don't think typically or really truly pairs with the instrumental that he has going on here however once I got more into the lyrical tone of the song but actually he was saying it felt like the marriage was a little better it felt like the combination made a bit more sense overall I liked the theme of the track there are some excuse me there are some lyrical moments on the song that I wouldn't say that I was a huge fan of like when he said like what like like tension or pressure increases like khakis talking about the creases the inward creases on khaki pants you know that it's it's bars like that that to me while certainly it is clever it's certainly clever I wouldn't deny that that is clever thinking about the tone of the song thinking about the narrative of the song it sort of takes the listener out of the mood of the track to basically make a khakis reference and that's the thing with Eminem sometimes it seems like he has no appreciation for making sure that his references even if he does come up with a clever reference making sure that his references fit the tone of the song and don't take the listener out of the story or the vibe of the song to me that's certainly an example but moving beyond that there are a lot of beautiful points on this track where Eminem not only reflects on his career but where he stands as an artist as far as his status goes in the world of hip-hop right now and also reflecting on basically how his popularity has waned over the years whether it be through a combination of just the changing sonic landscape or him just not really living up to his own standards painting himself as someone who is actually pretty insecure painting himself who is someone who's really kind of a perfectionist to the point where it seems like he's hurting his own creative process it's it's it's stuff like that that really kind of makes the song intriguing and again sort of gives listeners a different angle of mm their moments are you here pages ripping and so on and so forth to kind of add to the narrative of the track which calls back and reminds me of some recent material from Kendrick and the very beautiful and piano based instrumental here while Eminem has rapped over some glitzy stuff before there was something about the vibe of the song that read to me as being like a little McLemore and that's not to say Eminem is ripping these people off it's actually something good about Eminem that I think that he's been able to not just kind of hole up in his own little world and instead actually take on some influence and appreciate the newer generation of MCS and the sounds that they're bringing to the table and you know while Eminem certainly could use a bit of a jump start in his career especially now he doesn't seem like somebody who was stuck in his ways you know it seems like he's still an artist who is willing to progress and is willing to accept change and is willing to kind of give respect to the newer generation especially the artists who he thinks are you know lyrical especially the artists who he thinks are trying to say something with their music but you know while Eminem does try to adjust he's gonna do on his own terms and you know while this track was nice it was cool to sort of see Eminem in a different light this time around I'm not exactly sure if this is a song I'm really gonna want to go back to outside of the context of the album honestly like for me personally just as like a general music fan I just thought the song was okay like it wasn't exciting to me but if you're a hardcore Eminem fan I could see yourself really loving this song because it's gonna give you something that not a whole lot of other Eminem songs give you but if you're not that deeply invested in Eminem's personal story in his progression as an artist which maybe at one time I was but it's it's been a long time since I've cared that much about Eminem's music and you know that's not to say that I think mmm is not talented or worth listening to anymore I mean I thought the last Marshall Mathers LP was pretty good but how many disappointments did we get up until that point you know what I mean so this new Eminem record could be good and who knows maybe this new track will grow on me as I listen to it in the context of the rest of the record which should be dropping pretty soon apparently it's going to be another installment of sort of the the our series the recovery and relapse and so on and so forth so it'll be interesting to sort of see if Eminem can actually pull through in that series with a fantastic record and what the rest of the album will bring will it be as serious and as personal in tone as this new cut over here not a bad single you know not a banger though but not a bad single at all and again interesting sort of here Eminem in this light let's move on to the tracks that I thought were the worst tracks of the week the band first off SIA has a new single out titled snowman yes it's that time of year we're starting to get the Christmas music and this new track over here it's just such a humdrum average plain like nothing interesting going on Christmas song like actually there's nothing really all that Christmasy about the instrumental tone of the track like I wouldn't have even known it was a Christmas song if not for the cover art and if not for you know the the references to snowmen you know on the hook and the fact the song is titled snowman it's it's a pretty plain Christmas song honestly it does not really get me in the spirit it's not really that fun and I don't really think it's one of Sia's best from a writing standpoint either it's a pretty inconspicuous track and I don't know man I really don't know boo not from there there is a cover song of the cramped song garbage man which is performed by none other than William Shatner it's going to end up on a new dr. Demento covered in Punk compilation believe it or not and there's gonna be a lot of other artists involved in this whole thing it's gonna be a lot of crazy silly novelty songs and yes while this William Shatner cover is pretty bad it's it's kind of one of those it's so bad it's good situations like it's certainly funny it's certainly entertaining I wasn't legitimately sitting down and listening to it and on ironically enjoying it it didn't take too long for William to really kind of be out of pace with the instrumental which is you know kind of one of my biggest gripes with a lot of William Shatner's spoken-word music however it seemed like it was really given it his all and he really tried to be really gruff he really tried to be really grimy and nasty on the song and the instrumental does have some bite to it so I'm not gonna completely count this track out but I'm not really thinking of it as anything more than just a novelty track that's that might get a few other plays for me just for a laugh down the road moving on from there yung lean yung lean has a new track out which honestly is the first track from this new album cycle that actually disappointed me the title metallic intuition and this cut over here is it's really hollow it's really kind of lifeless unfortunately it kind of runs the same minimal trap spacey melodic vibe that a lot of the other teaser tracks have so far in this new album cycle but this one in particular just seems like really devoid of anything interesting vocally lyrically melodically this one just really could have gone back to the drawing board in my opinion aesthetically it's very much in line with the other tracks that have dropped and that's totally cool that's totally fine but there's not a whole lot to it honestly it's it's really kind of empty again I'll use the word Hollow and we're gonna move on to the tracks that I thought were men think of it tracks that I just thought were okay you know we're certainly worth shouting out I wasn't in love with them but I definitely wanted to a point your attention to them one this new Morrissey track Jackie's only happy when she's up on stage which is actually one of the better singles from his forthcoming album so far really slow dramatic rock instrumentation on this one Morrissey for the most part on this track really kind of making a statement with his lyrics on performance and performing and Fame and that sort of thing it's a nice track it's a nice track overall I think it could have used a little but more in the way of like looseness it did seem a little too clean-cut as far as the performance of the instrumental which was a little lifeless but you know really at the end of the day these tracks and Morrissey's the material that he's been putting out in this leg of his career is really mostly about his lyrics his vocals and if you're a hardcore Morrissey fan you're getting your you're getting what you expect on this thing and not much more not much less so it's it's decent it's fine track a little Kim took us a break yes the new little Kim track is actually kind of decent and I think a lot of people haven't noticed a little Kim if you don't know is a pretty legendary female MC you know do your research look into her stuff I mean obviously she doesn't have a whole lot of classic projects under her belt obviously however and you know it has been a while since we've heard some good stuff from little Kim but having said that this new track over here kind of fits the mold for a lot of these modern trap bangers with autotune vocals and very clean punchy hard-hitting production very dark kind of moody vibe like she's really kind of playing to the strengths of that style and doing it pretty well I'm not gonna say she's come through with the most original sound you know as far as this trend goes but for somebody who is her age and I don't mean you know to say that you can't make good music at a certain age what I mean to say is as an ageing artist who as you would expect would probably be totally out of touch with this style out of touch with the sound she actually approaches it really well so big respect to her for actually coming through the track and it's been a while since I've heard a track from her that actually sounds like contemporary and in a good way you know like actually on point contemporary not like a bad awkward totally out of touch take on what a contemporary rap song sounds like so respect a little Kim on this one it's it's actually not a bad cut Chromeo has a new song out titled juice and unfortunately it's just as flaccid and as underwhelming and not quite as sensual as a lot of the cuts that landed on you know or it's it's just as lacking in those things there's a lot of the cuts on their last record I don't know man Chromeo ever since business casual I I personally feel like they don't have the juice I personally do not feel like they have the juice the vocals are not quite as sexy the grooves are not quite as irresistible and I feel like with the whole synth funk thing while they've come out with some amazing music in the past in that style and that's their whole shtick I feel like they've almost painted themselves into a corner with it stylistically artistically because they're just really not progressing past it and as a result I feel like things are just kind of stagnating a little bit and I don't know it's it just kind of sounds like a bit of a novelty act at this point yeah I really don't know I feel like some of ChromeOS best stuff could go toe to toe with some of the best synth funk music that dropped in the 80s and now it seems like they're just kind of I don't know just keeping the torch lit because they don't have any other option but yeah I'm not really into this new track sadly it's it's ok it's it's not the worst thing I've heard this year but it's it's just not really getting me in the mood best tracks best tracks the tracks that blew me away this week tracks that I really enjoyed let's get into it ooh this new track from when Ida and it's been a while since I've heard a song from these guys that really kind of stopped me in my tracks now if you didn't know them they're an experimental rock band who really honestly album an album you you don't know what direction they're going to go in and with this new track over here God wild lead vocals fast quick punky heavy guitars sounds like a little Melvin's influence but sort of a little no wave influence - it's it's really all over the place it's really nutty it's really insane it's so bold it's really freaky and I don't know just excited to hear what the band is going to be doing lately because it seems like they're really kind of just revving the engine up for something pretty cool here the title of this song over here is titled town crier and recommended it's full of energy it's full of aggression and it's really eccentric it's really off-the-wall so shout out to these guys for coming out with a I don't know experimental rock banger this week next Kimbra top of the world Kimber's last album I thought left a lot to be desired there were some really bland tracks on there and unfortunately the record did not end up as eccentric as I kind of anticipated that it would be this new track over here however kind of throws in like a lot of primal percussion like it kind of reminds me of like a fruitier more upbeat Fever Ray of course like you know self-titled debut fever ray it's really cerebral it's really groovy her lead vocals on the track are really awesome it just could it just sounds like the influences are coming from all across the world it's got a very international sort of vibe to it and it only helps that Kimber's lead vocals on the track are fantastic the hook is great the song is structured and produced really well all around is just a great song definitely one of the best pop tracks I've heard this week next girlfriend of the year or GF oty the PC music camp is back at it with a new track the track titled poison slash tongue and this is easily one of the most experimental tracks that I've heard at a PC music and out of girlfriend of the year it's got elements of punk in it of experimental electronic music it's got elements of I don't know just like the the weird electronic bubblegum bass style that you typically get out of PC music it's really all over the place and it's kind of like a multi-faceted track it's insane it's insane and but yet it's also catchy and exciting so I don't know what else to say man like the weirdness of this song is kind of beyond words so I'm just gonna kind of leave it at that and just urge you guys to try it because it is that crazy it is that insane and it has a lot of flavor and a lot of character I'll leave it at that next and I think this is actually the last track yeah this is the last song rich chigga featuring 21 savage crisis the people at 88 rising come through the new single over here and this is actually pretty nice song and 21 savage and rich chicka is not a bad pairing at all because Savage has a pretty laid-back cold-blooded low-key style so does rich chigga and they happen on this instrumental that has a very dark sort of moody beginning but then when the chorus pops in it like blossoms in this really beautiful melodic way it kind of switches moods in a way when the hook comes in and I like that a lot I like how they can kind of introduce these melodies and just totally change the emotion of the track just in a second and I don't know that because of that it just kind of has like a sort of unique flavor to me and flows are decent it's 21 savage you can't expect too much out of them you know but again that's just kind of his aesthetic to just play it as minimally as possible and if you want to hear a very melodic minimal moody beautiful but also kind of cold-blooded rap track don't miss out on this single probably my favorite rap single of the week hands down and that's gonna be it guys those were the best the men and the worst tracks of the week and spoke on the new Eminem single - hope you guys enjoyed that I thought it was okay I thought it was decent and again hit up Lowe's Amazon and turntable lab links down there in the description to support the segment and support the channel and I'll see you guys in

ZjByhSZLZEs,hi everyone Bernie would have one here the Internet's busiest music nerd and I'm gonna do a quickie review lay down some thoughts here on the new skeptic EP vicious skepta is a UK rapper a grime artist who's been having a pretty big couple of years over here in the US collaborating with artists like the ASAP mob he had an interlude cut on Drake's new more life album mixtape playlist whatever you want to call it and his konichiwa record you know really kind of did numbers and gained a lot of attention outside of the UK at least more than your average rapper from there typically gets outside of the UK now he's got this new EP I was kind of curious considering how much of konichiwa I enjoyed and it it's a little bit of a mixed bag I mean it starts off well enough with an incredible banger instrumental kind of a sleek nice bass line on the opening cut over here still some pretty cutthroat lyrics from Skepta of course with grime music the the lyrics are not quite as violent or as dark or I guess I don't know as braggadocious in the typical sense that a lot of American artists are or at least the similes that they make or the cultural references that they make are maybe a little bit beyond what some Americans understand or what is typically the lyrical or the aesthetic as far as word choice goes for an American hip-hop listener so there may be some points here and there that that could strike some listeners as a little corny but still to me this was a quality grind track and a great way to kick off the EP and miraculously right after this cut we had the song to sit down featuring little B it's a total frickin banger B kills the hook on the track his feature is fantastic him and Skepta just land on this pretty fiery instrumental and they have good chemistry on the track and even though no security is maybe the most low-key cut on the entire EP it does have a very cold-blooded vibe to it and some of the lyrics at least from the perspective of Skepta are kind of personal that land on there but beyond that it's like the EP totally just takes this nosedive the song worst featuring section boys this has to be intentional but this track sounds exactly like no security it seems just like an extension of that track the bass line sounds nearly the same the flows sound nearly the same it has to be intentional but what it wasn't completely necessary I mean maybe not really I mean if they were gonna sound that similar why not make it a single track or why not just have section boys feature on no security like the track sounds so friggin similar the song hypocrisy has probably some of the worst lyrics and the most awkward they try to disrespect me when they're online especially but everything cool when they checked me because I'm so cool and deadly see I had to realize slowly that nobody actually knows me yeah man I got 15 different iPhones but I am so not phony what you have an artist who thinks they sound really slick on a beat or that they've written something really slick and it's just it's just so not the case and maybe there is a bit of self-awareness to what's kept is saying on this track but it doesn't stop it from feeling and sounding as awkward as it does and honestly while I was pretty interested to hear ASAP nast & ASAP rocky on the closing track over here ghost ride it is one again one of the more lackluster tracks on the EP like there's not a whole lot in terms of energy on this track very little in the way of chemistry between all these guys despite the fact that you've had connections between ASAP mob and skepta before like it just was not fireworks unfortunately you know if you give this EP shot expect the first half to be hot and then immediately it gets no hop right after that you know once you start me man I think that's when you need to cut the review off so yeah overall pretty indifferent toward the EP but that's not necessarily because there isn't good material on it there certainly is it's just that the the downsides of this EP totally cancel out the upsides I would say but man I if I would recommend any track or right off the bat it's definitely the little be cut I'm feeling like a light too decent five on this thing yeah but over here next to my head you can catch a review of konichiwa or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel and that's going to be it guys I'll catch you in the next one forever 
htvR_dBs3eg,hi everyone respect everyone here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Sam Smith album the thrill of it all I see wearing red shirt and knee don't you dare do my boy Sammy rhymes he's a beautiful cherub he sings like a hundred angels a hundred angels sitting on top of 200 angels this is the sophomore full-length album from English singer-songwriter Sam Smith who was making some pretty big waves in the music industry several years ago with a handful of hits of his debut album in the lonely hour which while there were some pappi trashy cuts off of this record like money on my mind I had a pretty big soft spot for the more dramatic glamorous more piano based tunes on the album mainly the song stay with me that was the site of Sam Smith that I really preferred and building up to this second record here that seemed like that was the the same Smith we were gonna get on this album the more mature soulful side of Sam Smith was going to shine through which I think the mainstream could use a tad more maturity right now there's not a whole lot of male songwriters out there kind of working the particular musical angle that Sam is and I was pretty impressed with some of the lead cuts going into this record like too good at goodbyes which not only has an emotionally powerful chorus with these rushing huge gospel choir sized group vocals but the lyrics of the song are pretty sweet pretty much about building up emotional armor to being mistreated in a relationship to the point where you gain the courage to remove yourself from it and you become good at goodbyes the swelling strings the somber piano it's it's a legitimately beautiful track in my opinion and it's pretty straightforward - it's as catchy as it is intensely and directly emotionally cutting so I was kind of looking forward to hearing Sam deliver this gauntlet of depression ballads on this new thing but unfortunately the deep cuts on this record are not really up to snuff in my opinion in fact I think Sam kind of exposed a lot of his shortcomings as a songwriter on this record because the album doesn't really offer much more than banal lyrics quivering vocals God the vocals they quiver they quiver they don't stop and instrumentation that tries to paint heartbreak is being like this ritzy enchanting thing now truth be told a lot of records have actually dropped like this over the years Sam Smith is not the first musician to deliver this kind of music with this kind of instrumentation with these kinds of lyrics there are many a record that is just a slow and sad and mainstream as this it's just that to hear them you would need to go to the dusty dollar record bin at the thrift shop nearest to you or like a record fare and the thing is a lot of these records have a handful of decent cuts on them but they don't hold up on the whole and I enjoy Sam's voice just as much as the next guy but it does not make up for the songwriting shortcomings on this thing say at first is probably the most drab cut on the entire record instrumentally it doesn't really go anywhere it's just kind of a moody atmosphere with barely a song stringing it all together also some of the vocal effects on this track are really annoying the song one last soul is kind of a quirky piece of pop soul but Jesus Christ this instrumental it sounds like I'm listening to a like a Mariah Carey Christmas CD circa 1994 and midnight train come on dude like I was totally on your side when Tom Petty came after you saying that stay with me just totally whipped off I won't back down and I thought you know what maybe it was subconscious maybe just the melodies are similar it's probably not that significant of an influence but now you come through with this track that's a total ripoff of Radiohead's creep so you're telling me you're just totally just mirroring these popular songs just just by accident beyond this track Sam just kind of continues a moding and pulling off a mixed bag of vocal acrobatics over this really grand slow instrumentation the songwriting unfortunately is not nearly as impressive as the vocal performances occasionally some highlights or changes of pace pop up that are of note like the very corny but kind of sassy baby you make me crazy which has all the vocal passion and lyrical cliches of love lifts us up where we belong if only the song was actually like captivating maybe 20 years down the road I will enjoy this one ironically just like I I do that Joe Cocker tune I will say though there is a vocal chemistry with Sam and Yabba on this track that I cannot deny but is there any reason that the percussion on this track is produced like I'm listening to a hip-hop beat it really kind of sucks the dynamics out of the track and this isn't even the only instance of this on this record but it's not like more intimate musical settings like the song Palace are much better like any track off of the new Adele record smokes a number of intimate songs on this record any number of tracks on like the debut or maybe even the follow-up James Blake album smoked a number of tracks on this record I still do acknowledge Sam as a vocal talent and there are at least a couple of tracks on here that I liked a bit but the tunes were just not on this album the production was not really that impressive either overall the instrumentation was kind of generic a little lifeless and to overproduced to feel legitimately personal and an intimate and subtle and unfortunately I don't feel like Sam has that many tricks up his sleeve artistically at this point so where his music is even gonna go beyond this record I don't know I'm feeling a strong four to a like five on this thing you did it you did it to my Sammy why'd you have to do it to my Sammy transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you the best what should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful or a passionate comment down in the comments if you're feeling passionate and thoughtful over here next to my head is a another review for you to check out the review of Adele's last album or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one forever 
WLDhNDAOw8k,hi everyone io thneed Ines hanim here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new converge album the dusk in us Salem Massachusetts metalcore legends converge are back with their ninth album and what can be said about converge at this point like they've written so many metalcore classics like Jesus Christ one killer record after another Jane Doe and you fail me axe to fall and no heroes and even their 90 stuff while not as fully formed as the material that they dropped last decade still had a wild and a frantic personality and character to it that still maintains to this day in their newer material over the years they've written some of the most abrasive throttling and progressive metalcore ever and they just can't stop they just keep it going now the band's last full-length record five years ago in 2012 all we love we leave behind seemed to me almost like an exercise in dynamics and melody for the band easily their most varied album so far in terms of style in motion and intensity the band was staying pretty true to their metalcore roots while working in some very obvious nods to sludge metal and post hardcore and it's fantastic even now to see the band continuing to challenge themselves and release quality albums now converge haven't dropped a major disappointment of a record yet in my opinion so as a result with this new album my expectations going into it were high and given the ever-changing landscape of loud rock with how eager converge seemed to be to step outside of their comfort zone on their last album I expected this new record over here to deliver some risks as well but simultaneously tracks like I can tell you about pain for me kind of felt like these short formulaic teasers where it was kind of converged by the numbers these singles to me did not feel as groundbreaking or as exciting as tracks like aimless arrow did five years ago and listening to this entire record now it does seem like converge is kind of going back a little bit to a more raw abrasive Mathi sound relying more on crazy grooves and difficult time signatures to keep the audience on the edge of their seat the production is a bit more brittle and thin and noisy this time around the drums are not nearly as Bumi as they were on converges last album the guitars not quite as dense and as heavy which for longtime fans might not necessarily be a bad thing because aesthetically it does seem like this record has quite a bit in common with records like no heroes or even Jane Doe but compositionally the dusk in US isn't quite as frenzied the band is still trying to write a pretty dynamic album here the song a single tear that opens the album up kicks the entire record off with these frenzied drums these angular anthemic guitar leads this intense metalcore instrumentation eventually crumbles to this heart-wrenching vocal break it builds from there in a really cohesive way into this amazing ascending set of drums and guitar riffs and leads then you have this refrain about a single teardrop falling and these noodley epic guitars that like it's amazing that converge on this track is really writing one of their most finely crafted and detailed songs like the band brings this incredible visceral energy on this track and many other tracks but when you actually get into the Nitty Gritty of this song and many others on here like they are so detailed they're so intricate they're so methodically assembled but it doesn't necessarily seem like that on the surface it's almost like the band is just so wild and angry and aggressive that they're just like you know pulling all of this out of the ether following tracks like under duress have these amazing empowering gang vocals this cycling hypnotic head-banging riff arkhipov calm if I'm pronouncing that correctly has these amazing syncopated rapid-fire drums and guitars that play throughout the track that are really like their critics I and Jakob bannon's impassioned shouts throughout the cut are incredible to his monstrous screams just sliced through the insanity of the instrumentation as usual and the cruel cruel world bit on the song wildlife is easily one of the catchiest choruses on the entire record and I can tell you about pain honestly within the context of the album has really grown on me and digging deeper into the lyrics of the album it almost seems like the song is about trying to survive and get away from some kind of abusive relationship not necessarily a romantic one it could be read maybe that way but it seemed like the the relationship could have been applied to a lot of different scenarios the point that I'm trying to make is on these four tracks I just mentioned and on other songs here the band is writing this vein popping metalcore music that still has some really catchy details woven into it or just some really interesting lyrical or musical ideas that really kind of stick with me very little of this album goes by in a blur as much meat-and-potatoes metalcore does but converge despite their rage despite the the frenzy of their music it really kind of comes down to detail detail detail case in point the song broken by light which i think is a testament to just how much musically the band can pack into one minute and 40 seconds there are only a few tracks here that while they were angry and loud and aggressive didn't leave much of a compositional impression on me and that would probably be cannibals and I of the quarrel the one track that really did start to test my patience though had to have been the seven minute title song on this thing which features these lifeless lead vocals and a kind of drab guitar passage at the very start that don't do too much for me but I do like the way you have these ghostly tones kind of swelling at a few different points in the song behind the vocals behind the rhythm guitars it's got a bit of a post-rock atmosphere to it and a pretty heavy powerful ending and I get the record needed a centerpiece and I get that the band is trying to be more versatile I understand and accept that however there has to be some kind of functional middle ground between extreme anger extreme volume and extreme emptiness extreme which I think the song thousands of miles between us comes closer to achieving this track is one of the more loke cuts in the tracklisting here and it has it's underwhelming moments too but the vocals do reach a more passionate high toward the end and by vocals I mean the cleanly sung vocals not the screams it almost turns into like this sad dejected alt-rock song with like metal guitars almost kind of reminding me of Code Orange a little bit but you know it has its own vibe and there are a few other experiments in the tracklisting here that I think panned out really well like on the song Merc and Mara which features like these tents spazzy shots of guitar over these like really primal bass lines and drum beats it has a really odd structure for a song like a really odd just tension based foundation but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and then you have the very groovy and sinister trigger which has just this head bobbing devilish funk to it that is kind of odd and totally unexpected for converge and they totally pull it off with their usual level of aggression and with their tight flawless performance style the ending of this album is somewhat solid the final tracks segue into one another pretty nicely however I wouldn't say reptilian is one of the best finishers of any converge record I feel like it is one of these sludgy er heavier more harmonious tracks on the album's so it almost kind of became the de facto closer on this thing as a result it's okay it's a little anticlimactic though I will give the song kudos for having some of the best lyrics on the entire record I love the themes on this track of just endless war and control and a higher evil power sort of just playing things down below like it's a chess game but still I can't help but feel like this song could have landed at least at a few different spots in the tracklisting and the album really kind of could have run the same all that being said though I think this is another incredibly solid and super enjoyable converge album like the band just keeps putting numbers on the board and the band keeps writing some of the best music that this genre has to offer they're still one of the most unique bands in loud rock in in rock in general and I feel like the lyrical theme on this album of violence and a lack of compassion in mankind in general hit even harder than they usually do given the social climate we're in the midst of I love this thing everything that's great about it is pretty clear pretty on the surface so it shouldn't be too difficult for anybody who is typically into this style of music or have appreciated converges work in the past to enjoy what the band is doing here I think the record doesn't really come off with as strong and artistic character as all we love or Jane Doe or you fail me but even though converge kind of played things as to be expected they still play to their strengths this Scylla very well produced album it still have incredibly performed album and some of their best material today lands on this thing I'm feeling a light too decent eight on this record transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it to like to like please subscribe

iQMN0dTmbnw,hi everyone Anthony Fantana here the Internet's busiest music nerd bet bet you thought you'd never see one of these again yes it's time for another episode of it came from band camp where I go over a series of releases that are currently weirding me out or making me scratch my head or should I even scratch my chin on the band camp platform because you know you could pretty much upload anything onto there and as a result there are interesting results let's ease ourselves into this new episode of it came from band camp with a new release from smokers lungs sandwich the internet died it's it's a single 19 minute track created by Leia Cozart Lyle Bernstein and Efrem Cooper ray william Johnson's head is on the cover with a like he's in a coffin with a menu the description says smokers lungs sandwich play freely improvised Noise music we're from Long Island that's about it alright let's let's do it [Music] let's try to pop a little deeper into this and see where this progresses [Music] well they definitely do deliver on the noise I also love that apart from their instruments they're also delivering raw energy and cosmic vibes so says the the instrumental description here I mean it's it seems like some fun noisy music some low fights and lo-fi aesthetics here that hurts so much this next record over here looks like it's gonna pique my interest these guys are from Paris France so says their Bandcamp here's a beautiful image of the band it's it's an action shot you know it's it's not often you get a nice action shot and sort of a band promo photo so shout out to them for that the name of this project or you know so it says in these parentheses and your night is your shadow a fairytale piece of land to make our dreams and they label it as being experimental ambient Arabic field recordings free jazz free rock krautrock noise psychedelic Subrosa paris and we have a handful of cuts here a lot of personnel released in april of this year let's give it a shot could be interesting [Music] [Music] already just a minute into this single track I'm catching those elements of krautrock experimental rock it's a little dark and post-punk II - it's kind of jammy but I'm catching those Arabic influences as well which is actually pretty cool it's actually a kind of cool style at the band is going on here could definitely see post-rock fans getting into this but what I like about it is that it's not just giving in to all those post-rock cliches I'm not even I'm not even sure if I would say that's even a direct influence here but but again I could sort of see that audience crossover with this that's like a five minute cut here's a seven minute cut not that we're gonna hear all seven minutes but you know let's hear what the band does when they give themselves a bit more breathing room to kind of build things up maybe ooh I like that loose those keys that is cool jump you know sometimes you jump in it goes hard but I'm happy about that [Music] look at this yeah this track is definitely more post rocky than its predecessor but still it's it's pretty sick this is pretty sick this one's very [Music] [Music] I like this quite a bit I'll put this I'm put this one in my pocket this one's going on my pocket this was pretty sick all right next we're diving into a band camp from someone who goes by the name of Mexican guy so so this page says he's literally from Mexico and the title is vaporwave is just 80s music slowed down and you know it see even people from Mexico know it I've said it plenty of other people have said it it's pretty much common knowledge at this point the description says this is an example of how stupid vaporwave fits but I really like some of these slowdown songs tags being 80s alternative experimental chillwave echo jams feature funk mall soft plunder phonics retro see Punk synth wave vapor vapor wave let's give the track hello Doctor please lift my face a shot sounds like vapor wave name okay you you you you you literally cannot just take a song and slow it down and have it be vapor wave you have to like you know you have throw a little more effects on there you got to chop out the bits that people actually want to hear you got to loop those and kind of create a funky and nostalgic jam with it I mean listen I I have shit on my fair share of basic ass vaporwave but it it requires a little more effort than this just a smidge alright let's move on to our next project from one gimp gash this project is beautifully titled Britney Spears on crystal meth love the love the cover here love the red and yellow and black sort of color scheme here not much to the band camp itself I guess you can get a limited edition CDR of this for nine dollars or you can buy the digital album for eight and what I'm told is that this is just kind of a series of Britney Spears songs that are like chopped and screwed and sort of altered to the point where they just sound really weird and who can deny these track titles give me more crystal meth toxic meth fumes oops I did crystal meth again lucky theis crystal meth crystal meth bitch crystal meth drives me crazy hit my meth pipe one more time I think that's the track we need to try first I'm sleeping here wondering has the song started yet is this the is this the start I mean I technically it has started but is this merely an introduction or are we are we truly into the madness that this track is going to deliver for the entirety of its length already I'm gonna guess the latter whoa this is uh this is kind of intense but so I kind of fucks with this I kind of fucks with a heavy let me give a shot to toxic meth fumes that's that's where I'm gonna go with this next [Music] I dig this you know this it's I don't know man I just like a lot of weird sound edit plunder phonics noise experimental you know sample stuff and this is this is definitely kind of my alley I mean it's it's obviously a little odd it's it's obviously a little difficult to engage with as far as like you know a formal review or something like that but what give - is doing fucks with it i fucks with it and it seems like she has like a little bit of a an art blog spot - that's pretty interesting by the way I've moved on to another project this one by an artist whoop head clubs meeting room and rare plants this project is set to be from Japan and the aesthetics of the cover art on this band camp are incredible a few YouTube links over here SoundCloud link designed by Hiroki Yamasaki and the tag say experimental pop Japan let's see how experimental this pop gets I have a feeling it's not really going to be pop it's mostly just going to be experimental and that's completely fine but I just I just have that feeling also love the CDR here packing leaves into the CDR case is smart and beautiful and an interesting way to approach DIY packaging people who are sort of doing their own shit very smart very cool support that lets go [Music] this story should last about as long as you can hold your breath there's a little bit longer okay it's like a self-help CD deads I do I need to hold my breath the whole time [Music] [Music] the sound designer is crazy [Music] [Music] I mean I do this track quite a bit it's pretty interesting I mean there's obviously not a whole lot of cohesion about it in the traditional sense but it's all very odd and fringe and the sounds are really vivid and crazy and it's it feels like it has a sense of place I'm not just listening to a piece of sound art like I'm being immersed here into some artists sort of world I'm gonna jump to one more track before we hop onto the next project this one is titled sacrifice oh nice good names [Music] [Music] I feel like I am in like an astronaut movie and I've gone into a black hole in the black hole sort of ends up becoming like this Time Warp through my entire life and and this is the soundtrack this is the soundtrack this is the soundtrack to that time war it's my whole life just flashing before my eyes and just one big rush and I like it it's pretty interesting I'm gonna I'm gonna put this one in my pocket to God sometimes I wish I could just spend all day on Bandcamp just bullshitting and just listen to no random crap this next album is from a solo project by the name of giant claw the album is soft channel it comes from a musician who I've been familiar with for a while now Keith Rankin who has put up some releases on this band camp that I have listened to before the cassette for this is out now on orange milk records whose exploits I have followed for a little bit now and the tracklist is essentially soft channel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and let's give track 3 a shot and see what's up keep in mind the tags here are electronic MIDI experimental putter phonics and again it's orange milk records so you know you're going to kind of expect this kind of weird plunder phonics electronic music which we seem to be covering a lot in this episode but I don't mind that because I think that stuff is pretty interesting so you know it's this is a very vaporwave friendly episode I would say the most vapor episode of it came from band camp yet [Applause] [Music] this is beautiful it's rich it's entertaining it's crazy it's unpredictable but yeah it's also kind of engaging their elements of it that do have you know patterns to them so there's kind of like a logical flow but yet it's orbited by all this insanity there's a lot of cool things about this I'm gonna give one more track a shot this intrigues me this intrigues me it gives me a curiosity boner how do these guys come up with these sounds this is not the first time I've heard like Peno people editing stuff like this pulling together do you grab like a special effects CD and you're just like like it's pretty insane like the aesthetic ever reminds me a lot of OneNote Rick's point numbers are plus 7 but it's it's it's just so off the wall it's it's just so crazy a couple more left here we have sport ball mega teams the game day EP which austin describes to me as a post jock jam EP to get you pumped for the big game let's let's give a shot to the song it's game time God what is this gonna be I have a feeling this is gonna make me want to die it's okay that's pretty sick that's kind of sick obviously it's a little ironic but it's it's sick okay okay I respect it also a shout out to deejay ballgame who this EP features what a guy let's close up shop with one more with one Tennessee Luke with this play detective EP you may remember Luke he was like an extra more of a regular I guess on Tim and Eric awesome show great job and this new project of his is out now on the David liebe Hart band camp and this play detective track it's like a new single he has out and this this release on Bandcamp it's sort of like a little bit of an EP with it with a few extra tracks some remixes and that sort of thing let's give this play detective song a shot and I've already heard it it's it's a beautiful ballad [Music] the life and trip around [Music] as odd and as silly as it is and as encouraged as I am to you know giggle of this a little bit this is some legitimately intriguing like outsider music you know it's it's very rough around the edges it's very low fie it's it's not I would say conventional in almost any form and the lyrics are a little bit creepy too so uh you know a lot of good quality good outsider music qualities here the links to all these band camps are down there below guys thank you for watching this has been another installment

FMfw5VuQgNI,hi everyone vitamin water is over hi sugar water here take a multi for Christ's sake the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Reena saw a Yama EP Reena give me that back give it back I don't wanna give it here no I wanna keep it stop being a naughty baby boy okay good to have this back because the couch couch Estus stole my yellow flannel story line was really was was really honestly it was going nowhere it was going nowhere I'm not I'm not I'm not a writer I'm not a master of script so let's just not even pretend that that's the case Reena saw Yama is a uk-based pop singer and this is her big debut EP she recently linked up with one of my favorite songwriters and producers mr. Clarence clarity whose album no now is one of my favorite records of 2015 easily one of the most creative glitchy and experimental pop records of the decade and I've been looking forward to his new record enjoying some of the new material that he's been dropping but recently I've been seeing he's been working with Reena and I didn't know who she was before this he's just like hey I'm producing these tracks for this person check it out okay I will and then I go to listen to it and it's like because the creative chemistry between these two on this EP was so good Riina's voice has this fantastic like late 90s early 2000s pop R&B flavor to it it really revives the golden years of artists like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears it's totally out of the era of dial-up internet and Total Request Live pop divas and this material they were coming out with together they just kind of enhanced one another's talents Clarence is giving Reena this production that while it is immediate and very catchy and sweet and melodic it's subtly glitchy and experimental very intricate and interestingly layered and then arenas vocal abilities kind of allow Clarence to indulge in this very straightforward this very true form of pop music in a way that I don't think he's been able to before he's not just simply implying pop music with arena he's legitimately making fantastic pop music with Reena especially on the song take me as I am a true pop banger and empowerment anthem where the lyrics detail relationship troubles having a hard time dealing with being manipulated emotionally fighting to be yourself fighting to get more than just the status quo out of a relationship and not only is the beat in the instrumental on this thing invigorating but also as Reena is singing about fighting during the day fighting at night becoming more powerful it's just like it's just really electrifying it's encouraging the song maybe Supastar is a wonderful opener to this thing it's one of those personal humanizing pop star ballads think Britney Spears lucky the themes are loneliness in the spotlight the song features these glistening synth leads really strong vocal melodies it's kind of cute it's kind of cuddle a bowl there's some light rock guitars kind of pulsating during the hook a bit of Riina's English accent pops in as she's singing the chorus on this thing say you Bastad it's just a light sweet song but then the instrumental and Riina's vocals just kind of add a new depth to it 10 20 40 has kind of an 80's flair to the instrumental through the groove through the gated drums through the soaring guitar solo through some of the glistening synth leads but then the lyrics take a darker tone on here where she's referencing what seems like opioid addiction with ten twenty forty being different potencies like oxycontin while the verses on here read like somebody who's making some kind of questionable decisions and that same musical decades seems to be a reference point on the song to be able to tattoo you have more roaring guitar chords on the hook decisive really bright vocal harmonies in the lyrics sound like somebody's singing about their younger selves when they were more carefree and had less responsibilities Reena even seems to slip in some melodies that sound like they're coming from the world of j-pop on the song time out I just realized the camera moves off the green screen and now I'm pissed off about it oh wait no I'm not I'm not hit I'm not hitting the person I'm hitting see it's a green screen I'm hitting the green screen ah but Japan has actually had a pretty considerable tradition taking the sounds of pop and R&B from America and kind of twisting it into their own sort of style artists like crystal kay are kind of a prime example and then we have an incredible duet with none other than Shamir on this thing who you might remember from his record ratchet that came out a little while ago he actually has a new record out that's that's worth hearing and this duet goes over really well like Shamir's vocals on this song are super expressive amazing guest singer and when him and rayna's vocals tie together in the second half into this really amazing ascending melody it's just so powerful it's really just an orgasm achhi and then the closer cyber Stockholm Syndrome is this fantastic track detailing loneliness and love and romance in the internet age there have been quite a few songs kind of tackling this topic recently and I've loved nearly every one because I find it to be an interesting topic the way that the internet and social media has changed the game of love but also God the instrumental is fantastic one of the best on the entire EP like the whole song launches into another galaxy it literally sounds like it's in space in the second half I'm not sure what to say about this EP outside of just that I wish there was more to it it's certainly not disappointing it's actually a very satisfying EP a good number of tracks on here a few decent interludes it's just over 20 minutes it's not really a bad runtime I mean five more track on this thing and it would have just been an incredible album but hey you know what I'll settle for an incredible EP I am literally feeling like a strong II to l89 on this thing it's it's that fantastic it's easily the best pop music I've heard all year it's inventive it's catchy it's dynamic it's well produced sung written and the lyrics are pretty good like they're far from just vapid lyrics it's very bright bold enjoyable pop music there's so many details and interesting qualities to it that you can really dive into it and think hard about what you're listening to but it's also super sweet and accessible so it can kind of be enjoyed on the surface as well almost just as much this thing is great I'm gonna leave it at that transition have you given this EP a listen did you love did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what

FPeMy9v0_oI,ah hi everyone here's the ham here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a few of the new Julian Baker album turn out the lights Julian Baker is a Tennessee singer-songwriter this is her second full-length album her sophomore record it came out recently on Matador Records now despite missing out entirely on her debut album a few years ago which when I look back on the reception to that it seemed pretty hype but I I don't even remember I don't even recommend I remember you guys asking me to talk about it shame on you however I was pretty intrigued by this new album over here not only because I was getting a ton of recommendations for it but I thought some of the teaser tracks are pretty sweet the song appointments or the title track on this thing both of which made a somewhat big emotional splash with me both of these tracks were these beautiful patient slowly swelling indie ballads that were fused with like a touch of post-rock and slow core the way both of these tracks built up was really beautiful both of their instrumental climaxes were fantastic Julian Baker's vocals which didn't really win me over at first on these tracks ended up building up into these immense passionate heartbreaking highs when she reaches into her upper register her vocals get so expressive and powerful so there's definitely a great performance element there though I wouldn't say that Julian's vocals are the most distinct on the block even now after listening to this record multiple times I might have a hard time sort of pulling them out of a lineup if she were shoulder to shoulder with a few similar singers and as I listened to the album more and more I kind of got a grip of Julian's lyrics and learned that that's really kind of her calling card that's really kind of her selling point so many songs on here detailing Julian's struggles with depression and self-doubt failure being emotionally empty or just the fight to be a functional human being when you have these tendencies toward being dysfunctional and the tracks that are the best on this thing have this slow raging burn to them that is is like like a bonfire growing higher and higher and higher and I'm just hypnotized by the flames but I did end up being somewhat underwhelmed by the full scope of the record these linear gently escalating songs are kind of what Julian does best and after a while that becomes a tad formulaic the record starts dishing out cuts that kind of pale in comparison to the songs that do it best like the song shadowboxing or the track televangelist which aren't bad but the highs certainly aren't as high as they could be and then when the songs on this thing veer into the direction of maybe a more humble ballad the album really kind of loses steam there too because Julian's nondescript vocal style and very plain slightly reverb instrumentation aren't really enough to keep things interesting like on the song happy to be here or hurt less or one of the most tedious tracks in the tracklisting even the very steady and flavorless guitar chords on this thing become really really mind-numbing there strummed really lifelessly and that's maybe one of my biggest disappointments with the record like texturally it's so average for anyone who enjoys the tambour of a unique guitar tone or a closely mike piano or a singer that has a bit of an eccentric flair to his or her voice there's almost nothing here but again the lyrics do sort of make up for it here and there they aren't about anything revolutionary I would say however just the tone of them the lyricism does occasionally crush the soul like this particular line saying I'm an amputee with a phantom touch leaning on an invisible crutch pinned to the mattress like an insect - styrofoam calling out of my bedroom alone I know what's in my cannibal chest that's been dug out like a strip mine till there's nothing left hold the course in between my ears until I go deaf that remind me exactly what I am every chance they get which is probably one of the most metal lyrics 2017 honestly like that's some dark death metal and then you get tracks like hurt less where Julian is very descriptive in delivering to the audience these desires of wanting to die in a car crash out of just a sheer lack of self-interest these suicidal tendencies that pop up on the record here and there are really sharp even though again I find the instrumentation and the male/female vocal harmonies to be very plain like I could slip them into a Twilight movie soundtrack and probably not get much in the way of complaints however I do find the piano song claws near back to be a spectacular closer for this album and I do like it when a record begins strong and end strong and while I do have quite a few complaints about this record I do see the hype I do see the appeal I think there are a lot of great fundamentals here the sound is kind of average but the mix is well balanced and the instrumentation is pretty well recorded when it swells it's very full and gorgeous kudos on the song structures too it's not easy to sort of write these long linear songs that feel like they're lengthier than they are and for many of them to hit so hard emotionally and be so gratifying some of the melodies are really quality on this thing and consistently I'm pretty impressed with the lyrics there's just not enough in the way of variation style Flair or grace on this record to really kind of get me excited it's almost like the depression that's fueling this album is also kind of impeding its full potential but overall I do think this was a pretty good record and definitely were at the time of any big singer-songwriter fan especially if you are paying very close attention to the lyrics and you do like a little bit of a dark depressive edge coming out of them I'm feeling a strong six to a light seven on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you loved educating what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should i review next with the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful in-depth comment down in the comments if you're feeling thoughtful and you want to communicate some opinions and ideas about the record yourself please you're invited I encourage it over here next to my head is another review you can check out or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel make sure to hit the reminder bell - and I will see you guys in the next one Anthony Fantana Julian Baker forever 
PoJehADEZ4g,ah hi everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd doing a quickie review of the new in tongues EP from Joji aka George Miller aka pink guy aka filthy Frank so on and so forth a lot of you guys may know this dude through his YouTube antics and of course through pink season and other records that he's dropped under another alias that is much more crude and comedic and mimetic but recently he's been dropping music that has a much more somber and serious tone to it under this Joji name on the 88 rising label he dropped a preview single from this thing will he not too long ago did a video review for it and walked away from the track feeling mostly indifferent there were things that I loved about it there were things that not so much I liked the lo-fi and very melodic and somber tone of the track but was kind of let down by the lack of passion or really anything interesting or intriguing coming out of the vocal performances on the track George seeing fit to switch pretty much jest to singing as opposed to rapping which he's done before under this moniker and under the pink guy name of course so now we're getting kind of a loaf I low-key super bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh style of R&B music and that style that aesthetic is pretty uniform throughout this very short EP you get four more tracks and interlude and that's pretty much it for the entire thing you do get some variation here and there on this thing but it's not always for the best the song pills instrumentally is maybe my favorite on the entire EP the way that the instrumentation kind of subtly flourishes and swells on that track provides some of the greatest instrumental contrast on the entire EP which I liked a lot the song demon's features one of the goofiest and most questionable vocal performances on the entire thing that just sounds sort of silly and taking things down as somewhat comedic and self-deprecating route on the song bitter didn't necessarily end up kind of selling this EP to me though I did kind of like the beat acoustic guitar combo on that track for the most part I like the bedroom very homespun production aesthetic on this thing I just don't really think it goes anywhere structurally like these tracks really could have benefited from being built out a little bit more in terms of bigger choruses or just different facets on a particular track to me a lot of these songs just kind of run in a circle until they're just sort of over I don't mind the moody tone of the record but I feel like it kind of stands in the way of the music actually sort of going anywhere again aesthetically I don't mind what Joe Gee is going for here but there's not a whole lot to it beyond its moody vibe and those are pretty much my thoughts on the EP now I know that George is going to have another EP out very soon under the Joji name like toward the beginning of next year from what I understand could be totally wrong on that but I'm hoping that it's a change of pace somewhat but I'm not really banking on that if I'm going to guess I would probably assume that we're going to get five or six more tracks in very much the same vein that we're hearing here and if that ends up being the case I'm probably going to walk away from that collection of tracks feeling pretty much the same way that I did here again I'm pretty much feeling pure indifference on this thing it doesn't really strike me as awful it doesn't really strike me as great it just kind of feels like I don't know a bit of musical wallpaper to me I'll see you guys in the next one over here next to my head is a review that I did of pink guys Pink's season you can click on that hit that up or you can click on the link to subscribe to this channel and that'll be it I'll see you guys in the next one thanks for watching forever 
OiI54tt1p-U,hey hey hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here the Internet's busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and it is time for another weekly track roundup where I go over what I felt were the best and worst tracks of the week now man I'm just really excited to get all these tracks out there of course I have to mention a few things of course our Amazon Associates link which prior on many an episode of the weekly track roundup I have said that if you go on Amazon you click on the link down there in the description box if you live in the US anything you buy we get kickback from it that has changed now the link works if you're in Canada if you're in the UK it actually works now for a bulk of mainland Europe and it actually works for a Japan as well so anybody in any of those countries you too can now participate in using the link and anything you were going to buy anyway on Amazon give us some kickback from it supports the channel supports this segment and of course we have a similar thing going on with the good people over at turntable lab where if you click on the link down there in the description box you can buy some audio equipment turntables speakers colorful pressings of records that i've reviewed on the channel spoil yourself with a little bit of music with the gift of music and finally the one and only the needle drop turntable slip mats are back they are down there in the description box via the link to our support page you can get them as is you can get them initialed by yours truly with some review notes sent in the mail as well last time I sent stickers instead of review notes and I forgot to swap out the review notes tag and I apologize for the confusion over that but this time I'm legitimately doing the review notes it was just a sort of mistake on my part last time and also anybody who picks up one of these slip mats will be in the running to win one of two copies of the new Kendrick Lamar record on vinyl and it is signed by Kendrick Lamar himself I bought myself a signed copy they sent them in a way where you have sort of the signed cover which is an actual like cover of it's like an actual cardboard you know cover of the record and then they actually sent the vinyl this the old vinyl with it it's how mine came it's how the two other copies came I don't know what was their sort of decision-making process as far as doing it that way but that's the way that they did it so you do get the sign to Kendrick Cover you do get you to get a vinyl copy of damn it you know if you are chosen at random to win and again the only worry the only way that you're put in the running to win that is if you pick up one of these uh slip maps and that's it let's just get into the tracks now now that's all been mentioned I do want to shout out a mark kozilek live track featuring the magic magic orchestra which is linked down there in the description box which is very good you guys should check it out I didn't put it any of these sections I just wanted to shout it out all right let's get into the worst tracks of the week the worst ones the songs that kept me awake at night that hurt hurt my insides the inside of my brain first our boy Tim Heidecker whose music I've enjoyed on numerous occasions really loved that funny mar-a-lago track he had about Trump he's been writing a lot of political tracks lately a lot of tracks that have kind of reflected on the whole Trump presidency and Trump culture and this new one of his to dump for suicide is easily the most like I don't know desperate for attention and edgy of all of his anti Trump songs so far I I don't get exactly what he was trying to go for with this track it just makes him seem like he's not writing an anti Trump song or that he's not writing a piece of political satire that's going to enlighten people or actually change anything it just kind of seems like he's sort of self aggrandizing here and trying to applaud himself for taking a shot at the like easily the dumbest president we've ever had in American history but whatever it's it's a pretty slow mediocre uninteresting song to be honest equally unimpressed with the new Taylor Swift track call it what you want the lyrics on this cut are easily the grossest of all the songs that she's come out with thus far in this new album cycle however it's not like the the lyrical top have differed all that much from song to song it seems like she's so like grossly obsessed with the whole falling out that she had with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian like a while back and then she sort of disappeared out of the public eye for a little bit and who cares it happened so long ago it was so dumb it was so annoying it was like one of the most useless and trashy pieces of celebrity news to come out that year and I'm just I'm not I'm not interested who cares like literally who cares like how can you be this obsessed with it that it sounds like you're basically conceptualizing this entire album around it it's it's really dumb and it's really Petty and just write a pop song people want to hear Jesus Christ moving on from there wasn't really that into the new jam track unfortunately with production by Rick Rubin musically and lyrically I think there are a lot of good things going on but there's just I don't know some really annoying production choices and on top of it DRAM is chipmunk throughout the entire song which I think takes away a lot of the eccentric and interesting qualities of his voice he's already a very interesting rapper and singer he doesn't need this extra weird little bit of effects on his voice to make things interesting to make things like listenable in fact I would say the chipmunk defects on his voice the pitch shifting does the exact opposite so didn't really care for it was just a really annoying cut and minus points for having your phone in low-power mode which is terrible to get your phone out of low-power mode please you're a 44% stop messing up dude but that song is called cheeky fabrics with fabrics it's linked down below maybe you liked it more than me here are the tracks that I was kind of met on sort of on the fence with but certainly felt like they were worth shouting out and pointing some attention to you guys might dig him a little bit more than me does the new young fathers track this track titled Lorde is a very passionate a very low fie a very textured and a very emotive and beautiful ballad it's very nice on the ears it's very pretty even though it is a little rough it is a little grimy and it's a tad short I do wish it was longer however there were kind of a lot of short lo-fi ballads off of their last full-length record white men are black men too I believe it was titled and you know maybe this track will gain a little bit more weight with me as I hear it in the context of the rest of the album aesthetically it sounds very nice I just wish there was a little bit more to it it's not that satisfying as a single song in my opinion but again could could grow on me on the record new static select a track he has a record out on the way and of course this new single of his features run the jewels killer mic LP they each have a verse on here it's a smooth jazzy instrumental it's not the best I've heard from any of these guys but it's cool to hear them colliding on a new single moving on from there pine grove has a new track out which a lot of people in hyping up this single to me the single is excuse me titled intrepid and by the way the static selected track is titled put the put jewels on it featuring run the jewels haha but this new Pine Grove track intrepid have never really been able to get into Pine Grove never really could get anything emotionally out of the Bands music and that just kind of continues for me here like it just sounds like some very distant somewhat lo-fi very average emo and indie rock to my ears I mean some of the vocals are pretty emotive but it's it's not really hitting me you know and neither did the last record I guess I'm just kind of pointing out to you guys that a new Pine Grove track is out if in fact that sort of thing interests you I don't think it's terrible it just doesn't really do much for me the new Miguel track is all right it's not amazing in my opinion but I do think there are some significant improvements to his sound here when compared to a lot of the cuts from his last record this is a pretty vibrant synth funk track instrumentally Miguel's vocals are very poppy very expressive he seems like he's really kind of dominating the track with you know sort of like a boyish charm almost it's it's got a good vibe it's got a good energy you know and looking forward to sort of seeing if he goes further in the direction it's pretty intriguing track in my opinion didn't blow me away but I thought it was decent God flesh has a new track out that pretty much is a little God flesh by the numbers not quite as abrasive and as heavy as a lot of their early stuff but if you're looking for that nice heavy very ugly grimy hit of industrial rock to kind of just shock you shack you alive you're gonna want to hear this one the single is titled excuse me post self and Flying Lotus has a new track out titled post requisite which i thought was kind of an average song for him I mean there was some kind of quirky sound effects that we're flowing throughout the track here and there but for the most part the bass lines the beats the way that they grooved kind of the pace of the track it all it all kind of seemed like you know very much Flying Lotus by the numbers but um you know who knows this new album of his that he has on the way could totally blow me away and you know provide some more interesting moments deeper into the record DJ premier has a new track out with ASAP ferg it has kind of a boom back quality too of course because that's just DJ premiers mo ASAP ferg does his best to adhere to that rap style being from new york it doesn't sound like it's that awkward for him to do so even though he's not often recording on top of that type of production I would just say what kind of holds this track back is that he's not the most lyrical emcee on the block and therefore over this kind of beat the the lyrical performance it's just kind of okay you know but it is cool to hear ASAP for continuing to be versatile it's cool to hear DJ premier continuing to link up with young artists I want to shout out the new CyHi the prynce track over here featuring Kanye West - side hook is decent Kanye West's verse has stirred quite a bit of commotion this past week because of uh you know some of the mentions he has in the verse sigh hi is okay I guess it's cool to hear that these two have linked back up after they had a little bit of a falling out you know I'm not going to over hype it it's not amazing but it's it's it's certainly listenable it's certainly listenable moving on from there believe it or not and this is like maybe been the most unlikely and surprising thing all week and I do recommend this track I do recommend to listen because it is really odd but alt-j took maybe one of my least favorite tracks from the new record and they had the band Code Orange like remix it and now it's this heavy sort of industrial kind of metallic revision of the song and it doesn't sound anything like the original and it's totally whacked out and I I just recommend it it's kind of insane I recommend hearing the original and then comparing this and just you know on its own it's a decent it's a decent track but it's just kind of mind-blowing to hear the revision just the the changes this track underwent to become what it is here alright and let's move into the track so they thought were the best tracks of the week let's make no more buts about it but BAM Sharon Jones & the dap-kings have a new wonderful passionate tear inducing and inspiring gospel flavored track out titled call on God and Sharon Jones piano performance here is great her vocal performance here is fantastic you know it's it's unfortunate that we lost her in you know such an untimely way rest and peace of course but a lot of this stuff that has been sort of teasing toward this posthumous record that's gonna be coming out very soon is like some of the best stuff the band has recorded it's just unfortunate that it's going to be released under these conditions but still no better time than now with this forthcoming record to celebrate Sharon Jones as an artist as the enigmatic singer that she was and as one of the most significant torch bearers for the sound of classic soul today in at least in this day and age anyway moving on from there OTT has a new single out titled these three things now on is a band hailing from Canada I believe or at least I know that they were affiliated with constellation records for a little while and just want to double-check that really quick don't want to mess that up on you guys because I I know that these locations are important yes they're from not they're from Montreal I knew that really loved the band's last record and I thought that they had sort of increased the instrumental performance on their the vocal performances and the lyrics were more interesting the band's music is like really art rocky post-punk II it's really erratic and very wordy very poetic and this new track of theirs kind of has a bit of a dancey almost new wavy kind of feel to it but I feel like they maintain a lot of their eccentric qualities in the process of making an overall more accessible sound and I love that I love it when a band can pull that off you know I hate it when groups go more mainstream they take their sound they try to dumb it down for a lower common denominator and in the process everything that made the group's special just kind of disappears not the case on this new track over here and music video is completely whacked I'll say that but I love the groove on this - on this thing love the danceable groove I think the change-up and the vocals is really nice - and just again just the the grooves the instrumental flavor it's still weird it's still odd it's more danceable now more poppy but still a lot of fantastic and sort of left-field qualities and oughts music that continued make the band special moving on from this track over here nerd has a new track out titled lemon featuring Rihanna and it's frickin amazing the production of course is off the friggin walls super groovy super fruity super colorful and Rihanna has this excellent rap performance like this excellent and long like she dominates a lot of the track you know who knew she had a dinner she totally dominated the track Pharrell you know of course on the track is fantastic I really don't have anything negative to say about this track honestly it's just non-stop fun it's very gutsy and it's nice to hear a group that you know sort of made a name for themselves years and years and years ago actually kind of come back with a debut single that just is a spline - man it's a friggin splash I'm gonna leave it at that excellent single excellent single really liked it Kemba FK a/yc the cynic has a new track out super lyrical super jazzy excellent hip-hop track support this dude is easily one of the best in the underground right now a lot of you may have remembered him when Kendrick like linked up with him for a little bit and and I feel like he's fallen off the radar of a lot of people since then please do not let that happen this dude is a super talented dude and he has a new project on the way please do listen to it I have no doubt in my mind that it is going to be worth your while moved on from there gorillas have a new track out a new post humans track like nearly every single song that comes out after the release of this album is like better than most of the material on the album like it would have improved the record so much to cut some of the worst material and put some of the the better tracks on there including this cut over here featuring little Sims garage palace and you know sure doesn't have a strong hook most of the song is like little sins just like rapid-fire rapping and totally killing the instrumental but the instrumental is actually quite groovy colorful funky very much like chewing gum it's very fun it's very sweet and just kind of liken the the vibe and the direction and the chemistry that they have together you know to me the song didn't really need a big grand sort of show-stopping hook because little Sims energy and her performance and her lyricism just kind of sold the track for me so I don't know man every single track to come out from this Gorillaz album afterwards again I've liked them but it's it's just really bittersweet because this is the stuff that should have been on the record converge have a new track out that I'm not going to talk too much about it's titled a single tear it very much goes in the same kind of post-hardcore direction that a lot of the material from their last record did and I'm putting it in this section obviously because I think it's really good but I'm going to review the album very soon so I don't want to spoil anything I don't want to get too deep into it and finally this is gonna be the last track Aesop Rock has a new cut out titled hot dog hot dog I believe I want to double-check on that freakin pluralization of course yeah hot dogs production is super off-kilter and weird and somewhat rickety but in a cool way of course Aesop Rock lyrically is off on another goddamn planet like he usually is and all the respect in the world for to him for that though because that's sort of what makes him such a one-of-a-kind emcee and although it seems like he's becoming a little bit more obtuse here like he has typically been in the past I feel like his latest record which I love and I thought his latest record was fantastic as easily one of his most readable accessible and personal albums to date and now it kind of feels like he's sort of drifting back into that more obtuse direction which is cool you know hardcore fans longtime fans are probably going to enjoy that a little bit more kind of feel like this is more familiar stomping grounds that sort of thing and just kind of like in the vibe of the track like and of course is flows which are always fantastic always intricate always complex I wish the song instrumentally did change up a little bit more but I do think this is a really good mouth-watering debut single for this forthcoming project yes coming out and that is going to be it guys those were the best the men and the worst tracks of the week remember available now and will be available for a limited time you know we do them in short runs so when there will be more slip mats in the future I'm not entirely sure you know but we have you know a few hundred right now for sale that are accessible via the link down there in the description box along with our

it's his widest and most varied and riskiest project yet I really cannot say enough good things about it some of his most thoughtful tracks as well I just love the flow of these two separate discs I love how deep we get into crits personality on this thing and just how he sort of elevates everything that I've loved about him in the past to a new level on this thing don't miss it one of my favorite rap records of the year alright moving on from their primitive man with their new record caustic this is an amazing like doom noise sludge noise album that the the hideousness of it while it is kind of one-dimensional it really just kind of envelops me and I soak in it and it's gross it's harsh it's disgusting it's beautiful it's nihilistic it's like a black dark endless hateful abyss that in a funny way sums up my feelings on the year 2017 for the most part and it's it's just it's just fun for the whole family I'll leave it at that moving on from there the new proto martyr album relatives in descent this is a fantastically well written and put together post-punk album with tons of poetic lyrics dynamic instrumentals this is the proto martyr album that I personally have been waiting for the instrumentation is so much better and more intricate and more complex than it's been in the past the lyrics are as interesting and the vocal performances are as interesting and and sad and as glum and is sort of downtrodden as ever this is easily the band's best project to date and I'm hoping that the rock fans I'm hoping that the post-punk fans are picking up on it because it really truly is that good also Nick Cave fans should take notice as well because I think there's a bit of a crossover appeal here moving on from there I really enjoy the new Colella album quite a bit I wasn't really ant anticipating this record because I didn't enjoy her previous EP or her previous mixtape that much but honestly kilala came through with a smooth boundary pushing and sort of cutting edge take on 90s R&B with like all this futuristic production the songwriting is very quality as well the album is a bit lengthy and it does require quite a bit of patience from the listener because it is very subtle it is very low-key but it is a gorgeous album all the same highly recommended moving on from there I really enjoy the new uncommon NASA album written at night which is one of the dudes best projects yet and I love the crazy written at night concept that flows through the album which I'm not going to spoil here you need to sort of hear for yourself to kind of get it and appreciate it but I will say uncommon NASA is back in full force producing on this album with a bunch of clunky dirty lo-fi off-kilter beats his shouty sort of spoken where delivery is in full force as well and just as great as ever and I just think that with those two things sounding as great as they've ever been tying that into the fantastically executed concept on this thing add on to that there's a lot of great guest features and uncommon s sort of guides all these collaborators through these tracks making sure they focus on the topic at hand on the song so he's kind of playing director on this album a little bit here and you know all those factors added together sort of makes up for one of his best projects again I will say that too again that one of his best projects and finally I got to give a shout out to my dude igloo ghost for coming through with his full-length debut or his new full-length album neo wax boom on bloom rather on brain feeder records it is just as cutting edge and as futuristic and as overwhelming and is insane and is off-the-wall as his previous EP I would actually say a little bit more so it is really if I hadn't said it already intense like it's it's really just like strap yourself in because you're going through hyperspace at a million miles an hour with psychedelic colors flying by you in every direction it's so it's so much it is so much it is a lot to digest but I highly recommend listening through and sticking with it because it does kind of grow on you and it does the the bustling beats and the zany melodies and everything that is so maximal about this album kind of falls into place the patterns become more apparent and it sounds less like just a tangled mess and more like one of the most insane and detailed electronic compositions I've heard on a full-length record and that's gonna be it I think for this any don't forget about Harvard Graduate little pomp oh yeah [Music] ition have you given these albums a listen I hope you have because I think they're very good give them a shot links again all down there in the description box you guys are the best I'm proud of you keep eating your fruits and veggies keep loving one another keep staying hydrated over here next to my head is another great album's video you can click on that or click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next one forever 
sxISrm03SHk,whoo hey everyone Tiffany ladies Hannah here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new 21 savage offset in Metro boomin project without warning the Atlanta scene continues to drop these totally out of the blue superstar power projects Wow first with future and young thug's album slash mixtape it's it's kind of it's it's a mixtape masquerading as an album that was a few weeks ago and now we have a collaboration featuring one of the most cold-blooded rappers out there right now 21 savage also one member of the Atlanta rap trio migos who also featured on savages slaughter tape a little while back and it's kind of odd seeing him step out in such a big way into a collaborative record considering that like this past summer it seemed like quavo was the member of the migos that had like the most crossover potential outside of the trio and then you have producer Metro boomin one of the most in-demand rap producers right now who actually had a collaborative project out with 21 savage last year savage mode and it's just a really weird bill it is a weird bill so of course because of that I went into this thing with a lot of questions and reservations like metros production for the most part I like it but it can be kind of hit or miss especially when it is running super formulaic and 21 savage while I think he has a really distinct style that I like in small doses he's one of the most one-dimensional rappers out there right now and without the support of his fellow amigos how would offset do for the entirety of a mixtape or album especially considering tracks like Ric Flair drip on this thing are just okay and while 21 savage and offset have quite a bit in common considering they are both contemporary track rappers based in Georgia they have wildly different styles that could theoretically mix like oil and water and just like super slimy there are a handful of tracks on this thing that don't even feature both savage and offset but honestly without warning is pretty tight it does not overstay its welcome at just 10 tracks in 33 minutes twenty-one savage and offset actually complement one another more than I thought they were going to going into this project for the most part Metro boomin and 21 savage continue the chilling scary and cold-blooded aesthetic that they had going on with savage mode but now the instrumentals are little earier a little more atmospheric a little more melodic I mean on the song nightmare seems like Metro boomin is consciously trying to create a trap take on 80s horror movie soundtracks like Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street you know John Carpenter or Charles Bernstein that sort of thing so they obviously have a good thing going but then offset comes in to kind of break up the monotony of you know a 21 savage track by providing a little bit more vocal energy tighter flows neither offset or savage are really lyrical or interesting enough to carry an entire project on their own so they just kind of you know add up somehow they kind of distract from one another's weaknesses here and not simply because they're switching off but also because I think they have quite a bit of chemistry and cohesion on this thing while I would call neither of these two artists stupendous it does seem like they're both putting their all into nearly every single one of these tracks and while this project is is far from being perfect there are a lot of bangers on here the song Ghost Face killers with Travis Scott comes out with all cylinders firing it has this lengthy but infectious hook from offset that kind of reminds me of Travis Scott's 3500 but a little more low-key his tight triplet flows and auto-tuned vocals fit very nicely in the smooth glossy atmospheric instrumental Travis Scott takes up the rear of the track really nicely 21 savage provides his verse in the middle of the track which is much drier and closer and more intimate than any other vocal on the track it's a bit of a weird adjustment and changeup but this small flub on this track is something that I feel like it's worked out deeper into the record like the sense of collaboration sounds a bit tighter on the subsequent tracks as there are moments on this thing where the auto-tune on offsets vocals isn't quite so overbearing or there's a bit more in terms of effects on 21 savages voice or maybe offset just kind of turns his energy level down just a little bit more to match savages on the song rap save me featuring quavo 21 savage takes up the hook on the song the first verse and he hits listeners with just this hypnotic flow I am locked into this flow which is enhanced by all the swirling reversed melodies playing throughout the instrumental it's mind-bending it's dark it's trippy and things only get hotter and more intense when offset pops in with his fluttering auto-tune triplet flows now my choppa is one of the solo tracks on here and is easily one of the best songs Savage has ever written and recorded not only because the hook is killer like the KKK simile to his gun on this track is very nasty very tasteless but I think it just kind of speaks to just how heartless savage is when he's rapping and when he's writing and he's in that murderous headspace and then the transition into the song nightmare at the end of this song is fantastic it's an amazing transition that makes the two songs seem linked in a significant way and I think conceptually and melodically they are and I actually wish more songs on this thing segwayed into one another like that it would make this whole project seem so more mathematical asofail hits a really nice groove through 21 savages flow and the B even though it is sort of low-key oddly enough I find it to be one of the more aggressive tracks in the track listing here like for me this was kind of relatively a high-energy moment here the other tracks sitting shoulder to shoulder with these cuts are okay in my opinion where the album really starts to blunder is in its final moments you can tell the potential and the ideas and this collaboration are kind of running thin the song run up the racks is a solo savage track that gets pretty sleepy and nondescript it pretty much goes stale by the second half I mean it's it's pretty much a twenty one savage song by the numbers and the song still serving feels like yet another sluggish installment from the savage mode project but just with offset featuring on it in the second half the song Darth Vader features some really eerie chimes in the instrumental that are a pretty big selling point though I think the drums the percussion on this thing isn't really much to write home about and while I do think there is greater vocal energy and chemistry coming from both savage and offset on this track it's not like the song really does anything that the previous nine tracks haven't already and it's not really that spectacular of a finisher and while overall I think this project is pretty entertaining it's pretty good it doesn't really have a whole lot of substance to give it I think the staying power it would need for it to be one of my favorites of the year though surely I will give it credit for having some pretty good and pretty infectious hooks here and there as well as some freakishly cutthroat one-liners I thought this project was pretty solid more bangers than snoozers on this thing I'm feeling a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this collaborative project a listen did you love it did you hate it what would

ivXWRxoLpfE,hi everyone started in the white Ana here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new Big KRIT album forever is a mighty long time now this album is excellent and as a result of it being excellent I want to dawn my yellow flannel kal give me the flannel here we go flannel give the flannel here thank you I don't see it in here it's not there I don't think it's in here where could it be my yellow flannel where can it be where where where would such a thing go it's a part of my identity at this point it's my brand how am I supposed to tell people whether or not an album is good or not Helmut made me just put out and another shirt different a different shirt okay I guess I can just put on a shirt it's doesn't feel right though Big KRIT is a Mississippi rapper singer producer songwriter quadruple threat Krantz started making pretty big waves in 2010 with his breakout mixtape crit was here which for a mixtape ran a lot like an album and then after this Cris started dropping one album after another masquerading as a mixtape I mean these projects were loaded with these classy Southern Fried bangers and also on these projects crit just bled his influences in such a creative way in a way that he celebrated them but also built off of them I'm talking about UGK Outkast 8ball & MJG goodie mob's Scarface Ti David Banner did I say David Banner I think I think I didn't now the thing is even though crit dropped one great mixtape after the next he had a hard time sticking the landing when it came to coming through with a commercial album for Def Jam Records whether that be his live from the underground record in 2012 or Cadillac tuka I mean crit expressed himself some of his frustration with not really coming through for fans on these projects especially live from the underground but I think this past couple of years of relative silence from crit has done him a lot of good because he's hunkered down he's focused on this project which is huge it's really two albums in one he's invited on a wealth of other producers and collaborators Jill Scott Ti Robert Glasper and Terrace Martin great producers like willpower who's worked with Eminem tec-9 Mannie Fresh who's worked with everyone from Cash Money to Big Freedia or even organized Noize but Chris still produces a bulk of this record himself and you can really hear that in each track in each instrumental even on the beats that he doesn't touch directly he's still guiding the sound and the vibe of this album in a very conscious way he's not just bringing on a producer so that he can grab it a sound that he wouldn't normally have it's like he's bringing on guest artists to enhance his style enhance his pre-existing sound now as I already said this thing is huge it's almost 90 minutes long it's two discs it's over 20 tracks there's only a couple of skits to be had on the entire thing and there's not just a lot of material on this thing but a lot of ambition too as well as some of crits most hungry vocal performances his sweetest hooks and there are quite a few moments here where the lyrics bring a lot of food for thought to now if you've been a crit fan up until this point you kind of go into a new project expecting that he's always been great at sort of striking a balance between what bumps in the whip and what bumps in your brain shout-out to FIFO now even though Chris is asking a lot of his fans on this thing because it is so long I didn't really find this project to be that tough of a slog mostly because crits music isn't really that strenuous a lot of the time he usually wears his lyrical intentions on his sleeve his hooks usually pop his instrumentals are typically pretty lavish and he's pretty much maintained all of this while shooting for this more epic sound overall on this new project not to mention that I think it's totally kosher to listen to these two separate discs at your leisure because they each kind of have their own flow their own vibe their own personality the first disc of this album is front loaded with bangers slowly grows more mellow as it plays on there are loads of music tributes here to crit southern predecessors and of course that is reflected in some of the guest list here whether it be t I and C low bun B and Pimp C even the song aux cord is a purposeful musical tribute to the artists that inspired not just crits lyrics but his production to now the second disc on this project is the more conscious side of this coin musically it starts off with much more in the way of soul and gospel influences especially on cuts like keep the devil off overall there's much more singing from Big KRIT like on the cut mixed messages and then as the record draws on the songs get a little bit more aggressive and grim somber in their tone crit's lyrics get a little bit more introspective he reflects on the price of fame and the sacrifices he made to get where he is now the song bury me in gold uses gold as a metaphor for the things in life that are actually valuable not just material things in terms of the themes and the takeaway message which is pretty religious a lot of the time on this album it's it's it's pretty familiar stopping grounds for crit and that's the thing even though he is making a double album here and he is taking quite a few risks there is kind of that usual formula that usual mix of elements that you usually hear on a crit album you still hasn't totally distance himself from the blueprint now he's gone into a lot of his projects with you have an invigorating introduction a couple of electrifying trunk knockers most notably the songs sub n Stein which is the latest installment of the my sub series of course all of the hardest and heaviest and bassist tracks and crits discography the beat on this track is incredible so is crits flow I mean his charisma is off the charts I also want to appreciate how timely this track is there are so many monster references and the lyrics and there's some kind of weird and freaky sound effects throughout the beat - this song could easily double as like a Halloween banger he's literally rapping about his his sub coming alive also I love the beats which up in the second leg of the track it gives the song a heavenly send-off you have a sharp sexy club anthem with a kind of R&B twist on 1999 a track where you have these dark introspective reflections on crits craft and the rap game at large on confetti and then of course inspiring motivational anthems with chopped up soul samples like get away which is an excellent song about sort of separating yourself from destructive things and negativity then you have these soul charge and that's just the first disc the second half of this thing is really where crit pulls out a lot of the stops he takes some of his biggest risks here like the epic soul jazz instrumental that kicks the entire second disc off which he names after himself there are grand pianos on this track heavy percussion swirling synthesizers soaring strings amazing singers that back up the second half of the song it's it's a moment like this that I feel like Justin is really sort of speaking through his music he typically just sort of speaks with his words but really compositionally he's speaking through his music and such a passionate and powerful way it's somewhat tear inducing and this moment actually kind of gets me charged when I'm listening through the entire thing because it kind of piques my interest and gets me excited for the second helping of this thing the song mixed messages I think conceptually is one of crits smarter tracks where he kind of looks back on his discography and thinks about just how he fails to deliver a consistent moral message in his music and sort of questions himself thinking you know is is it bad that I'm tempted sometimes as a bad that I give in to that temptation the idea of the good path and the bad path is one that crit has explored in his music again and again and again and yet he just kind of finds another way to work that angle with a new fresh song here I will say some of the singing toward the start of the track is a little bit clumsy but it seems like crit self-references even that later in the song where he says that he has this passion this desire to sing in his music but he better rap because he's known as a rapper and that's just something that he has to kind of stick to also the huge gospel choral vocals on the track keep the devil off our fantastic and throughout the song crit delivers these shouty huge vocals that are sort of rapping but also it seems like he's giving a sermon I don't think it was like the best lead single for the album and everything and do you think the song draws on a little long at five minutes like maybe around the three minute and 30 second mark you've kind of just hit like an extended instrumental of the track and you've heard much of what the song is gonna do it's a little repetitive but still I would say an essential part of this tracklist and while I'm at I'll say that maybe the song lay up which is possibly the most low-key track on this entire thing could have used a touch of shortening too however the song Miss Georgia for Nia is maybe the most fantastic piece of country rap fusion that I've heard in a while the pianos on this track the acoustic guitars they mix really well with the beat and crit's rapping and Joy's vocals on the track make the song in a lot of ways it's just such a beautiful track it's so well put together it's so soulful it's so passionate it's so catchy I do think the second disc hits a little bit of a lull in the middle with the song everlasting as well as higher calling I think the sound of these two tracks is a little average for this project a little average for crit however I do appreciate what he's trying to do with these two tracks because they do seem connected the former kind of seems like crits spitting some game on this girl who he's questioning whether or not he has long-term potential with romantically and then the latter of these two songs featuring Jill Scott is kind of like the deeper more passionate love song that kind of builds off of the previous track the song has this really intense emotional and sexual energy to it and the space enos kind of reminds me of Records like ATLiens meanwhile the song drinking sessions is maybe Chris most emotional track yet I mean on a lot of this cut he sounds like he's on the verge of tears and not totally surprising considering that I think lyrically is kind of getting to the root of a lot of what drives him as an artist a lot of what drives his personal morality the following track the light is just as enthralling lyrically features this tense jazzy instrumental that Terrace Martin and Robert Glasper put together it's gorgeous crit takes - this backing instrumentation so well and bury me in gold is just an amazing send-off for the album it's a great sort of message it's a great takeaway for the record itself crit has explored a lot of these familiar themes of peace and love and unity and understanding but I think is sort of connected them and elevated them in a way that he hasn't before because this album it's fun it's catchy it's well produced it's well performed but I feel like a lot of the messaging and a lot of what Chris is doing here it's just ah it it it what am I trying to say here what I'm trying to say is I feel like his music what he's doing on this album this double album it speaks directly to the soul and human decency and I love that it's rare that I hear an album and it has happened in the past but it's rare that I hear an album and you know what it makes me want to be like a better person and that's a beautiful thing again I'll say that there are a few moments on the album where I think it's length or the length of some individual tracks does come around to bite it there's a bit of a lull in the middle of the second disc there are so many songs on this thing that fade out although that I got kind of used to pretty fast CeeLo feature is a kind of silly the guest singing on 1999 is a little buttery but I kind of came to love it overall though I think this is the crit album that I've been waiting for it's everything I've loved about him up until this point but expanded and amplified and matured I would go as far as to say that this thing is his artistic second wind and I'm looking forward to seeing how far that takes him in the future I'm feeling a strong 82 a light 9 on this thing transition have you given this Big KRIT album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if

h9r1kIjo2aA,hi everyone Stu the new spooked anno here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for review of the new fever ray album plunge what are you even supposed to be oh I don't know confused Karen dreary Anderson aka fever ray this is her second full-length album under the fever ray name she is formerly of the electro and art pop duo known as the knife now the last time we heard from Karen under the fever ray name was back in 2009 with an incredible self-titled album which I actually named my album of the year because of its great songwriting because of its vivid and colorful analog synthesizers fantastic percussion the production and sound of this thing all around was amazing the vibe of the record was uniquely dark and primal and witchy it was just so solid track 4 track 4 track 4 track and also it was one of those moments for an artist breaks off from a group or a project that they're known for to create some solo material it feels kind of unique from the music that you typically know them for so here we are now just short of a decade later new record and it's it's definitely a head-scratcher not that I think Karen is doing anything artistically that is beyond the comprehension of a fever a fan or a knife fan or even a fan of kindred spirit planning to rock I'm just confused because very little of what made the self-titled record great carries over onto this new album here and I'm not saying here that I expected Karen to come out with the same record twice though I do love the brooding smooth and ominous sounds of when I grow up and seven and if I had a heart it's again been almost a decade since the release of that album it would be unreasonable to expect Karen to come through with nearly the exact same sound and also given the debut single of this record to the moon and back I actually went into this thing expecting music that was really bold and freakish and uncompromising so my expectations for this record we're much more than just aesthetic but what I'm kind of complaining about here is just the overall lack of quality songwriting well-developed instrumentals and even the sense of adventure that I typically get when I listen to some of Karen's music no matter what capacity she's recording in the record starts off boldly enough with the song wanna sip which features this really tense punchy percussion these weird metallic rattles howling synthesizers Karen's shouty and one-of-a-kind vocal delivery is as attention-grabbing as ever the lyrics also display this strong sense of lust and sexuality and desire almost like she has an addiction to a particular person in mind it's easily one of my favorite cuts here though it does fizzle out toward the very end which is not that good of a sign when you're starting a record and another favorite of mine in the track listing is the following mustn't hurry which features this very low-key primal instrumental I see keyboard chords some deeply pitched woodwind leads it eventually reaches a very easygoing groove that would have slipped in nicely on Karen's self-titled Fever Ray album and I kind of like the very revealing and personal lyrics on this track too that talked about needing a song or needing a person but not wanting to hurry that process to really truly get what you want however the record takes a very fast nosedive after this the song a part of us melodically it does not go toe to toe with the two previous tracks at all and they're very annoying and alienating robot chorus effects on the vocals are a very big turn-off I would say ruins any potential of this track being enjoyable and doesn't really complement the incredibly unique tambour of Karen's voice and the beat itself is one of the least interesting on the entire album it just feels like a redundant series of mechanical loops that get very stale very fast especially since the beat shows so little in the way of progression or change across the runtime of the track the song falling is another moment where I enjoy the lyrics quite a bit Karen singing about the the kind of hurt and pain and disgust with oneself that you can feel just based off of the emotions of another person and all of this anguish pours through so boldly in vocal performance on this track but this is easily one of the worst instrumentals here the swelling synthesizers all over this things sound like they come off of a Halloween sound effects tape the weird mechanical bleeps and bloops they do very little for the chord progression of the track for the melody of Karen's voice it sounds like I'm just listening to like a weird quirky synth beat that's left over from a bad sci-fi movie soundtrack all hope of the record pulling itself together stylistically kind of goes out the window with the song I don't know about you whose funky polyrhythmic very organic sounding drums kind of sound like a bit of a left over from the last knife record shaking the habitual in fact with the kind of loudly mixed vocals on the track they're sort of clipping and distorted obviously that's intentional but the skeletal nature of the track itself kind of makes it feel like I'm listening to a b-side or a demo leftover from that album meanwhile the track momma's hand the closer while it is a decent cut it's yet another moment on the album that reminds me of the knife which to me there there was kind of a bold separator between what was a Fever Ray song and what was a knife song this track for example sounds like it could have been on silent shout and the song this country as far as annoying tracks on this album go is maybe the hardest to stomach not only because of its cartoony chorus effects on Karen's vocals that makes me feel like I'm listening to I don't know like a cartoon fly like they're also these weird metallic blinky melodies the way that the groove and the beat on this thing lumbers and this really hideous digital distorted like faux industrial ways is is so it's not even abrasive in like an appealing way and the weird impromptu like sloganeering in the middle of the track is absolutely ridiculous and once the track hits its mantra of I'm just the title track on here is an instrumental cut surprisingly enough which isn't bad it's definitely more palatable than the most objectionable material on this album but it's not amazing and the song red trails is probably the best track in the second half of this whole thing a very slow brooding ballad one of the most expressive vocal performances on the entire record and also some wonderful fluttering string layers that kind of add a nice natural organic quality to the whole thing and then yet again we get another track an itch which just shows as far as the sound and the mixing of this record goes how out of whack it all is because the vocals just seem so overbearing in comparison with the instrumental which is so muddy and sort of I don't know chaotic to the point where it's it's difficult to kind of parse anything interesting out of it the this record man I took a little while listening to it to really kind of come to terms with just how lukewarm I am on it honestly and it's it's really disappointing to have come to that feeling because I love the last Fever Ray album and generally the knife's music so much I mean this wouldn't be the first time that Karen came out with music that I didn't care for but still but considering this album features a song like mustn't hurry which directly has a line in it about not rushing a song or a piece of music this whole album just feels in so many ways just thrown together structurally melodically conceptually there's so many drab or hideous instrumentals on this thing occasionally the rhyme schemes are kind of basic and underwhelming too it's it's just in my opinion just not some of Karen's best work and which is why I'm essentially feeling a light 5 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next it they'll like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment if you're

zglUexTARC0,hi everyone top 10 anime crossovers here the Internet's busiest music nerd and it's time for a review of the new the world is a beautiful place and I'm no longer afraid to die album always foreign this is the latest record from East Coast emo outfit the world is a beautiful place this is their third record their second for epitaph records their last album a few years ago harmlessness was this grand and full fusion of emo and post rock the band's approach enhanced the inherent drama in both styles not to mention that generally they just had this knack for earnest vocals and poetic lyrics and very intricate instrumental layering much of which however does not really carry over onto this new album for some reason don't get me wrong there are at least a handful of pretty epic cuts on this record most of which come toward the end of the project like the closing track infinite Steve that hits listeners with these cuts of guitar chords that slice through the mix rushes of strings passionate vocals the whole thing kind of reminds me of a slightly more aggressive and and emotionally potent Smashing Pumpkins the song fuzz minor serves as one of the most dramatic and heavy and distorted tracks on the entire record and the song Marine Tigers is the lengthiest and most epic track on the entire record there is obviously a series of lyrical nods here to our rotten political system to the focus that issues like immigration have taken in the current political landscape as much as I like these tracks the material that leads up to this point does not really deliver the band's usual level of finesse or detail which in a way I kind of anticipated because some of the teaser tracks to this album we're relatively straightforward and simple sort of like the band was trying to pull off more of a pop punk vibe but now that I here within the context of the album it's pretty underwhelming it's kind of basic and there's nothing really that injures like the song the future toward the start of the album which is so OneNote it just kind of leaves me confused despite the fact that this song hits a pretty good tempo the band's older music just seemed kind of spunkier and more raw and more youthful by comparison and sure while in the past the lead vocals of come off very boyish and in heartfelt they've never really felt whiny or obnoxious to me at least not as much as they are on this record there are songs in the track listing here that are slightly more dynamic like hilltop or like the song fakir which kind of hangs in this really weird moody mellow guitar sleep-inducing purgatory before finally launching into a really explosive finish with layered vocal harmonies and busy drum fills and driving guitar leads I don't really think it's anything to write home about I mean the sound the production is nowhere near as expansive as it's been in the past nor are the instrumental progressions all that interesting sure there were moments on helplessness that were kind of obtuse and asked quite a bit of patience of listeners but ultimately the ask was usually worth it because the payoff was pretty big there was a lot of weight to what the band was doing instrumentally or there was a really great narrative coming out of the lyrics meanwhile by comparison on this new album the song Dylan and her son sounds like some tacky mid-2000s emo pop with sugar-sweet synthesizers and very little in the way of structure and that's another thing always foreign is a cut in runtime in comparison with its predecessor - which isn't inherently a bad thing I did think that helplessness could have used a bit of paring down to its most essential moments but instead of doing that with the band seems to be doing here is just boiling things down to some bare essentials but in the process of that vaporizing what made the group interesting in the first place I mean a lot of the time I feel like I'm listening to a version of me without you except the instrumental performances aren't as exciting and the storytelling isn't really there sort of like on the song Graham which if you look at the lyrics on this track it has all the elements of a painfully sad story but it's written more like a lazy synopsis the record is certainly listenable it has its moments but it's far from the Bands best in my opinion it's not the triumph for emo that their two previous records were and it just kind of feels like a downgrade on all fronts the performances the amount of material that we're getting here the level of ambition it's okay I could see hardcore fans getting more into it than me but I'm just having a hard time finding stuff really praised this record on honestly I'm feeling a like two decent six on this one transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next to the like if you like please subscribe and please don't cry just leave a thoughtful comment down in the comments if you're thoughtful and respect others as well while you're in the comments -

before the video is over because I am gracious for their sponsorship and let's get into the worst tracks ah the worst tracks of the week we're making this a pretty good time here I think all right the worst tracks of the week what is the first one that I wanted to shout out as being one of the worst of the week it's it's the this this first one I'm pretty disappointed in it's not the worst I've ever heard from them but I'm pretty disappointed in it unfortunately it is the newest track from sleighbells who have a new track or rather a new album coming out very soon the song is titled Rainmaker and so they borrowed this chord progression from a previously released piece of music and while it is a decent chord progression I don't know the song is just kind of tired it doesn't really kind of have that gutsy arena rock bratty kind of feel that I liked so much from their last album it sounds almost like they're trying to just make I don't know just regular bland electro pop that's really shouty and kind of has some annoying production on it I'm hoping that they kind of keep their attitude on this forthcoming record of theirs while I don't begrudge them the the desire to mature I think that's part of what made their last record so interesting I don't know I'm hoping that they don't kind of boil their sound down and just kind of make it super safe so that people who weren't into the band before sort of matriculate over now that some of their older fanbase has kind of evaporated because you know they're no longer kind of a buzz band at this point but they're still putting out some decent stuff moving on from there they knew her rahi song taste you know this to me is when sophistic just faintly hops over that very very very faint border between that particular genre of music and just just plain old boring pop without much in the way of strong melody or an exciting groove or vocal performance this just felt like I don't know just like stale water to me stale dusty stale dusty water you know just a warm glass of water in an old plastic cup with a nice like healthy caking of dust around the top of it that that's how this felt to me unfortunately wasn't really digging much more than new on the new track from Noel Gallagher's high flying birds of course Noah was not gonna let this year go without a record from him or at least you know this this span of time rather because Liam of course just dropped his new album a while ago as you were and this new track over here I can appreciate what Knoll is trying to do all they do here like it's a little experimental it's a little out there like about two minutes in I was like okay is the song is the song and starts soon because it's such a weird spacey instrumental moment but once I sort of realized that that's the direction he was going in it just kind of turned me off just how wack some of the lyrics were how over compressed all the instrumentation was like there was no breathing room at all a lot of the instrumentation sounded really like smooth and digital and hideous aesthetically it was just not pleasing at all and for something as experimental as it's trying to be it doesn't really keep me on the edge of my seat or keep me engaged with I don't know like the jam of it or the performance of it even though it's clearly like way over produced and like not organic in any way shape or form like if you're going to come together with something like this have it be a live organic in the moment recording with kind of like a human touch on it don't over produce it to the point where it sounds like a robots making it yeah it's I was not into this new track over here it's it's titled Fort Knox by the way and unfortunately was not really digging the new Morrissey track either I kind of like the lyrics on this cut the song is titled I wish you lonely but unfortunately the production on this track is hideous sometimes Morrissey's vocal inflections can get slightly goofy but that that kind of comes with the territory in in this leg of his career currently you know I kind of came into this expecting that didn't really mind the vocals for the most part it's really kind of the hideous synthesizers all over this track that really do not fit his style that sounds super clunky super out of place not really all that well performed or sort of smooth into the instrumental that like instrumentally I would have gone back to the drawing board on this maybe four different times until it actually came out sounding halfway decent yeah was not digging the instrumental on this at all and completely ruined any hope that the track had of being truly memorable or enjoyable honestly but let's move on to the tracks that I was pretty a man hmm there we go new tune yards song unfortunately look look at your hands this attract me was kind of safe for tune-yards to be completely honest it was not really as kooky or as fruity or as off-the-wall certainly not the the International music influences that I typically get out of tune-yards music but and not to say that they need them to be successful in that they need them to actually make good music not necessarily one percenter case but in this particular instance the instrumental taking those elements out it's like they haven't swapped anything else in and the final result is just really bland really kind of run-of-the-mill felt almost like just your average kind of indie dance pop tune and the lyrics are easily some of the most uninteresting that I've ever heard in a tune-yards song so I don't know I'm just kind of hoping that future material on this forthcoming record is a bit more Bowl is a bit more interesting because this this was not really exciting in in my opinion let's move on from here to the new Sufjan Stevens songs or rather you know song he has a new project coming out that's essentially like a mix tape or a compilation of b-sides and demos and remixes from you know Carrie and Lowell and this new track whose chord progression you will probably be familiar with John my beloved is uh you know very uh very nice very enjoyable tune and you know nice sort of raw acoustic cut moving on from there new Sam Smith ballad he has a record coming out very soon the track is titled burning and it's a nice it's a nice track it's a nice ballad you know Sam's a vocal performance on here is pretty passionate I wouldn't say melodically it's the best he's ever done but I'm actually kind of looking forward to this new record of his even though I haven't been hyping it up too much um I do think he is one of the more mature and one of the more interesting songwriters in the mainstream right now of which there are very few and you know looking forward to sort of seeing if he can kind of grow past that you know that big debut splash that he made into something that seems a little bit more personal and a little less um I don't know squeaky-clean it's because there were moments on his last record that I thought were just like this is like clearly a track that you're just throwing out there for the pop fans these new tracks that I've been hearing you know it sort of sounds like he's trying to go maybe more of like the route of Adele's last album and coming through with something that is a little bit more organic and maybe a little bit more real and just wish them all the luck in the world with this new record because I'm liking what I'm hearing so far moving on from there I dig the new hooded menace track it's titled charnelle reflections and if you really dug the new pallbearer album I think you're gonna like what this track has to offer over here it's got like this it's it's slow its doomy it's heavy its apocalyptic and it has of course those soaring harmonized guitar leads and solos that pallbearer fans I can love but it has kind of these death-metal growled vocals at the forefront of it that kind of sets them apart a little bit from a lot of their contemporaries who are also doing you know those melodic slow doom type Dorjee songs and it's not bad you know it's not the most exciting thing I've ever heard but it kind of has me a you know interest piqued for this forthcoming record Franz Ferdinand has a new track out title always ascending the vocals are kind of goofy vocals are very goofy so are the lyrics but damn this instrumentals tight AF it is tight AF very you know it's a nice solid alternative dance single very fun very flavorful very interesting lots of character and lots of excitement coming out of the beat here and I don't know hopefully the the new record is good hopefully the new record is good they certainly got a good groove going here I will say you know the vocals they are still very kind of clumsy and weird but you know Franz Ferdinand they for the most part they still got it they still got it kind of diggin the new first aid kit track over here it's a titled a postcard and it's kind of this weary tear in your beer kind of country tune you know it's not the usual close harmony ascending epic and inspiring indie folk that they typically do which i think is a good thing kind of a change in pace for first aid kit I think has been long overdue and even though you know it's it's not the most biting or memorable song I've heard in this style I think they are taking to this style of music very well so I'm looking forward to a you know potentially them doing more of this and maybe exploring some other sounds on this forthcoming album too because with them kind of breaking away from their trademark sound I think that's gonna leave open space for them to try you know really anything and you know anything at this point as far as a risk taking from first-aid kit is you know welcomed at least for me anyway so looking forward to that and the new Amin a single squeeze is pretty good it's short it's super short but it's kind of a quirky weird off the beaten path with some weird pitched vocals pitch high pitch low it's very cartoony it's very colorful at the there's just not a whole lot of structure to it but some funny bars and you know his his sharp sense of humor comes through in a lot of ways on those lyrics so shout out to him and shout out to this single all right let's get into the tracks that I thought were the best of the week the best tracks of the week oh man I got some good tracks over here that I got a shout out that I'm pretty excited to turn you guys on to one yacht has a new EP out it's you know that like the strawberry EP and the first track from it it's titled shame and it is a weird tight tense post punky banger with a great beat great driving beat the vocals get kind of shouty Jeremy who edits some of the videos said it kind of reminded him of sleater-kinney and I would tend to agree the vocal performance on this track anyway in my opinion it's one of the better tracks they've come out with in a while I thought the you know some of the other material on the EP was kind of a bit of a snooze but I thought this new track from this EP was very good I want to give a shout out to a new artist or at least an artist who's new to me whose name is Rina saw a Yama and how I came into her music is Clarence clarity has produced her new record new project and this single of hers is titled take me as I am and it sounds like an amazing like mid-2000s or like you know like late 90s early 2000s Christina Aguilera style pop banger great melodies great hooks great production it has that you know seriously like Otts Audis pop like dance pop vibe to it but kind of those weird quirky elements that you expect from Clara's clarity's music come through and hear big-time but not so heavy that they would turn off like your average pop fan like I could show this to a lot of different people and they would definitely do not only what Clarence is doing but what Reena is doing as well because her vocals are pretty good like she embodies that pop style to a tee on this track and I'm looking forward to hearing more what she's doing on this new record of hers - especially if you know her and Clarence work together so well on this track how well they work together on the subsequent tracks you know is uh could be even more exciting so I'm really digging this track it's a great pop banger alright moving on from there I dig the new porches track quite a bit find me what I've been hearing from porches lately it seems like there's not a whole lot of stylistic consistency but not necessarily a bad thing because the Tunes have all been good in my opinion this new track over here has like a bit of a Moody alternative dance vibe to it I love the lyrics I love the very subtle vocal harmonies on here it's a very pretty tune with a light very light very easygoing groove to it it's danceable but it is very relaxing as well I just kind of like the mood I like the vibe of the track I like what porches has been doing lately because early on some of the low five stuff was a little bit of a turn-off for me but seems like the sound is really maturing into something that's quality as far as sound goes and songwriting goes so I'm pretty excited to hear what porches are gonna be doing with this new record I dig the new amigo single Nicki Minaj cardi beer on it instrumentally and flow wise it's kind of your standard migos affair but the hook is decent and Nicki Minaj and cardi B I think bring it quite a bit to the song and I believe this is gonna be on their next full-length album culture - and I did enjoy culture one not expecting they're gonna blow culture one out of the water or just culture rather but uh you know still looking forward to the record still looking forward to it and I dig the single quite a bit it's it's it's a banger it's a banger alright next Krauss has a new record out and it is kind of on the short side like a lot of their recent releases but this one is a collaborative project with Dave Edwardson of neurosis who provides some synths on this project who provides some vocals on this project and honestly even though I've been kind of underwhelmed by Crowell is's late at latest work like they've kind of drifted away from the black metal sound that I enjoyed them having when they came on scene and have gone into more of a technical you know kind of grimy blackened death sort of style that reminds me of a lot of Colin marcin's other projects you know I have been sort of disappointed by that but honestly what I've hear what I've heard of this project so far specifically this track over here them linking you guys to the song ranked mankind it kind of sounds like Dave's involvement here is kind of bringing the band a little bit of new life here I mean the vocals are excellent the performance is really exciting sure the the production is still like a tad muddy but like the the performance is really muscular the playing is really muscular like it is some badass technical and throttling metal music and again the vocals man the vocals really just kind of like brought this song just like you know just inched it past that edge to being like wow this is like one of the best tracks of her this week but yes really enjoyed that enjoyed this new track from friendship a Philly band that I was turned on to by the good people over a Stereogum I think and it's just kind of like a very low-key very sad and forlorn like little pop tune there are elements with the vocals and storytelling that kind of remind me of like old Simon joiner or something like that you know if you guys aren't familiar please do check him out he's a you know one of those sad sax songwriters who came out with a lot of great stuff in the 90s who I highly recommend and this kind of struck me as being in that same vein but kind of having a bit of a instrumental style of its own and just kind of liking what I'm hearing here and looking forward to the new record this next band over here that I wanted to shout out have a wild song on their Bandcamp title that Chucho ela and the name of the band is Dodd hello da da al oh and these guys are a grindcore band from Nepal and they're like soaring guitar solos on this track wild vocal layers like insane insane drumming and guitar work like it's super noisy and frantic and spastic and technical but yet also like throttling and gruff and visceral and to the point it's kind of like a nice balance between an amazing amount of energy and power and throttle and an amazing of detail and like kind of personality and zaniness which i kind of like you know I kind of like every once in a while with my grindcore so definitely check this track out check this band out they have a new record out soon as is the case with one of my favorite hip hop duo's Armand Hammer who of course features Billy woods and lucid and they have a new track out titled want to get this right it was written and obviously flow wise lyrically it is as impressive as everything that we've heard from Armand Hammer on their last album instrumentally it's really cutting edge I will say you know just as like as cutting edge of some of the instrumentals from like Billy woods history will absolve me which I really loved and you know it's just like some really ahead of the curve grimy dark underground hip-hop and a lucid and Billy I think continue to kind of grow this chemistry that was very natural to the both of them when they first came out with Armand Hammer first came out with that debut record now it seems like they're working together even better on this new track over here complimenting each other even better and I'm gonna leave it at that guys those are the best tracks those are the met tracks those were the tracks they thought were the worst tracks again I

Rqji8DgXwcM,boy hey how you doing there it's a couch couch esta and it's time further though why you don't review where andis gonna go over a bunch of ablum said he didn't talk about over the month and talked about him here and a bunch of videos one after another and you don't even gotta click on another video to see a bunch of opinions about a bunch of other albums so there you go I think that's all I gotta say oh yeah Ella and he told me to say so without further a chew it the beo new Kumasi washington EP which i wanted to be as hyped about as a lot of people are and there are some good highlights on here some tracks that you know go in a bit of a jazz funk direction and a latin jazz direction that i thought were very nice but um i was just getting a lot of moments of deja vu on this EP i think it was smart and interesting to sort of put together like a condensed and very seamless listening experience that while shorter does kind of run a lot like the epic did but to me this just kind of seems like an epic epilogue i-i-i do try to give Hoodie Allen a shot every time he comes out with a new album because I like Hoodie Allen as a person he seems like a nice guy it seems like he loves his fans and it seems like his hustle is impeccable and from what I understand you know he's kind of he's kind of like a self a self-made dude and you know unlike a lot of these other white rappers out there he sort of seems to sidestep all this you know nasty hatred that a lot of them get and I think it's just because you know he's like a little bit of a lone wolf in in the industry right now he's so popular and yet he gets so little in the way of nods and attention from the you know traditional rap industry you know and I think he has flow I think he's got personality you know he's got wit he's kind of funny and his hook certainly pop but I typically do not like my pop rap this sugary you know it's just really not for me however just incredible and continuing respect for this dude and what he does and you know I just hope he continues to be successful with it you know overall I kind of enjoyed this more than bellies last full-length project although while I do think some of his flows are great and he has a great year for production on this thing at the end of the day I can't say this project is much more than just average you know there's nothing lyrically or vocally or instrumentally that really truly kind of stands out to me as being very unique or very exciting the while the title is a bit of a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing it's not actually a mumble rap album he's certainly a cut above many mumble rappers you're gonna hear he's certainly not dazzling with his lyricism the instrumentals are far from cutting edge his flows are kind of catchy occasionally the hooks are alright it's it's not anything amazing I guess it's decent I'm not gonna hate on it but I'm not going to tell you guys it's one of the best projects of the year as much as people have praised propoganda over the years for this sound that they've developed into this melodic throttling epic sort of skate punk melodic hardcore style I just have not really been able to get into it like there's a lot of older material in their back catalogue that's very funny and very kind of satirical and has kind of a sharp snarky wit to it that I think is a you know really good but as far as like a lot of this newer stuff it's a super self-serious and I don't know just just not really that exciting to me you know maybe not as grand or as epic as it sort of seems to imply and I get it these are serious times you know which is probably why the record is you know the tone that it is and you know props for the album cover are because victory lap this image here is an amazing combination of if you're a punk fan and you're looking for something that is more than just you know kind of your simple aggressive straightforward meat-and-potatoes punk record definitely look this thing up because you know there's certainly are dynamics to it it certainly is trying to do something on a somewhat grand scale while sticking to its punk roots and respect for that it's just not really meaning much to me that's all [Music] Miley Cyrus goes country on her new album I mean why not at this point you you've done almost everything else and you know culturally and you know as far as as far as where she kind of got her start I mean uh you know with her father and everything I mean that's that's where she comes from you know that's the background she comes from I wouldn't say that it's really that special of a pop or a country record or you know a pop record with kind of a country twang to it though I will say in this musical context the natural twang of her voice or at least you know kind of her somewhat nasal almost foghorn II kind of delivery makes more sense you know certainly doesn't seem as out of place certainly doesn't sound as obnoxious as it does against some kinds of instrumentals and some kinds of musical styles but um you know it's it's it's not it's not really doing anything for me though I will say it this is easily one of her most tolerable albums for me this is one of her least annoying albums you know I'm not going to say it's great but it certainly was listenable and you know that's that's worthy of respect to some degree I guess unfortunately despite loving a lot of heavens earlier stuff under the four tet name this new album is just such a snoozer for me like i get to his music typically does run very subtle and you know is usually very cerebral and heady and takes a while to develop and blossom and deliver its fullest and you know most intricate ideas but a lot of these songs just really didn't go anywhere interesting for me and you know not only that but the idea is just were not truly that bold like everything as far as progressions and as far as sound play just felt so faint that this album for the most part just became like wallpaper music for me yeah I'm not really sure what to say at this point I mean obviously elements of you know electro acoustic music and techno and house and and all that stuff still influenced his music but it just doesn't sound like he's experimenting quite as boldly as he has in the past which is primarily what has made for Tet's music so fantastic and intriguing to begin with I kept returning to this Suzanne son for album again and again and again just hoping that it would finally click with me I mean I guess in a way I respect that this is the first time she's making an album quite like this with every record she has dropped so far she kind of changes her sound up quite a bit on this one it's it's mostly acoustic it's very Spacey it's very atmospheric it's very dramatic it's very regal I would say however to me as I listen to the album again and again and again it kind of reads to me is like I don't know a Kate Bush record or maybe even like a I don't know why you like a joanna newsom album but without that extra eccentric spark to sort of push it over the edge you know to sort of just make it seem like aha whoa this is like truly a unique or a vibrant or you know a passionate experience it's it's too reserved and it's too I guess sort of predictable to sort of scratch those itches everybody's saying review the new wu-tang or review the new wu-tang review the new boots hang and listen I get it okay the last record was not really their best and some of the lead-up tracks on this thing we're pretty grimy pretty hard-hitting definitely played to those New York boom-bap roots however this new record over here it's it's barely a wu-tang album okay you like you don't have all the original members assembling on single tracks the production obviously is a factor here as well this is essentially like a rap album that only has what angers on it you know what I mean it's it's kind of kind of not entirely like you know it's it's it's like only technically a wu-tang album in name only you know it's like a wu-tang album for marketing purposes like this does not seem like a clearly collective effort from everybody in the group all at once I was pretty excited to listen to this LP unfortunately it was just it was it was a little too run-of-the-mill and pleasant when I actually gave it a listen however I don't think there's anything entirely wrong with that you know there are some very nice folk rock records out there that you can listen to and they're just kind of like for a lazy Sunday or something you know no there's there's nothing bad about that and while I did find Courtney's last record very underwhelming and Kurt's last record very underwhelming there is something that's so much more charming about this album over here like there's definitely a certain playfulness and a flirtiness and fun very loving attitude to this album that I think is enhanced by the sense of collaboration here I've been listening to this kid and listen to this kid even hit me up on Twitter he's like hey man let's listen to my new project I would love it if the needle drop in pitch work and listen to my new project so I did a lot of people were recommending it too and it's okay you know it's some good conscious hip-hop thoughtful lyrics some nice instrumentals he just kind of wears his influences on his sleeve you know like a lot of these newer contemporary conscious rappers especially Kendrick like he is so so so like biting them on this thing and listen that's not to say that out of complete disrespect obviously he's influenced by these artists because he thinks very highly of them he thinks are doing great things and he wants to do great things too I'm just kind of waiting for the moment where he kind of bypasses that a little bit and comes into his own they're a good lyrical and instrumental fundamentals on this thing as well as you know rapping fundamentals the flows on here pretty good it's just that you know this part sounds like this person this part sounds like this person this person's like this person there's a lot of moments that you know it seems really obvious that he's pulling from his contemporaries and you know hey listen a lot of these artists who he's borrowing from that's how they sounded when they started off you know what I mean so it'll be interesting to sort of see if he can kind of jettison a lot of those sounds he's borrowing from other people into the future and you know completely develop a style of his own because it seems like he's got a lot of heart it seems like he's got a lot of vision seems like he's trying to do something on a grander scale and I wish him I wish him the look I wish him all the luck in the world getting that getting that getting that done I mean sure you know it has a little bit more bite than their last album which was just like a bland washed out grunge record but you know is it all that interesting of like an emo or a pop punk or a post hardcore album not not no not really I couldn't pick this album out of a lineup I couldn't some albums you just you just you just don't have anything to say no matter how much you think no matter how much you listen you're seduced you just don't position have you given these albums a listen did you love them did you hate them what would you rate them you're the best you're the best

tfRfhunuCbI,hey everyone Anthony Fantan oh here internets busiest music nerd hope you're doing well and I'm going to pull off a review here like it's a stunt I don't know why I said pull off and a pull off a review here of the new Liam Gallagher album as you were this is the new solo record from one half of the Gallagher brothers William formerly a member of the Brit pop phenom known as Oasis who broke up in the late 2000s and pretty much all of the solo material that has come out since the breakup has ranged from merely Pleasant - I mean Noel Gallagher's recent high flying birds album was pretty listenable but the now disbanded BDI which was once led by Liam Gallagher dropped two albums that I thought were borderline horrendous just basically indulged in every rock-and-roll cliche imaginable now given that BDI material I wasn't exactly excited to go into this new solo album from Liam however I was pleasantly surprised by the singles and this album itself I mean it's it's pretty decent essentially as you were is the slick catchy and sharply crafted Brit pop that put the Gallagher name on the map to begin with it's classy it's smart it's a decent balance of rowdy and mature especially on the first leg of the album the track wall of glass that kicks the entire project features these window shattering guitars honking harmonica leads some soulful background vocals in a rock hard groove and some of the lyrics on this track are pretty sharp - I love the one line that Liam drops about the rock you hurl sort of flies back into your path and you shatter like a wall of glass and I love that this track again has a nice balance to it moments of it glimmer and moments of it have a lot of grit the song greedy soul is yet another gutsy rocker with kind of fuzzy guitars some propulsive drums and bass the occasional shot of feedback you know it's a little off the rails but not too off the rails it's you know is about as edgy as radio rockets and radio rock is a necessarily bad thing especially if it's written well and it sticks in your head Liam on this track finds power and simplicity with some really blunt lyrics a very straightforward confidence stare you right in the eyes vocal delivery in the first leg of the album there are a couple of John Lennon esque slow burner some somber ballads the song bold as well as the track paper crown they hit really hard in here especially paper crown in which I love the metaphor in the lyrics on this track about this person's crown being made of paper and aging or turning to ash I also love the very simple skeletal acoustic intro on the track - and the song for what it's worth is kind of another touching lyrical moment on the record all about Liam kind of owning up to his mistakes it's a heartfelt apology set to song with lyrics that map out Liam's good intentions but his inability to shape up to the man that he wants to be unfortunately in my opinion I think the album kind of trails off after this point you have the weakest cut on the entire record when I'm in need which is kind of this swaying ballad that seems hugely influenced by 60s psychedelic pop but there's nothing really all that psychedelic are interesting about the sound to begin with it's it's actually kind of bland even as Liam and the band try to build things up with more guitar layers and synth arpeggios and what sounds like strings it's kind of grand but the vocal melodies are weak and kind of obnoxious it just feels like they're amplifying and turning the volume up on annoying not to mention the weird arena rock groove toward the end of this cut that just sounds like a rolling stone's throw away songs like you better run and I get by bring back the album's aggressive streak with some huge roaring riffs and slinky guitar leads but these two tracks are easily like two of the weakest lyrical moments on the record and while I like the intimate acoustic direction that the album takes on the song Chinatown the track is nowhere near is blissful or as wide as the reverb on it would imply because the compression just really crushes the track down for a ballad it just seems so claustrophobic from here the album kind of finishes off with another couple of toothless ballads that mistake blandness for bliss unfortunately the album doesn't really stick the landing nor did the flow up until this point keep me on the edge of my seat you know it's kind of nice to hear that Liam can still keep a torch lit for the Britpop sound and really kind of bring back in a sense the old days of Oasis with some of the best tracks on this thing but for those who listen to this record and love it from front to back and you think it's flawless and it really just kind of lights that fire in your heart again for the Britpop sound I envy you honestly I'm feeling a strong 6 - a light 7 on this thing transition have you given this album a listen did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you're the best you're the best what should I review next hit the like if you like please subscribe and please don't please don't cry just leave a nice intelligible and and well-thought-out comment in the comments if you're feeling some type of way you know start a conversation make a friend over there next to my head is a another review that you should check out the BDI review I'll throw over there or you can click on the link to subscribe to the channel I'll see you guys in the next one forever
